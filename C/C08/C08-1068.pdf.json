It is useful for MT (to create possible equivalents of unknown words) (Knight and Stall, 1998; Paola and Sanjeev, 2003), cross-lingual information retrieval (Pirkola et al, 2003), the development of multilingual resources (Yan et al, 2003) and multilingual text and speech processing. Inter-dialectal translation without lexical changes is quite useful and sometimes even necessary when the dialects in question use different scripts; it can be achieved by transliteration alone.

The major difference between Hindi and Urdu is that the former is written in Devanagari script with a more Sanskritized vocabulary and the latter is written in Urdu script (derivation of Persio-Arabic script) with more vocabulary borrowed from Persian and Arabic. In contrast to the transcriptional difference, Hindi and Urdu share grammar, morphology, a huge vocabulary, history, classical literature, cultural heritage, etc. Hindi is the National language of India with 366 million native speakers.

Two or more consonants may be combined together to form a cluster called Conjunct that marks the absence of the inherited vowel [ə] between two consonants (Kellogg, 1872; Montaut, 2004).

SAMPA (Speech Assessment Methods Phonetic Alphabet) is a widely accepted scheme for encoding the IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) into ASCII.

When a vowel comes at the start of a word or a syllable, the independent form is used; otherwise the dependent form is used (Kellogg, 1872; Montaut, 2004).","Urdu contains 10 vowels and 7 of them have nasalized forms (Hussain, 2004; Khan, 1997).

In Hindi, SHA (श) and SSA (ष) both represent the sound [ʃ] and have one equivalent symbol in Urdu, i.e. Sheen (ش). To make distinction between SHA (श) and SSA (ष) in UIT, they are mapped on S and S1 respectively. Similarly in Urdu, Seh (ث), Seen (س) and Sad (ص) represent the sound [s] and have one equivalent symbol in Hindi, i.e. SA (स). To make distinction among them in UIT, they are mapped on s1, s and s2 respectively. All similar cases are shown in Table 6.

UIT is extendable to other languages like Eng-","lish, French, Kashmiri, Punjabi, Sindhi, etc. For","example, Punjabi has one extra character than Urdu i.e. Rnoon [ɳ] (ڻ), it is mapped on ‘n’̀ in UIT. Similarly, UIT, a phonetic encoding scheme, can be extended to other languages. All these mappings can be implemented by simple finite-state transducers using XEROX’s XFST (Beesley and Karttunen, 2003) language. A sample XFST code is given in Figure 1. read regex [ب -> b, پ -> p, ج -> [d “_” Z] ]; read regex [[ج ه] -> [d “_” Z “_” h]]; read regex [و -> v, ی -> j || .#. _ ]; read regex [و -> v, ی -> j || _ [آ | ا]]; read regex [ی -> e || CONSONANTS _ ]; read regex [ ی -> i || _ [ْ | .#.]]; ... read regex [ब -> b, प -> p, ज़ -> z, झ -> [d “_” Z “_” h]]; read regex [अ -> “@”, आ -> A, ई -> i || .#. _ ] ...","Figure 1: Sample XFST code","Finite-state transducers are robust and time and space efficient (Mohri, 1997). They are a logical choice for Hindi-Urdu transliteration via UIT as this problem could also be seen as string matching and producing an analysis string as an output like finite-state morphological analysis. 5.2 Contextual HUMT Rules UIT mappings need to be accompanied by necessary contextual HUMT rules for correct Hindi to Urdu transliteration and vice versa.","For example, Vav (و) and Choti Yeh (ی) are used to represent vowels like [o], [ɔ], [i], [e], etc. but they are also used as consonants. Vav (و) and Choti Yeh (ی) are consonants when they come at the beginning of a word or when they are followed by Alef mada (آ) or Alef (ا). Also, Choti Yeh (ی) represents the vowel [e] when it is preceded by a consonant but when it comes at the end of a word and is preceded by a consonant then it represents the vowel [i]. These rules are shown in red colour in Figure 1.","Thus HUMT contextual rules are necessary for Hindi-Urdu transliteration and they can also be implemented as finite-state transducer using XFST. All these rules can’t be given here due to shortage of space."]},{"title":"6 HUMT System","paragraphs":["The HUMT system exploits the simplicity, robustness, power and time and space efficiency of finite-state transducers. Exactly the same transducer that encodes a Hindi or Urdu text into UIT can be used in the reverse direction to generate Hindi or Urdu text from the UIT encoded text. This two-way power of the finite-state transducer (Mohri, 1997) has significantly reduced the amount of efforts to build the HUMT system. Another very important and powerful strength of finite-state transducers, they can be composed together to build a single transducer that can perform the same task that could be done with help of two or more transducers when applied sequentially (Mohri, 1997), not only allows us to build a direct Hindi ↔ Urdu transducer, but also helps to divide difficult and complex problems into simple ones, and has indeed simplified the process of building the HUMT system. A direct Hindi ↔ Urdu transducer can be used in applications where UIT encoding is not necessary like Hindi-Urdu MT system.","The HUMT system can be extended to perform transliteration between two or more different scripts used for the same languages like Kashmiri, Kazakh, Malay, Punjabi, Sindhi, etc. or between language pairs like English–Hindi, English–Urdu, English–French, etc. by just introducing the respective transducers in the Finite-state Transducer Manager of the HUMT system to build a multilingual machine transliteration system. ","Figure 2: HUMT System In the HUMT system, Text Tokenizer takes the input Hindi or Urdu Unicode text, tokenizes it into Hindi or Urdu words and passes 541 them to UIT Enconverter. The enconverter enconverts Hindi or Urdu words into UIT words using the appropriate transducer from Finite-state Transducers Manager, e.g. for Hindi words, it uses the Hindi ↔ UIT transducer. It passes these UIT encoded words to UIT Deconverter, which deconverts them into Hindi or Urdu words using the appropriate transducer from Finite-state Transducers Manager in reverse and generates the target Hindi or Urdu text. 6.1 Enconversion of Hindi-Urdu to UIT Hindi ↔ UIT transducer is a composition of the mapping rules transducers and the contextual rules transducers.

It can similarly be enhanced to transliterate between language pairs, e.g. English-Arabic, English-Hindi, English-Urdu, French-Hindi, etc. Thus, it can be enhanced to build a multilingual machine transliteration system that can be used for cross-scriptural transliteration and MT.","We are intended to resolve the problems of multi-equivalences, no-equivalences and the most importantly the restoration of diacritical marks in Urdu text that are observed but left unattended in the current work. Restoration of diacritical marks in Urdu, Sindhi, Punjabi, Kashmiri, etc. texts is essential for word sense disambiguation, natural language processing and speech synthesis of the said languages.","The HUMT system will also provide a basis for the development of Inter-dialectal translation system and MT system for surface-close languages like Indonesian-Malay, Japanese-Korean, 543 Hindi-Marathi, Hindi-Urdu, etc. Translation of the surface-close languages or inter-dialectal translation can be performed by using mainly transliteration and some lexical translations. Thus HUMT will also provide basis for Cross-Scriptural Transliteration, Cross-scriptural In-formation Retrieval, Cross-scriptural Applica-tion Development, inter-dialectal translation and translation of surface-close languages."]},{"title":"9 Conclusion","paragraphs":["Finite-state transducers are very efficient, robust, and simple to use. Their simplicity and powerful features are exploited in the HUMT model to perform Hindi-Urdu transliteration using UIT that is a generic and flexible encoding scheme to uniquely encode natural languages into ASCII. The HUMT system gives 97.50% accuracy when it is applied on the Hindi-Urdu corpora containing 412,249 words in total. It is an endeavor to bridge the scriptural, ethnical, cultural and geographical division between 1,017 millions people around the globe."]},{"title":"Acknowledgement","paragraphs":["This study is partially supported by the project CIFLI funded under ARCUS-INDIA program by Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Rhône-Alpes region."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Beesley, Kenneth R. and Karttunen, Lauri. 2003.
