In pattern generation from a parallel corpus, Compositional Constituents that could be generalized were 74% of independent words, 24% of phrases and only 15% of clauses. This means that in Japanese-to-English MT, most of the translation results as shown in the parallel corpus could not be obtained by methods based on Compositional Semantics. This dictionary achieved a syntactic coverage of 98% and a semantic coverage of 78%. It will substantially improve translation quality."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["A wide variety of machine translation (MT) methods are being studied(Nagao, 1996; Brown et al., 1990; Vogel et al., 2003), but to obtain high-quality translations between languages belonging to different families that are alien each other is difficult. Most practical systems still employ a transfer method based on compositional semantics. A problem with this method is that it produces translations by separating the syntactic structure from meaning, and is thus liable to lose the meaning of the source text.","c⃝ 2008.

However, pattern-based MT require immense pattern dictionaries that are difficult to develop(Jung et al., 1999; Uchino et al., 2001).","Meanwhile, example-based MT(Nagao, 1984; Sato, 1992; Brown, 1999) obtains translation results by substituting semantically similar elements in structurally matching translation examples, so a pre-prepared pattern dictionary is not needed. However, the capability to substitute a constituent in an example changes from one example to the next, and to automate this judgement is impossible. This problem could be addressed by manually tagging each example beforehand to specify which constituents can be substituted, but the resulting method would be just another pattern-based translation method.","Attention has been focused on the use of cognitive grammar(Langacker, 1987) and construction grammar(Fillmore, 1988) in the search to find methods that might help to resolve this problem. However, the standards for determining the structural meaning units and the granularity needed for meaning analysis have not been clarified.","As a method in which the syntactic structure and meaning are dealt with as an integral whole, a sentence pattern (SP)-dictionary called A-Japanese Lexicon has already been developed for Japanese simple sentences(Ikehara et al., 1997). This dictionary includes 14,800 valency patterns. The translation quality of Japanese simple sentences into English was 90% and this could be improved up to 97% by additional pattern pairs(Kanadechi et al., 2003).","Therefore in this study we developed an SP-dictionary for translating compound and complex 353 sentences. First we proposed a Non-compositional Language model (NL-model) and a method for creating sentence patterns. Based on these, we built a large scale SP-dictionary from a parallel corpus through the generalization of compositional constituents."]},{"title":"2 Language Model","paragraphs":["Conventional MT methods are based on the concept of compositional semantics. However, real languages have many expressions to which this concept cannot be applied. Solving this problem requires findinga mechanism acquiring the meaning of entire expressions before their constituents are analyzed. 2.1 Expressions and Constituents Arita(1987) has pointed out that humans employ a framework of expressions (semantic structure) in their mother tongue in the process of conceptualiz-ing objects. In the semantic structure that come to mind during the process when a speaker is forming a concept, two types of constituents to be considered those that cause the overall meaning to be lost when other constituents are substituted for them, and those that do not cause the overall meaning to be lost when an alternative constituent is substituted for them. Based on this idea, we derived the following definitions. Definition1: Types of constituents: A compositional constituent (C-constituent) is defined as the constituent for which there are one or more alternative constituents and for which the meaning of a semantic structure does not change when this constituent is substituted. Any other constituent is defined as non-compositional constituent (N-constituent). Definition2: Types of expressions: A compositional expression (C-expression) is defined as an expression that consists entirely of C-constituents, and a non-compositional expression (N-expression) is definedas an expression that has one or more N-constituents.","Before we applying these definitions to actual linguistic expressions, we need to clarify what we mean by “ the meaning of a semantic structure.” This is very important problem for semantic analysis, because the guranularity needed for semantic analysis is determined by the way of the meaning defiition.","In this study, considering applications to Japanese-to-English MT, the meaning of Japanese semantic structures definedin terms of English semantic structures.1","Figure 1 shows an example. The source text is a Japanese expression expressing a relationship between two events: “ directly after some event happened, somebody performed some action,” and this meaning is defined by the English expression. For individual constituents such as “she” and “colle ge,” there are domains of substitutable constituents with which they can be substituted without changing the English semantic structure, so these constituents are classified into C-constituents. 2.2 Characteristics of C-constituents From the above definitions, we can see that a C-constituent possesses the following characteristics. From these characteristics, possible guidelines for pattern-forming can be obtained.","#1: The number and the scope of C-constituents depends on the language used for definingthe meanings of expressions.","#2: C-constituents need to be independent of each other.","#3: The domain of alternatives for a C-constituent is syntactically and semantically limited.","#4: Whether a constituent is compositional depends on the way it is articulated.","#5: C-constituents are defined in relation to the entire expression. Many times these expressions consist of plural words, and some of them are N-expressions. 2.3 Non-compositional Language Model According to definition 1, any linguistic expression consists of zero or more C-constituents and one or more N-constituents. The scope of these constituents can be arbitrarily selected. Then, we assume that C-constituents are extracted from expressions with a meaningful range (e.g., a word, phrase or clause). The C-constituent extracted in","1","In this way, when the meaning of a linguistic expression is defined in another natural language, semantic ambiguity occurs in the language used in the definition. However, in the case of MT, the meaning of the translation results is understood by a speaker of the target language, so it is not thought to constitute a problem. 354 Japanese kanojo  she","ha daigaku college","wo sotsugyosuruto graduate sugu soon jimotono local chiisanakaisha small company","ni tsutometa engaged Alternatives for C-constituent","watashi, kare, - - ,  , - - Corresponding Constituents I, he, - -","tokyonokaisha, ginkou, - -","",",",", - - company in Tokyo, bank, - - Meaning definition by English On graduation from , she joined a small local companycollege junior high school, high school, - -","chugaku, koukou  ,","- - (c.f.) : N-constituent : C-constituent : Domain of C-constituents Figure 1: Corresponding Relationships of C-constituents between Japanese and English this way may itself also be a N-expression according to characteristic #5, so a linguistic expression can generally be expressed with the language model designated as the NL-model in Figure 2.","As this figure shows, when C-constituents are repeatedly extracted from an N-expression, the end result is an N-expression that contains no C-constituent. Although the resulting N-expression may just be a single word, it could also be an idiomatic phrase that has no substitutable constituents. Thus, in NL-model, linguistic expressions can finallybe articulated into N-constituents and N-expressions.","The difference from conventional Compositional Language model (CL-model) is in that NL-model does not assumes that all of expressions can be articulated into only C-constituents2","."]},{"title":"3 Pattern Forming 3.1 Principles of Pattern-forming","paragraphs":["Not only words but also meaningful expression units such as phrases and sentences represent concepts, and the semantic structures of these expressions represent higher order concepts(Ikehara, 2003). Then, if we develop a pattern dictionary of semantic structures for expressions, higher order concept can be taken out of each expression by pattern matching.","An important aspect of the NL-model is that the N-expressions that appear at each stage of the decomposition are meaningful expression units. In","2","Translations by matching larger text unit are used in conventional MT including recent phrase-based SMT. But it is only that they regard phrases as C-constituents. The fact remains that entire expression is regarded as C-expression. this process, loss of the original meaning can be avoided by using a semantic dictionary for N-expressions at each stage. For example, if linguistic expressions are classified into sentences, clauses and phrases, and pattern dictionaries are prepared for N-expressions at each of these levels, then this would provide a mechanism for scooping up the meaning of entire sentences.","We think that patterns are a suitable framework for expressing the structure of N-expressions, because:","(a) N-constituents cannot be replaced by any other constituent, so a literal description is appropriate,","(b) the order of constituents is not fle xible and often fixed. Therefore, in this study we use a pattern- forming approach for N-expressions.","The Japanese-to-English parallel corpus is a typical example in which the meaning of Japanese expressions is defined by English expressions. Pattern pairs were therefore produced for N-expressions in the parallel corpus by extracting C-constituents and generalizing them.","When a parallel corpus is used, the following two types of constituents need to be considered as C-constituents:","(1) the constituent to which there is a semantically corresponding constituent in the English expression,","(2) the constituent to which there is no corresponding constituent in English, but deleting 355 N-expression Original Sentence Partial Expression Partial Expression N-expression N-expression N-expression N-constituentC-constituentN-constituent N-constituentC-constituent N-constituentC-constituentN-constituent N-constituentC-constituent N-constituentC-constituent N-expression N-expression Figure 2: Non-compositional Language Model (NL-model) this constituent from the Japanese expression does not cause any change in the corresponding English expression. 3.2 Pattern Description Language A pattern description language was designed to achieve the following aims:","a) patterns can be semi-automatically generated from the result of morphological analysis of a parallel corpus, and","b) patterns can be definedaccording to the degree of generalization. Here, a) is important in that it allows the development of large-scale SP-dictionaries. This condition also means that there is no need for syntactic or semantic analysis when comparing the input text with the SP-dictionary. If these analyses were required, problems would occur due to vagueness of interpretation, and the significance of the pattern method would be halved.","The descriptors used in this language are shown in Table 1. They are divided into four classes: literals, variables, functions, and symbols. As a rule, C-constituents are declared using variables(independent constituents), functions(subordinate constituents), and symbols(structural constituents), while N-constituents are declared by using the literal of words.","Constituents of a pattern are classified as either essential or optional. An essential constituent is one without which it would be impossible to definea corresponding relationship with the English pattern. An optional constituent is one that allows a corresponding English pattern to be definedeven when it is omitted.","Optional constituents are further classified into two types. One type contains constituents that can be omitted from both the English and Japanese expression. The other contains constituents that do not appear in either the English or the Japanese expression, but these constituents can be inserted into those expressions. 3.3 Generalization of C-constituents (1) Generalization by Variables According to the characteristics of #3, when generalizing C-constituents by variables, the domain of a variable needs to be specified by syntactic attributes and semantic attributes. A syntactic attribute is represented by a variable name and a semantic attribute is represented by an argument at-tached to the variable. Attentions need to be paid to the following points in this generalization.","(a) A C-constituent may itself be an N-expression.","(b) Corresponding English constituents do not necessarily have the same syntactic attributes. (2) Generalization by Functions Conjugated forms of words that have been converted into variables are specified by a word form function when necessary. Also, particles and subordinate words such as auxiliary verbs are specified using a Tense aspect modality function when necessary. (3) Generalization by Symbols Fluctuations in expressions are also C-constituents. These are declared using symbols.","Symbols are also used to specify omitted subjects and objects when necessary. The optional constituents mentioned in section 3.2(2) are also C-constituents and word order that do not change 356","Table 1: Descriptors of Pattern Description Language","# Classification Types (The number of descriptors)","1 Literal Japanese Character, English Character","2 Variable(17) Word variable(11), Phrase variable(5), Clause variable(1)","3 Function(151) Word form function(33), Tense aspect modality function(56), Part of speech","transfer function(8)","Macro function(20)","Group function(9), Extraction func-","tion(2), Literal function(2), others","4 Symbol(10) Insertion mark, Optional mark, Permutation mark, Changeable position mark,","Supplementation mark, Others","c.f.

Step 1: Creation of parallel corpus: A parallel corpus consisting of 1 million sentence pairs was created from about 30 types of documents. Step 2: Extraction of translation examples: From the results of morphological analysis of this corpus, we extracted 150,000 target example sentences. Analytical errors were corrected manually. Step 3: Pattern generation: Using resources such as Japanese-English word dictionaries, semantically corresponding relationships were found and converted into variables, functions, and symbols in the following three steps:","(a) Word-level generalization: Compositional independent words are converted into word variables.","(b) Phrase-level generalization: Compositional phrases are converted into phrase variables.","(c) Clause-level generalization: Compositional clauses are converted into clause variables.

The ratio of generalized C-constituents was 74% at the word level and 24% at the phrase level, but just 15% at the clause level.

(1) Experimental Conditions We produced a program (pattern parser) to compare input sentences against the SP-dictionary, and used it for evaluations.","Ten thousand sentences that we randomly selected from the example sentences were used for creating the patterns and used in experiments.

Therefore, the coverage was evaluated according to the following two parameters:","Syntactic coverage: The ratio of input sentences that are matched to at least one pattern.","Semantic coverage: The ratio of input sentences for which there is one or more semantically correct pattern. (2) Saturation of Syntactic Coverage Figure 3 shows the relationship between the number of patterns and the syntactic coverage at the word, phrase, and clause levels. As the number of patterns increases, syntactic coverage saturates rapidly.","In the case of simple sentences, it was reported that the number of valency patterns required to cover all of them more or less completely was estimated to be 25 thousands(Shirai et al., 1995).","When the patterns are rearranged in order of their frequency of matching, the saturation speed in Figure 3 becomes about five times faster. Then, we would expect the number of required patterns for compound and complex sentences to be some-where in the tens of thousands or thereabouts as is the case of simple sentences. (3) Evaluation of Coverage Figure 4 shows the results of our evaluation of the coverage of the SP-dictionary. The results show that the whole dictionary covered almost all input sentences. However, many cases of matches to semantically inappropriate patterns occurred, and the semantic coverage decreased to 78% when these were eliminated.
