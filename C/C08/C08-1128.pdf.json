This is different from most European languages and poses difficulty in many natural language processing tasks, such as machine translation.","It is difficult to define “correct” Chinese word segmentation (CWS) and various definitions have been proposed. In this work, we explore the idea that the best segmentation depends on the task, and concentrate on developing a CWS method for MT, which leads to better translation performance.","The common solution in Chinese-to-English translation has been to segment the Chinese text using an off-the-shelf CWS method, and to apply a standard translation model given the fixed segmentation. The most widely applied method for MT is unigram segmentation, such as segmentation using the LDC (LDC, 2003) tool, which requires a manual lexicon containing a list of Chinese words and their frequencies. The lexicon and","c⃝ 2008. Licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/).

Since does not exist in the manual lexicon, it cannot be generated by this method.","In addition to unigram segmentation, other methods have been proposed. For example, (Gao et al., 2005) described an adaptive CWS system, and (Andrew, 2006) employed a conditional random field model for sequence segmentation. However, these methods are not specifically developed for the MT application, and significant improvements in translation performance need to be shown.","In (Xu et al., 2004) and (Xu et al., 2005), word segmentations are integrated into MT systems during model training and translation. We refine the method in training using a Bayesian semi-supervised CWS approach motivated by (Goldwater et al., 2006). We describe a generative model which consists of a word model and two alignment models, representing the monolingual and bilingual information, respectively. In our methods, we first segment Chinese text using a unigram segmenter, and then learn new word types and word distributions, which are suitable for MT.","Our experiments on both large (NIST) and small (IWSLT) data tracks of Chinese-to-English translation show that our method improves the performance of a state-of-the-art machine translation system."]},{"title":"2 Review of the Baseline System 2.1 Word segmentation","paragraphs":["In statistical machine translation, we are given a Chinese sentence in characters cK","1 = c1 . . . cK which is to be translated into an English sentence eI 1 = e1 . . . eI .

Different from a standard unigram model for CWS, our model can introduce new Chinese word types and learn word distributions automatically from unlabeled data.","According to this model, a corpus of Chinese words f1, . . . fm, . . . , fM is generated via: G|α, P0 ∼ DP (α, P0) fm|G ∼ G where G is a distribution over words drawn from a Dirichlet Process prior with base measure P0 and concentration parameter α.","We never explicitly estimate G but instead integrate over its possible values and perform Bayesian inference.

In contrast, for model-based probability distributions, we use the generic symbol P (·). probability of a Chinese word given a set of already generated words, while integrating over G. This is done by casting Chinese word generation as a Chinese restaurant process (CRP) (Aldous, 1985), i.e. a restaurant with an infinite number of tables (approximately corresponding to Chinese word types), each table with infinite number of seats (approximately corresponding to Chinese word frequencies).","The Dirichlet Process model can be viewed in-tuitively as a cache model (Goldwater et al., 2006). Each word fj in the corpus is either retrieved from a cache or generated anew given the previously observed words f−j: P (fj|f−j) =","N (fj)+αP0(fj) N + α , (1) where N (fj) is the number of Chinese words fj in the previous context. N is the total number of Chinese words, P0 is the base probability over words, and α influences the probability of introducing a new word at each step and controls the size of the lexicon. The probability of generating a word from the cache increases as more instances of that word are seen.","For the base distribution P0, which governs the generation of new words, we use the following distribution (called the spelling model): P0(f ) = P (L)P0(f |L) = λL L!","e−λ uL","(2) where 1","u is the number of characters in the document, i.e. character vocabulary size, and L is the number of Chinese characters of word f .

The alignment indicates the aligned Chinese word fbi for each English word ei, where f0 indicates a special null word as in the IBM models. 1018","Without assuming any special form for the probability of a sentence pair along with hidden variables, we can factor it into a monolingual Chinese sentence probability and a bilingual translation probability as follows:","P r(c1K",", e1 I , f1 J , b1 I )","= P r(cK","1 , f J","1 )P r(eI","1, bI","1|f J","1 )","= P r(f J 1 )δ(f1J",", c1","K",")P r(eI 1, bI","1|f J","1 ),","where δ(f J 1 , cK","1 ) is 1 if the characters of the se-","quence of words f1J","are c1","K",", and to 0 other-","wise.

In Sections 4.1.1 and 4.1.2, we will describe","the modeling assumptions behind the monolingual","Chinese sentence model and the translation model,","respectively. 4.1.1 Monolingual Chinese sentence model","We use the Dirichlet Process unigram word model introduced in section 3. In this model, the parameters of a distribution over words G are first drawn from the Dirichlet prior DP (α, P0). Words are then independently generated according to G. The probability of a sequence of Chinese words in a sentence is thus:","P r(f J","1 ) ≈ J ∏ j=1 P (fj|G) (3) 4.1.2 Translation model","We employ the Dirichlet Process inverse IBM model 1 to generate English words and alignment given the Chinese words. In this model, for every Chinese word f (including the null word), a distribution over English words Gf is first drawn from a Dirichlet Process prior DP (α, P0(e)), where P0(e) we used the empirical distribution over English words in the parallel data. Then, given these parameters, the probability of an English sentence and alignment given a Chinese sentence (sequence of words) is given by:","P (eI 1, bI 1|f J","1 , Gf ) = I ∏ i=1","1 J + 1 P (ei|Gfb i ) This is the same model form as inverse IBM model 1, except we have placed Dirichlet Process priors on the Chinese-word specific distributions over English words. 2","2","fb","i is the Chinese word aligned to ei and Gf","b","i is the","distribution over English words conditioned on the word fb","i.","Similarly, ea j is the English word aligned to fj in the other di-","rection and Gea","j is the distribution over Chinese words con-","ditioned on ea j .","In practice, we observed that using a word-alignment model in one direction is not sufficient. We then added a factor to our model which includes word alignment in the other direction , i.e. a Dirichlet Process IBM model 1. We ignore the de-tailed description here, because the calculation is the same as that of the inverse IBM model 1. According to this model, for every English word e (including the null word), a distribution over Chinese words Ge is first drawn from a Dirichlet Process prior DP (α, P0(f )). Here, for the base distribution P0(f ) we used the same spelling model as for the monolingual unigram Dirichlet Process prior.

Similar deficient models have been used very successfully before, for example, in the IBM models 3–6 and in the unsupervised grammar induction model of (Klein and Manning, 2002)."]},{"title":"5 Gibbs Sampling Training","paragraphs":["It is generally impossible to find the most likely segmentation according to our Bayesian model using exact inference, because the hidden variables do not allow exact computation of the integrals. Nonetheless, it is possible to define algorithms using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) that produce a stream of samples from the posterior distribution of the hidden variables given the observations. We applied the Gibbs sampler (Geman and Geman, 1984) — one of the simplest MCMC methods, in which transitions between states of the 1019","Figure 1: Case I, transition from a no-boundary to","a boundary state, f to f ′","f ′′",".","Figure 2: Case II, transition from a boundary to a","no-boundary state, f ′","f ′′","to f .

The probability of this hypothesis is computed analogously. 5.2 Determining the set of alternative","hypotheses As mentioned earlier, we consider alternative alignments which deviate minimally from the current alignments, and which satisfy the constraints of the IBM model 1 in both directions. In order to describe the set of alternatives, we consider two cases, depending on whether there is a boundary at the current character before sampling at position k. Case 1. There was no boundary at ck in the previous state (see Figure 1). 1021","If there is no boundary at ck, there is a single word f spanning that position. We denote by {e} the set of English words aligned to f at that state in the E-to-C direction and by e∗ the English word aligned to f in the C-to-E direction. Since every state we consider satisfies the IBM one-to-many constraints, there is exactly one English word aligned to f in the C-to-E direction and the words {e} have no other words aligned to them in the E-to-C direction.","In this case, we consider as hypothesis cbak− the same segmentation and alignment as in the previous state. (see Table 1 for an overview of the alternative hypotheses.)","We consider M different hypotheses which in-clude a boundary at k in this case, where M depends on the number of words {e} aligned to f in the previous state.

Additionally we need to align f ′","and f ′′","to English words in the C-to-E direction. The number of different hypotheses is equal to 2P","where P = |{e}|. These alternatives arise by considering that each of the words in {e} needs to align to either f ′","or f ′′",", and there are 2P combinations of these alignments. For example, if {e} = {e1, e2}, after splitting the word f there are four possible alignments, illustrated in Figure 1: I. (f ′",", e1) and (f ′′",", e2), II. (f ′",", e2) and (f ′′",", e1),","III.

We obtained λ1 = 1.4, λ2 = 1 and λ3 = 0.8 as optimal values and T = 4 as the optimal number of iterations of re-alignment with GIZA++.","For a fair comparison, we evaluated on various CWS methods including translation on characters , LDC (LDC, 2003), ICT (Zhang et al., 2003), unigram, 9-gram and GS. Improvements using GS can be seen in Table 6. Under all test sets and evaluation criteria, GS outperforms the baseline method. The absolute WER decreases with 1.2% on Dev3 and with 1.1% on Eval data over baseline.","We compared the translation outputs using GS with the baseline method. On the Eval data, 196 sentences are different out of 489 lines, where 64 sentences from GS are better, 33 sentences are worse, and the rests have similar translation qualities. Table 7 shows two examples from the Eval corpus. We list segmentations produced by the baseline and GS methods, as well as the transla-tions corresponding to these segmentations. The GS method generates better translation results than the baseline method in these cases. 1023","Table 7: Segmentation and translation outputs with","baseline and GS methods.","a) Baseline £4 m","do you have a ?

In a large and a small data environment, our method outperformed the standard Chinese word segmentation approach in terms of the Chinese to English translation quality. In future work, we plan to enrich our monolingual and bilingual models to better represent the true distribution of the data."]},{"title":"8 Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["Jia Xu conducted this research during her internship at Microsoft Research.
