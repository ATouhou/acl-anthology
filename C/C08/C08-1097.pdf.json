In English, definite noun phrases such as the company and overt pronouns such as he are anaphors that refer to preceding entities (antecedents). On the other hand, in Japanese, anaphors are often omitted and these omissions are called zero pronouns. We focus on zero anaphora resolution of Japanese web corpus, in which anaphors are often omitted and zero anaphora resolution plays an important role in discourse analysis.","Zero anaphora resolution can be divided into two phases. The first phase is zero pronoun detection and the second phase is zero pronoun resolution. Zero pronoun resolution is similar to coref-","c⃝ 2008.

(2001); Mitkov (2002); Ng (2005)). Isozaki and Hirao (2003) and Iida et al. (2006) focused on zero pronoun resolution assuming perfect pre-detection of zero pronouns. However, we consider that zero pronoun detection and resolution have a tight relation and should not be handled independently. Our proposed model aims not only to resolve zero pronouns but to detect zero pronouns.","Zero pronouns are not expressed in a text and have to be detected prior to identifying their antecedents. Seki et al. (2002) proposed a probabilistic model for zero pronoun detection and resolution that uses hand-crafted case frames. In order to alleviate the sparseness of hand-crafted case frames, Kawahara and Kurohashi (2004) introduced wide-coverage case frames to zero pronoun detection that are automatically constructed from a large corpus. They use the case frames as selectional restriction for zero pronoun resolution, but do not utilize the frequency of each example of case slots. However, since the frequency is shown to be a good clue for syntactic and case structure analysis (Kawahara and Kurohashi, 2006), we consider the frequency also can benefit zero pronoun detection. Therefore we propose a probabilistic model for zero anaphora resolution that fully utilizes case frames. This model directly considers the frequency and estimates case assignments for overt case components and antecedents of zero pronoun simultaneously.","In addition, our model directly links each zero pronoun to an entity, while most existing models link it to a certain mention of an entity. In our model, mentions and zero pronouns are treated similarly and all of them are linked to correspond-ing entities. In this point, our model is similar to 769","Table 1: Examples of Constructed Case Frames.","case slot examples generalized examples with rate","ga (subjective) he, driver, friend, · · · [CT:PERSON]:0.45, [NE:PERSON]:0.08, · · ·","tsumu (1) wo (objective) baggage, luggage, hay, · · · [CT:ARTIFACT]:0.31, · · ·","(load) ni (dative) car, truck, vessel, seat, · · · [CT:VEHICLE]:0.32, · · ·","tsumu (2) ga (subjective) player, children, party, · · · [CT:PERSON]:0.40, [NE:PERSON]:0.12, · · ·","(accumulate) wo (objective) experience, knowledge, · · · [CT:ABSTRACT]:0.47, · · ·","...","...","... ga (subjective) company, Microsoft, firm, · · · [NE:ORGANIZATION]:0.16, [CT:ORGANIZATION]:0.13, · · ·","hanbai (1) wo (objective) goods, product, ticket, · · · [CT:ARTIFACT]:0.40, [CT:FOOD]:0.07, · · ·","(sell) ni (dative) customer, company, user, · · · [CT:PERSON]:0.28, · · · de (locative) shop, bookstore, site · · · [CT:FACILITY]:0.40, [CT:LOCATION]:0.39, · · ·","...","...","... the coreference model proposed by Luo (2007) and that proposed by Yang et al.

We construct case frames from a large raw corpus by using the method proposed by Kawahara and Kurohashi (2002), and use them for case structure analysis and zero anaphora resolution. This section shows how to construct the case frames. 2.1 Basic Method After a large corpus is parsed by a Japanese parser, case frames are constructed from modifier-head examples in the resulting parses. The problems of case frame construction are syntactic and semantic ambiguities. That is to say, the parsing results inevitably contain errors and predicate senses are intrinsically ambiguous. To cope with these problems, case frames are gradually constructed from reliable modifier-head examples.","First, modifier-head examples that have no syntactic ambiguity are extracted, and they are disambiguated by coupling a predicate and its closest case component. Such couples are explicitly expressed on the surface of text, and can be considered to play an important role in sentence meanings. For instance, examples are distinguished not by predicates (e.g., “tsumu (load/accumulate))”, but by couples (e.g., “nimotsu-wo tsumu (load baggage)” and “keiken-wo tsumu (accumulate experience))”. Modifier-head examples are aggregated in this way, and yield basic case frames.","Thereafter, the basic case frames are clustered to merge similar case frames. For example, since “nimotsu-wo tsumu (load baggage)” and “busshi-wo tsumu (load supplies)” are similar, they are clustered. The similarity is measured using a thesaurus (The National Language Institute for Japanese Language, 2004). Using this gradual procedure, we constructed case frames from approximately 1.6 billion sentences extracted from the web. In Table 1, some examples of the resulting case frames are shown. 2.2 Generalization of Examples By using case frames that are automatically constructed from a large corpus, sparseness problem is alleviated to some extent, but still remains. For instance, there are thousands of named entities (NEs), which cannot be covered intrinsically. To deal with this sparseness problem, we generalize the examples of case slots. Kawahara and Kurohashi also give generalized examples such as “agent” but only a few types. We generalize case slot examples based on categories of common nouns and NE classes.","First, we use the categories that Japanese morphological analyzer JUMAN1","adds to common nouns. In JUMAN, about twenty categories are defined and tagged to common nouns. For example, “ringo (apple),” “inu (dog)” and “byoin (hospital)” are tagged as “FOOD,” “ANIMAL” and “FA-CILITY,” respectively. For each category, we calculate the rate of categorized example among all case slot examples, and add it to the case slot as “[CT:FOOD]:0.07.”","We also generalize NEs. We use a common standard NE definition for Japanese provided by IREX workshop (1999). IREX defined eight NE classes as shown in Table 2. We first recognize NEs in the source corpus by using an NE recognizer (Sasano and Kurohashi, 2008), and then construct case frames from the NE-recognized corpus.","1","http://nlp.kuee.kyoto-u.ac.jp/nl-resource/juman.html 770","Table 2: Definition of NE in IREX.

This information is utilized to estimate the case assignment probability, which will be mentioned in Section 3.2.3."]},{"title":"3 Zero Anaphora Resolution Model","paragraphs":["In this section, we propose a probabilistic model for Japanese zero anaphora resolution. 3.1 Overview The outline of our model is as follows:","1. Parse an input text using the Japanese parser KNP2","and recognize NEs.","2. Conduct coreference resolution and link each mention to an entity or create new entity.","3. For each sentence, from the end of the sentence, analyze each predicate by the following steps: (a) Select a case frame temporarily.","(b) Consider all possible correspondence between each input case component and an case slot of the selected case frame.","(c) Regard case slots that have no correspondence as zero pronoun candidates.","(d) Consider all possible correspondence between each zero pronoun candidate and an existing entity.","(e) For each possible case frame, estimate each correspondence probabilistically, and select the most likely case frame and correspondence.","In this paper, we concentrate on three case slots for zero anaphora resolution: “ga (subjective),” “wo (objective)” and “ni (dative),” which cover about 90% of zero anaphora. 2 http://nlp.kuee.kyoto-u.ac.jp/nl-resource/knp.html","Morphological analysis, NE recognition, syntactic analysis and coreference resolution are conducted as pre-processes for zero anaphora resolution. Therefore, the model has already recognized existing entities before zero anaphora resolution.","For example, let us consider the following text:","(i) Toyota-wa 1997-nen hybrid car Prius-wo hatsubai(launch). 2000-nen-karaha kaigai (overseas)-demo hanbai(sell)-shiteiru. (Toyota launched the hybrid car Prius in 1997. φ1 started selling φ2 overseas in 2000.)","Figure 1 shows the analysis process for this text. There are three mentions3","in the first sentence, and the two mentions, hybrid car and Prius, appear in apposition. Thus, after the pre-processes, two entities, { Toyota} and { hybrid-car, Prius} , are created.","Then, case structure analysis for the predicate hatsubai (launch) is conducted. First, one of the case frames of hatsubai (launch) is temporarily selected and each input case component is assigned to an appropriate case slot. For instance, case component Toyota is assigned to ga case slot and Prius is assigned to wo case slot4",". In this case, though there is a mention hybrid-car that is not a case component of hatsubai (launch) by itself, it refers to the same entity as Prius refers. Thus, there is no entity that is not linked to hatsubai (launch), and no further analysis is conducted.","Now, let us consider the second sentence. A mention kaigai (overseas) appears and a new entity { kaigai} is created. Then, case structure analysis for the predicate hanbai (sell) is conducted. There is only one overt case component kaigai (overseas), and it is assigned to a case slot of the selected case frame of hanbai (sell). For instance, the case frame hanbai(1) in Table 1 is selected and kaigai (overseas) is assigned to de (locative) case slot. In this case, the remaining case slots ga, wo and ni are considered as zero pronouns, and all possible correspondences between zero pronouns and remaining entities are considered. As a result of probabilistic estimation, the entity { Toyota} is assigned to ga case, the entity { hybrid-car, Prius} is assigned to wo case and no entity is assigned to ni case.","Now, we show how to estimate the correspondence probabilistically in the next subsection.","3","In this paper, we do not consider time expressions, such as 1997, as mentions.","4","Note that since there are some non case-making postpositions in Japanese, such as “wa” and “mo,” several correspondences can be considered. 771 Toyota-wa Prius-wo hybrid car hatsubai. kaigai-demo hanbai-shiteiru. 1997-nen 2000-nen-karawa {Toyota, Φ } {hybrid car, Prius, Φ2 } {kaigai} Entities (overseas) (launch) (sell) hatsubai (launch) ga subjective company, SONY, firm, ...

It also outputs the case frame and case assignment that have the highest probability. That is to say, our model selects the case frame CFbest and the case assignment CAbest that maximize the probability P (CF, CA| v, ICC, EN T ): (CF best, CAbest)","= argmax CF,CA P (CF, CA| v, ICC, EN T ) (1)","Though case assignment CA usually represents correspondences between input case components and case slots, in our model it also represents correspondences between antecedents of zero pronouns and case slots. Hereafter, we call the former direct case assignment (DCA) and the latter indirect case assignment (ICA). Then, we transform P (CFl, CAk| v, ICC, EN T ) as follows: P (CFl, CAk| v, ICC, EN T ) =P (CFl| v, ICC, EN T ) × P (DCAk| v, ICC, EN T, CFl) × P (ICAk| v, ICC, EN T, CFl, DCAk) ≈P (CFl| v, ICC) × P (DCAk| ICC, CFl) × P (ICAk| EN T, CFl, DCAk) (2) =P (CFl| v)×P (DCAk, ICC| CFl)/P (ICC| v) × P (ICAk| EN T, CFl, DCAk) (3) ( ∵ P (CFl| v, ICC) =","P (CFl, ICC| v) P (ICC| v) =","P (ICC| CFl, v) · P (CFl| v) P (ICC| v) =","P (ICC| CFl) · P (CFl| v) P (ICC| v) , (∵ CFl contains the information about v.) P (DCAk| ICC, CFl) =","P (DCAk, ICC| CFl) P (ICC| CFl) )","Equation (2) is derived because we assume that the case frame CFl and direct case assignment DCAk are independent of existing entities EN T , and indirect case assignment ICAk is independent of input case components ICC.","Because P (ICC| v) is constant, we can say that our model selects the case frame CFbest and the direct case assignment DCAbest and indirect case assignment ICAbest that maximize the probability P (CF, DCA, ICA| v, ICC, EN T ): (CFbest, DCAbest, ICAbest) =","argmax CF,DCA,ICA ( P (CF | v) × P (DCA, ICC| CF ) ×P (ICA| EN T, CF, DCA)) (4)","The probability P (CFl| v), called generative probability of a case frame, is estimated from case structure analysis of a large raw corpus. The following subsections illustrate how to calculate P (DCAk, ICC| CFl) and P (ICAk| EN T, CFl, DCAk). 772 3.2.1 Generative Probability of Direct Case","Assignment","For estimation of generative probability of direct case assignment P (DCAk, ICC| CFl), we follow Kawahara and Kurohashi’s (2006) method. They decompose P (DCAk, ICC| CFl) into the following product depending on whether a case slot sj is filled with an input case component or vacant: P (DCAk, ICC| CFl) =","∏ sj:A(sj)=1 P (A(sj) = 1, nj, cj| CFl, sj) × ∏ sj:A(sj)=0 P (A(sj) = 0| CFl, sj) = ∏ sj:A(sj)=1 { P (A(sj) = 1| CFl, sj) × P (nj, cj| CFl, sj, A(sj) = 1) } × ∏ sj:A(sj)=0 P (A(sj) = 0| CFl, sj) (5) where the function A(sj) returns 1 if a case slot sj is filled with an input case component; otherwise 0, nj denotes the content part of the case component, and cj denotes the surface case of the case component.","The probabilities P (A(sj) = 1| CFl, sj) and P (A(sj) = 0| CFl, sj) are called generative probability of a case slot, and estimated from case structure analysis of a large raw corpus as well as generative probability of a case frame.","The probability P (nj, cj| CFl, sj, A(sj) = 1) is called generative probability of a case component and estimated as follows: P (nj, cj| CFl, sj, A(sj) = 1) ≈P (nj| CFl, sj, A(sj)=1)×P (cj| sj, A(sj)=1) (6)","P (nj| CFl, sj, A(sj) = 1) means the generative probability of a content part nj from a case slot sj in a case frame CFl, and estimated by using the frequency of a case slot example in the automatically constructed case frames. P (cj| sj, A(sj) = 1) is approximated by P (cj| case type of (sj), A(sj) = 1) and estimated from the web corpus in which the relationship between a surface case marker and a case slot is annotated by hand. 3.2.2 Probability of Indirect Case Assignment","To estimate probability of indirect case assignment P (ICAk| EN T, CFl, DCAk) we also decompose it into the following product depending Table 3: Location Classes of Antecedents. intra-sentence: case components of L1 : parent predicate of Vz L2 : parent predicate of Vz” (parallel) L3 : child predicate of Vz L4 : child predicate of Vz (parallel) L5 : parent predicate of parent noun phrase of Vz L6 : parent predicate of parent predicate of Vz (parallel) L7 : other noun phrases following Vz L8 : other noun phrases preceding Vz inter-sentence: noun phrases in L9 : 1 sentence before L10: 2 sentences before L11: 3 sentences before L12: more than 3 sentences before on whether a case slot sj is filled with an entity entj or vacant:","P (ICAk| EN T, CFl, DCAk) = ∏","sj:A′ (sj)=1","P (A′ (sj) = 1, entj| EN T, CFl, sj) × ∏","sj:A′ (sj)=0","P (A′ (sj) = 0| EN T, CFl, sj) (7)","where the function A′ (s","j) returns 1 if a case slot sj is filled with an entity entj; otherwise 0. Note that we only consider case slots ga, wo and ni that is not filled with an input case component. We approximate P (A′","(s j) = 1, entj| EN T, CFl, sj)","and P (A′ (sj) = 0| EN T, CFl, sj) as follows:","P (A′ (sj) = 1, entj| EN T, CFl, sj) ≈ P (A′","(s j) = 1, entj| entj, CFl, sj)","= P (A′ (s j) = 1| entj, CFl, sj) (8)","P (A′ (sj) = 0| EN T, CFl, sj) ≈ P (A′","(s j) = 0| case type of (sj)) (9)","Equation (8) is derived because we assume P (A′","(sj) = 1| CFl, sj) is independent of existing entities that are not assigned to sj. Equation (9) is derived because we assume P (A′","(sj) = 0) is independent of EN T and CFl, and only de-pends on the case type of sj, such as ga, wo and ni. P (A′","(sj) = 0| case type of (sj)) is the probability that a case slot has no correspondence after zero anaphora resolution and estimated from anaphoric relation tagged corpus.","Let us consider the probability P (A′","(s","j) = 1| entj, CFl, sj). We decompose entj into content part njm , surface case cjn and location class ljn. Here, location classes denote the locational relations between zero pronouns and their antecedents. We defined twelve location classes as described in Table 3. In Table 3, Vz means a predicate that has a zero pronoun. Note that we also consider the 773 locations of zero pronouns that are linked to the target entity as location class candidates. Now we roughly approximate P (A′","(sj) = 1| entj, CFl, sj)","as follows: P (A′","= 1| ent j, CFl, sj)","=P (A′ = 1| n jm , cjn, ljn, CFl, sj) =","P (njm, cjn, ljn| CFl, sj,A′ =1)· P (A′","=1| CF l, sj) P (njm, cjn, ljn| CFl, sj) ≈","P (njm| CFl, sj, A′","=1) P (njm| CFl, sj) ·","P (cjn| CFl, sj, A′","=1) P (cjn| CFl, sj) ·","P (ljn| CFl, sj, A′","=1) P (ljn| CFl, sj)","· P (A′ =1| CF l, sj) (10) ≈","P (njm| CFl, sj, A′","= 1) P (njm) ×","P (cjn| case type of(sj), A′","= 1) P (cjn)","× P (A′ = 1| l jn, case type of (sj)) (11) ( ∵","P (ljn| CFl, sj, A′","=1) P (ljn| CFl, sj)","· P (A′ =1| CF l, sj) =","P (A′ =1, l","jn| CFl, sj) P (ljn| CFl, sj)","=P (A′ =1| CF l, ljn, sj))","Note that because entj is often mentioned more than one time, there are several combinations of content part njm , surface case cjn and location class ljn candidates. We select the pair of m and n with the highest probability.","Equation (10) is derived because we assume njm , cjn and ljn are independent of each other. Equation (11) is derived because we approximate P (A′","= 1| CF","l, ljn, sj) as P (A′","= 1| ljn, case type of (sj)), and assume P (njm) and P (cjn) are independent of CFl and sj. Since these approximation is too rough, specifically, P (njm) and P (cjn) tend to be somewhat smaller than P (njm | CFl, sj) and P (cjn| CFl, sj) and equation (11) often becomes too large, we introduce a parameter α(≤ 1) and use the α-times value as P (A′","= 1| ent","j, CFl, sj).","The first term of equation (11) represents how likely an entity that contains njm as a content part is considered to be an antecedent, the second term represents how likely an entity that contains cjn as a surface case is considered to be an antecedent, and the third term gives the probability that an entity that appears in location class ljn is an antecedent.","The probabilities P (njm ) and P (cjn) are estimated from a large raw corpus. The probabilities P (cjn| case type of (sj)) and P (A′","= 1| ljn, case type of (sj)) are estimated from the web corpus in which the relationship between an antecedent of a zero pronoun and a case slot, and the relationship between its surface case marker and a case slot are annotated by hand. Then, let us consider the probability P (njm| CFl, sj, A′","(sj) = 1) in the next subsection.","3.2.3 Probability of Component Part of Zero","Pronoun","P (njm | CFl, sj, A′","=1) is similar to P (n","j| CFl, sj, A=1) and can be estimated approximately from case frames using the frequencies of case slot examples. However, while A′","(sj) = 1 means sj is not filled with input case component but filled with an entity as the result of zero anaphora resolution, case frames are constructed by extracting only the input case component. Therefore, the content part of a zero anaphora antecedent njm is often not included in the case slot examples. To cope with this problem, we utilize generalized examples.","When one mention of an entity is tagged any category or recognized as an NE, we also use the category or the NE class as the content part of the entity. For examples, if an entity { Prius} is recognized as an artifact name and assigned to wo case of the case frame hanbai(1) in Table 1, the system also calculates: P (NE :ARTIFACT | hanbai(1), wo, A′","(wo)=1)","P (NE : ARTIFACT )","besides: P (P rius| hanbai(1), wo, A′","(wo) = 1)","P (P rius)","and uses the higher value. 3.3 Salience Score Previous works reported the usefulness of salience for anaphora resolution (Lappin and Leass, 1994; Mitkov et al., 2002). In order to consider salience of an entity, we introduce salience score, which is calculated by the following set of simple rules: • +2 : mentioned with topical marker “wa”. • +1 : mentioned without topical marker “wa”. • +0.5 : assigned to a zero pronoun. • ×0.7 : beginning of each sentence.","For examples, we consider the salience score of the entity { Toyota} in (i) in Section 3.1.

We selected 20 documents for test and used the other 166 documents for calculating several probabilities. Since the anaphoric relations in some web documents were not so clear and too difficult to recognize, we did not select such documents for test. In the 20 test documents, 122 zero anaphora relations were tagged between one of the mentions of the antecedent and the target predicate that had the zero pronoun.","Each parameter for proposed model was estimated using maximum likelihood from the data described in Table 4. The case frames were automatically constructed from web corpus comprising 1.6 billion sentences. The case structure analysis was conducted on 80 million sentences in the web corpus, and P (nj) and P (cj) were calculated from the same 80 million sentences.","In order to concentrate on zero anaphora resolution, we used the correct morphemes, named entities, syntactic structures and coreferential relations that were annotated by hand. Since correct coreferential relations were given, the number of created entities was same between the gold standard and the system output because zero anaphora resolution did not create new entities. 4.2 Experimental Results We conducted experiments of zero anaphora resolution. As the parameter α introduced in Section 3.2.2., we tested 3 values 1, 1/2, and 1/4. For comparison, we also tested Kawahara and Kurohashi’s (2004) model. The experimental results are shown in Table 5, in which recall R, precision P and F-measure F were calculated by: R =","# of correctly recognized zero anaphora # of zero anaphora tagged in corpus , P = # of correctly recognized zero anaphora # of system outputted zero anaphora , F =","2 1/R + 1/P .","Kawahara and Kurohashi’s model achieved al-most 50% as F-measure against newspaper articles. However, as a result of our experiment against web documents, it achieved only about 20% as F-measure. This may be because anaphoric relations in web documents were not so clear as those in newspaper articles and more difficult to recognize. As to the parameter α, the larger α tended to output more zero anaphora, and the highest F-measure was achieved against α = 1/2.","When using α = 1/2, there were 72 (=122−50) zero pronouns that were tagged in the corpus and not resolved correctly. Only 12 of them were correctly detected and assigned to a wrong entity, that is, 60 of them were not even detected. Therefore, we can say our recall errors were mainly caused by the low recall of zero pronoun detection.","In order to confirm the effectiveness of generalized examples of case slots and salience score, we also conducted experiments under several conditions. We set α = 1/2 in these experiments. The results are shown in Table 6, in which CT means generalized categories, NE means generalized NEs and SS means salience score.","Without using any generalized examples, the F-measure is less than Kawahara and Kurohashi’s method, which use similarity to deal with sparseness of case slot examples, and we can confirm the effectiveness of the generalized examples. While generalized categories much improved the F-measure, generalized NEs contribute little. This may be because the NE rate is smaller than common noun rate, and so the effect is limited.","We also confirmed that the salience score filter improved F-measure. Moreover, by using salience score filter, the zero anaphora resolution becomes about ten times faster. This is because the system 775","Table 6: Experiments under Several Conditions.","CT NE SS R P F","√ .131 (16/122) .205 (16/78) .160√ √ .164 (20/122) .247 (20/81) .197√ √ .402 (49/122) .368 (49/133) .384√ √ .385 (47/122) .196 (47/240) .260√ √ √ .410 (50/122) .373 (50/134) .391 can avoid checking entities with low salience as antecedent candidates. 4.3 Comparison with Previous Works We compare our accuracies with (Seki et al., 2002). They achieved 48.9% in precision, 88.2% in recall, and 62.9% in F-measure for zero pronoun detection, and 54.0% accuracy for antecedent estimation on 30 newspaper articles, that is, they achieved about 34% in F-measure for whole zero pronoun resolution. It is difficult to directly compare their results with ours due to the difference of the corpus, but our method achieved 39% in F-measure and we can confirm that our model achieves reasonable performance considering the task difficulty."]},{"title":"5 Conclusion","paragraphs":["In this paper, we proposed a probabilistic model for Japanese zero anaphora resolution. By using automatically constructed wide-coverage case frames that include generalized examples and in-troducing salience score filter, our model achieves reasonable performance against web corpus. As future work, we plan to conduct large-scale experiments and integrate this model to a fully-lexicalized probabilistic model for Japanese syntactic and case structure analysis (Kawahara and Kurohashi, 2006)."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Iida, Ryu, Kentaro Inui, and Yuji Matsumoto. 2006.
