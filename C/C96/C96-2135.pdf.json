I will argue that the presented account is more adequate than others made during the past years because it allows the description of constituents in fronted positions with their modifier remaining in the non-fronted part of the sentence. A problem with ill-formed signs that are admitted by all HPSG accounts for partial verb phrase fronting known so far will be explained and a solution will be suggested that uses the difference between combinatoric relations of signs and their representation in word order domains. 1 Introduction During the last years, several different analyses for partial verb phrase fronting have been proposed (Pollard, To appear; Nerbonne, 1994; Baker, 1994; Hinrichs and Nakazawa, 1994b). The most promising account so far has been the one of Hinrichs and Nakazawa. This account, however, suffers from some drawbacks that will be discussed in section 4. I will present a rather simple account that, uses the standard NONLOC mechanism HPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1994) provides. In sect, ion 3.3, I will discuss a problem that arises for all accounts of partial verb phrase fronting: underspecified COMPS lists. By the means of a new daughter (licensing daughter) in a schema for the introduction of nonloeal dependencies this problem will be solved.","*This paper is available via the WWW: http:// www. compling, hu-berlin, de/~ st ef an/Pub/e_pvp, html Thanks to Prank Keller for comments oil earlier versions of this paper. 2 The"]},{"title":"Phenomena","paragraphs":["Ill German, it is possible to front non-maximal verbal projections}","(1) a.

Instead I will follow Reape's (1994) at)preach. Reape assumes word order domains as an additional level of representation. In such a domain, all daughters of a head occur. These domains differ from the daughter list, in that the ele, ments in a domain (signs) correspond in their serialization to the surface order of the words in the string. LP-eonstraints apply to elements of the order domain. Another basic assumption of Reape is that constituents may be discontinuous.","As Hinriehs and Nakazmva (1994a) have shown, it is reasonable to assume in addition to the head complement schema a schema that licenses the -verbal complex. Hinri(:hs and Nakazawa introduced the concept of argument attraction into the HPSG framework. If a vert)al (:omI)lex is build two verbs are combined and the resulting sign inher~ its all arguments from both verbs. In their paper, Hinrichs and Nakazawa treat verbal complements as ordinary complements that, are included in the COMPS list of their heads. It has however proven 1,o be useful to distinguish the verbal complement from other complements (Rentier, 1994a; Mfiller, 1995a). The merits of this move will t)e discussed shortly, l~br the Imrpose of representing the in-tbrmation at)out verbal colnt)lements , the fl;ature VCOMP is introduced.

It is marked LEX+ because it can in turn be embedded.","(8) , well er ihm ein M/irchen because he him a fairy talc [[erz~hlen lassen] hat]. tell let has 'because he has let him tell the story.' 3.2 The LEX Feature The LEX feature in the entry for werden ensures that a matrix verb is combined with its verbal complement before the verbal complement is saturated by one of its complements. It is therefore possible to avoid multiple structures in the Mittelfeld. (9) a. Er wird seiner Tochter ein M/irchen","[erzghlen mfissen].","b. Er wird sciner Toehter [[ein M/irchen erz/ihlen] miissen]].","c. Er wird [[seiner Tochter ein Miirchen erz//hlen] miissen]]. But exactly those constituents that have to be avoided in the Mittclfeld are needed in the Vorreid. Very complicate mechanisms have been introduced to cope with this problem without a lot of spurious ambiguities (Nerbonne, 1994; Hinrichs and Nakazawa, 1994b). I will suggest a solution to the problem that is very simple: If it is the case that an embedded verb or verbal complex has to be LEX+ when verb and complement are tombitted locally and if it is the case that this does not hold if a nonlocal dependency is involved than the simplest solution is to view LEX not as a local feature. If one assumes that LEX lives under the path SYNSEM instead of SYNSEMILOC than the problem turns into a non-issue.","Figures 1 and 2 show the analyses of the sentences in (10). 4 In the analyses of (10a), a trace flmctions as a verbal complement. In (10b) a trace for a verb is modified by an adverb.","(10) a. Seiner Tochter erziihlen wird er das M/irchen. b. Vortragen wird er es morgen.","Sentences like (5a) are ruled out because wird selects a complement in bse-form that has a VCOMP value none. As erziihlen does not appear in any COMPS list it is not possible for the verb to count as an argument of the fronted verbal complex that is saturated in the Mittel]eld. This is the case in Pollards account. Hinrichs and Nakazawa have to block this case by stating type constraints","4In the original grammar, I use a binary branching schema for head-complement and verb cluster struclures. Adjuncts and complements are inserted into the domain of their head so that word order facts are accounted for. Due to space limitations, the figures show a tree for a flat head-complement structure. on lists of attracted arguments. With a separate VCOMP feature this problem disappears.","3.3 The Problem of Underspeeified COMPS Lists In this section, I will address a problem that seems to have gone unnoticed until now. All analyses that involve argument attraction admit signs with underspecified COMPS lists. So in (1), wird is coinbined with a trace or a lexical rule is applied to it. The LOC value of the verbal complement is put into SLASII and the argmnents of the verbal complement are attracted by the matrix verb. This list of argmnents, however, is not instantiatcd in the resulting sign. It remains variable until the SLASIt element becomes bound. Therefore, the HPSG principles admit any kind of combination of totally unrelated signs. Since the COMPS list of the head is variable, any constituent is a possible complement. 5 As an HPSG theory is assumed to be a set of constraints that describe well formed descriptions of linguistic objects, this is clearly not wanted. If a grammar contains phonologically empty elements (traces, relativizers, and the like) the set of ill-formed signs will be infinite because wird -i could be combined with arbitrarily many empty elements. 6","It is clear that we want the matrix verb to be-have in a very well defined way. It shall attract exactly the arguments of the fronted verbal projection that were not saturated by this projection, i.e., the matrix verb shall perform the argmnent attraction that would take place in base position, abstracting away from tile value of LEX. The de-sired effect can be reached if a rule schema is used for the introduction of nonlocal dependencies. To introdnce a nonlocal dependency for a verbal complex, this schema requires an additional licensing condition to be met. The extracted element is licensed by an actually existing verbal projection in the string. When a hearer of a sentence hears the words that have to be combined with a trace or introduce the nonlocal dependency in another way, he or she has already heard the phrase actually located in the Vorfeld. Therefore, the infor-Ination about the nonlocal dependency is present and can be used to license the extracted element. The COMPS list of the extracted element, therefore is specified. The specified COMPS are attracted by tile matrix verb and the COMPS list of the matrix verb therefore does not contain any variables and our theory does not admit signs that don't describe linguistic objects.","~The same problem exists for analysises that treat verb second as verb movement (Kiss and Wesche, 1991; Netter, 1992).","6For a bottom-up parser, this would mean nontermination. 802 S(lin] V II.I';X-I LOC[~I SUBJ <[~, SUBCAT [3]<[4]>1","[~]N P[ilal] V Ibse, LEX+, SUBJ <12~, SUI]CA'I\" <[~ [~,1"]},{"title":"I","paragraphs":["S¢illcr Tiichter cr Wdhlen Slfin, SI.ASII <Jill V[tin, [~]NP[noml [20NP[acc] [i~V[bse,I.EX-;, SUBCAT <[~ • [~], ~ SUI]CAT [~], VCOMP ~] SI,ASH <[]]>] wird er das M~lrchen"]},{"title":"Figure 1: Analysis of Seiner Tochtcr erziihlen wird er das Mfirchen.","paragraphs":["SIlin] V[]~[bse,l.EX+, S[lin, SI]I]J <L~, SLASII <[[]>] silnCA'r 03< ~3~, CONT ~-II Vllin, SUIICAT <[2}> oL3], VCOMP ~]1 __ 7 - --- -~--- VC","[2]Nl'[,oml [~]NPlaccl l~.flV[bse, CONT ~rl SI.ASI[ <[I]>] ADV[MOD~q.

I will not repeat the arguments against these approaches here.

However, the assumption that SLASH contains signs rather than local objects is a change of the basic HPSG formalism with far reaching consequences that is not really needed and that has some side effects.","In the following, I discuss two problems for this approach.

A minor change in the feature geometry of signs was sufficient to cope with the spurious ambiguity problem of Pollard's (To appear) account. The account, argued for in this paper can describe the fronting phenomena without the assumption of an infinite lexicon. A solution for the problem of underspecified COMPS lists was found.
