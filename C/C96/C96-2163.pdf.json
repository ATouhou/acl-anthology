Among several research topics in this field, acquisition from parallel corpora is quite attractive (e.g. Dagan et al. (1991)). The reason is that parallel sentences are useful for resolving both syntactic and lexical ambiguities in the monolingual sentences. Especially if the two languages have different syntactic structures and word meanings (such as English and Japanese), this approach has proved to be most effective in disambigua-tion (Matsumoto et al., 1993; Utsuro et al., 1993).","Utsuro et al. (1993) proposed a method for acquiring surface case frames of Japanese verbs from Japanese-English parallel corpora. In this method, translated English verbs and case labels are used to classify senses of Japanese polysemous verbs. Clues to sense classification are found using English verbs and case labels, as well as the sense distribution of the Japanese case element","*The author would like to thank Prof. Yuji MAT-SUMOTO for his valuable comments on this"]},{"title":"research.","paragraphs":["This work is partly supported by the Grants from"]},{"title":"the","paragraphs":["Ministry of Education, Science, and Culture, Japan, ~07780326. nouns. Then, a human instructor judges whether the clues are correct. One of the major disadvantages of the method is that the use of English information and sense distribution of Japanese case element nouns is restricted. Only surface forms of English verbs and case labels are used and sense distribution of English verbs is not used. Also, the threshold of deciding a distinction in the sense distribution of Japanese case element nouns is predetermined on a fixed level in a Japanese thesaurus. As a result, the human instructor is frequently asked to judge the correctness of the clue.","In the field of statistical analysis of natural language data, it is common to use measures of lexical association, such as the information-theoretic measure of mutual information, to extract useful relationships between words (e.g. Church and Hanks (1990)). Lexical association has its limits, however, since often either the data is insufficient to provide reliable word/word correspondences, or the task requires more abstraction than word/word correspondences permit. Thus, Resnik (1992) proposed a useful mea~ sure of word/class association by generalizing information-theoretic measure of word/word association. The proposed measure addresses the limitations of lexical association by facilitating sta~ tistical discovery of facts involving word"]},{"title":"classes","paragraphs":["rather than individual words.","We find the measure of word/class association of Resnik (1992) is quite attractive, since it is possible to discover a meaningful sense club-ter in an arbitrary level of the thesaurus. We thus expect that the restrictions of the previous method of Utsuro et al. (1993) can be Overcome by employing the idea of the measure of word/class association. In this paper, we describe how this idea can be applied to the sense classification of Japanese verbal polysemy in case frame acquisition from Japanese-English parallel corpora. First, sense distribution of English predicates and Japanese case element nouns is represented using monolingual English and Japanese thesaurus, respectively (sections 2 and 3).

We are planning to make experiments on sense classification without bilingual information to evaluate the e.lt'ectiveness of such bilingual information. li'or 9 verl)s, we made an ext)eriment on sense classification of verbal polysemy. We compared the result with the hand-classification and checked whether each cluster contained examples of only one hand-classitied sense (Table 3). In the table, 'CI.' and 'lEg.' indicate the numbers of ellis= ters and examples, respectively. The column 'One Sense (Jluster' means that each cluster contains examples of only one hand-classified sense, and the sub-eohmms 'CI.' and 'Eg.' list the number of SlLch (:lusters and the sum of examples contained in such clusters, respectively. We ewduated the accuracy of the method am the rate of the number of examples contained in one sense clusters as in the 'Eg.' sub-eohmm. This achieved 100% accuracy for four verbs out of the 9 verbs, and 93.3% in average. The coluinn 'Total C1./Hand-Classif.' indicates the ratio of the total number of clusters to the number of hand-classified senses, correspoading to the average number of clnsters into which one hand-classified sense is divided. Its a, verag% median, and standard deviation are 2.46, 1.80, and 1.06, respectively.","The result of the experiment indicated that the t)r<)posed sense classification method has achieved almost pure classification, while the result seems a little liner than hand-elassitieation. This is mainly cause<l by the Net that clusters which correspond to the same hand-classified sense are separately located in the human-made thesaurus, and it is not easy to find exactly one representative class in the thesaurus (Utsuro, 11995). It is necessary to further merge the clusters so that exactly one cluster corresponds to one hand-classified sense."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["K. W. Church and P. Hanks. 1990.
