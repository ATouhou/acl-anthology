Compound nouns as index terms that usually subscribe to specific notions tend to increase the precision of retrieval performance. The use of the component nouns of a compound noun as index terms, on the other hand, may improve the recall performance, but can decrease the precision. Our proposed method to handle compound nouns with a goal to increase the recall while preserving the precision computes the relevance of the component nouns of a compound noun to the document content by comparing the document sets that are supported by the component nouns and the terms of the document. The operational content of a term is represented as the probabilistic distribution of the term over the document set. Experiments with a set of 1,000 documents show that our method gains 33% increase of retrieval performance compared to the indexing method without compound noun analysis, and is as good as manual decomposition by human experts. 1 Introduction Automatic indexing renders a form of document representation that visualizes the content of the document more explicitly. Indices that are carefully chosen to represent a document will bring about the improvement of retrieval performance in accuracy and time efficiency. The potential of a candidate index is often judged on the basis of"]},{"title":"its","paragraphs":["discriminating power over a docmnent set as well as its linguistic significance in the document. Thus, a good index term should distinguish a certain class of documents from the rest of the documents and be relevant to the subject matters of the"]},{"title":"class","paragraphs":["of documents to be indexed by the term.","In general, automatic indexing consists of the identification of index terms and the assignment of weights to the terms (Salton 1983).","An index term can be either a simple noun or a compound noun composed of more than one simple nouns. Compound nouns tend to carry more specific contextual information than simple nouns, thus they are likely to contribute to the retrieval precision. Compound nouns may contain useful simple nouns that usually refer general contexts, and thus will boost the recall of retrieval. Process-ing compound nouns is decomposing them into simple nonns and evaluating the simple nouns as potential index terms. In both identifying and evaluating index terms, compound nouns require a different strategy from that for simple nouns. The identification of compound nouns involves a certain degree of linguistic or statistical analysis that varies from simple stemming to morphological analysis (Fagan 1989).","What makes it even more complicated to handle compound nouns in Korean documents lies in the convention of writing compound nouns. In Korean, it is allowed to write compound nouns with or without intervening blanks between constituent nouns. Arbitrarily long compound nouns are possible and not rare in real texts. The decomposition of a compound noun is particularly problematic because of the severe ambiguity of segmentations.","In this paper, we propose a method to identify and evaluate the candidate index terms from compound nouns. First, each possible decomposition of a compound noun is identified. To'see the potential of the component nouns of the decomposition, we observe how the component nouns are distributed over the total document set, and 514 also examine how the simple and componnd nouns of the current document are distributed over the same document set. The similarity of the two distributions implies how consistently the two term sets will behave given a query at retriewd time.","The proposed method assumes a dictionary of nouns that is automatically constructed from the document set. 3'his is the practice that has never been tried in Korean document indexing, but has some important merits. A laborious work for the manual construction of nominal dictionaries is not needed. Since the noun dictionary contains only those in a document set, the ambiguity in analyz-ing words is greatly reduced.","Previous researches on the problem of compound noun indexing in Korean have been done in two directions. One approach adopts a full-scale morphological analysis to decompose a word into a sequence of the smallest morpheme units that are all treated as index terms. The other approach tries to avoid the complexity of the full scale analysis by using bigrams as in (Fnjii 199'3; l,ee 11996; Ogawa 1993). Since these methods take all the components of compound nouns as index terms without evaluation, irrelewmt terms can decrease retrieval precision.","Experiments on 1000 documents show that our evaluation scheme gave results closet\" to the human intuition and maintained the highest precision ratio of tile existing methods.","In the following section, a brief review of related work on automatic indexing for Korean docnments is made. Section 3 explains tile proposed method in detail. The verification of the method through experiments is described in section 4. Section 5 concludes the paper. 2 Related Work The previous approaches to compound noun indexing are based either on full scale morphological analysis (Kang :1995; Kim"]},{"title":"1983;","paragraphs":["Lee 1995; Seo 1993) or on the syllabic patterns (Fujii 1993 ; Lee 1996; Ogawa 1993). Morphological analysis will return morphologically valid component words constituting a given compound word. Since this method does not exclude invalid or meaning-less words, it can result in the degradatiou of precision. Besides the employment of full morphological analysis is often too expensive and requires costly maintenance.","Simpler methods segment componnd nouns mechanically into unigram or bigram words that are all regarded as index terms (Lee 1996). Bigram in-dexes shows better precision than unigrams, but can suffer from big index size. In general, the existing methods for compound noun analysis have been focused mainly on recall performance with little attention to the precision.

Figure 1 summarizes the algorithm. The tokenizer produces a list of simple and compound nouns by utilizing the noun dictionary and the basic stermning rules. The noun dictionary is used to identify whether a noun is simple or compound, and the basic stemming rules are used to differentiate non-final words from others such as function words and verbs. The noun dictionary is automatically constructed from the obserw~tion on the document set. The compound noun analyzer inw:stigates if the components of compound nouns are appropriate as indexes. The index terrns that include simple nouns prodnced as a result of compound noun analysis are weighted, which finishes the indexing.","l,et £' and C denote the sets of simple and compound nouns, respectively. Simple nouns are, by definition, those that do not have any of their substrings as a noun according to the dictionary. Compound nouns are those one or more substrings of which are recognized as nouns. Let T = {7'l,7~,...,5/~} = EUC be the set of all simple and compound nouns of a document set.

The task for Korean texts requires extra efforts due to the complexity of inflections. The proposed method gives better potential of sustaining the precision while improving the recall than other approaches by making use of probabilistic distributions of terms as the representation of meaning of the terms.","The proposed method to evaluate the coinponents of compound nouns is unique in that it delines and uses term representation, which explains the superiority of the method to other methods. The method requires little human involvement and is very promising for the implementation of practical systems by achieving efficiency and accuracy at the same time. References Blahut, Richard E.
