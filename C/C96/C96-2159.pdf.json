However, a DTLA cannot handle structured attributes like nouns, which are classified under a thesaurus. In this paper, we present a new DTLA that can rationally handle the structured attributes. In the process of tree generation, the algorithm generalizes each attribute optimally using a given thesaurus. We apply this algorithm to a bilingual corpus and show that it successfiflly learned a generalized decision tree for classifying the verb \"take\" and that the tree was smaller with more prediction power on the open data than the tree learned by the conventional DTLA. 1 Introduction The group of Decision Tree Learning Algorithms (DTLAs) like CART (Breiman et al., 1984), ID3 (Quinlan, 1986) and C4.5 (Quinlan,"]},{"title":"1993)","paragraphs":["are some of the most widely used algorithms for learning the rules for expert systems and has been sueeessfully applied to several areas so far.","These algorithms are now getting keen attention from the natural language processing (NLP) research community since the huge text corpus is becoming widely available. The most popular touchstone for the DTLA in this community is the verbal case frame or the translation rules. There have already been some attempts, like (Tanaka, 1994) and (Almuallim et al., 1994).","The group of DTLAs, however, was originally designed to handle \"plain\" data, whereas nouns are \"structured\" under a thesaurus. Although handling such \"structured attributes\" in the DTLA was described as a \"desirable extension\" in the book of Quinlan (Quinlan, 1993), the 1-10-11 Kinuta, Setagaya-ku","Tokyo, 157, Japan tanakah@strl, nhk. or."]},{"title":"jp","paragraphs":["value attribute (case) (semantic restriction) object noun",",.t [¥ I I Q l [ I Taro Hanako cat dog elephant TV camera","tsurete-iku [escort] hakobu[carry] class (translation) Figure 1: Case Prame Tree Learned by DTLA problem has received rather limited attention so far (Ahnuallim et el., 1995).","There have been several attempts to solve tile problem in the NLP community, such as (Tanaka, 1995b), (Almuallim et el., 1995). These attempts, however, are not always satisfactory in that the handling of the thesaurus is not flexible enough.","In this paper, we introduce an extended DTLA, LASA-1 (inductive earning Algorithm with Structured Attributes), which can handle structured attributes in an optimmn way. We first present an algorithm called T*, which can solve the sub-problem for structured attributes and then present the whole algorithm of LASA-1. Finally, we report an application of our new algorithm to verbal case frame acquisition and show its effectiveness.","2 The Structured Attribute Problem Figure 1 shows an example decision tree represent-ing acase frame for the verb \"take.\" This decision tree was called the case frame tree (Tanaka, 1994) and we follow that convention in this paper, too. One may recognize that the restrictions in figure 1 are not semantic categories but are words: this tree was learned from table I which contains word forms for the values. Although the tree has some attractive features mentioned in (Tanaka, 1994), it suffers from two problems.","• weak prediction power A case frame tree with word forms does not have high prediction power on the open data 943 Table 1: Single Attribute Table.,for:. \"take\"","Object Noun Japanese Translation Taro Hanako cat dog elephant elephant TV camera tsurete-iku (escort) tsurete-iku (escort) tsurete-iku (escort) tsurete-iku (escort) hakobu (carry) hakobu (carry) hakobu (carry) hakobu (carry)","(the data not used for learning). The nouns","are the most problematic. There will be","many unknown nouns in the open data. • low legibility","If we include many different nouns in the","training data (the data used for learning),","the obtained tree will have as many branches","as the number of nouns. The ramified tree is","hard for humans to understand. Introducing a thesaurus or a semantic hierar-","chy in a case frame tree seems a sound way to","ameliorate these two problems. We can replace","the similar nouns in a case fl'ame tree by a proper","semantic class, which will reduce the size of the","tree while increasing the prediction power on the","open data. But how can we introduce a thesaurus","into the conventional DTLA framework? This is","exactly the \"structured attributes\" problem that","we mentioned in section 1. 3 The Problem Setting 3.1 Partial Thesaurus The DTLA takes an attribute, value and class table for an input 1 Although the table usually includes multiple attributes, the algorithm evaluates an attribute's goodness as a classifier independently of the rest of the attributes. In other words a \"single attribute table\" as shown in table 1 is the flmdamental unit for the DTLA. This table shows an imaginary relationship between an object noun of the verb \"take\" and the Japanese translation. We used this table to learn the case frame tree in figure 1 and it suffered from the two problems.","Here, we can assume that the word forms of the ON are in a thesaurus (We call this thesaurus the original thesaurus) and we can extract the relevant part as in figure 2. We call this tree a partial thesaurus T 2. If we replace \"Taro\" and \"Hanako\"","lWe are going to mainly use the terms attribute, value, and class for generality. They actually refer to the case, restrictions for the case, and the translation of the verb respectively in our application. In this paper, we use these terms interehangeably.","2The scores at each node will be explained in section 3.3.

If we replace \"Taro,\" \"Hanako,\" \"cat,\" \"dog\" and \"elephant\" by \"*mammal,\" and assign the translation \"tsurete- iku\" to \"*mammal\" (The majority translation under the node \"*mammal\" in T. We are going to use this \"majority rule\" for the class assignment.), then the learned case fl'ame tree will reduce the size by four. But the case frame tree will produce two translation errors (\"hakobu\" for \"elephant\") when we classify the original table 1. In both cases, the learned case frame trees are expected to have reinforced prediction power on the open data thanks to the semantic classes: the replacement in the table generalizes the case frame tree. We want high-level generalization but low-level translation errors; but how do we achieve this in an optimum way?","3.2 Unique and Complete Cover Generalization One factor we have to consider is the possible combinations of the node set in T which we use for the generalization of the single attribute table.

By applying a shortest path algorithm (Gondran and Minoux, 1984) to figure 4, we find the shortest traverse as (s ~ *human --+ *beast --+ *instrument ---+ e) arm get the optimally generalized table as in table 5 and the generalized decision tree as in figure 5. 4.2 Correctness and Time Complexity We will not give a full proof for propositions 1 and 2 (correctness of T*) because of the limited space, but give an intuitive explanation of why the two propositions hold.","5The sum of the scores in the traversM node set is minimal.

In conclusion, we have to include \"cat\" or \"*beast\" in the P~, which satisfies formula (4). The T* links all such possible nodes with arcs, and the traversal node sets can exhaust T'.","One may easily understand that the traversal graph will be a DAG, since formula (4) allows an arc between two nodes to be spanned only in the direction that increases the index number of the leaf. Since proposition 1 holds, the time complexity of the T* can be estimated by the number of arcs in a traversal graph: there is an algorithm for the shortest path problem in an acyclic graph which runs with time complexity of O(M), where M is the number of arcs (Gondran and Minoux, 1984). Then we want to clarify the relationship between the number of leaves (data amount, denoted by D) and the number of arcs in the traversal graph. Unfortunately, the relationship between the two quantities varies depend-ing on the shape of the tree (partial thesaurus), then we consider a practical case: k-ary tree with depth d (Tanaka, 1995a).

The pairs contained 15 translations (classes) for \"take,\" whose occm'rences ranged from 5 to 9. We first converted the sentence pairs into an input table consisting of the case (attribute), English word form (value), and Japanese translation for \"take\" (class). We used 6 cases for attributes s and some of these appear in figure 6.","We used the Japanese \"Ruigo-Kokugo-Jiten\" (Ono, 1985) for the thesaurus. It is a 10-ary tree with the depth of 3 or 4. The semantic class at each node of the tree was represented by 1 (top level) to 4 (lowest level) digits. To link the English word forms in the input table to the thesaurus in order to extract a partial thesaurus, we used the Japanese translations for the English word forms. When there was more than one possible semantic class for a word form, we gave all of them 9 and expanded the input table using all the semantic classes.","We evaluated both algorithms with using the 10-fold cross validation method(Quinlan, 1993).","The purity threshold for halting the tree generation was experimentally set at 7570 10 for both algorithms.","A part of a case frame tree obtained by LASA-1 is shown in figure 6.
