It is natural to view each of these sub-tasks as a sequence labeling task of assigning POS/chunk labels to a given word sequence. For languages like English where annotated corpora are available in abundance these tasks can be performed with very high accuracy using data-driven machine learning techniques. Languages of the world show different levels of readiness with respect to such annotated resources and hence not all languages may","1","Marathi is the official language of Maharashtra, a state in Western India. The language has close to 20 million speakers in the world. provide a conducive platform for machine learning techniques.","In this scenario, morphologically rich languages from the Indian subcontinent present a very interesting case. While these languages do not enjoy the resource abundance of English, their linguistic richness can be used to offset this resource deficit. Specifically, in such languages, the suffixes carry a lot of information about the category of a word which can be harnessed for shallow parsing. This is especially true in the case of verbs where suffixes like {ne}, {naare} 2 clearly indicate the category of the word. Further, the structure of verb groups in such languages is relatively rigid and can be used to reduce the ambiguity between main verbs and auxiliary verbs.","In the current work, we aim to reduce the data requirement of machine learning techniques by appropriate feature engineering based on the characteristics of the language. Specifically, we target Marathi- a morphologically rich language-and show that a powerful morphological analyzer backed by a high coverage lexicon and a simple but accurate Verb Group Identifier (VGI) can go a long way in improving the accuracy of a state of the art sequence classifier. Further, we show that harnessing such features is the only way by which one can hope to build a high-accuracy classifier for such languages, and that simply throwing in a large amount of annotated corpora does not serve the purpose. Hence it makes more sense to invest time and money in developing good morphological analyzers for such languages than investing in annotation.

Even hybrid taggers such as CLAWS (Garside and Smith, 1997) which combine stochastic and rule based approaches have been developed. However, most of these techniques do not focus on harnessing the morphology; instead they rely on the abundance of data which is not a very suitable proposition for some of the resource deprived languages of the Indian sub-continent.","Morphological processing based taggers using a combination of hand-crafted rules and annotated corpora have been tried for Turkish (Oflazer and Kuruöz, 1994), Arabic (Tlili-Guiassa, 2006), Hungarian (Megyesi, 1999) and Modern Greek (Giorgos et al., 1999). The work on Hindi POS tagging (Singh et al., 2006) comes closest to our approach which showed that using a detailed linguistic analysis of morphosyntactic phenomena, followed by leveraging suffix information and accurate verb group identification can help to build a high-accuracy (93-94%) part of speech tagger for Hindi. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no POS tagger and Chunker available for Marathi and ours is the first attempt at building one."]},{"title":"3 Motivating Examples","paragraphs":["To explain the importance of suffix information for shallow parsing we present two motivating examples. First, consider the following Marathi sentence, a. haa rasta don gavaannaa jodaNaaraa VM aahe. this road two villages connecting is this is the road connecting VM two villages.","The word {jodaNaaraa} (connecting) in the above sentence is a verb and can be categorized as such by simply looking at the suffix {Naaraa} as this suffix does not appear with any other POS category. When suffix information is used as a feature a statistical POS tagger is able to identify the correct POS tag of {jodaNaaraa} even when it does not appear in the training data. Hence, using suffix information ensures that a classifier is able to learn meaningful patterns even in the absence of large training data. Next, we consider two examples for chunking.","• VGNN (Gerund Verb Chunk) u . maaNasaane uDaNyaachaa B-VGNN3 prayatna kelaa. man fly try do man tried flying B-VGNN.","• VGINF (Infinitival Verb Chunk) . tyaane chaalaayalaa B-VGNF suruvaata kelii. he walk start did he started to walk B-VGINF. Here, we are dealing with the case of two specific verb chunks, viz., VGNN (gerund verb chunk) and VGINF (infinitival verb chunk). A chunk having a gerund always gets annotated as VGNN and a chunk having an infinitival verb always gets annotated as VGINF. Thus, the correct identification of these verb chunks boils down to the correct identification of gerunds and infinitival verb forms in the sentence which in turn depend on the careful analysis of suffix information. For example, in Marathi, the attachment of the verbal suffix “- ” {Nyaachaa} to a verb root always results in a gerund. Similarly, the attachment of the verbal suffix “” {yalaa} to a verb root always results in an infinitival verb form. The use of such suffix information as features can thus lead to better generalization for handling unseen words and thereby reduce the need for additional training data. For instance, in the first sentence, even when the word “u” {uDaNyaachaa} does not appear in 3 Note that for all our experiments we used BI scheme for","chunking as opposed to the BIO scheme 348 the training data, a classifier which uses suffix information is able to label it correctly based on its experience of previous words having suffix “- ” {Nyaachaa} whereas a classifier which does not use suffix information fails to classify it correctly."]},{"title":"4 Morphological Structure of Marathi","paragraphs":["Marathi nouns inflect for number and case. They may undergo derivation on the attachment of postpositions. In the oblique case, first a stem is obtained from the root by applying the rules of inflection. Then a postposition is attached to the stem. Postpositions (including case markers and the derivational suffixes) play a very important role in Marathi morphology due to the complex morphotactics.","Marathi adjectives can be classified into two categories: ones that do not inflect and others that inflect for gender, number and case where such an inflection agrees with the gender and number of the noun modified by them.","The verbs inflect for gender, number and person of the subject and the direct object in a sentence. They also inflect for tense and aspect of the action as well as mood of the speaker in an illocutionary act. They may even undergo derivation to derive the nouns, adjectives or postpositions. Verbal morphology in Marathi is based on Aakhyaata theory for inflection and Krudanta theory for derivation which are two types of verb suffixes (Damale, 1970). Aakhyaata Theory: Aakhyaata refers to tense, aspect and mood. Aakhyaata form is realized through an aakhyaata suffix which is a closing suffix attached to verb root. For example, {basalaa} (sat) comes from basa + laa. There are 8 types of aakhyaatas named after the phonemic shape of the aakhyaata suffix. Associated with every aakhyaata are various aakhyaata-arthas which indicate the features: tense, aspect and mood. An aakhyaata may or may not agree with gender. Krudanta Theory: Krudanta suffixes are attached to the end of verbs to form non-infinitive verb forms. For example, ( + a) {dhaavaayalaa} (to run). There are 8 types of krudantas defined in Marathi."]},{"title":"5 Design of Marathi Shallow Parser","paragraphs":["Figure 1 and 2 show the overall architectures of Marathi POS tagger and chunker. The proposed system contains 3 important components. First, a morphological analyzer which provides ambiguity schemes and suffix information for generating a rich set of features. Ambiguity Scheme refers to the list of possible POS categories a word can take. This can add valuable information to a sequence classifier by restricting the set of possible POS categories for a word. For example, the word {jaat} meaning caste or go(caste-noun, go- VM/VAUX) can appear as a noun or a main verb or an auxiliary verb. Hence it falls in the ambiguity scheme <NN-VM-VAUX>. This information is stored in a lexicon. These features are then fed to a CRF based engine which couples them with other elementary features (previous/next words and bigram tags) for training a sequence labeler. Finally, in the case of POS tagger, we use a Verb Group Identifier (VGI) which acts as an error correcting module for correcting the output of the CRF based sequence labeler. Each of these components is described in detail in the following sub-sections. 5.1 Morphological Analyzer The formation of polymorphemic words leads to complexities which need to be handled during the analysis process. For example, consider the steps involved in the formation of the word {devasamorchyane} (the one in front of the God + ERGATIVE). devaasamora = (deva → devaa) + samora devaasamorachaa = ( devaasamora → devaasamora)","+ chaa devaasamorachyaane = (devaasamorachaa → devaasamorachyaa) + ne In theory, the process can continue recursively for the attachment of any number of suffixes. However, in practice, we have observed that a word in Marathi contains at most 4 suffixes.","FSMs prove to be elegant and computationally efficient tools for analyzing polymorphemic 349 Figure 1: Architecture of POS Tagger words. However, the recursive process of word formation in Marathi involves inflection at the time of attachment of every new suffix. The FSM needs to be modified to handle this. However, during the i-th recursion only (i-1)-th morpheme changes its form which can be handled by suitably modifying the FSM. The formation of word {devaasamorachyaane} can be viewed as: devaasamora = (deva → devaa) + samora devaasamorachaa = ( deva → devaa) + ( samora → samora)","+ chaa devaasamorachyaane = (deva → devaa) + (samora → samora) + (chaa → chyaa) + ne In general, Polymorphemic word = (inf lected morpheme1) + (inf lected morpheme2) + ...","Now, we can create an FSM which is aware of these inflected forms of morphemes in addition to the actual morphemes to handle the above recursive process of word formation. These inflected forms are generated using the paradigm-based4 system written in Java and then fed to the FSM implemented using SFST5",". 4 A paradigm identifies the uninflected form of words","which share similar inflectional patterns. 5 http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/gramotron","Our lexicon contains 16448 nouns categorized into 76 paradigms, 8516 adjectives classified as inflecting and non-inflecting adjectives, 1160 verbs classified into 22 classes. It contains 142 postpositions, 80 aakhyaata and 8 krudanta suffixes. 5.2 CRF Conditional Random Fields (Lafferty et al., 2001) are undirected graphical models used for labeling sequential data. Under this model, the conditional probability distribution of a tag given the observed word sequence is given by, P (Y |X; λ) =","1 Z(X)","· ePT t=1","PK k=1 λkfk(Yt−1,Yt,X,t) (1) where, X = source word Y = target word T = length of sentence K = number of f eatures λk = f eature weight Z(X) = normalization constant We used CRF++6",", an open source implementa-tion of CRF, for training and further decoding the tag sequence. We used the following features for training the sequence labeler (here, wi is the i-th word, ti is the i-th pos tag and ci is the i-th chunk tag).","/SOFTWARE/SFST.html 6 http://crfpp.sourceforge.net/ 350 Figure 2: Architecture of Chunker Features used for POS tagger training Consider position of interest = i • ti ti−1 and wj such that i − 3 < j < i + 3 • ti ti−1 and suffix information of wi • ti ti−1 and ambiguity scheme of wi Here, the first features are weak features which depend only on the previous/next words and bigram tags. The next two are rich morphological features which make use of the output of the morphological analyzer. Features used for Chunker training Consider position of interest = i • ci ci−1 and tj, wj such that i − 3 < j < i + 3 • ci ci−1 and suffix information of wi where ci, ci−1 ∈ {B, I}. Here again, the first set of features are weak features and the second set of features are rich morphological features. 5.3 Verb Group Identification (VGI) In Marathi, certain auxiliaries like a {asate} (be), a{aahe} (is) etc.. can also act as main verbs in certain contexts. This ambiguity between VM (main verbs) and VAUX (auxiliary verbs) can lead to a large number of errors in POS tagging if not handled correctly. However, the relatively rigid structure of Marathi VG coupled with distinct suffix-affinity of auxiliary verbs allows us to capture this ambiguity well using the following simple regular expression:","MainVerbRoot (KrudantaSuffix AuxVerbRoot)* AakhyaataSuffix The above regular expression imposes some restriction on the occurrence of certain auxiliary verbs after specific krudanta suffixes. This restric-tion is captured with the help of a rule file containing krudanta suffix-auxiliary verb pairs. A sample entry from this file is , [oon, kaaDh] which suggests that the auxiliary verb {kaaDh} can appear after the suffix {oon}. We created a rule file containing around 350 such valid krudanta suffix-auxiliary verb pairs.","An important point which needs to be high-lighted here is that a simple left to right scan ignoring suffix information and marking the first verb constituent as main verb and every other constituent as auxiliary verb does not work for Marathi. For example, consider the following verb sequence, u a . tyaalaa uchaluun aaNaave laagale","He carry bring need","It was needed to carry and bring him. Here, a simple left to right scan of the verb sequence ignoring the suffix information would imply that u is a VM whereas aand are VAUX. However, this is not the case and can be identified correctly by considering the suffix affinity of auxiliary verbs. Specifically, in this case, the verb root a cannot take the role of an auxiliary verb when it appears after the krudanta suffix . This suggests that the verb 351 adoes not belong to the same verb group as u and hence is not a VAUX. This shows suffix and regular expression help in disambiguat-ing VM-VAUX which is a challenge in all POS taggers."]},{"title":"6 Experimental Setup","paragraphs":["We used documents from the TOURISM and NEWS domain for all our experiments 7",".

Weak Morphological Features (Weak-MF): In addition to the elementary features we use substrings of length 1 to 7 appearing at the end of the word as feature. The idea here is that such substrings taken from the end of the word can provide a good approximation of the actual suffix of the word. Such substrings thus provide a statistical approximation of the suffixes in the absence of a full fledged morphological analyzer. This should not be confused with weak features which mean tags and word. Rich Morphological Features (Rich-MF): In addition to the elementary features we use the ambiguity schemes and suffix information provided by the morphological analyzer.

Adding more data will definitely not be of much use as the curve is already close to saturation. On the other hand, if morphological information is completely harnessed using a rich morphological analyzer then an accuracy as high as 94% can be obtained by using data as small as 20k words. Figure 6 tells a similar story. In the absence of morphological features a large amount of annotated corpus (62k words) is needed to reach an accuracy of 96%, whereas if suffix information is used then the same accuracy can be reached using a much smaller training corpus (20k words). This clearly shows that while dealing with morphologically rich languages, time and effort should be invested in building powerful morphological analyzer. 2. Weak morphological features vs rich morphological analyzer: Figure 3 shows that in the case of POS tagging using just weak morphological features gives much better results than the baseline (i.e. using only weak features). However, it does not do as well as the rich features especially when the training size is small, thereby suggesting that an approximation of the morphological suffixes may not work for a language having rich and diverse morphology. On the other hand, in the case of chunking, the weak morphological features do marginally better than the rich morphological features suggesting that for a relatively easier task (chunking as compared to POS tagging) even a simple approximation of the actual suffixes may deliver the goods. 3. Specific case of verbs: Figure 4 shows that in case of POS tagging using suffixes as features results in a significant increase in accuracy of verbs. Specifically accuracy increases from 62% to 95% using a very small amount of annotated corpus (20K words). Comparing this with figure 5 we see that while using morphological information definitely helps other POS categories, the impact is not as high as that felt for verbs. Figures 7 and 8 for chunking show a similar pattern i.e., the accuracy of verb chunks is affected more by morphology as compared to other chunk tags. These figures support our claim that “verbs is where all the action lies” and they indeed need special treat-","VM VAUX VM 17078 347 VAUX 257 6025 Table 3: Confusion matrix for VM-VAUX using Rich-MF ment in terms of morphological analysis. 4. Effect of VGI: Figures 3 and 4 show that the VGI module does not lead to any improvement in the overall accuracy. A detailed analysis showed that this is mainly because there was not much VM-VAUX ambiguity left after applying CRF model containing rich morphological features. To further illustrate our point we present the confusion matrix (see Table 3 ) for verb tags for a POS tagger using Rich-MF. Table 3 shows that there were only 347 VM tags which got wrongly tagged as VAUX and 257 VAUX tags which got wrongly tagged as VM. Thus the rich morphological features were able to take care of most VM-VAUX ambiguities in the data. However we feel that if the data contains several VM-VAUX ambiguities such as the one illustrated in the example in Section 5.3 then the VGI module would come in play and help to boost the performance by resolving such ambiguities."]},{"title":"9 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We presented here our work on shallow parsing of a morphologically rich language- Marathi. Our results show that while dealing with such languages one cannot ignore the importance of harnessing morphological features. This is especially true for verbs where improvements upto 50% in accuracy can be obtained by adroit handling of suffixes and accurate verb group identification. An important conclusion that can be drawn from our work is that while dealing with morphologically rich languages it makes sense to invest time and money in developing powerful morphological analyzers than placing all the bets on annotating data."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Black, Ezra, Fred Jelinek, John Lafferty, Robert Mercer, and Salim Roukos. 1992.
