An alternative to the enormous cost of hand-annotating a corpus for a specific formalism is to convert from an existing corpus.","The Penn Treebank (PTB; Marcus et al., 1994) has been converted to HPSG (Miyao et al., 2004), LFG (Cahill et al., 2002), LTAG (Xia, 1999), and CCG (Hockenmaier, 2003). Dependency corpora, e.g. the German Tiger corpus, have also been converted (Hockenmaier, 2006). The Penn Chinese Treebank (PCTB; Xue et al., 2005) provides analyses for 770,000 words of Chinese. Existing PCTB conversions have targeted TAG (Chen et al., 2005) and LFG (Burke and Lam, 2004; Guo et al., 2007).","We present Chinese CCGbank, a Chinese corpus of CCG derivations automatically induced from the PCTB. Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG; Steedman, 2000) is a lexicalised grammar formalism offering a unified account of local and non-local dependencies. We harness the facilities of CCG to provide analyses of Chinese syntax includ-ing topicalisation, pro-drop, zero copula, extraction, and the 把 ba- and 被 bei-constructions.","Pushing the boundaries of formalisms by subjecting them to unfamiliar syntax also tests their universality claims. The freer word order of Turkish (Hoffman, 1996) and the complex morphology of Korean (Cha et al., 2002) led to the development of extensions to the CCG formalism.","We present our analysis of Chinese syntax under CCG, and provide an algorithm, modelled after Hockenmaier and Steedman (2007), to incrementally transform PCTB trees into CCG derivations. The algorithm assigns CCG categories which directly encode head and subcategorisation information. Instances of Chinese syntax demanding special analysis, such as extraction, pro-drop or topicalisation, are pin-pointed and given elegant analyses which exploit the expressivity of CCG.","Our conversion yields CCG analyses for 27,759 PCTB trees (98.1%). Coverage on lexical items, evaluated by 10-fold cross-validation, is 94.46% (by token) and 73.38% (by type).","We present the first CCG analysis of Chinese syntax and obtain a wide-coverage CCG corpus of Chinese. Highly efficient statistical parsing using a CCGbank has recently been demonstrated for English (Clark and Curran, 2007). Our Chinese CCGbank will enable the development of similarly efficient wide-coverage CCG parsers for Chinese."]},{"title":"2 Combinatory Categorial Grammar","paragraphs":["CCG (Steedman, 2000) is a lexicalised grammar formalism, with a transparent syntax-semantics in-terface, a flexible view of constituency enabling concise accounts of various phenomena, and a consistent account of local/non-local dependencies.","It consists of categories, which encode the type and number of arguments taken by lexical items, and combinators, which govern the possible interactions between categories."]},{"title":"1083","paragraphs":["那 部 电影 我 已经 看 过 了 that MW movie I already see EXP SFP","( / )/ ( \\ )/( \\ ) ( [ ]\\ )/ ( \\ )\\( \\ ) \\","> <B× / ( [ ]\\ )/","> ",">T >B","/( \\ ) ( [ ]\\ )/","Ttop >B","/( / ) [ ]/ > [ ] < [ ] Figure 1: Chinese CCG derivation: “That movie, I’ve already seen.”","A CCG grammar defines atomic categories, e.g. NP and S, which may be recursively constructed into complex categories, e.g. N/N and S\\NP.1 Figure 1 shows how combinators govern the interaction of categories for lexical items, while slashes specify argument directionality.","The combinators allow us to reduce lexical ambiguity, by preserving a word’s canonical category even when displaced from its canonical position. This facility is a strength of CCG, but elevates its generative power to mild context-sensitivity.","Some combinators may be disabled in a given language – the multi-modal CCG (Baldridge, 2002) allows these distinctions to be lexically specified.","Introducing non-CCG rules decrease categorial ambiguity at the expense of deviating from the formalism. Hockenmaier and Steedman (2002) show that these greatly improve lexical coverage. Their analysis of English employs non-CCG rules to coerce a verb phrase headed by a participle (category S[ng]\\NP) to a post-nominal modifier: [ ]\\ −→ \\ (1)","This frees verbs from having to possess a distinct category in each position, thus trading off lexical ambiguity for derivational ambiguity. Honnibal and Curran (2009) extended CCG with hat categories, enabling the lexical specification of these unary type-change rules.","Hockenmaier and Steedman (2002, 2007) developed CCGbank, the first wide-coverage English CCG corpus, by converting 1.2 million words from the Wall Street Journal section of the PTB.

(2005) developed the Penn Chinese Treebank (PCTB), the first syntactically annotated corpus for Chinese. The corpus includes newswire text, magazine articles, and transcribed speech.2","Xue et al. establishes several principles for a more disciplined and consistent style of annotation compared to the original PTB. These principles include complement/adjunct marking: allowing the recovery of predicate-argument structure; limited semantic role marking: the annotation of modifier phrases with semantic roles; covert argument marking: the retention of traces of arguments deleted through pro-drop; and NP internal structure: bracketing of NP structure where the in-tended interpretation is clear.","The one relation per bracketing principle unambiguously encodes a grammatical relation (chiefly, predication, adjunction, or complementation) through the configuration of a node and its children. Xue et al. developed this principle to as-sist conversions from the PTB, e.g. Hockenmaier (2003), in resolving argument/adjunct distinctions.","PCTB derivations are pre-segmented, pretokenised, and POS tagged. Owing to the dearth of morphology in Chinese, the concept of part of speech is more fluid than that of English – the word 比较 bijiao ‘compare’ might be glossed as a verb, adjective, adverb, or noun depending on its context. Noun/verb mis-taggings are a frequent error case for PCFG parsing on PCTB data, compounded in Chinese by the lack of function words and morphology (Levy and Manning, 2003). This ambiguity is better handled by the adaptive multitagging approach used by Clark and Curran (2007) for CCG supertagging, in which each lexical item is tagged with a set of CCG categories.","We present our CCG analysis of Chinese syntax below, followed by our conversion algorithm.","2","We use the Penn Chinese Treebank 6.0 (LDC2007T36)."]},{"title":"1084 4 The syntax of Chinese 4.1 Basic clause structure","paragraphs":["Chinese is typologically SVO, with some OV elements (relative clauses, adjunct PPs and noun modifiers precede their heads).

In Mandarin, topicalisation manifests as left-dislocation of the topic phrase (Li and Thompson, 1989). We distinguish gap and non-gap topicalisation depending on whether the topic is co-referent with a gap in the sentence.3","For gapped topicalisation (cf. Figure 1), we adopt the Steedman (1987) topicalisation analysis: → /( / ) for parametrically licensed (3) For non-gap topicalisation (Example 5), we use a variation of the analysis described in Hockenmaier and Steedman (2005), which treats the topicalised constituent as a sentential modifier. Under this analysis, the determiner in a topicalised NP receives (S/S)/N instead of its canonical category NP/N. Instead, we propose a unary rule: → / for topicalisation candidate (4) This delays the coercion to sentential modifier type (i.e. NP → S/S) until after the NP has been consolidated, allowing the words under the topicalised NP to preserve their canonical categories.","3","Non-gap topicalisation is also known as the double subject construction (Li and Thompson, 1989).","(5) (As for) trade, it has developed rapidly. 贸易 发展 很 快 trade development very fast /","T >T > / /( \\ ) \\ >  > ","Topicalisation is far less marked in Chinese than in English, and the structure of topicalised constituents is potentially quite complex. The additional categorial ambiguity in Hockenmaier and Steedman (2005) compounds the data sparsity problem, leading us to prefer the unary rule. 4.3 Pro-drop Since Chinese exhibits radical pro-drop (Neeleman and Szendr}oi, 2007), in which the viability of the pro-drop is not conditioned on the verb, the categorial ambiguity resulting from providing an additional argument-dropped category for every verb is prohibitive.","Rather than engendering sparsity on verbal categories, we prefer derivational ambiguity by choos-ing the unary rule analysis S[dcl] | NP → S[dcl] to capture Chinese pro-drop. 4.4 Zero copula Although the Chinese copula 是 shi is obligatory when equating NPs, it may be omitted when equating an NP and a QP or PP (Tiee and Lance, 1986).4","(6) 她 NP 3SG 今年 VP/VP this-year 十八 (S\\NP)/M 18 岁 M years-old She is 18 this year.","A solution involving a binary rule NP QP → S[dcl] is not properly headed, and thus violates the Principle of Lexical Head Government (Steedman, 2000). Conversely, a solution where, for example, 十八 ‘18’ would have to receive the category (S[dcl]\\NP)/M instead of its canonical category QP/M would lead to both data sparsity and over-generation, with VP modifiers becoming able to modify the QP directly. Tentatively, we ignore the data sparsity consequences, and have 十八 ‘18’ receive the category (S[dcl]\\NP)/M in this context.","4","The copula is ungrammatical in predication on an adjectival verb, such as 高兴 ‘happy’.

Although superficially similar, the resulting constructions exhibit distinct syntax, as our CCG analysis reflects and clarifies.","In the 被 bei-construction, the patient argument of a verb moves to subject position, while the agent either becomes the complement of a particle 被 bei (the long passive), or disappears (the short passive; Yip and Rimmington, 1997). Although the two constructions are superficially similar (apparently differing only by the deletion of the agent NP), they behave differently in more complex contexts (Huang et al., 2008).","The long passive occurs with or without an object gap (deleted by identity with the subject of the matrix verb). We analyse this construction by assigning 被 bei a category which permutes the surface positions of the agent and patient. Co-indexation of heads allows us to express long-distance dependencies.","Bei receives ((S\\NPy)/((S\\NPx)/NPy))/NPx in the gapped case (cf.

Our analysis agrees with Huang et al. (2008)’s observation that short-bei is isomorphic to English tough-movement: our short-bei category is the same as Hockenmaier and Steedman (2005)’s category for English tough-adjectives.","In the 把 ba construction, a direct object becomes the complement of the morpheme 把 ba, and gains semantics related to “being affected, dealt with, or disposed of” (Huang et al., 2008).

Table 1 lists the types distinguished by the PCTB, and the headedness we assign to compounds of each type.","Modifier-head compounds (PCTB tag VSB) exhibit clear head-final semantics, with the first verb 1 causally or temporally preceding 2. Verb coordination compounds (VCD) project multiple heads, like ordinary lexical coordination.","In a resultative compound (VRD), the result or direction of 1 is indicated by 2, which we treat as a post-verbal modifier. The V-not-V construction (VNV) forms a yes/no question where 1 = 2. In the V-bu/de-V or potential verb construction (VPT), a disyllabic verb = 1 2 receives the infix 得 de or 不 bu with the meaning can/cannot . In both these cases, it is the infixed particle 得 de or 不 bu which collects its arguments on either side. 4.7 Extraction In the Chinese relative clause construction, the particle 的 de links a sentence with a subject or object gap with a NP to which that gap co-refers, in an analysis similar to the English construction described by Hockenmaier and Steedman (2005), mediated by the relative pronoun that.","As in the English object extraction case, forward type-raising on the subject argument, and forward composition into the verbal category allows us to obtain the correct object gap category S/NP."]},{"title":"1086 4.8 Right node raising","paragraphs":["Two coordinated verbs may share one or more contiguous arguments under right node raising.

As a result, 68% of non-trace NPs in PCTB have only a flat bracketing.","We assume that the internal structure of flat NPs is right-branching and head-final (Li and Thompson, 1989), following Hockenmaier and Steedman (2005), who assume this structure for English. A re-analysis of PCTB, like Vadas and Curran (2007) for the PTB, could restore this structure, and allow our conversion algorithm to yield the correct CCG analysis with no further modifications.","To obtain this default analysis, each node under NP internal structure receives the marker n, except the the final node, the head, which receives N. 5.2 Binarisation CCG combinators take at most two categories, in-ducing binary derivation trees. As such, PCTB trees must be re-shaped to accommodate a CCG analysis.","Our markers control the shape of the binarised structure: head-initial complementation yields a left-branching tree, while head-final complementation, adjunction, predication, coordination, and NP internal structure all yield right-branching trees.

Atomic categories The chosen mapping from PCTB tags to categories defines the atomic category set for the grammar. The richer representation in CCG categories permits some constituents to be expressed using a smaller set of atoms (e.g. an adjective is simply a noun modifier – N/N). Despite their critical importance in controlling the degree of under-/over-generation in the corpus, little guidance exists as to the selec-tion of atomic categories in a CCG grammar. We observed the following principles:","Modifier proliferation: when two classes of words can be modified by the same class of modifiers, they should receive a single category;","Over-generation: the atom set should not overgeneralise to accept ungrammatical examples;","Efficiency: the representation may be motivated by the needs of applications such as parsers.","Table 2 shows the eight atomic categories chosen for our corpus. Two of these categories: LCP (localisers) and M (measure words) have variously been argued to be special sub-classes of nouns (Huang et al., 2008). However, based on our overgeneration criterion, we decided to represent these as atomic categories.","We adopt the bare/non-bare noun distinction from Hockenmaier and Steedman (2007) on parsing efficiency grounds.

Labelling algorithm We developed a recursive algorithm which applies one of several labelling functions based on the markers on a node and its children.","The algorithm proceeds top-down and assigns a CCG category to every node. The markers on a node’s children are matched against the schema of Table 3, applying the categories of the matching schema to the children. The algorithm is then called recursively on each child.

Since CCG aims to provide a transparent interface between surface string syntax and semantics, traces are expressly disallowed (Steedman, 2000). Hence, we eliminate traces from the annotation, by devising alternate analyses in terms of categories and combinatory rules.

Hockenmaier and Steedman (2001) showed that formalisms with rich tagsets, such as CCG, are particularly sensitive to this sparsity – while a lexical item may be attested in the training data, it may lack the necessary category.","We divided the 27,759 valid derivations into ten contiguous sections, performing ten-fold crossvalidation to determine the coverage of lexical items and CCG categories in the resulting corpus.","Average coverage on lexical items is 73.38%, while average coverage on categories is 88.13%. 94.46% of token types from the held-out set are found in the training set. These figures compare to 86.7% lexical coverage (by type) and 92% (by token) in German CCGbank (Hockenmaier, 2006). Although lexical coverage by token is comparable to the German corpus, we observe a marked difference in coverage by type.","To explain this, we examine the most frequent POS tags among the missing tokens.

The 100 most frequent missing tokens across the ten folds comprise 48 NR tokens, 46 NR, 3 NT (temporal nouns), 2 JJ (adjectives) and one VA (verbal adjective). Personal names are also not tokenised into surnames and forenames in the PCTB, increasing unseen NR tokens.","The missing VVs (verbs) include 1342 fourcharacter compounds, fossilised idiomatic expressions which are considered atomic verbs in the PCTB annotation.
