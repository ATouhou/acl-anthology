What is required is something that supports traditional IR models (such as the vector space model), graph mining and probabilistic graphical models. We have formulated a representation referred to as concept association graphs (CAG). Figure 1 illustrates a small portion of CAG that has been constructed based on processing the 9/11 commission report1","in the counterterrorism domain. The inputs for this module are paths for data collection and domain-specific dictionary containing concepts. In our experiments, we extract as concepts all named entities, as well as any noun or noun phrases participating in Subject-Verb-Object relationships. Domain ontological links are also illustrated, e.g., white house is a type of organization.   Figure 1. Portion of the CAG","2.2 Concept profile (CP) and snippet cluster generation A concept profile (CP) is essentially a set of terms that together represent the corresponding concept. We generate concept profiles by adapting the Local Context Analysis technique in Information Retrieval and then integrate them into the graphical framework (Jin et al., 2007).  1 http://www.9-11commission.gov/ Particularly, the CP for concept c is built by first identifying a relevant set of text segments from the corpus in which concept c occurs, and then identifying characteristic concepts from this set and assessing their relative importance as descriptors of concept c. Formally, the profile Profile(ci) for concept ci is described by a set of its related concepts ck as follows:"," },,,,{)(Pr ,22,11, LL kkiiii ccccofile ωωω=","","Weight ωi,k denotes the relative importance of ck as an indicator of concept ci and is calculated as follows:"," n idfkif k ki log )),(log( ,","× += ξω","","Where n is the number of relevant text segments considered for concept ci (in our experiments, the basic unit of segmentation is a sentence). The function f (i, k) quantifies the correlation between concept ci and concept ck and is given by "]},{"title":"∑","paragraphs":["= ×= n j jkji sfsfkif 1 ,,),( ","Where sfi,j is the frequency of concept ci in the j-th sentence and sfk,j is the frequency of concept ck in the j-th sentence. This can be easily computed by constructing “concept by sentence” matrix Q whose entry Qi,j is the number of times concept ci occurs in sentence sj. (QQT",")ij then represents the number of times concepts ci and cj co-occur in sentences across the corpus. The in-verse document frequency factor is computed as"," ) /log ,1max( λ k k","npN idf =","Where N is the number of sentences in the document collection, npk is the number of sentences containing concept ck. λ is a collection dependent parameter (in the experiments λ=3). The factor ζ is a constant parameter which avoids a value equals to zero for wi,k (which is useful, for instance, if the approach is to be used with probabilistic framework). Usually, ζ is a small factor with values close to 0.1. Table 1 illustrates a portion of the CP constructed for concept Bin 30 Ladin. The best concepts are shown based on their relative importance.

If a concept X is related to another concept Y which has a similar context as that of X, then such a relation can be coherent and meaningful. More precisely, a scalar profile similarity matrix Si,j is defined as follows:  )()̂(̂)()̂(ˆ , ji ji ji cCcC cCcC S ×","• = ","Where Ĉ(ci) and Ĉ(cj) are profile vectors for concepts ci and cj respectively. In terms of text mining and knowledge discovery, we also require the graphical representation relate concepts and associations to underlying text snippets in the corpus. Without this support, the framework is not complete since users need to validate conclusions by looking at actual documents. This is achieved by associating each edge with a Snippet Cluster, which links the snippets (e.g., sentences) in the corpus to the corresponding associations (e.g., co-occurrence of concepts in sentences) represented by edges in the CAG. The resulting snippet clusters offer a view of the document collection which is highly characterized by the presence of concept associations (illustrated in Fig. 1).","2.3 Concept Chain Generation and Rank-ing Given two concepts of interest designated, concept chain query (CCQ) tries to find if (i) there is a direct connection (association) between them, or (ii) if they can be connected by several intermediate concepts (paths). Note that finding direct links between two concepts is trivial; in the following we mainly focus on discovering and ranking indirect connections between concepts.","We formulate the CCQ problem as finding optimized transitive associations between concepts in the CAG. Given the source concept c1 and destination concept cn, the transitive strength of a path from c1 to cn made up of the links {(c1, c2), ... , (cn-1, cn)}, denoted by TS(c1, c2 ,... ,cn), is given by:",")),((),,,( 11","121 +−","=∏= iin","in ccwcccTS L","Where w(ci, ci+1) represents the weight of the edge connecting concepts ci and ci+1. The formulation of generating and ranking transitive associations is then described as follows with input and output constraints specified:","Given: an edge-weighted graph CAG, vertices s and t from CAG, and an integer budget l","Find: ranked lists of concept chains CCs star-ing from s and ending at t, one list for each possible length (i.e., between the shortest connection length and the specified maximum length l). Within each list, top-K chains that maximize the “goodness” function TS(·) is returned.","Our optimization problem is now to find an optimal path that maximizes the “goodness” measure for each possible length. This could be easily computed using dynamic programming given the inductive definition of the goodness function TS(·). Notice that in real applications there are often cases that users might be interested in exploring more potential chains instead of just one optimal chain, we have thus adapted the traditional dynamic programming algorithm into finding top-K chains connecting concepts for each possible length efficiently. The details of algorithm and implementation can be found in (Jin et al , 2007)."]},{"title":"3 The System Interface","paragraphs":["Figure 2 illustrates the main HCAMiner visualization interface.

This view provides the profile information for any concept in-volved in the generated chains.

Different from traditional search, we interpret such a query as finding the most meaningful concept chains across documents that connect these two concepts. Specifically, the system generates ranked concept chains where the key terms representing significant relationships between concepts are ranked high. The discovered novel but non-obvious cross-document links are the candidates for hypothesis generation, which is a crucial initial step for making discoveries.","We are now researching extensions of concept chains to concept graph queries. This will enable users to quickly generate hypotheses graphs which are specific to a corpus. These matched instances can then be used to look for other, similar scenarios. Ontology guided graph search is another focus of future work."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Jin, Wei, Rohini K. Srihari, and Hung Hay Ho. 2007.
