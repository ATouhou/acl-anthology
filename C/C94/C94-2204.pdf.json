INTRODUCTION","paragraphs":["Describing objects is one of several purposes for which linguists use fe.at, ul:e structures. A description is an er, tity that can be interpreted as true or false of an object. For example, the conventional interpretation of the description 'it is black' is true of a soot particle, but false of ~ snowtlake, q'herefore, any use of a feature structure to describe an object delnands that the feature structure can be interpreted as true or false of the object. In this paper, I tailor the semantics of [K~NG 1 989] to suit the typed feature structures of [CAII.I'F, NTFA{ 1 992], and so create an explicit interpretation of a typed feature structure used as a descript, ion. I then use this interpretation to define the notion of a satisfiable feature structure. Though no featm'e structure algebra provides descriptions as expressive as those provided by a feature logic, using feature structures to describe objects profits from a large stock of available computational techniques to represent, test and process feature structures. In this paper, I demonstrate the computational benefits of marrying a tractable syntax and an explicit semantics by creating a simple and effective algorithm to decide the satisfiability","*The research presented in this paper was sl)on-sored by ']'eilprojekt B4 \"Constraints on (h'ammar for Efficient Generation\" cff the Sonderforschungsbereich 340 of the Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschafL I also wish to thank Bob Carpenter, Dale (lerdemmm, q'hile) GStz and Jennifer King for their invalualAe hel l) with this paper.","tWilhehnst.r. 113, 72t17,1 ~l~{ilfingen, (]el'Ill[|fly.
