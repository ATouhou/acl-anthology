The system first extracts the rhetorical structure, the compound of the rhetorical relations between sentences, and then cuts out less important parts in the extracted structure to generate an abstract of the desired length. Evaluation of the generated abstract showed that it contains at maximum 74% of the most important sentences of the original text. The system is now utilized as a text browser for a prototypicaI interactive document retrieval system. 2 I N T R O D U C T I O N Abstract generation is, like Machine Translation, one of the ultimate goal of Natural Language Processing. IIowever, since conventional word-frequency-based abstract generation systems(e.g. [Kuhn 58]) are lacking in inter-sentential or discourse-structural analysis, they are liable to generate incoherent abstracts. On the other hand, conventional knowledge or script-based abstract generation systems(e.g. [behnert 801, [Fum 86]), owe their success to the li,n-itation of the domain, and cannot be applied to document with varied subjects, such ,as popular scientific magazine. To realize a domain-independent abstract generation system, a computational theory for analyzing linguistic discourse structure and its practical procedure must be established.","ltobbs developed a theory in which lie arranged three kinds of relationships between sentences from the text coherency viewpoint [Hobbs 79].","Grosz and Sidner proposed a theory which accounted for interactions between three notions on discourse: linguistic structure, intention, and atten-tion [C, rosz et al. 86].","l,itman and Allen described a model in which a discourse structure of conversation was built by recognizing a participanUs plans [Litman et al. 87]. 'l'hese theories all depend on extra-linguistic knowledge, the accumulation of which presents a problem in the realization of a practical analyzer.","Cohen proposed a framework for analyzing the structure of argumentative discourse [Cohen 87], yet did not provkle a concrete identification procedure for 'evidence' relationships between sentences, where no linguistic clues indicate the relationships. Also, since only relationships between successive sentences were considered, the scope which the relationships cover cannot be analyzed, even if explicit connectives are detected.","Mama and Thompson proposed a linguistic structure of text describing relationships between sentences and their relative importance [Mann et al. 87]. llowever, no method for extracting the relationships from superficial linguistic expressions was described in their paper.","We have developed a computational rnodel of discourse for Japanese expository writings, and implemented a practical procedure for extracting discourse structure[Sumita 92].

First, unlike conventional word-frequency-based abstract generation systems(e.g. [Kuhn 58]), the geuerated abstract is consistent with the original text in that the connectives between sentences in the abstract reflect their relation in the original text. Second, once the rhetorical structure is obtained, varions lengths of generated abstracts can be generated easily. This can be done by simply repeating the reduction process until one gets the desired length of abstract. Third, unlike conventional knowledge or script-bÃ sed abstr,~t generation systems(e.g. [Lehnert 80], [Fum 86]), the rhetorical structure extraction does not need prepared knowledge or scripts related to the original text , aud can be used for texts of any domain , so long as they contain enongh rhetoricM expressions to be expository writings.
