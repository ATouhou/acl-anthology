Research on reference began with the development of models to account for nominal reference bronght about by the usage of nominal expressions such as definite noun phrases and pronominals (Grosz, Joshi and Weinstein 1983; Kameyama 1986). Recently a number of researchers have indicated that temporal expressions such as tense morphemes and temporal adverbials can be regarded as referring expressions and have proposed models for temporal reference resolution (Hinrichs 1986; Hwang and Schubert 1992; Kameyama, Passonnean and Poesio 1993; Lascarides 1.992; Partee 1984; Song and Cohen 1991; Webber 1988).","Sentences in a dialogue describe eventualities 1 and introduce them into the context. The time of an eventuality described by a sentence is interpreted as temporally related to the times of other eventualities that were introduced into the context earlier in the dialogue. Temporal expressions are regarded as referring expressions since they convey information about the time of an eventuality, which is interpreted relative to the times of other eventualities in the context. Resolving temporal reference means determining what temporal relationships exist between an eventuality described by a sentence of a dialogue and eventualities that have been introduced into the context earlier in the dialogue. 2 Resolving temporal reference is requisite to many tasks, such as designing a natural language interface to a planning system in which temporal information is crucial (Crouch and Pullman","tan event.uality is the general term for an event, process or state, due to Bach (1986).","~The chief concern here is temporal reference to intersentential context. Thus this paper does not address the probiem of determining what temporal relationships an eventuality described by a clause of a sent, ence has with eventualities described by other clauses of the same sentence. This problem is covered by Brent (1990), Itwang et al. (1992), and Reichenbaeh (1947)."]},{"title":"1993).","paragraphs":["To understand the notion of temporal reference, consider the following dialogue, (dl). a Assume tha~ dialogue participants, Bill and John, mutually know that John received an e-mail message from Mary.

I focus on sentences with past-tense morphemes in Japanese dialogues. Previous work also used past-tense sentences as a touchstone to show the validity of a model (IIinrichs 1986; Kameyama ct al. 1993; Lascarides 1992; Partee 1984; Webber 1988).

'['he time, 51', of an eventuality described by the cnrrent sentence is interpreted according to the time, Ttf, in the temporal focus. Existing models that apply to intersentential context use the notion of temporal focus (llwang el el, 1992; Song ct el. 19911. Kameyama et el. (1993) refined the. notion of temporal focus and proposed the notion of temporal centering. In formal semantics, models of temporal anaphora based on discourse representation theory have been proposed (ltinrichs 7198{3; Partee 1984).

Lascarides (1.9!t2) presented a model based on a theory of defeasihle inference for integrating world knowledge of causality with the process of determining the temporal and causal relationships between even tualities mentioned in a discourse. This approach was also adopted in a model proposed by Kameyama ct el. (1993). In these models, approaches (ii-~) and (ii-b) are unified within a single framework. Let me call the interpretation based on approach (ii-a) the (lefanlt interpretation, and the interpretation based on approach (ii-b) the knowledge-based interpretation. The knowledge~based interpretation is preferred over the default interpretation when they disagree.","l,et me explain how existing models work by using (tialogue (dl) ~ as, example. 1 focus on how (s4) i,, interpreted, assuming that the time of /~'a is in the. temporal focus, l)eNnlt interpretation rule (hi.l) says that the Lime of ]Q must be after the time of lea sittce both eventualities are not>stative, past eventualities.

However, existing models do not explain how the process of resolving nominal reference affects the process of resolving temporal reference and assume that the entire set of knowledge of causality can be used."]},{"title":"2.2 Reference interaction","paragraphs":["In this section, I argue that the notion of reference interaction provides an account of the temporal reference in (s4), which existing approaches ignore. More-over, a restricted set of world knowledge can be used to explain the reference interaction.","Sentence (sl) introduces an individual 6, M, which is an e-mail message. Sentence (s4) involves nominal reference to M: tile object of \"tensousnrn (forward)\" is zero-pronominalized and refers to M. Moreover, sentence (s4) involves the interaction between nominal and temporal reference. That is to say, what the object being forwarded is affects what the time of forwarding is. I will explain this below.","When someone forwards something to someone else, the time of forwarding must be during the time when the object being forwarded exists. In other words, the time of forwarding depends on what the object being forwarded is. Moreover, when someone deletes something, the time when the object being deleted exists must be before the time of deleting. This kind of world knowledge can be regarded as knowledge of temporal relationships between eventualities and the existential status of individuals. Judg-ing fi:om such knowledge, the eventuality of forwarding, EI, cannot temporally follows the eventuality of deleting, Ea. This is because both the object of \"kesu (delete)\" and the object of \"tensousuru (for-ward)\"refer to M, so the time of t~'f must be during the time when M exists and the time when M exists rnust be before the time of Ed, The interpretation consistent with such knowledge is that /~Sf temporally precedes Ea. Consequently, identifying the referent of the zero-pronominalized object of/Q serves to resolve temporal reference, and the knowledge of temporal relationships between eventualities and the existential status of individuals can be used to explain the reference interaction. 7","Moreover, knowledge of the temporal relationships between eventualities and the existential status of in-dividnals can be regarded as a restricted set of world knowledge of causality. It is restricted because given an eventuality, E, we have only to allow for the individuals that constitute E and do not have to allow °flere, \"individual\" is used as a term for a single person or thing. 7In this paper, only nominal reference to individuals is allowed for. for all eventualities that can be causally related to E. Exploiting the reference interaction clarifies how such a restricted set of world knowledge contributes to resolving temporal reference. When such restricted world knowledge is sufficient to resolve temporal reference, immediate recourse to the entire set of world knowledge of causality call be avoided. Note that such knowledge is not selected arbitrarily. It is the knowledge that is necessary for explaining the reference interaction.","Next I review two existing proposals that are related to the argument above. First, Hwang el al. (1992) argued that resolving temporal reference requires plausible inference that can interact with various processes such as resolution of anaphora, introduction of new individuals and identification of spa-tial and temporal frames. They also argue that the plausible inference has to rely on world knowledge such as that one normally would not buy broken things (IIwang e¢ al. 1992: p.239). Their argument agrees with the approach presented here. They did not, however, present a concrete model to support the argument.","Second, Webber and Baldwin (1992) discussed the integration of two independent mechanisms for context-change by entity introduction and by event simulation. The idea of integrating these context-change mechanisms and that of exploiting the reference interaction in resolving reference share the view that the relationships between eventualities and the existential status of entities or individuals serve in interpreting referring expressions. They, however, focused on interpreting nominal reference made by the use of definite nouns, rather than on the problem of resolving temporal reference by exploiting the reference interaction, which is the chief concern of this paper.","Finally, it is easy to see that the reference interaction also occurs in an English dialogue. In an English counterpart of (dl), the pronoun \"it\" is used the same way as a Japanese zero pronoun is used. l,ikewise, the restricted knowledge stated above is common to Japanese and English."]},{"title":"3 A FRAMEWORK","paragraphs":["A framework is presented, within which the reference interaction is exploited in resolving temporal reference.

First, an account of the role played by the reference interaction in resolving temporal reference is given. As stated in see. 2, existing models cannot account for how the process of resolving nominal reference affects the process of resolving temporal reference since they do not explain the reference interaction. Second, it is shown that exploiting the reference interaction clarifies how a restricted set of world knowledge (knowledge of the temporal relationships between eventualities and the existential status of individuals) contributes to the resolution process. As stated in see. 2, existing models resort to the entire set of causality knowledge. I do not entirely deny the validity of the existing approach. However, when a restricted set of world knowledge is sufficient to resolve temporal reference, immediate recourse to the entire set of world knowledge of causality can be avoided. A framework is also presented, within which temporal reference is resolved by exploiting the reference interaction.","Future work will first extend the framework to deal with eventualities specified by various tense morphemes, whereas this paper focuses on eventualities specified by the past-tense morpheme \"ta\". Next, to explore the notion of reference interaction in more detail, the way resolving temporal reference affects the resolution of nominal reference must be investigated, whereas this paper concentrates on the converse process. Finally, the coverage of this framework must be evaluated. Evaluation will require an exhaustive list-ing of possible cases of the existential status of individuals that are used to resolve reference. This paper accounts for cases where an individual exists at a certain space-time location of the physical world. We can allow for other kinds of existential status, such as a status where an individuM exists in the mental state of a dialogue participant. 11"]},{"title":"REFERENCE","paragraphs":["Allen, J. F.
