Major processing steps of example-based approach are: 1) collect examples and the results of performing the task in a database, 2) given an input, retrieve similar examples from the database, 3) adapt the results of tile similar examples to the current input and obtain the output.","Compared with the traditional rule-based approach, example-based approach has advantages like: 1) it is easier to maintain the implemented system, since once the system is constructed, the performance can be improved just by adding new examples, 2) finer-grained syntactic and semantic discrimination can be expected just by adopting finer-grained similarity measure between the input and the example. ht almost all the previous fl'ameworks of example-based NLP, it is necessary to calculate similarity values for all the examples in the database in order to find the most similar one, and this is called"]},{"title":"full retrieval.","paragraphs":["Usually, the computational cost of example retrieval causes a severe problem, because the retrieval time increases in proportion to the number of examples in the database.","This paper proposes a novel method for avoiding flfll retrieval.
