The approach builds on tile ttleory of discourse segment (Nomoto and Nitta, 1993), incorporating ideas from the research on information retrieval (Salton, 1988). A discourse segment has to do with a structure of Japanese discourse; it could be thought of as a linguistic unit delnarcated by wa, a Japanese topic particle, which may extend over several sentences. The segmentation works with discourse segments and makes use of coherence measure ba~scd on tfidf, a standard information retrieval measurement (Salton, 1988; IIearst, 1993). Experi,nents have been done with a Japanese newspaper corpus. It has been found that the present approach is quite sucecssfld in recovering articles fronl tile unstructured corpus."]},{"title":"Introduction","paragraphs":["In this paper, we describe a method for discovering coherent texts from the unstructured corpus."]},{"title":"The","paragraphs":["method is both linguistically and statistically motivated. It derives a linguistic motivation front the view that discourse consists of what we call discourse segments, minimal coherent mtits of discourse (Nomoto and Nitta, 1993), while statistically it is guided by ideas from intbrmatiou retrieval (Salton, 1988). Previous quantitative approaches to text segmentation (Hearst, 1993; Kozima, 1993; Youmans, 1991) have paid little attention to a statistically important structure that a discourse might have and detined it away ~Ls a lump of words or sentences. 1'art of our concern here is with explicating possible effects of a discourse segment on the quantitative structuring of discourse.","In what follows, we will describe some important features about discourse segment and see how it can be incorporated into a statistical analysis of discourse. Also some comparison is made with other apl)roaches such as (Youmans, 1991), followed by discussion on the results of the present method."]},{"title":"Theory of Discourse Segment","paragraphs":["The theory of discourse seF, ment (Nomoto a.nd Nitta, *2520 |tatoyama Saitama 350-03 Japan tel. +81-492-9C~6111 fax. +81-492-9(~-6006 1993) carries with it a set of empirical hypotheses about structure of Japanese discourse.

In particular, Japanese haz a special way of marking the topic: by sutllxing it with a postpositionM particle wa. Thus in Japanese, a topic-comment structure takes the form: topic comment where \"*\" represents a word. The comment part could become quite long, extending over quite a few sentences (Mikami, 1960). Now Japanese provides for a variety of ways to mark off a topic-comment structure; the wa-marking is one such and a typographical device such as a line- or a page-break is another. For the present discussiou, we take a discourse segment to bca block of sentences bounded by a text break and/or a wa-marked element."]},{"title":"I T1 ~'1 5'2 \"'' Sn [ ~t~2 Sn-F1 Sn+2 ' \"\" Sn-Frn ],","paragraphs":["Discourse Segment Discourse Segment where \"T\" denotes a boundary marker, \"S\" a sentence, and \"[\" a segment gap.

Thus a discourse should look like Figure 1, where G denotes a discourse segment. Fnrthermore, we do not intend the dis-D Figure 1: Discourse Structure course structure to be anything close to the ones that rhetorical theories of discourse (tIovy, 1990; Mann and Tholnpson, 1987; Itobbs, 1979) claim it to be, or inteulional structure (Grosz and Sidner, 1986) ; indeed we do not assmne any functional relation, i.e. causation, elaboration, extension, etc., among the segments that constitute a discourse structure. The present theory is not so much about the rhetoric or the function of discourse as about the way anaphora are interpreted.","It is quite possible that a set of discourse segments are not aggregated into a single discourse but may have diverse discourse groupings (Nomoto and Nitta, 1993). This happens when discourses are interleaved or embedded into some other. An interleaving or an embedding of discourse is often invoked by changes in narrative mode such as direct/indirect speech, quoting, or interruption; which will cue the reader/hearer to suspend a current discourse flow, start another, or resume the interrupted discourse."]},{"title":"A Quantitative Structuring of Discourse","paragraphs":["Vector Space Model Formally, a discourse segment is represented as a lerm vector of the form: Gi = (gil, gi2, gi3 .... ,git) where a..qi represents a nominal occurrence in Gi. Ill the information retrieval terms, what happens here is that a discourse segment Gi is indexed with a set of terms gll through tit; namely, we characterize Gi with a set of indices gil,... ,tit. A term vector can either be binary, where each term in the w~'ctor takes 0 or 1, i.e., absence or presence, or weighted, where a term is assigned to a certain importance value. In general, the weighted indexing is preferable to the biuary indexing, as the latter policy is known to have problems with precision (Salton, 1988) 2. The weighting policy that we will adopt is known as If. idf It is an indicator of term importance Wij defined by:","N wij .= t fij * log ~j","2 Precision measures the proportioi1 of correct items retrieved against the total number of retrieved items. where tf (term frequency) is the number of occurrences of a term Tj in a document Di; df (document frequency) is tile number of documents in a collection of N documents in which 7) occurs; and the importance, wljis given ~s the product of if and the inverse dffactor ,or idf, log N/dfi. With the tf idfpolicy, high-frequency terms that are scattered evenly over the entire documents collection are considered to be less important than those that are frequent but whose occurrences are concentrated in particnlar documents 3. Thus the tf.idfindexing favors rare words, which distinguish the documents more effectively than common words.","With the indexing method in place, it is now possible to define the cohercnce between two term vectors. For term vectors X = (xl,x~,...,x~) and Y = (Yt, Y2,..., Yt), let the coherence be defined by: t","/=1 C(X,Y) = t t i-.~1 4=1 where w(xi) represents a tfidf weight assigned to the term xi. The measure is known as Dice coefficienl 4. Experiments Earlier quantitative approaches to text partitioning (Youmans, 1991; Kozima, 1993; Ilearst, 1993) work with an arbitrary block of words or sentences to determine a strneture of discourse. In contrast, we work with a block of discourse segments. It is straightforward to apply the tfidf to the analysis of discourse; one may just treat a block of discourse segments as a document unit by itself and then define the term frequency (t J), the document fi'equency (dJ), and the size of docmnents collcction (N), accordingly. Coherence would then be determined by the number of terms segment blocks share and tf.idf weights the terms carry. Thus one pair of blocks will become more cohesive than auother if the pair share more of the terms that arc locally frequent.","The partitioning proceeds in two steps. We start with the following:","1. Collect all the nominal occurrences found in a corpus 5","2. Divide the collection into disjoint discourse seglrlents.","3. Compare all pairs of adjacent blocks of discourse segments.","3 Precision depends on the size of docmnents coLLection; as the collection get, s smaller in size, index ternls become less extensive and more discriminatory.
