We call this inethod of looking up ECs in the inverse dictionaries when choosing relevant equivalencies inverse consultation, and we call the words obtained by looking up inverse dictionaries the selection area (SA). Inverse consultation utilizes the. structure of dictionaries to measure the nearness of the meanings of words in (tiff>rent languages. The simplest application of inverse consultation is to use Dic~_,~. In the above example, each EC is looked up in Dict_,e and the results are compared with the English equivalencies of \")~'6\"\" (E); namely, competition, contest, and race. The SA of eompdtitlon is competition, contest and match, which have tile elements contest and competition in common with E (Fig. 2). As compdtition derived from competition, competition should be put aside, but contest is still left as a common element and thus compdtition is selected as an equivalence of '\"~(P\"'. As for race, the SA of race consists of race and ancestry, whose intersection with E only gives race; so race is judged as an inadequate EC. In shorl;, the number of elements in common between the selection area and E indicates the nearness of the meaning between the EC and the original word.","For the inverse consultation (lmseril)ed above, the SA was in English.

We (:all this process the selection p'roced.ure. One way to do this is to count the mnnber of specific element:s in the SA. For example, if the SA is in Japanesc', the number of l.he element \"\"~¢~d @\"' itself is counted. Another way is to count how many parts of words (PWs) are eontMnmd in the SA. \" ~a and \"¢6\" [ or exaulple, the number o[' \"\"'~:\" contained in the SA is considered (thus \"\" ..... ~ in \"~j~'~\" iS ;dSO collnl;ed).","If we handle the meaning of words, a third way",".v)¢.~ ~ in ;t Japalmse Lhesaurns an(1 is to look up ' *'~-\" COllar how nlal]y times the synottynls ai)i)ear in the $A.

If we go further to h;mdle the meaning, we might as well process words by semantic processing.","Since a kanji is an ideogram, the second method also handles the meaning. When 1;11o s(,qection area is in English or l\"rench, the eorresi)on(ting me.tlm(1 is to count morphemes such as \"inl;er\" and \"national\" for the word \"int0.rnationar'. W(; are interested in to what extent the method that does not (;xplicitly concern the meaning may be used to handle the me,ruing of words, lln |;11(; for lowing, we. focus on 1;11(; former two inethods. 29B 3 Fundamental Concepts 3.1. Harmonized Dictionary A bilingual dictionary forms a grN)h whose nodes are words and whose })ranches are correspondences between the words. Branchc's haw; directions, which make the graph asymmetric. D:ic.,(1,g is a graph with all the tn'anches in Dic> 'v in inverse direction.","Since the purpose of bilingual dictionaries is to denote the correspondences of words that have the same meaning [tIar83], it; is Iud.ura] that branches ~re bidirectional. We t;herefore design symmetrical dictionaries and we denote, a di(:tionary from hmguage :c to y as D .... u ,calling it; ;t harmonized dictiona'uI. When D,._ ,,/and D:j ,~, are construc~;e(1 fi'om the same dictionaries, D!t.**=: DTly holds. We remove the overlaps of branches. 3.2 Syntactic Selection Procedure A multiset here is a set in which each element: has :~ weight that is a m~tural nmnl)er.

Of the latter, some examples are listed in Table 5 and 6. For distique in Table 5, which is a term in French literature, De~j translates it into the term for the corresponding kind of Japanese literature. Although it resembles to the direct translation of distique, it is only an analogy. On the other hand, since the direct translation of distlque in the published dictionary adopts the concept of French imems, it is uncommon and cannot be mttlerstoo(1 ])y iilOSl; Japanese readers. The same is true for boulier except that the commml Japanese is indicated in a published dictionary. Pull is borrowed front the English word pull-over whose direct translation is contained in a published dictionary, and it is not a common word in Japanese.","In the first example in Table 6, grive is the generic name equivalent to th rush, whereas merle is a kind of thrush. The second example shows that more equivalencies are found in Dj_d.","To sum up, the resulting dictionary can be utilized in conjunction with the published (tictionar-ies as follows: • To revise the equiwdeneies. • To supplement the equivaleneies.","Sections of the resulting dictionaries is listed in Table 7. List 1 is Dj_~, and List 2 is D,+j. For each list, entrie.s arc in t;he first row and their equiwdeneies are in the third row. Symbols in the. second row indicate how approI/riate each equivalence is. (Refer to t, he notes beside.) 6 Related Work The use of a third hmguage English as an intermediary in the construction of a bilingual diet:to-- nary was test;ed manually on a large scale on c(lit-ing the Spanish-Japanese (lictionary [Kuwg0]. It is now a representative middle-sized dictionary hav-ing a large quantity of informal;ion.","Toktmaga and Tanaka [Tok90] tried t;o extract; a eonceI)tual dictionary fi'om Japanese-English and English-Japanese dictionaries. Although they used a concept similar to ours that is the graph structure of a dictionaryrelate([ to meaning of words, their t?ameworks and final product differ frolil ollrs. 7 Conclusion and Future Works The i)rol)osed method for using a intermediate hmguage to construct a l)ilingu:d dictionary utilizes the structure of dictionaries and morphemes and can choose appropriate equiwdencies for most, entries. Comi)aring the resulting dictionary with publishe(l dictionaries showed that tiara obtained are usefltl for revising and sUi)l)lementing t.he vocabulary of existing dictionaires.","To increase the accuracy with which eqnivah',ncie.s can be selected, mistakes in word-to-word dictionaries must t)e corrected even if' our method may detect aI)i)ropri:~te equiwdeneies. One way to do this would be t.o use thesaurus to cheek whether the extracted eorresi)ondences are relewmt.","Nouns were l;akeu into consideration in tiffs research, and the next ste I) will be to apply the proposed method to other parts of speech. We also need to estat/lish a way to handle compom~d words in European languages.
