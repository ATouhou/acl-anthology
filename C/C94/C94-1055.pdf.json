The domains currently modeled are end consumer activities in car maintenance and some technical procedures fl'om an aircraft maintenance l~ilanual.","One of the central aims in the design philosophy of the T E C t l D O C knowledge t)ase is the separation of domain-independent technical knowledge and specific concepts 1)erraining to the particular domain: the I)orta-1)ility of general technical knowledge has been a concern ['rom the beginning. For instance, knowledge about various types of tanks (with or without imprinted scales, dipsticks, drain bolts) is encoded on an abstract level in tile inheritance network (the 'middle nlodel'), and the particular tanks found in tile engine domain are attached at, the lower end. Similarly, we have an abstract model of connections (plugs, bolts, etc.), their properties, and the actions pertaining to them (phlg-in cormections can be merely connected or disconnected, screw connections call be tightly or loosely connected, or disconnected). Objects with the functionality of connections (e.g., spark phlgs) appear at the bottom of the hierarchy. Thus, when the system is transt\\~rred to a dill'e.rent technical domain - as experienced recently when we moved to air(:raft manuals ---, large parts of the abstract representation levels are re-usable."]},{"title":"3 D o c u m e n t R e p r e s e n t a - t i o n U s i n g R S T","paragraphs":["Tile first task undertaken ill TECIIDOC was a thorough analysis of a corpus of pages from multilingual manuals in terms of eonte.nt as well as structure of tile sections.
