This is achieved through the application of the Minimum Message Length Principle to evaluate candidate interpretations. Our system receives as input a quasi-Natural Language argument, where propositions are presented in English, and generates an interpretation of the argument in the form of a Bayesian network (BN). Performance was evaluated by distorting the system’s arguments (generated from a BN) and feeding them to the system for interpretation. In 75% of the cases, the interpretations produced by the system matched precisely or almost-precisely the representation of the original arguments."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["In this paper, we focus on the interpretation of argumentative discourse, which is composed of implications. We present a mechanism for the interpretation of NL arguments which is based on the application of the Minimum Message Length (MML) Principle for the evaluation of candidate interpretations (Wallace and Boulton, 1968). The MML principle provides a uniform and incremental framework for combining the uncertainty arising from different stages of the interpretation process. This enables our mechanism to cope with noisy input in terms of wording, beliefs and argument structure, and to factor out the elements of an interpretation which rely on a particular knowledge representation.","So far, our mechanism has been tested on one knowledge representation – Bayesian Networks (BNs) (Pearl, 1988); logic-based representations will be tested in the future. Figure 1(a) shows a simple argument, and Figure 1(d) shows a subset ","This research was supported in part by Australian Research Council grant A49927212. of a BN which contains the preferred interpretation of this argument (the nodes corresponding to the original argument are shaded). In this example, the argument is obtained through a web interface (the uncertainty value of the consequent is entered using a drop-down menu). As seen in this example, the input argument differs structurally from the system’s interpretation. In addition, the belief value for the consequent differs from that in the domain BN, and the wording of the statements differs from the canonical wording of the BN nodes. Still, the system found a reasonable interpretation in the context of its domain model.","The results obtained in this informal trial are validated by our automated evaluation. This evaluation, which assesses baseline performance, consists of passing distorted versions of the system’s arguments back to the system for interpretation. In 75% of the cases, the interpretations produced by the system matched the original arguments (in BN form) precisely or almost-precisely.","In the next section, we review related research. We then describe the application of the MML criterion to the evaluation of interpretations. In Section 4, we outline the argument interpretation process. The results of our evaluation are reported in Section 5, followed by concluding remarks."]},{"title":"2 Related Research","paragraphs":["Our research integrates reasoning under uncertainty for plan recognition in discourse understanding with the application of the MML principle (Wallace and Boulton, 1968).","BNs in particular have been used in several such plan recognition tasks, e.g., (Charniak and Goldman, 1993; Horvitz and Paek, 1999; Zukerman, 2001).

In contrast, we use a BN to constrain our understanding of the propositions in an argument, and apply the MML principle to select a plausible interpretation. Both Horvitz and Paek’s system and Zukerman’s handled short dialogue contributions. Horvitz and Paek used BNs at different levels of an abstrac-tion hierarchy to infer a user’s goal in information-seeking interactions with a Bayesian Receptionist. Zukerman used a domain model and user model represented as a BN, together with linguistic and at-tentional information to infer a user’s goal from a short-form rejoinder. However, the combination of these knowledge sources was based on heuristics.","The MML principle is a model selection technique which applies information-theoretic criteria to trade data fit against model complexity.

When a good interpretation is found, a message which encodes the NL argument in terms of this interpretation will be shorter than the message which transmits the words of the argument directly.","A message that encodes an NL argument in terms of an interpretation is composed of two parts: (1) in-structions for building the interpretation, and (2) in-structions for rebuilding the original argument from this interpretation. These two parts balance the need for a concise interpretation (Part 1) with the need for an interpretation that matches closely the original argument (Part 2). For instance, the message for a concise interpretation that does not match well the original argument will have a short first part but a long second part. In contrast, a more complex interpretation which better matches the original argument may yield a shorter message over-all. As a result, in finding the interpretation that yields the shortest message for an NL argument, we will have produced a plausible interpretation, which hopefully is the intended interpretation. To findthis interpretation, we compare the message length of the candidate interpretations. These candidates are obtained as described in Section 4. 3.1 MML Encoding The MML criterion is derived from Bayes Theorem: Pr  Pr  Pr","  , where  is the data and  is a hypothesis which explains the data.","An optimal code for an event","with probability Pr    has message length ML    Pr    (measured in bits).

It is composed of simple implications of the form Antecedent","Antecedent","   ","Antecedent Consequent (where","indicates that the antecedents imply the consequent, without distinguishing between causal and evidential implications).","Arg represents an understanding of the input argument.

This in-volves selecting its propositions from those in the domain, and then choosing which of the possible relations between these propositions are included in the interpretation.

This probability gradually falls as the discrepancy between the belief stated in the argument and the system’s belief increases, which in turn yields an increased message length. 3.3.2 Structural differences The message which transmits the structural discrepancies between","SysInt and","Arg describes the structural operations required to transform","SysInt into","Arg. These operations are: node insertions and deletions, and arc insertions and deletions. A node is inserted in","SysInt when the system can-not reconcile a proposition in the given argument with any proposition in its domain representation. In this case, the system proposes a special Escape (wild card) node. Note that the system does not presume to understand this proposition, but still hopes to achieve some understanding of the argument as a whole. Similarly, an arc is inserted when the argument mentions a relationship which does not appear in","SysInt. An arc (node) is deleted when the corresponding relation (proposition) appears in","SysInt, but is omitted from","Arg. When a node is deleted, all the arcs incident upon it are rerouted to connect its antecedents directly to its consequent. This operation, which models a small inferential leap, preserves the structure of the implication around the deleted node. If the arcs so rerouted are inconsistent with","Arg they will be deleted separately.","For each of these operations, the message an-nounces how many times the operation was performed (e.g., how many nodes were deleted) and then provides sufficient information to enable the message receiver to identify the targets of the operation (e.g., which nodes were deleted).

The goodness of a word-match depends on the following factors: (1) level of synonymy – the number of synonyms the words have in common (according to WordNet, Miller et al., 1990); (2) position in sentence; and (3) part-of-speech (PoS) – obtained using MINIPAR (Lin, 1998).

Our measure of performance is the edit-distance between the original BN used to generate an argument, and the BN produced as the interpretation of this argument. For instance, two BNs that differ by one arc have an edit-distance of 2 (one addition and one deletion), while a perfect match has an edit-distance of 0.","Overall, our results were as follows. Our system produced an interpretation in 86% of the 5400 trials. In 75% of the 5400 cases, the generated interpretations had an edit-distance of 3 or less from the original BN, and in 50% of the cases, the interpretations matched perfectly the original BN. Figure 3 depicts the frequency of edit distances for the different BN sizes under all noise conditions. We plotted edit-distances of 0,   ",", 9 and",", plus the category NI, which stands for “No Interpretation”. As shown in Figure 3, the 0 edit-distance has the highest frequency, and performance deteriorates as BN size increases. Still, for BNs of 7 arcs or less, the vast majority of the interpretations have an edit distance of 3 or less. Only for BNs of 9 arcs the number of NIs exceeds the number of perfect matches.","We also tested each kind of noise separately, maintaining the other kinds of noise at 0%. All the distortions were between 0 and 40%. We performed 1560 trials for word noise, arc noise and node insertions, and 2040 trials for belief noise, which warranted additional observations. Figures 4, Figure 3: Frequency of edit-distances for all noise conditions (5400 trials) 5 and 6 show the recognition accuracy of our system (in terms of average edit distance) as a function of arc, belief and word noise percentages, respectively. The performance for the different BN sizes (in arcs) is also shown. Our system’s performance for node insertions is similar to that obtained for belief noise (the graph was not included owing to space limitations). Our results show that the two main factors that affect recognition performance are BN size and word noise, while the average edit distance remains stable for belief and arc noise, as well as for node insertions (the only exception occurs for 40% arc noise and size 9 BNs). Specifically, for arc noise, belief noise and node insertions, the average Figure 4: Effect of arc noise on performance (1560 trials) Figure 5: Effect of belief noise on performance (2040 trials) edit distance was 3 or less for all noise percentages, while for word noise, the average edit distance was higher for several word-noise and BN-size combinations. Further, performance deteriorated as the percentage of word noise increased.","The impact of word noise on performance reinforces our intention to implement a more principled sentence comparison procedure (Section 4.1), with the expectation that it will improve this aspect of our system’s performance."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We have offered a mechanism which produces interpretations of segmented NL arguments.
