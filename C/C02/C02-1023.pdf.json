In these contexts, the use of grammar-independent input (sequences of uninflected semantic units like e.g. language-independent icons) can be an answer to the users’ needs. However, this requires that an intelligent system should be able to interpret this input with reasonable accuracy and in reasonable time. Here we propose a method allowing a purely semantic-based analysis of sequences of semantic units. It uses an algorithm inspired by the idea of “chart parsing” known in Natural Language Processing, which stores intermediate parsing results in order to bring the calculation time down."]},{"title":"Introduction","paragraphs":["As the mass of international communication and exchange increases, icons as a mean to cross the language barriers have come through in some specific contexts of use, where language independent symbols are needed (e.g. on some machine command buttons). The renewed interest in iconic communication has given rise to important works in the field of Design (Aicher and Krampen, 1996; Dreyfuss, 1984; Ota, 1993), on reference books on the history and development of the matter (Frutiger, 1991; Liungman, 1995; Sassoon and Gaur, 1997), as well as newer studies in the fields of Human-Computer Interaction and Digital Media (Yazdani and Barker, 2000) or Semiotics (Vaillant, 1999).","We are here particularly interested in the field of Information Technology. Icons are now used in nearly all possible areas of human computer in-teraction, even office software or operating systems. However, there are contexts where richer information has to be managed, for instance: Alternative & Augmentative Communication systems designed for the needs of speech or language impaired people, to help them communicate (with icon languages like Minspeak, Bliss, Commun-I-Mage); Second Language Learning systems where learners have a desire to communicate by themselves, but do not master the structures of the target language yet; Cross-Language Information Retrieval systems, with a visual symbolic input.","In these contexts, the use of icons has many advantages: it makes no assumption about the language competences of the users, allowing impaired users, or users from a different linguistic background (which may not include a good command of one of the major languages involved in research on natural language processing), to access the systems; it may trigger a communication-motivated, implicit learning process, which helps the users to gradually improve their level of literacy in the target language. However, icons suffer from a lack of expressive power to convey ideas, namely, the expression of abstract relations between concepts still requires the use of linguistic communication.","An approach to tackle this limitation is to try to “analyse” sequences of icons like natural language sentences are parsed, for example. However, icons do not give grammatical information as clues to automatic parsers. Hence, we have defined a method to interpret sequences of icons by implementing the use of “natural” semantic knowledge. This method allows to build knowledge networks from icons as is usually done from text.","The analysis method that will be presented here is logically equivalent to the parsing of a dependency grammar with no locality constraints. Therefore, the complexity of a fully recursive parsing method grows more than exponentially with the length of the input. This makes the reaction time of the system too long to be acceptable in normal use. We have now defined a new parsing algorithm which stores intermediate results in “charts”, in the way chart parsers (Earley, 1970) do for natural language."]},{"title":"1 Description of the problem","paragraphs":["Assigning a signification to a sequence of information items implies building conceptual relations between them. Human linguistic competence consists in manipulating these dependency relations: when we say that the cat drinks the milk, for example, we perceive that there are well-defined conceptual connections between ‘cat’, ‘drink’, and ‘milk’—that ‘cat’ and ‘milk’ play given roles in a given process. Symbolic formalisms in AI (Sowa, 1984) reflect this approach. Linguistic theories have also been developed specifically to give account of these phenomena (Tesnière, 1959; Kunze, 1975; Mel’čuk, 1988), and to describe the transition between semantics and various levels of syntactic description: from deep syntactic structures which actually reflect the semantics contents, to the surface structure whereby messages are put into natural language.","Human natural language reflects these conceptual relations in its messages through a series of linguistic clues. These clues, depending on the particular languages, can consist mainly in word ordering in sentence patterns (“syntactical” clues, e.g. in English, Chinese, or Creole), in word inflection or suffixation (“morphological” clues, e.g. in Russian, Turkish), or in a given blend of both (e.g. in German). Parsers are systems designed to analyse natural language input, on the base of such clues, and to yield a representation of its informational contents. S VP ‘‘Aquam bibit.’’homo nominative accusative V Syntactical analysis based on word order Morphological analysis based on word inflexion accusative : agent: agentNP 0 NP 0 NP 1 nominative : object: objectNP 1 ‘‘[The man] [drinks] [the water].’’","In contexts where icons have to be used to convey complex meanings, the problem is that morphological clues are of course not available, when at the same time we cannot rely on a precise sentence pattern.","We thus should have to use a parser based on computing the dependencies, such as some which have been written to cope with variable-word-order languages (Covington, 1990). However, since no morphological clue is available either to tell that an icon is, e.g., accusative or dative, we have to rely on semantic knowledge to guide role assignment. In other words, an icon parser has to know that drink-ing is something generally done by living beings on liquid objects."]},{"title":"2 The semantic analysis method","paragraphs":["The icon parser we propose performs semantic analysis of input sequences of icons by the use of an algorithm based on best-unification: when an icon in the input sequence has a “predicative” structure (it may become the head of at least one dependency relation to another node, labeled “actor”), the other icons around it are checked for compatibility. Com-patibility is measured as a unification score between two sets of feature structures: the intrinsic semantic features of the candidate actor, and the “extrinsic” semantic features of the predicative icon attached to a particular semantic role (i.e. the properties “expected” from, say, the agent of kiss , the direct object of drink , or the concept qualified by the adjective fierce ).","The result yielded by the semantic parser is the graph that maximizes the sum of the compatibilities of all its dependency relations. It constitutes, with no particular contextual expectations, and given the state of world knowledge stored in the iconic database in the form of semantic features, the “best” interpretation of the users’ input.","The input is a sequence of icons",",",", . . .",", each of which has a set of intrinsic features:","","(where ","is a set of simple Attribute-Value seman-","tic features, used to represent intrinsic features of","the concept—like {<human,+1>,<male,+1>}","for Daddy).","Some of the symbols also have selectional fea-","tures, which, if grouped by case type, form a case","structure:","   ","","","","","","","(where each of the","","is a case type such as","agent, object, goal..., and each","a set of sim-","ple Attribute-Value semantic features, used to deter-","mine what features are expected from a given case-","filler—e.g. <human,+1> is a feature that the agent","of the verb write should possess).","Every couple  ","","","present in the case struc-","ture means that ","is a set of Attribute-Value cou-","ples which are attached to","","as selectional features","for the case  :","","","",""," ","","","","","","      For example, we can write: ","(write,agent)","{<human,+1>}","The semantic compatibility is the value we seek to maximize to determine the best assignments.","1. At the feature level (compatibility between two features), it is defined so as to “match” extrinsic and intrinsic features. This actually includes a somehow complex definition, taking into account the modelling of conceptual inheritance between semantic features; but for the sake of simplicity in this presentation, we may assume that the semantic compatibility at the semantic feature level is defined as in Eq. 1, which would be the case for a “flat” ontology1",".","2. At the feature structure level, i.e. where the semantic contents of icons are defined, semantic compatibility is calculated between two homogeneous sets of Attribute-Value couples: on one side the selectional features attached to a given case slot of the predicate icon—stripped here of the case type—, on the other side the intrinsic features of the candidate icon.","The basic idea here is to define the compatibility as the sum of matchings in the two sets of attribute-value pairs, in ratio to the number of features being compared to. It should be noted that semantic compatibility is not a symmetric norm: it has to measure how good the candidate actor fills the expectations of a given predicative concept in respect to one of its particular cases. Hence there is a filtering set (   ) and a filtered set ( ","), and it is the cardinal of the filtering set which is used as denominator: ","  ","     ","   ","   ","   ","","  (2)","(where the","","and the","","are simple features of the","form  ","","","and","","","","",", respectively).","A threshold of acceptability is used to shed out","improbable associations without losing time.","Even with no grammar rules, though, it is neces-","sary to take into account the distance between two","1","The difference in computing time may be neglected in the","following reasoning, since the actual formula taking into ac-","count inheritance involves a maximum number of computing","steps depending on the depth of the semantic features ontology,","which does not vary during the processing. icons in the sequence, which make it more likely that the actor of a given predicate should be just be-fore or just after it, than four icons further, out of its context.

Eventually a global assignment of actors (chosen among those present in the context) to the case slots of the predicate, has to be determined. An assignment is an application of the set of icons (other than the predicate being considered) into the set of cases of the predicate.","The semantic compatibility of this global assignment is defined as the sum of the values (as defined in Eq. 3) of the individual case-filler allotments.","4. For a sequence of icon containing more than one predicative symbol, the calculus of the assignments is done for every one of them. A global interpretation of the sequence is a set of assignments for every predicate in the sequence."]},{"title":"3 Complexity of a recursive algorithm","paragraphs":["In former works, this principle was implemented by a recursive algorithm (purely declarative PROLOG).

In the same way, at level (c), the computation of the interpretations’ values by adding the assignments’ values does not recompute the assignments values at every step, but simply uses the values stored in the assignments table.","Furthermore, the system has been improved for the cases where only partial modifications are done to the graph, e.g. when the users want to perform an incremental generation, by generating the graph again at every new icon added to the end of the sequence; or when they want to delete one of the icons of the sequence only, optionally to replace it by another one. In these cases, a great part of the information remains unchanged. To take this property into account, the system stores the current sequence and the charts resulting from the parse in memory, allowing them to be only partially replaced afterwards.","Finally, we have implemented three basic interface functions to be performed by the parser. The first one implements a full parse, the second partially re-parses a sequence where new icons have been added, the third partially re-parses a sequence where icons have been removed.
