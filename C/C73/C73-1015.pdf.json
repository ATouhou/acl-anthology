Select those which are phonetically ambiguous and can be understood as the roots of two different words. Take these words and change them into dissyllabics. Find the point of syllable division in both and ascertain whether the first syllables in them are open. Only words with initial open syllables will easily lend themselves to preliminary analysis. Compare the left-hand open syllables: if they may be represented as different words, the roots under consideration have different vowels; 198 .̂ s. UB~a~A~ if the open syllables may be represented as homonyms, the difference lies in the postvocalic consonants. The opposition of the contrasting phonemes will yield the linguistic basis of the distinctive feature that keeps them apart. Study all the possible oppositions and get all the distinctive features obtainable by this method. The features will be only loosely characterized, e.g. \"that which distinguishes the root-final consonant of such-and-such words and disappears before a pause \" The element of the ambiguous form is not an independent phoneme if its occurrence is confined to this form. But if some root is ambiguous in all its forms and another root only in one form, we have a case of two independent phonemes crossing at a single point, so that the phonological make-up of the constantly ambiguous root remains unchanged.","When all the distinctive features have been extracted in this way, some phonemes will have become uniquely characterized as bundles of distinctive features. (It is important that at this stage a phoneme can be defined both as a minimal unit of natural segmentation and as a bundle of distinctive features, i.e. not only syntagmatically but also paradigmatically). But even these phonemes will be tied to the stem-final position. We must now learn to recognize these phonemes in other contexts, e.g. to identify/d/ in"]},{"title":"gocla","paragraphs":["and/d/ in"]},{"title":"dom","paragraphs":["\"house\" as one and the same unit. This is the most difficult step, and nothing but a tentative solution can be proposed here. It seems that phonemes are discovered as purely linguistic entities but identified phonetically. After we have obtained the features of the type \"that which distinguishes etc. \" (see above) we must fred their physical correlates and use them as tools of further identification. Human langmage consists of sounds, and it could be expected that at some late moment the material implementation of phonemes would come in.","Our next instructions coristitute a programme, which has already taken decades to carry out and whose termination lies in a comparatively distant future.","(III) Select the phonemes uniquely characterized as bundles of distinctive features and find their physical correlates. Use the correlates as marks whereby to recognize the phonemes in all contexts.","The Russian phonemes/d t g 2 / and some others are uniquely characterized by their distinctive features. But there are phonemes entering into few or no alternations. Thus,"]},{"title":"Ib I","paragraphs":["and Iv/never alternate in l~us-sian,'~and so the specific feature that keeps them apart defies detection. To be sure, while studying [d t g 21 etc., we got a list of distinctive TOWARDS A PHONOLOGICAL ALGORITHM 199 features and later found their correlates. Therefore we can now choose some features from the general list and ascribe them to/b/and/v/ (e.g./b/will be a stop and/v/a spirant), but the arbitrariness of this procedure is apparent.","Every system of phonemes, if diagrammed, will consist of concentric circles. The nucleus contains phonemes so active that their behaviour is able to characterize them uniquely. Some phonemes are less active (e.g./b/and/v[ in Russian), others are (almost) non-characterizable at all (e.g./1 m n r/); in the outermost circle we shall find the English/h/and kindred phonemes: these do not enter into any alternations and cannot be described by distinctive features. Phonemes may form a system or a list. Only the nucleus, definable through relevant features, deserves the name of system. Peripheral phonemes are juxtaposed as letters in an alphabet; they are also kept apart but their correlates must have an especially wide range of realizations.","Our next procedure resembles the previous one:","(IV) Select the phonemes whose characteristics only pardy emerge from the alternations and those which are non-definable through their linguistic behaviour. Contrary to the nuclear phonemes, these must be studied as wholes, both by the linguist and by the instrumentalist. A phoneme non-analyzable into distinctive features is itselfa materialized feature.","After we have identified the phonemes in all contexts each of them comes out as the invariant of some class of sounds. Hence the final definition of a phoneme: it is a minimal unit of natural segmentation in non-syllabic languages, a bundle of distinctive features, and the invariant of sounds possessing identical features.","The implications of the analysis suggested above are too far-reaching to be discussed here in detail. So only the most important of them will be enumerated.","1) Phonological research presupposes a certain amount of prosodic, morphological, and semantic data; we cannot start unless we know how to divide words into syllables and morphemes and how to distinguish homonymous forms and roots from non-homonymous ones.","2) To discover phonemes means to find their syntagmatic boundaries and to arrange them into a system. No paradigmatic procedures or procedures of identification are possible until the phonemes are separated from their neighbours. 200 A.s. I~IB~RMAIq","3) Preliminary segmentation and identification concerns stem-final consonants. Later they are used as \"yardsticks \" to define and identify stem-initial consonants. Thus, the syntagmatic procedure comes first; then follows the paradigmatic identification of phonemes at the end of the stem, and only after that the whole string falls into discrete elements. Until the last step is made, phonology is divorced from phonetics (except what concerns syllable-division) and is a shadow of morphology.","4) Phonemes form either systems or lists, according as the language is rich or poor in inftexion.","5) A phonological algorithm starts with the function and ends up with realizations. It rejects the idea that phonology is functional phonetics and operates on the assumption that phonetics is instrumental phonology.","It is our hope that the procedures discussed in this paper can, in principle, serve the basis of an algorithm by which a chain of phonemes is generated from an indiscrete sound string. Once this algorithm becomes a reality, its programming will be almost a technical problem; we shall be able to construct an analogue of the actual speech mechanism and approach coveted goal, viz. automatic treatment of phonic substance."]}]}
