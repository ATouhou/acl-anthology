Because of its overwhelming scale, improved quality, and multilingual nature, it has acquired a huge number of readers worldwide. One of the distinguishing features of Wikipedia is that it is a hypertext, which greatly enhances its usefulness and usability. That is, an article is linked to its related articles in the same language via intra-language links as well as to its counterpart articles in different languages via inter-language links (ILLs), and readers can navigate within millions of articles.","Editing Wikipedia articles naturally includes linking them to their related articles, which imposes an additional burden on contributors. As a result, Wikipedia articles may remain incomplete; they some-times lack important links as well as contain incorrect links. Thus, it is desirable to automate link-related editorial tasks such as embedding links in new articles and verifying links in existing articles. Linking a plain text, usually non-Wikipedia articles, to Wikipedia articles is called wikification, and much effort has been devoted to developing a variety of wikification methods over the past decade (Mihalcea and Csomai, 2007; Milne and Witten, 2008a; Fogarolli, 2009; Ratinov et al., 2011). However, wikification methods are still immature and affected by two hard problems; anchor selection, which involves keyword extraction or term recognition, and destination-article determination, which is a kind of word sense disambiguation (WSD).","We focused on the comparability of intra-language links between different language editions of Wikipedia, and developed a method for transferring intra-language links in one language edition to another language edition. Although the method is not applicable to texts other than Wikipedia articles, it avoids the problems of anchor selection and destination-article disambiguation by using analogy with different language editions. It does not require any language resources other than Wikipedia itself. When the target language is a morphologically rich one, a morphological analyzer is also required.

These two articles, which describe the same entity, concept or topic, are comparable. Note that this comparability holds not only for texts in articles but also for intra-language links, each of which links an anchor or an important term within an article to another same-language article describing the entity, concept, or topic denoted by the anchor term. Figure 1 gives an example pair of ILL-linked articles; an English article “Tata Motors” and a Japanese article “タタ・モーターズ.” The former has an intra-language link from an anchor “Jaguar” to the English article “Jaguar Cars,” while the latter has an intra-language link from an anchor “ジャガー” to the Japanese article “ジャガー (自動車).” These two intra-language links are comparable: namely, the anchors are translations of one another and the destination articles are linked via an ILL.","The above fact inspired us to develop a method for transferring intra-language links between ILL-linked articles to enrich the intra-language links in each article. Suppose an extreme case in which an article q in one language, which is linked to its counterpart p in another language via an ILL, has no intra-language links. An intra-language link can be transferred from p to q as follows. First, following an intra-language link (p to pd) and then the ILL (pd to qd), the final destination article qd is identified as that to be linked from q. Second, the text of q is searched for possible anchors for the destination article qd, which are learned from the entire Wikipedia beforehand. If two or more possible anchors are found, the most appropriate one will be selected according to a certain criterion. For example, suppose all intra-language links are missing from the Japanese article “タタ・モーターズ” in Figure 1. The intra-language link from the English article “Tata Motors” to “Jaguar Cars” and the ILL from “Jaguar Cars” to “ジャガー (自動車)” suggest that the Japanese article “タタ・モーターズ” should have an intra-language link to “ジャガー (自動車).” The possible anchors for “ジャガー (自動車),” which have been learned from all the Wikipedia articles linked to it, include “ジャガー (自動車),” “ジャガー,” and others. Since the text of “タタ・モーターズ” contains “ジャガー,” it is selected as the anchor for the destination article “ジャガー (自動車).”","It should be noted that our proposed method avoids the two hard problems in wikification, anchor selection and disambiguation, by exploiting the intra-language links provided by Wikipedia in another language. Resulting anchors are certainly important terms within q, since their counterparts have been selected as anchors by the author of counterpart p in another language. Even if an anchor were an ambiguous term, i.e., had two or more possible destination articles, it would be certainly linked to the appropriate one due to the “one sense per discourse” hypothesis (Gale et al., 1992). The hypothesis is extended to a pair of ILL-linked articles, p and q, as follows. A pair of corresponding anchors should be regarded as a single term and express the same sense in a discourse shared by p and q. In other words, they should be linked to articles that are linked via an ILL. Since the proposed method relies on this extended hypothesis, it will select correct destination articles for anchors in q as long as anchors in p have been linked to their correct destination articles.","It should also be noted that the proposed method first determines the destination articles then the anchors for them, while usual wikification methods first select anchors then determine their destination articles. The main reason for this is convenience of implementation; cross-language mapping of Figure 1. Transferring intra-language link. 1261 destination articles is one-to-one (or one-to-zero), while that of anchors can be one-to-many. Determining destination articles prior to anchors, however, results in an additional advantage that allows a destination article to be proposed without an anchor for it. Since the pair p and q is not parallel but just comparable, the counterpart of an anchor in p is not always found in q. This is often the case when q is incomplete, under construction, or written in a different style from that of p. In such a case, our method proposes a destination article qd without an anchor, and q will be linked to qd once q is enlarged to contain a term appropriate as the anchor for qd."]},{"title":"3 Proposed Method","paragraphs":["The proposed method is divided into two steps; the preprocessing step for collecting possible anchors for all Wikipedia articles in a target language as well as estimating probabilities required in the succeeding step and the main step for transferring intra-language links in a source-language article p to the target-language article q linked to p via an ILL. In this section, a triplet (p, a, pd) denotes an intra-language link from anchor a in article p to destination article pd and, likewise, a triplet (q, b, qd) does. Note that although an article can have two or more intra-language links from the same anchor at different positions in the text to the same destination article, they are treated as a single link. 3.1 Preprocessing Step Collecting Possible Anchors for Wikipedia Articles The title of a Wikipedia article can be used as an anchor for the article. However, a title is often accompanied by a parenthesized note indicating the domain of the article to discriminate from other articles with the same title. The title “ジャガー (自動車)” of an article that describes a car named Jaguar is an example; the parenthesized note “(自動車)” discriminates the article from another article “ジャ ガー”, which describes an animal belonging to the cat family. Such a title accompanied by a parenthesized note rarely occurs in usual texts, and the title with the parenthesized note deleted is often marked as an anchor. Accordingly, we also regard a title with a parenthesized note deleted (e.g., “ジャガー”) as a possible anchor. Other terms, typically synonyms of the article title, are often used as anchors. Therefore, we collect terms that are actually used as anchors for each article from the entire Wikipedia. Finally, we threshold possible anchors by their keyphraseness to eliminate general words. The keyphraseness κ(b) of a term b is defined as the probability that b is used as an anchor in Wikipedia articles (Mihalcea and Csomai, 2007), i.e., κ(b) =","|{q|∃qd. (q, b, qd) ∈ Lt}| df(b) , where Lt is a set consisting of all intra-language links in the target-language Wikipedia and df(b) is the number of Wikipedia articles in which b occurs.","In summary, a set of possible anchors A(qd) are constructed for a target-language destination article qd as follows: A(qd) = ({title(qd), title′(qd)} ∪ {b|∃q. (q, b, qd) ∈ Lt}) ∩ {b|κ(b) ≥ θ}, where title(qd) and title′(qd) are qd’s title with and without the parenthesized note, respectively, and θ is the threshold for the keyphraseness. Estimating Probabilities The following probabilities, which will be used to select one from among possible anchors for a destination article, are estimated from the entire Wikipedia."," The probability that the target-language anchor is b on the condition that its source-language counterpart is a, i.e., P(b|a) =","count(a, b) ∑ count(a, b′)b′ , 1262","count(a, b) = |{((p, a), (q, b))| ∃pd. ∃qd.

(q, b, qd′ ) ∈ L t}| 3.2 Main Step Let p and q be source-language and target-language articles that are linked via an ILL, respectively. Intra-language links in p are transferred to q as follows: (i) For each source-language intra-language link (p, a, pd), do (ii) to (v).","(ii) If pd has an ILL to an article in the target language, let qd be the destination article of the ILL from pd. Otherwise, output “NOT TRANSFERRED” and move to the next intra-language link.","(iii) If A(qd) is empty, output the transferred intra-language link (q, NULL, qd), which means that q should be linked to qd but does not contain a term appropriate as the anchor, and move to the next intra-language link.","(iv) For each possible anchor b ∈ A(qd), search the text of q for b. If found, let pos(b, q) denote the position of its first occurrence in the text; otherwise, let pos(b, q) = −1.","(v) If at least one possible anchor is found, choose the most appropriate one b̂ according to an anchor priority score Score(b), i.e.,","b̂ = argmax b s.t. b∈A(qd)∧pos(b,q)≥0 Score(b). and output the transferred intra-language link (q, b̂, qd). Otherwise, output the transferred in-tra-language link (q, NULL, qd). We have the following five alternative anchor priority scores in step (v) above."," Anchor translation probability: Score1(b) = P(b|a). This score favors the anchor that occurs most frequently as counterpart to the source-language anchor."," Anchor probability: Score2(b) = P(b|qd). This score favors the anchor by which the destination article is pointed most frequently."," Destination article likelihood: Score3(b) = P(qd|b). This score favors the anchor that is most likely to point the destination article."," Spelling: Score4(b) = 1 − dist(b, title′(qd)) max{len(b), len(title′(qd))}⁄ , where dist(s, s′) is the Levenshtein distance between character strings s and s′ (Levenshtein, 1966), and len(s) is the length of character string s. This score favors the anchor with the highest similarity to the article’s title without a parenthesized note, which is the most representative term denoting the entity, concept, or topic described in the article."," Position: Score5(b) = 1 pos(b, q)⁄ . Note that in a Wikipedia article, among two or more occurrences of an important term, the first one tends to be marked as an anchor. 1263"]},{"title":"4 Experiment 4.1 Experimental Settings","paragraphs":["We conducted an experiment on transferring intra-language links from the English edition to the Japanese edition of Wikipedia. Input Data The English edition of Wikipedia (2013-04-03 dump), consisting of 4,241,324 articles, and the Japanese edition of Wikipedia (2013-03-28 dump), consisting of 951,411 articles1",", were used for the experiment. Intra-language links were extracted from each dump file, and ILLs were obtained from Wikidata (2013-03-28 dump). Redirect pages were resolved preliminarily, i.e., if the destination of an intra-language link or ILL was a redirect page, the destination was replaced with an article pointed by the redirect page.","From among a total of 366,358 pairs of English and Japanese articles linked by ILLs, 3,595 pairs were randomly selected as a test set. The remaining pairs were used as training data for constructing English and Japanese intra-language link sets, Ls and Lt. The English articles in the test set contained 179,963 intra-language links in total; these were input to the algorithm of the proposed method. Keyphraseness Threshold Limiting possible anchors to meaningful ones and gaining many links are in a trade-off relation adjustable by the keyphraseness threshold θ. In the experiment, θ was set to 0, 0.01, 0.05, and 0.1.","Keyphraseness values of several anchors are listed in Table 1. Technical words (e.g., “ベイジア ン・ネットワーク” – Bayesian network) and uncommon proper names (e.g., “地獄の辞典” – Dictionnaire Infernal) tend to have high keyphraseness values. Common words (e.g., “悪魔” – devil and “対立” – conflict) and proper names (e.g., “パリ” – Paris and “ニコラス” – Nicholas), especially identical to a general noun, have middle or low values according to their commonness. Although some functional words (e.g., “より” – from) may be included in possible anchors for the Wikipedia articles of their homographic content words (e.g., “より” – Yori (kana)), they naturally have extremely low values. By setting θ to a value slightly greater than zero, functional words could be removed from possible anchors. Comparison of Anchor Priority Scores To determine the most effective anchor priority score, the accuracy of anchors selected according to each score was evaluated, assuming the existing intra-language links in the original Japanese articles as gold standard. That is, anchor accuracy Acc is defined as the percentage of originally pointed destination articles for which correct anchors were selected, i.e., Acc =","|Result ∩ GoldSTD| |{(q, b, qd) ∈ Result|∃b′. (q, b′, qd) ∈ GoldSTD}| , where Result is a set consisting of all transferred intra-language links and GoldSTD is the gold standard intra-language link set. Table 2 lists the anchor accuracies for each anchor priority score and each θ. Anchor translation probability exhibited the best results and, therefore, we adopted anchor translation probability as the anchor priority score.  1 Redirect pages and articles with no intra-language links were not included in these counts.","Anchor English translation Keyphraseness ベイジアン・ ネットワーク Bayesian network 1 地獄の辞典 Dictionnaire Infernal 0.810 悪魔学 demonology 0.678 パリ Paris 0.574 オカルト occult 0.304 悪魔 devil 0.135 ニコラス Nicholas 0.039 対立 conflict 0.001 半分 half 7.8 × 10–5"," より Yori (kana) 4.4 × 10–6"," Table 1.

The proposed method added many new intra-language links to Wikipedia articles.

Anchor accuracy of new intra-language links could not be calculated because of the unavailability of gold standard data. However, the proposed method specifies the anchor b for destination article qd only when possible anchors for it is found in the target-language article q. The specified anchor b is likely to be the counterpart of source-language anchor a pointing to pd that is the source-language counterpart of qd, regardless of whether b already points to qd or not. Thus, the anchor accuracy of new links should be similar to that of existing links.","Among the S = 179,963 input English intra-language links, 100D S⁄ = 100 ∙ 52,275 179,963⁄ = 29.0% (θ = 0) were transferred to Japanese intra-language links with the anchor unspecified. This was because different language articles contain different contents even though they are linked via an ILL. The anchor-unspecified links are put in the “関連項目” sections (“See also” sections) of target-language articles, and Wikipedia authors are expected to enlarge or revise the articles so that these anchor-unspecified links can be converted to anchor-specified links.

Anchor probability is also useful because this is a posterior probability of the anchor for the destination. High-er accuracy with spelling score indicates that Wikipedia editors tend to use the title of the destination as an anchor. This may be caused by manually specifying the anchor and destination independently. Contrary to expectations that the first occurrence likely becomes an anchor, position score exhibited the worst results. More detailed analysis of the context in which a term tends to be selected as an anchor is necessary.","Table 2 shows that the anchor probability, unexpectedly, decreases with a rise of the keyphraseness threshold.

He was a free-thinker influenced by Voltaire. He worked as a printer and publish-er in Plancy-l'Abbaye and Paris.

Since the English edition of Wikipedia is richer than Japanese, it has been assumed that an English-to-Japanese direction is more effective than the inverse.

The proposed method can be straightforwardly extended to three or more language combinations: Even if two source articles in two different languages are handled separately, the target article would be more enriched with the union of two transferred link sets. While this contributes to increasing the coverage of links, the reliability of links can also be improved by taking the intersection of the two transferred link sets. A more sophisticated combination of multiple source languages is a further problem.","In the experiment, existing links were used as the gold standard for evaluation, despite the fact that they are not always appropriate because they are manually created by unspecified contributors. For example, there is a biology-related article containing an anchor “translation” linking to an article “Translation” describing language translation, not to another article “Translation (biology).” Such an incorrect intra-language link may be detected using a similar method as the proposed one. In the above example, suppose the Japanese counterpart article contains an anchor “翻訳” linking to an article “翻 訳 (生物学).” Two anchors “translation” and “翻訳” correspond to each other but their destination articles are not linked via an ILL. This inconsistency may be evidence for an inappropriate intra-language link. Note that which of the English and Japanese links is inappropriate cannot be easily de-termined. How to estimate the appropriateness of intra-language links is a problem to be solved."]},{"title":"6 Related Work","paragraphs":["Wikification, which aims at linking mainly non-Wikipedia articles to Wikipedia articles, can be naturally applied to linking between Wikipedia articles. There has been much research on wikification, most of which focused on disambiguation of destination articles (Milne and Witten, 2008a; Fogarolli, 2009; Ratinov et al., 2011). Determining an appropriate destination article for an anchor term is a special case of WSD. Although a variety of ideas for WSD have been adapted to wikification, their per-formance is not satisfactory and there is room for further improvement. Another important issue with wikification is anchor selection, although most literature on wikification avoids the issue by selecting every term that is used as an anchor in any Wikipedia article. Anchor selection is a keyword extraction problem, which has been tackled using syntactic, statistical, and/or machine learning techniques but remains room for further improvement (Jacquemin and Bourigault, 2003). It should be added that our proposed method avoids both disambiguation and anchor selection problems by exploiting link information in another language edition of Wikipedia.","Adafre and de Rijke (2005) proposed a method for finding “missing intra-language links” in a Wikipedia article by assuming that an intra-language link represents the relatedness between concepts described by the linked articles. Their method adds intra-language links to an article by using articles with similar link structures as that of the article in question. Similar methods that use the Wikipedia’s link structures as a semantic network have been proposed for entity linking (Milne and Witten, 2008b; Fogarolli, 2009; Ratinov et al., 2011). These still remain monolingual methods; the availability of other language editions cannot be assumed.","A bilingual approach to improving quality of Wikipedia articles has also been studied. Sorg and Cimiano (2008) proposed a method for finding new ILLs by using a classifier whose features include 1267 the number of ILLs between articles pointed by an article in one language and those pointed by an article in another language. Wang et al. (2013) improved the classifier by extending the intra-language links to increase the number of features. Both methods and our proposed method exploit the comparability between intra-language links in different language editions. However, while the former find new ILLs, the latter finds new intra-language links."]},{"title":"7 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We proposed a method for enriching intra-language links in Wikipedia articles. It transfers intra-language links between a pair of different language articles linked by an inter-language link through the following two steps: first, determine destination articles to which the target-language article should be linked by following a source-language intra-language link and an ILL successively from each of the anchors in the source-language article; second, determine an anchor for each of the destination articles by searching the target-language article for possible anchors and selecting the most appropriate one according to the anchor translation probability criterion if two or more possible anchors are found. Unlike usual wikification methods, our method avoids anchor selection and disambiguation problems by exploiting the comparability of intra-language links between different language editions of Wikipedia. We conducted an experiment of transferring intra-language links from the English edition to the Japanese edition to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. The method increased the number of intra-language links in Japanese articles by 40.9%, and the accuracy of anchors selected was estimated to be 96.3%.
