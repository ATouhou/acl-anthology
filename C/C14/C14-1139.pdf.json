Graph theoretical methods or graph based approaches have been successfully applied for a varied set of NLP tasks such as Word Sense Disambiguation, Text Summarization, Topic detection etc. One of the earliest and most prominent work in this area has been the TextRank (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004) method - an unsupervised graph-based ranking model for extracting keyphrases and “ key” sentences from natural language text. This unsupervised method extracts prominent terms, phrases and sentences from text. The TextRank models the text as a graph where, depending on the end application, text units of various sizes and characteristics can be added as vertices e.g. open class words, collocations, sentences etc. Similarly, based on the application, connections can be drawn between these vertices e.g. lexical or semantic relation, contextual overlap etc. To identify “central” or “key” text units in this text graph, TextRank runs the PageRank algorithm on this constructed graph. The ranking over vertices (text units), which indicates their centrality and importance, is obtained by finding the stationary distribution of the random walk on the text graph.","In this paper, we consider the problem of extracting label specific keyphrases from a document which has document level metadata associated with it namely labels (i.e. multi-labeled document). To elaborate, consider a document as shown in Figure 1. This document has been assigned to two categories as indicated by the labels “ Air Pollution” and “ Plant Physiology”. Running TextRank on this article yields top ranked key-phrases such as “ calibrated instrument”, “ polluting gases”, “ industrial development” etc. These keyphrases, though central to the article, are not specific to any of thelabels that have been assigned to the article. For instance, one would associate keyphrases such as “ carbon monoxide ”, “ air pollutants” to be more relevant to the “ Air Pollution” label and keyphrases such as “ stomatal movement”, “ cell defense” to be more closely associated with the “ Plant Physiology” label. The objective of this paper is to explore extensions to TextRank for extracting label-specific keyphrases from a multi-labeled document. Such label-specific keyphrases can be useful for a number of practical applications namely: highlighting such terms within the body of a document could provide a label-specific (topic-focussed) view of the document thus facilitating fast browsing and reading of the document, such key terms could also be useful for generating topic-driven or label-specific summaries and in multifaceted search.

Details of the proposed method is discussed in Section 3 followed by evaluation in Section 4. Future work and conclusion is presented in Section 5."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["The methods for keyphrase (or keyword) extraction can be roughly categorized into either unsupervised or supervised. Unsupervised methods usually involve assigning a saliency score to each candidate phrase by considering various features. Popular work in this area include the use of point-wise KL-divergence between multiple language models for scoring both phrase-ness and informativeness of candidate phrases (Tomokiyo and Hurst, 2003), use of TF-IDF weighting (A. Hulth, 2003) etc. Supervised machine learning algorithms have been proposed to classify a candidate phrase into either keyphrase or not using features such as the frequency of occurrence, POS information, and location of the phrase in the document. All the above methods only make use the document text for generating keyphrases and cannot be used (as-is) for generating label-specific keyphrases.","One possible method for extracting label-specific keyphrases from a document could be based on post-processing the output of the TextRank algorithm in the following way (1) Identify a set of label specific features f cand","l (unigram terms) that are strongly correlated with the label. This could be done by applying feature selection methods (Forman, 2003), (Forman, 2003) on a multi-label text corpus (we discuss this step in more detail in a later section). For instance, f cand","air_pollution={“ pollutant”,“ gases”,...} (2) Run the TextRank algorithm on the document d to generate a list of keyphrases keyphrased (3) Filter the resultant list keyphrased based on lexical or semantic match with the label specific featuresf cand","l to","generate keyphrasel","d or label-l specific keyphrase for documentd. This approach suffers from the following limitations (a) The keyphrase list generated in Step (2) i.e.","keyphrased might be dominated by keyphrases which have little to do with label l. Post processing","this list (Step 3) using f cand","l might result in only very few keyphrases in keyphrasel","d. (b) The label specific featuresf cand","l , which are derived from corpus level statistics1",", might not be the best indicator of the keyphrase-ness of a term in the document. (c) Moreover, consider a scenario where a document is associated with more than one label. Consider the previous example where the document is associated with two labels “ Air Pollution” and “ Plant Physiology”. When extracting keyphrases specific to the label/category “ Air Pollution” from document d one would expect that the extracted keyphrases are closer to the Air Pollution label/category and distant from other labels associated with document d i.e. “ Plant Physiology”. It is not evident how this can be modeled in this approach. In this paper we propose an approach that models the problem of finding label-specific keyphrases in a document as a random walk on the document’s text-graph. Two approaches are proposed namely PTR: Personalized TextRank and TRDMS: TextRank using Ranking on Data Manifolds with Sinks.","1","Using feature selection methods 1469","PTR: Personalized TextRank : In this setting the PageRank algorithm, which is the underpinning of the TextRank keyphrase extraction algorithm, is replaced with the personalized page rank (Haveliwala, 2002) algorithm. By using the label specific featuresf cand","l as the personalization vector we are able to bias the walk on the underlying text graph towards terms relevant to the label. We discuss this approach in more detail in Section 3.3. Even though using a label specific transport or personalization vector helps bias the walk towards terms specific to that label, terms relevant to labels other thanl continue to influence the walk. The Personalized TextRank method offers no elegant solution which would penalize terms unrelated to l while simultaneously preferring terms relevant to label l.","To achieve both these goals in one model we propose the TRDMS: TextRank using Ranking on Data Manifolds with Sinks approach. We model the problem of identifying label specific keyphrases in a given document as a random walk over the document’s weighted text graph with sink and query nodes2",". Ranking on data manifolds was first proposed by (Zhou et al., 2004) and has been used for multi-document summarization (Wan et al., 2007), image retrieval (He et al., 2004) etc. An intuitive description of the ranking algorithm is described as follows. A weighted network is constructed first, where nodes represent all the data and query points, and an edge is put between two nodes if they are “ close”. Query nodes are then initialized with a positive ranking score, while the nodes to be ranked are assigned a zero initial score. All the nodes, except the sink nodes, then propagate their ranking scores to their neighbor via the weighted network. The propagation process is repeated until a global state is achieved, and all the nodes except the query nodes are ranked according to their final scores. Manifold ranking gives high rank to nodes that are close to the query nodes on the manifold (relevance) and that have strong centrality (importance). Sink nodes, whose ranking is fixed to the minimum (zero) during the ranking process, do not spread any ranking score to their neighbors thus penalizing the nodes that are connected to them. To use this method for extracting label-(l) specific keyphrases , f cand","l are modeled as query nodes while features associated with labels other than l are modeled as sink nodes. This approach is inspired by the work done by (Cheng et al., 2011) for query recommendation and update summarization. Section 3.4 discusses this method in more detail. To summarize, to the best of our knowledge we are the first to propose the problem of extractinglabel specific keyphrases from a multi-labeled document. Our modifications to TextRank for achieving this task are novel. Moreover, our idea of of usingRanking on Data Manifolds on the document-level text graphs for extracting label specific keyphrases is a new contribution."]},{"title":"3 Generating Label Specific Keyphrases 3.1 Notation","paragraphs":["In this section we introduce notations which we use throughout the paper. Let D represent a multi-label document corpus and I be the set of all possible labels which could be associated with documents in D. A document from this corpus is denoted by d and the set of labels associated with document d is denoted by l, where d ∈ D and l ⊆ I. The text graph for document d is denoted by Gd and M denotes the number of vertices in Gd . We describe how this text graph is constructed in Section 3.2. Features specific to label l, which are extracted from the corpus D, are represented as f cand","l , where l ∈ I. Section 3.5 describes how these label specific features are extracted from a multi-label document corpus. 3.2 Building the Text Graph For a given document d the text graph Gd is built in the following way. All open-class, unigram tokens occurring in d are treated as vertices. Two vertices are connected if their corresponding lexical units co-occur within a window of maximum N words, where N is set to 10 for all our experiments. As indicated by (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004) co-occurrence links express relations between syntactic elements and represent cohesion indicators for a given text. Note that the methods described in Section 3.3 and Section 3.4 provide a score/rank for each vertex (unigram term) in the graph. To generate keyphrases (ngrams) from these candidate terms the following post-processing is performed on the top ranked terms. Vertices are sorted in reverse order of their score and the top K vertices in the ranking are retained","2","Nodes correspond to terms in a text graph 1470","Figure 2: (a) Label specific featuresf cand l (b) Personalized TextRank - walk biased towards terms related","to f cand","plant_physiology (shown in red color). (c) TextRank using Ranking on Data Manifold with Sinks: walk","biased towards terms related to f cand","plant_physiology, while simultaneously penalizing terms that are related to f cand","air_pollution. The sink points, which are shown in black color, are vertices whose ranking scores are fixed at the minimum score (zero in our case) during the ranking process. Hence, the sink points will never spread any ranking score to their neighbors. Arrows indicate diffusion of ranking scores (Figure best viewed in color) for post-processing. Let this ranked list be represented as <TK >. During post-processing, all terms selected as potential keywords are marked in the text, and sequence of adjacent keywords are collapsed into a multi-word keyphrase. For example, in the text calibrated instruments are used to measure, if the unigram terms calibrated and instruments are selected as potential/candidate terms by the PTR or TRDMS method, since they are adjacent they are collapsed into one single keyphrase “ calibrated instruments”. This heuristic is implemented as a function which is referred as kphrasegen(<TK >,d). This function takes as input the ranked term list <TK > and the document text d and returns the collapsed set of keyphrases. A similar approach was adopted in the TextRank (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004) work. 3.3 PTR: Personalized TextRank For extracting label-l specific keyphrases from document d we modify the TextRank (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004) algorithm. We replace the PageRank algorithm used in the TextRank method with the Personalized Page Rank (Haveliwala, 2002) algorithm. PageRank gives a stationary distribution of a random walk which, at each step, with a certain probability ε jumps to a random node, and with probability 1-ε follows a randomly chosen outgoing edge from the current node. More formally, let Gd denotes the text graph of document d with M vertices where di denotes the out degree of node wi, then p = εLp + (1-ε)v. Where p is the page rank vector, L is a M × M transition probability matrix with Lji= 1","di . In the page rank equation v is a stochastic normalized vector whose element values are all 1","M . This assigns equal probabilities to all nodes in the graph in case of random jumps. In the personalized page rank formulation the vector v can be non-uniform and can assign stronger probabilities to certain kind of nodes effectively biasing the PageRank vector. In the PTR approach v is modeled to capture the evidence that is available for label l in document d. Doing so biases the walk towards terms that are more specific to labell in the document. This is achieved by considering vertices (terms) that are common between the label l feature vector i.e. f cand","l and the text graph for document d i.e. Gd. More precisely, for a label l associated with a document d, let V l","d denote the intersection of the set Vd with f cand","l , i.e. V l","d = Vd ∩ f cand","l , where Vd","denote the vertex set for the text graph Gd3","and l ∈ l. In this way V l","d indicates the evidence we have","for label l in the text graph Gd. To illustrate this point consider Figure 2. The label specific features for","label P lant P hysiology is shown in Figure 2 (a) denoted as f cand","plant−physiology. The term colored in red 3 Gd is the text graph built for document d using the method outlined in Section 3.2. 1471","indicates the term that is common between f cand plant−physiology and Gd i.e. V plant−physiology d Having identified the nodes (V l","d ) which should be allocated stronger probabilities in v the next step","is to devise a mechanism to determine these probabilities. We experiment with four approaches. In the","first approach, referred to as seed_nodes_only, we allocate all the probability mass in v uniformly to","the nodes in V l","d , all other nodes i.e. nodes ̸∈ V l","d are assigned zero probability. In the second approach, re-","ferred to as the seed_and_eta approach, we keep aside a small fraction η of the probability mass, which","is distributed uniformly to all the nodes ̸∈ V l","d , the rest of the probability mass i.e. 1-η4","is uniformly distributed to all nodes ∈ V l","d . The third approach, referred to as non_unif orm_seed_only, is similar to the seed_nodes_only approach except that in this case the probability mass in v is not allocated uniformly to the nodes in V l","d . Probability mass is allocated to the nodes in proportion to their importance, as indicated by the weights allocated to the feature in f cand","l by the feature selection method used. As we discuss in Section 3.5 the feature selection methods, which are used for generating label specific featuref cand","l , compute weights for individual features in f cand","l . These weights (e.g mutual information score, t-score) indicate the strength of association between the feature and the label. In the non_unif orm_seed_only approach we allocate probability mass to nodes in V l","d in proportion to their feature weights. Finally, in the non_unif orm_eta approach we distribute the probability mass i.e. 1-η amongst the V l","d in proportion to their feature weights. The left probability mass of η is distributed uniformly amongst other nodes ̸∈ V l","d . Performance of these different configurations are evaluated in Section 4.1.","One shortcoming of the PTR approach is that it does not provides a clean mechanism to integrate features from labels other than l which are associated with the document d. The motivation of doing so is to on one hand bias the walk on the text graph towards terms in f cand","l while simultaneously penal-","izing terms which are in Fcand = ∪k̸=l and k∈l f cand k","5",". As shown in Figure 2 (b) not incorporating this","information results in a leakage of scores (indicated using arrows) to nodes not relevant to label l (e.g.","gases, sulphur etc) . In the next section we describe the TRDMS or TextRank using Ranking on Data","Manifold with Sinks approach which allows us to simultaneously consider both f cand","l and Fcand in the same model. 3.4 TRDMS: TextRank using Ranking on Data Manifold with Sinks Algorithm 1: Algorithm for generating label-l specific keyphrases for documentd Data: Document d, label-l specific unigram features fcand","l , unigram features for label categories other than l","represented as Fcand = ∪k̸=land k∈l fcand","k","Result: label-l specific keyphrases from document d","1.

V l","d indicates the evidence we have for label l","in the text graph Gd, where l ∈ l. These vertices are also referred to as query nodes in the ranking on data","manifold literature. Let V ¬l","d denote the intersection of the set Vd with Fcand, where Fcand = ∪k̸=l and k∈l f cand k i.e. all the unigram features associated with label categories other than l6",". These vertices are also referred to as sink nodes in the ranking on data manifold literature. All other vertices are indicated by V q d , where V","q","d = Vd \\ (V ¬l","d ∪ V l","d ) denote the set of points to be ranked. Let p:V → R denote the ranking function which assigns a ranking score pi to each vertex wi in Gd. One can view p as a vector i.e. p = [p1,....,pM ]. A binary vector y = [y1,....,yM ] is defined in whichyi = 1 if wi ∈ V l","d otherwise yi = 0.","Algorithm 1 gives a detailed outline of the TRDMS method. This algorithm is based on the algorithm proposed by (Cheng et al., 2011) for ranking on data manifold with sink points. To generate label-l specific keyphrase for documentd the algorithm considers document d, label-l specific unigram features f cand l , and unigram features for labels other than l represented as Fcand. It begins by first building a text graph Gd. After this an affinity matrix A is constructed. This is shown in Step 2. The affinity matrix A, which captures the similarity between vertices (terms in the text graph) wi and wj, is built using WordNet. We use the popular WordNet::Similarity (Pedersen et al., 2004) package which measures the semantic similarity and relatedness between a pairs of concepts. After symmetrically normalizing A (Step 3) and initializing the query and sink nodes the scores are propagated till convergence (Step 4). The routine converge(p) checks for convergence by comparing the value of p between two consecutive iterations. If there is little or no change in p the routine return true. To generate n-gram keyphrases we follow the approach described in Section 3.2. In Step 6 of Algorithm 1 the kphrasegen7","routine is invoked. In order to choose top-k, label-l specific keyphrases for documentd one can select the firstk elements of the kphrasel","d list. 3.5 Generating label specific features from a multi-label corpus As discussed in previous sections the label specific featuresf cand","l play an important role in the overall ranking process. When searching for label-l specific keyphrases, the unigram featuresf cand","l helps bias the walk on the document’s text graph towards terms that are relevant and central to label l. We also saw that by considering Fcand i.e. unigram features belonging to label categories other than l8","as sink nodes prevents leakage of the ranking score to terms not relevant or central to l. We show through experiments in Section 4 that this improves the quality of label-l specific keyphrases extracted from document d. In order to generate label specific features from a multi-label corpus D we adopt the problem transformation approach commonly used in multi-label learning. In this approach the multi-label corpus D is transformed into | I | single-label data sets, where I is the set of labels associated with corpus D. Post this transformation any single-label feature selection method can be used to extract label l specific features from these single-label data sets. For our setup we experiment with unigram features selected using mutual information and chi-squared based feature selection methods."]},{"title":"4 Experiment","paragraphs":["In order to assess the quality of the label-specific keyphrases generated by our system we conduct a manual evaluation of the generated output. Details of this evaluation are provided in Section 4.1. For our experiments we use a subset of the multi-label corpus EUR-Lex9",". The EUR-Lex text collection is a collection of documents about European Union law. It contains many different types of documents, including treaties, legislation, case-law and legislative proposals, which are labeled with EUROVOC descriptors.

We refer to this data set as the EU R − Lexfiltered data set. We randomly selected 100 documents from the EU R − Lexfiltered data set. Two criteria were considered when selecting these documents (a) Each document should be associated with at least 2 but not more than 3 labels (b) The size of the evidence set i.e. |V l","d | where V l","d = Vd ∩ f l","cand is at least 10% of |Vd|, where Vd represents the vertex set of the text graph associated with d. The resulting data set is referred to as the EU R − Lex keyphrase filtered data set. The reason for enforcing these two criteria is the following. Ensuring that a document in EU R − Lex","keyphrase","filtered has at least 2 labels allows us to experiment with sink nodes i.e. Fcand. As we discuss in Section 4.1 for each label associated with a document, a human evaluator was asked to generates a label specific list of keyphrases. For example, if a document is associated with 3 labels, three label specific keyphrase list had to be generated by the human evaluator. Allowing documents with more than 3 labels makes this process tedious. The reason for putting restriction (b) when building the EU R − Lex keyphrase filtered is explained in Section 4.1.1. For","generating label-l specific features we use the approach described in Section 3.5. For our experiments","mutual information based feature selection method was used with a feature size of 250 i.e. |f cand","l | = 250. 4.1 Label-specific Keyphrase Evaluation Two graduate students were asked to manually extract label-specific keyphrases for each document in the EU R − Lexkeyphrase","filtered data set. At most 10 keyphrases could be assigned to each document-label pair. This results in a total of 1721 keyphrases. The Kappa statistics for measuring inter-agreement among the annotation was 0.81. Any annotation conflicts between the two subjects was resolved by a third graduate student. For evaluation, the automatically extracted label-specific keyphrases for a given document were compared with the manually extracted/annotated keyphrases. Before comparing the keyphrase, the words in the keyphrase were converted to their corresponding base form using word stemming. We calculate three evaluation metrics namely Precision, Recall and F-measure for each document-label pair. Precision (P) = countcorrect","countsystem , Recall (R) = countcorrect","counthuman and F-measure (F) = 2P R","P +R , where countcorrect is the total number of correct keyphrases extracted by our method, countsystem is the total number of automatically extracted keyphrases and counthuman is the total number of keyphrases labeled by the human annotators. These metrics are calculated for each document-label pair in the EU R − Lex","keyphrase","filtered data set and then","averaged to obtain P recisionavg",", Recallavg","and F − measureavg",". These results are shown in Table 1","We compare the performance of our system against the TextRank with Post-Processing: T P Pbaseline","baseline which was explained in Section 2. Briefly, in this setup to identify label- l specific keyphrases in","document d, we run TextRank on document d and filter the generated keyphrase list based onf cand","l i.e.","label l specific features.

For generating the","affinity matrixA, which is used in the TRDMS method, the res semantic similarity method is used12",".

The res measure gave us the best results 1474 l is the set of labels associated with document d) i.e. all the unigram features associated with label categories other than l (as sink nodes). One can observe from Table 1 that for PTR the non_uniform_eta configuration gives the best result. Overall theTRDMS approach significantly outperforms allPTR configurations and our baseline. This validates our belief that one can significantly improve the quality of extracted keyphrase by not only considering label-l specific features i.e. f cand","l but also features associated with label categories other than l. When we analyzed the performance of TRDMS at the document level we observed that the keyphrase extraction metrics for documents which had strongly correlated labels e.g. “ tariff_quota” and “ import_license” was 9-11% lower than the reported average scores. On the contrary, keyphrase extraction metrics for documents which had labels that had no or weak correlation e.g. “ aid_contract” and “ import_license” was 3-5% higher than the reported average scores. One reason for this could be the substantial overlap between f cand","l and Fcand for highly correlated labels. This large overlap results in the query nodes being considered as sink nodes which negatively impacts the score propagation in the underlying text graph.

In different setups we randomly drop out elements from V l d so that the size of the resulting evidence set ranges from 2% to 10% of |Vd|, where |Vd| represents the vertex set size of text graph Gd. We plot the impact this has on the F-measure in Figure 3. One observes that when the evidence set size is in the range 2-4% the gains over the T P Pbaseline baseline (0.177) are low to modest.
