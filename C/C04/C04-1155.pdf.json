Each TCT describes a translation example (a pair of bilingual sentences). It represents the syntactic structure of source language sentence, and more importantly is the facility to specify the correspondences between string (both the source and target sentences) and the representation tree. Furthermore, syntax transformation clues are also encapsulated at each node in the TCT representation to capture the differentiation of grammatical structure between the source and target languages. With this annotation schema, translation examples are effectively represented and organized in the bilingual knowledge database that we need for the Portuguese to Chinese machine translation system."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["The construction of bilingual knowledge base, in the development of example-based machine translation systems (Sato and Nagao, 1990), is vitally critical. In the translation process, the application of bilingual examples concerns with how examples are used to facilitate translation, which involves the factorization of an input sentence into the format of stored examples and the conversion of source texts into target texts in terms of the existing translations by referencing to the bilingual knowledge base. Theoretically speaking, examples can be achieved from bilin-  1 Or bilingual knowledge base, we use the two terms inter-changeably. gual corpus where the texts are aligned in sentential level, and technically, we need an example base for convenient storage and retrieval of examples. The way of how the translation examples themselves are actually stored is closely related to the problem of searching for matches. In structural example-based machine translation systems (Grishman, 1994; Meyers et al., 1998; Watanabe et al., 2000), examples in the knowledge base are normally annotated with their constituency (Kaji et al., 1992) or dependency structures (Matsumoto et al., 1993; Aramaki et al., 2001; Al-Adhaileh et al., 2002), which allows the corresponding relations between source and target sentences to be established at the structural level. All of these approaches annotate examples by mean of a pair of analyzed structures, one for each language sentence, where the correspondences between inter levels of source and target structures are explicitly linked. However, we found that these approaches require the bilingual examples that have ‘parallel’ translations or ‘close’ syntactic structures (Grishman, 1994), where the source sentence and target sentences have explicit correspondences in the sentences-pair. For example, in (Wu, 1995), the translation examples used for building the translation alignments are selected based on strict constraints. As a result, these approaches indirectly limit their application in using the translation examples that are ‘free translation’ to the development of example-based machine translation system. In practice, most of the existing bilingual corpus, the mean-ings of the source sentences are interpreted in target language in the nature of ‘freer’, other than literally translated in a projective manner and stayed as close to the source text as possible, in particular for the languages-pair that are structural divergences, such as Portuguese and Chinese.","As illustrated in Figure 1, the translation of the Portuguese sentence “Onde ficam as barracas de praia?” is interpreted into “更衣室在哪裡? (Where are the bathhouses?)” other than straightly translated to “沙灘帳篷在哪裡 ? (Where are the tents of beach?)”. The translations of the words, i.e. “barracas” and “praia”, of the source sentence do not explicitly appear in target sentence. As a result, in the conventional alignment process, to achieve a fully aligned structural representation for such sentences-pair may be problematic. However, we found that such type of examples is very common. We have investigated around 2100 bilingual examples that are extracted from a grammar book “Gramática da Língua Portuguesa” (Wang and Lu, 1999), and found that 63.4% of examples belong to the discussed case, where the number of unmatched words is more than half the number of words in source sentence. In this paper, we overcome the problem by designing a flexible representation schema, called Translation Corresponding Tree (TCT). We use the TCT as the basic structure to annotate the examples in our example bilingual knowledge base for the Portuguese to Chinese example-based machine translation system. 在 ? Onde ficam as barracas de praia ? 哪裡更衣室 ?  Figure 1.

In TCT structure, the correspondence is made up of three interrelated correspondences: 1) one between the node and the substring of source sentence encoded by the interval SNODE(n), which denotes the interval containing the substring corresponding to the node; 2) one between the subtree and the substring of source sentence represented by the interval STREE(n), which indicates the interval of substring that is dominated by the subtree with the node as root; and 3) the other between the subtree of source sentence and the substring of target sentence expressed by the interval STC(n), which indicates the interval containing the substring in target sentence corresponding to the subtree of source sentence. The associated substrings may be discontinuous in all cases. This annotation schema is quite suitable for representing translation example, where it preserves the strength in describing non-standard and nonprojective linguistic phenomena for a language (Boitet and Zaharin, 1988; Al-Adhaileh et al., 2002), on the other hand, it allows the annotator to flexibly define the corresponding translation substring from the target sentence to the representation tree of source sentence when it is necessary. This is actually the central idea behind the formalism of TCT.

As illustrated in Figure 2, the translation ex-","ample “Onde ficam as barracas de praia?/ 更衣室在哪裡?” is annotated in a TCT structure. Based on the interpretation structure of the source sentence “Onde ficam as barracas de praia?”, the correspondences between the substrings (of source and target sentences) and the grammatical units at different inter levels of the syntactic tree of the source sentence are expressed in terms of sequence intervals. The words of the sentences pair are assigned with their positions respectively, i.e. “Onde (1)”, “ficam (2)”, “as (3)”, “barracas (4)”, “de (5)” and “praia (6)” for the source sentence, as well as for the target sentence. But considering that Chinese uses ideograms in writing without any explicit word delimiters, the process to identify the boundaries of words is considered to be the task of word segmentation (Teahan et al., 2000), instead of assigning indices in word level with the help of word segmentation utility, a position interval is assigned to each character for the target (Chinese) sentence, i.e. “更 (1)”, “衣 (2)”, “室 (3)”, “在 (4)”, “哪 (5)” and “裡 (6)”. Hence, a substring in source sentence that corresponds to the node of its representation is denoted by the intervals encoded in SNODE(n) for the node, e.g. the shaded node, NP, with interval, SNODE(NP)=4, corresponds to the substring “barracas” in source sentence that has the same interval. A substring of source sentence that corresponds to a subtree of its syntactic tree is denoted by the interval recorded in STREE(n) attached to the root of the subtree, e.g. the subtree of the shaded node, NP, encoded with the interval, STREE(NP)=3-6, corresponds to the substring “as barracas de praia” in source sentence. While the translation correspondence between the subtree of source sentence and substring in the target sentence is denoted by the interval assigned to the STC(n) of each node, e.g. the subtree rooted at shaded node, NP, with interval, STC(NP)=1-3, corresponds to the translation fragment (substring) “更衣室” in target sentence."]},{"title":"2.2 Expressiveness of Linguistic Information","paragraphs":["Another inherited characteristic of TCT structure is that it can be flexibly extended to keep various kinds of linguistic information, if they are considered useful for specific purpose, in particularly the linguistic information that differentiating the characteristics of two languages which are structural divergences (Wong et al., 2001). Basically, each node representing a grammatical constituent in the TCT annotation is tagged with grammatical category (part of speech). Such feature is quite suitable for the describing specific linguistic phenomena due to the characteristic of a language. For instance, in our case, the crossing dependencies (syntax transformation rules) for the sentence constituents between Portuguese and Chinese are captured and attached to each node in the TCT structure for a constituent that indicates the order in forming the corresponding translation for the node from the subtrees it dominated. In many phrasal matching approaches, such as constituency-oriented (Kaji et al., 1992; Grishman, 1994) and dependency-oriented (Matsumoto et al., 1993; Watanabe et al., 2000; Aramaki et al., 2001), crossing constraints are deployed implicitly in finding the structural correspondences between pair of representation trees of a source sentence and its translation in target. Here, in our TCT representation, we adopted the use of constraint (Wu, 1995) for a constituent unit, where the immediate subtrees are only allowed to cross in the inverted order. Such constraints, during the phase of target language generation, can help in determining the order in producing the translation for an intermediate constituent unit from its subtrees when the corresponding translation of the unit is not associated in the TCT representation.

In graphical structure annotation, a horizontal line is used to represent the inversion of translation fragments of its immediate subtrees. For example, the translation substring “更衣室在” of the shaded node, VP, can be obtained by inverting the order of the corresponding target translations “在” and “更衣室” from the dominated nodes V and NP. Therefore, such schema can serve as a mean to represent translation examples, and find structural correspondences for the purpose of transfer grammar learning (Watanabe et al., 2000; Matsumoto et al., 1993; Meyers et al., 1998)."]},{"title":"3 Construction of Example Base","paragraphs":["In the construction of bilingual knowledge base (example base) in example-based machine translation system (Sato and Nagao, 1990; Watanabe et al., 2000), translation examples are usually annotated by mean of a pair analyzed structures, where the corresponding relations between the source and target sentences are established at the structural level through the explicit links. Here, to facilitate such examples representation, we use the Translation Corresponding Tree as the basic annotation structure. The main different and advantage of our approach is that it uses a single language parser to process other than two different parsers, one for each language (Tang and Al-Adhaileh, 2001).","In our example base, each translation pairs is stored in terms of an TCT structure. The construction starts by analyzing the grammatical structure of Portuguese sentence with the aid of a Portuguese parser, and a shallow analysis to the Chinese sentence is carried out by using the Chinese Lexical Analysis System (ICTCLAS) (Zhang, 2002) to segment and tag the words with a part of speech. The grammatical structure produced by the parser for Portuguese sentence is then used for establishing the correspondences between the surface substrings and the inter levels of its structure, which includes the correspondences between nodes and its substrings, as well as the correspondences between subtrees and substrings in the sentence. Next, in order to identify and establish the translation correspondences for structural constituents of Portuguese sentence, it relies on the grammatical information of the analyzed structure of Portuguese and a given bilingual dictionary to search the corresponding translation substrings from the Chinese sentence. Finally, the consequent TCT structure will be verified and edited manually to obtain the final representation, which is the basic element of the knowledge base."]},{"title":"3.1 The TCT Generation Algorithm","paragraphs":["In the overall construction processes, the task to compile the syntactic structure of source sentence into the TCT representation by linking the translation fragments from the target sentence is the vital part.

The finding of translation units between the sentences pair is relying on structure tree of Portuguese sentence and the sequences of lexical words from Chinese sentence. Thus, instead of analyzing the Chinese sentence in deep, we analyze the Chinese sentence in the lexical level by using the Chinese Lexical Analysis System (ICTCLAS) (Zhang, 2002). Each Chinese word is delimited with spaces and assigned with a part of speech as illustrated in Figure 5."]},{"title":"Constructing Correspondence Structure for Portuguese Sentence","paragraphs":["After parsing and obtaining the syntactic structure of Portuguese sentence, next step is to compute the correspondences for the structure against the surface strings of the source sentence, which includes the corresponding phrase for a constituent unit in the tree and the corresponding content word that headed the constituent unit, both of these correspondences are denoted by the sequence intervals of the substrings spanning across the sentence fragments. In finding the corresponding phrasal substrings for subtrees, we start associating the lexical words to the corresponding terminal nodes of the structure tree by assigning the related offsets to SNODE(n) and STREE(n) of the nodes. Then we proceed to next upper level constituent units in the tree where the corresponding substrings are derived by connect-ing the lexical words from the nodes in the lower level it dominated. Theoretically, if node, N, has m daughters, N1...Nm, then the sequence interval for N will be STREE(N) = STREE(N1) ∪ STREE(N2) ∪...∪ STREE(Nm), the interval is bounded by spanning nodes of its immediate subtrees. To identify the lexical head for a constituent unit, we use simple rule to determine it by considering the grammatical category of the phrasal unit, and choose the word that owns the same category from the daughter nodes, then as-sign the interval of chosen to SNODE(N).

It makes use of the information about possible lexical correspondences from a bilingual dictionary and the grammatical categories of the lexical words, tagged in previous stage, to generate initial candidate alignments.

Initial candidate alignments of corresponding words.","Based on the possible word correspondences, the associated structure of the Portuguese sentence, together with the grammatical categories information, the search proceeds to align phrases by gradually increasing length (phrasal correspondences in different levels of constituent tree) based on the following criterions.","First, for any un-aligned words sequence “wua” being bounded by aligned words of daughter nodes “wa-left” and “wa-right”, we take the whole fragment “wa-leftwuawa-right” (including the bound-ing words or phrases) as the corresponding substring for the parent node that immediately dominates the daughter nodes, such that STC(N) = STC(Nleft) ∪ STC(Nright).","Second, for the case that the un-aligned fragment is not bounded by any aligned units, our approach relies on the assumption that if two set of sentence constituents (source and target sentences) are corresponding, their grammatical categories as well as the number of constituents should be consistent. The essential idea of the search is to look for inter levels where the constituent units of the structure of Portuguese sentence and the lexical words in Chinese sentence can be projected in one-to-one manner. We use the previous example “Onde ficam as barracas de praia? (Where are the bathhouses?)/ 更衣室在哪裡?” to illustrate the searching strategy. Beside the corresponding lexical items, e.g. “Onde / 哪裡” and “Ficam / 在”, that can be determined with the aid of a given dictionary, the process proceeds bottom-up and searches through the tree by considering only the unmatched items that if the assumption hold or not. For example, at the leaf level, the different numbers of the lexical items (“asDet, barracasN, dePrep, praiaN” and “更衣室N”) violates the assumption. The process repeats the investigation in next upper level in the representation structure of Portuguese sentence. As illustrated in Figure 8, the align
