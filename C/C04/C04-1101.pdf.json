Determining temporal relations relies on the combination of the information, which is explicit or implicit in a language. This paper reports a computational model for determining temporal relations in Chinese. The model takes into account the effects of linguistic features, such as tense/aspect, temporal connectives, and discourse structures, and makes use of the fact that events are represented in different temporal structures. A machine learning approach, Weighted Bayesian Classifier, is developed to map their combined effects to the corresponding relations. An empirical study is conducted to investigate different combination methods, including lexical-based, grammatical-based, and role-based methods. When used in combination, the weights of the features may not be equal. Incorporating with an optimization algorithm, the weights are fine tuned and the improvement is remarkable."," 1 Introduction","Temporal information describes changes and time of the changes. In a language, the time of an event may be specified explicitly, for example “ 他们在 1997 年解决了该市的交通问题 (They solved the traffic problem of the city in 1997)”; or it may be related to the time of another event, for example “修成立交 桥以后, 他们解决了该市的交通问题 (They solved the traffic problem of the city after the street bridge had been built”. Temporal reference describes how events relate to one another, which is essential to natural language processing (NLP). Its major applications cover syntactic structural disambiguation (Brent, 1990), information extraction and question answering (Li, 2002), language generation and machine translation (Dorr, 2002).","Many researchers have attempted to characterize the nature of temporal reference in a discourse. Identifying temporal relations1","between two events de-1 The relations under examined include both intra-sentence and interpends on a combination of information resources. This information is provided by explicit tense and aspect markers, implicit event classes or discourse structures. It has been used to explain semantics of temporal expressions (Moens, 1988; Webber, 1988), to constrain possible temporal interpretations (Hitzeman, 1995; Sing, 1997), or to generate appropriate temporally conjoined clauses (Dorr, 2002).","The purpose of our work is to develop a computational model, which automatically determines temporal relations in Chinese. While temporal reference interpretation in English has been well studied, Chinese has been rarely discussed. In our study, thirteen related features are identified from linguistic perspective. How to combine these features and how to map their combined effects to the corresponding relations are the critical issues to be addressed in this paper.","Previous work was limited in that they just constructed constraint or preference rules for some representative examples. These methods are ineffective for computing purpose, especially when a large number of the features are involved and the interac-tion among them is unclear. Therefore, a machine learning approach is applied and the empirical studies are carried out in our work.","The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces temporal relation representations. Section 3 provides linguistic background of temporal reference and investigates linguistic features for determining temporal relations in Chinese. Section 4 explains the methods used to combine linguistic features with Bayesian Classifier. It is followed by a description of the optimization algorithm which is used for estimating feature weights in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper. 2 Representing Temporal Relations","With the growing interests to temporal information processing in NLP, a variety of temporal systems have been introduced to accommodate the characteristics of temporal information. In order to process temporal reference in a discourse, a formal represen-  sentence relations.   tation of temporal relations is required. Among those who worked on representing or explaining temporal relations, some have taken the work of Reichenbach (Reichenbach, 1947) as a starting point, while others based their works on Allen’s (Allen, 1983).","Reichenbach proposed a point-based temporal the-ory. Reichenbach’s representation associated English tenses and aspects with three time points, namely event time (E), speech time (S) and reference time (R). The reference of E-R and R-S was either before (or after in reverse order) or simultaneous. This the-ory was later enhanced by Bruce who defined seven temporal relations (Bruce, 1972). Given two durative events, the interval relations between them were modeled by the order between the greatest lower bounding point and least upper bounding point of the two events. In the other camp, instead of adopting time points, Allen took intervals as temporal primitives to facilitate temporal reasoning and introduced thirteen basic relations. In this interval-based representation, points were relegated to a subsidiary status as “meeting places” of intervals. An extension to Allen’s theory, which treated both points and intervals as primitives on an equal footing, was later investigated by Knight and Ma (Knight, 1994).","In natural languages, events described can be either punctual or durative in nature. A punctual event, e.g., 爆炸 (explore), occurs instantaneously. It takes time but does not last in a sense that it lacks of a process of change. It is adequate to represent a punctual event with a simple point structure. Whilst, a durative event, e.g., 盖楼 (built a house), is more complex and its accomplishment as a whole involves a process spreading in time. Representing a durative event requires an interval representation. For this reason, Knight and Ma’s model is adopted in our work (see Figure 1). Taking the sentence “修成立交 桥以后, 他们解决了该市的交通问题 (They solved the traffic problem of the city after the street bridge had been built)” as an example, the relation held between building the bridge (i.e., an interval) and solving the problem (i.e., a point) is BEFORE.  Figure 1 13 relations represented with points and intervals 3 Linguistic Background of Temporal Reference in a Discourse 3.1 Literature Review","There were a number of theories in the literature about how temporal relations between events can be determined in English. Most of the researches on temporal reference were based on Reichenbach’s notion of tense/aspect structure, which was known as Basic Tense Structure (BTS). As for relating two events adjoined by a temporal/causal connective, Hornstein (Hornstein, 1990) proposed a neo-Reichenbach structure which organized the BTSs into a Complex Tense Structure (CTS). It has been argued that all sentences containing a matrix and an adjunct clause were subject to linguistic constraints on tense structure regardless of the lexical words included in the sentence. Generally, constraints were used to support syntactic disambiguation (Brent, 1990) or to generate acceptable sentences (Dorr, 2002).","In a given CTS, a past perfect clause should precede the event described by a simple past clause. However, the order of two events in CTS does not necessarily correspond to the order imposed by the interpretation of the connective (Dorr, 2002). Temporal/casual connective, such as “after”, “before” or “because”, can supply explicit information about the temporal ordering of events. Passonneau (Passonneau, 1988), Brent (Brent, 1990 and Sing (Sing, 1997) determined intra-sentential relations by accounting for temporal or causal connectives. Dorr and Gaasterland (Dorr, 2002), on the other hand, studied how to generate the sentences which reflect event temporal relations by selecting proper connecting words. However, temporal connectives can be ambiguous. For instance, a “when” clause permits many possible temporal relations.","Several researchers have developed the models that incorporated aspectual types (such as those distinct from states, processes and events) to interpret temporal relations between clauses connected with “when”. Moens and Steedmen (Moens, 1988) developed a tripartite structure of events2",", and emphasized it was the notion of causation and consequence that played a central role in defining temporal relations of events. Webber (Webber, 1988) improved upon the above work by specifying rules for how events are related to one another in a discourse and Sing and Sing defined semantic constraints through which events can be related (Sing, 1997). The importance of aspectual information in retrieving proper aspects and connectives for sentence generation was also recognized by Dorr and Gaasterland (Dorr, 2002).","Some literature claimed that discourse structures suggested temporal relations. Lascarides and Asher (Lascarides, 1991) investigated various contextual effects on rhetorical relations (such as narration, elaboration, explanation, background and result). They corresponded each of the discourse relations to a kind of temporal relation. Later, Hitzeman (Hitzeman, 1995) described a method for analyzing temporal structure of a discourse by taking into account the effects of tense, aspect, temporal adverbials and rhe-2 The structure comprises a culmination, an associated preparatory process and a consequence state.

A hierarchy of rhetorical and temporal relations was adopted so that they could mutually constrain each other.","To summarize, the interpretation of temporal relations draws on the combination of various information resources, including explicit tense/aspect and connectives (temporal or otherwise), temporal classes implicit in events, or rhetorical relations hidden in a discourse. This conclusion, although drawn from the studies of English, provides the common understanding on what information is required for determining temporal relations across languages.","3.2 Linguistic Features for Determining Tem-","poral Relations in Chinese Thirteen related linguistic features are recognized","for determining Chinese temporal relations in this","paper (See Table 1). The selected features are scat-","tered in various grammatical categories due to the","unique nature of language, but they fall into the fol-","lowing three groups. (1) Tense/aspect in English is manifested by verb inflections. But such morphological variations are inapplicable to Chinese verbs. Instead, they are conveyed lexically. In other words, tense and aspect in Chinese are expressed using a combination of, for example, time words, auxiliaries, temporal position words, adverbs and prepositions, and particular verbs. They are known as Tense/Aspect Markers. (2) Temporal Connectives in English primarily in-volve conjunctions, such as “after” and “before”, which are the key components in discourse structures. In Chinese, however, conjunctions, conjunctive adverbs, prepositions and position words, or their combinations are required to represent connectives. A few verbs that express cause/effect imply a temporal relation. They are also regarded as a feature relating to discourse structure3",". The words which contribute to the tense/aspect and temporal connective expressions are explicit in a sentence and generally known as Temporal Indica-3 The casual conjunctions such as “because” are included in this group.","tors. (3) Event Classes are implicit in a sentence. Events","can be classified according to their inherent tem-","poral characteristics, such as the degree of telicity","and atomicity. The four widespread accepted tem-","poral classes are state, process, punctual event and","developing event (Li, 2002). Based on their","classes, events interact with the tense/aspect of","verbs to determine the temporal relations between","two events.","Temporal indicators and event classes are both referred to as Linguistic Features. Table 1 shows the association between a temporal indicator and its effects. Note that the association is not one-to-one. For example, adverbs affect tense/aspect (e.g. 正, being) as well as discourse structure (e.g. 边, at the same time). For another example, tense/aspect can be jointly affected by auxiliary words (e.g. 过 , were/was), trend verbs (起来, begin to), and so on. Obviously, it is not a simple task to map the combined effects of the thirteen linguistic features to the corresponding relations. Therefore, a machine learning approach is proposed, which investigates how these features contribute to the task and how they should be combined. 4 Combining Linguistic Features with Machine Learning Approach","Previous efforts in corpus-based NLP have incorporated machine learning methods to coordinate multiple linguistic features, for example, in accent restoration (Yarowsky, 1994) and event classification (Siegel, 1998).","Temporal relation determination can be modeled as a relation classification task. We formulate the thirteen temporal relations (see Figure 1) as the classes to be decided by a classifier. The classification process is to assign an event pair to one class according to their linguistic features. There existed numerous classification algorithms based upon supervised learning principle. One of the most effective classifiers is Bayesian Classifier, introduced by Duda and Hart (Duda, 1973) and analyzed in more detail by Langley and Thompson (Langley, 1992).

Note that cases (2) and (3) are ambiguous. The positions of the temporal indicators are the same. But it is uncertain whether these indicators modify the first or the second event if there is no punctuation (such as comma, period, exclamation or question mark) separating their roles. The ambiguity is resolved by using POS information. We assume that an indicator modifies the first event if it is an auxiliary word, a trend word or a position word; otherwise it modifies the second.","Thus, we rewrite )|,...,( 21 ctttP n as ,,...,( 1111 nttP",")|,...,,...,,,..., 4","3","2 441331221 ctttttt nnn , where jn is the total number of the temporal indicators occurring in the position j . 4,3,2,1=j represents the four positions","and nn j j ="]},{"title":"∑","paragraphs":["= 4 1 .

The rationale of grouping will be demonstrated in Section 4.3. 4.3 Experimental Results","Several experiments have been designed to evaluate the proposed Bayesian Classifier in combining linguistic features for temporal relation determination and to reveal the impact of linguistic features on learning performance. 700 instances are extracted from Ta Kong Pao (a local Hong Kong Chinese newspaper) financial version. Among them, 500 are used as training data, and 200 as test data, which are   partitioned equally into two sets. One is similar as training data in class distribution, while the other is quite different. 209 lexical words, gathered from linguistic books and corpus, are used as the temporal indicators and manually marked with the tags given in Table 1. 4.3.1 Impact of Individual Features","From linguistic perspective, the thirteen features (see Table 1) are useful for temporal relation determination. To examine the impact of each individual feature, we feed a single linguistic feature to the Bayesian Classifier learning algorithm one at a time and study the accuracy of the resultant classifier. The experimental results are given in Table 2. It shows that event classes have greatest accuracy, followed by conjunctions in the second place, and adverbs in the third in the close test. Since punctuation shows no contribution, we only use it as a syntactic feature to differentiate cases (2) and (3) mentioned in Section 4.2. 4.3.2 Features in Combination","We now use Bayesian Classifier i
