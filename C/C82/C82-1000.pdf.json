ELSEVIER SCIENCE PUBLISHING COMPANY, INC. 52 Vanderbilt Avenue New York, N.Y. 10017 Printed in Czechoslovakia PREFACE In the course of the almost twenty years of their existence, COLING conferences have become a well-established opportunity to exchange ideas and experience in the rather young, interdisciplinary domain of research of computational linguistics, which attracts attention thanks to the stimuli it offers for deep theoretical studies as well as to the possibilities it provides for applications in various directions. The enormous interest in meetings of this kind is reflected also in the great number of papers submitted for admission for COLING 82 in Prague - the international body of reviewers faced the difficult task to choose only one third of submitted abstracts for presentation as full papers. The contents of this volume is the result of their responsible and uncomprosing work: it presents the collection of full texts of the papers accepted for presentation. The papers reflect the main directions followed by researchers engaged in this field and they give evidence that the field of computational linguistics, even though so difficult to be specified as for the proper domain of its concern, continuously attracts new students. The topics are fairly heterogeneous, but nevertheless the following main domains of interest can be delimited: machine translation efforts, both theoretical and practical, linguistic aspects of artificial intelligence and man-machine communication, questions of knowledge representation, computational linguistics in its relation to theoretical linguistics, to mathematics and computer science, and to information storage and retrieval. The interest in these domains is so large that - in addition to the full papers - about seventy abstracts were accepted as short communications, which will be presented (without any time for discussion, unfortunately) at a session parallel to those of the main papers and to the two workshops, one of which is devoted to the theoretical and practical aspects of automized translation, the other to the tradition of the Prague School of functional-structural linguistics and to some of its present day continuations. Two panel discussions will be organized, one on linguistic processes in man and machine (concerned with new approaches in computational linguistics, artificial intelligence and cognitive science) and the other on the question whether there can be general computational linguistic results within artificial intelligence. J vi Preface The abstracts of the short communications are included in a separate volume, published by Charles University, Prague. COLING 82 takes place in the heart of Europe, in a city of great linguistic tradition, where an international conference on formal linguistic was held already in 1964. Computer facilities may be more easily accessible in many other places, but the spirit of scientific discussions in Prague, we hope, will outweigh this as well as other possible difficulties. I hope that COLING 82 will provide a stimulating and friendly Working atmosphere for all the participants and I and my collegues are looking forward to seeing you in Prague.","Prof. dr.

MESSAGE FROM THE ICCL CHAIRMAN","Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear Colleagues in Computational Linguistics Prague has been selected as the site for the 9th International Conference: COLING-82. The regular participants of COLING conferences may notice that the International Committee tries to arrange it in such a way that many different places in the world become, for a few days, the focus of International Computational Linguistics. Last time, in Tokyo, many participants came from Japan; this time, it will be easier for European scientists, especially for those coming from Eastern Europe, to join. Obviously, I wish that as many colleagues as possible will come, from the most eastern parts of Asia as well as from the most western and southern parts of America. It will be a pleasure to be welcomed by our friends from Czechoslovakia, who have organized COLING-82 very nicely. The work to be performed by our hosts during the Conference is appreciated, as this can be seen; however, the hidden, time-consuming and difficult tasks during the months before the opening session are always underestimated. For such a successful result, I would like to convey to our hosts, on behalf of the ICCL, the gratitude of all those participating. Vive COLING. B. VAUQUOIS XV"]}]}
