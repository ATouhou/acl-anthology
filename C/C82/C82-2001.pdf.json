{"sections":[{"title":"PREFACE","paragraphs":["The Programme Committee of COLING 82, held in Prague on July 5th to July 10th, 1982, decided to organize, along with the sessions of full papers, also a parallel session of short communications. This decision was induced by the fact that according to the views of the international body of reviewers it was difficult to reduce the number of papers offered - 221 submitted abstracts - to the number admissible - 81 papers only, which, among other, is s doubtless evidenc~ that these regular biannual meetings have already gained good reputation and wide popularity.","The publication of abstracts included in this volume should serve three purposes: first, it gives an opportunity to acquaint the participants, at least in a brief form, with results achieved in various domains of computational linguistics all over the world (the contributors come from 22 countties), second, it should enable the authors to focus their attention in the short time slotted for their presentation to issues they consider most importaat and to leave aside an overall exposition, which is included in the abstract, and third, the abstracts published may serve as a good base for informal discussions \"in the corridors\" during the conference.","The abstracts are arranged here in alphabetical order; however, we attempted to schedule the programme itself in such a way that contributions with closely related topics were put together in one block, which should not coincide with the correspondin~ block in the main sessions. As for the topics, the contributions fall into seven groups: question answering and artificial intelligence -Wednesday morning, machine translation - Wednesday noon, gremmatico-semantic -9analysis - Thursday morning, information retrieval end linguistic date bases - Friday early morning, knowledge representation - Friday late morning, general aspects of computational linguistics - Friday noon, linguistics - Friday afternoon.","Since the decision to organize a session of short communications was made only in the course of the preparation of the programme, it ~ss necessary to publish their abstracts in the form in which they were submitted to the programme committee, without much editorial work and authors* revisions. Nevertheless, we hope that this volume, together with the Proceedings (containing the full texts of the main papers) co-published by North Holland and Academia, Prague, will contribute to the fruitfulness of the conference discussions.
