An Application is a \"complete package\" including any processing necessary to setup documents for TIPSTER processing and the User interface component. An Application may contain a Detection Component, Extraction Component or Clustering Component or any combination thereof. Compiled Query is the Detection Component specific form of a query generated by a Detection Component from a Statement of Relevance and is understandable only by the Detection Component. Component is equivalent to a Computer System Component (CSC) in the conventional life-cycle definition. A CSC is a distinct part of a Computer Software Component Item(CSCI). CSCs may be further decomposed into other CSCs and CSUs. A detection component is an example of a CSC. The size, function and complexity of an item is a guide to calling the item a 'component'. Components are major parts of an Application; they are built from modules. Note: The use of the term 'component' in the Architecture Design Document is in a different context, namely, part of the structure of a generic object. Detection Component is a component that selects documents from a Collection based upon the Detection Criteria. Detection Criteria is the User statement of information need and may include Selection Statements, short form free text queries, Boolean keyword queries or example documents Document Attribute is a characteristic of a document as represented by a single specific value or a set of values of the same type e.g., date received or authors. Document Collection is an unordered set of documents. Document List is an ordered list of document identifiers and optional document attributes or computational result for each list entry."]},{"title":"307 Extraction Component","paragraphs":["is a component that selects information from a document or a list of documents based upon the Template structure, Fill Rules and Patterns. Fill Rules are a collection of criteria which describe the constraints used to select information for Template slots and the conditions under which Template Objects are instantiated. The specific formats for the fills is also included. Module is equivalent to a Computer System Unit (CSU) in the conventional life-cycle definition. A CSU is an element specified in the design of a CSC that is separately testable. A parser is an example of a module. Modules are used to build components. Generally modules are composed of no more than 300 lines of code."]},{"title":"Multi-lingual","paragraphs":["is considered to be multiple languages in one document or multiple documents in different languages."]},{"title":"Pattern","paragraphs":["is an expression of a specific form that is used for matching text during the Extraction process."]},{"title":"Query","paragraphs":["is the Detection Component specific form of a query generated by a Detection Component in the component's unique structure and language.

The goal of Persistent Knowledge is to further the use of common knowledge items as new Applications are built. A significant pay-off may accrue through common usage, particularly in the development of operational Applications. It is recognized that there may be some reduction in capability when common knowledge items are used in an Application instead of unique, customized knowledge items; however, the history of other technical areas indicates that common items and sharing has merit and possible pay-off. Generally, Persistent Knowledge is that knowledge which is retained from one run to the next of an Application(s). However, there are degrees of persistency. Some items, such as, lexicons, gazetteers, glossaries, dictionaries, marking rules and grammars rules, are comparatively stable, subject to normal maintenance operations. A Query Library, on the other hand, may be modified frequently. Results from Detection, Extraction or User actions may be used to modify the items in the Persistent Knowledge Repository. Specific algorithms, even those which use items in the Persistent Knowledge Repository, are not considered part of the Repository, but instead are included in the particular instance of an implemented requirement; however, the structure of the particular knowledge item is an Architectural item. It should be noted that while Persistent Knowledge requires a place to keep knowledge items and the format of the item or storage area, not all items must be completely filled initially under the TIPSTER project. Some items will be filled, grow or be augmented as Applications are implemented under the Architecture. As a minimum the format and access method of each Persistent Knowledge item shall be established.

The statistical, linguistic and semantic analysis performed by Detection and Extraction may be considered the key work of TIPSTER processing.

This is accomplished by applying Persistent Knowledge information in conjunction with matching algorithms, annotations and template/pattern matching techniques to reduce a Document Collection to the desired sub-set or to extract information from the Document Collection. This sub-set or its extracted information is then presented to the user, passed to other components or stored for later use. The analytical methods and tools representative of the techniques to be applied to this functional area are given in Appendix B; however, this list should not be considered either exhaustive or restrictive.

The priority can be scaled, based on where in the document the match occurs. If several such portions of the query match, then an algorithm can combine priorities to get a net priority for the document.
