The CM process will document the conformance of each TIPSTER application to the Architecture Design Document and with any applicable APIs. The most important affect of the CM process will be to promote modular substitution, software re-use, and reduced risk of project planning. This will allow for the orderly upgrading of installed systems as technology improves in the future. It will also facilitate the sharing of developed software between Government agencies and offices."]},{"title":"1.2 TIPSTER Application Conformance Assessment Document","paragraphs":["The CM review process, described in detail below, will result in a document which details the ways in which an application or vendor product conforms to the Architecture Design Document and is in agreement with the TIPSTER Architecture design. This document is a TIPSTER Application Conformance Assessment Document (TACAD). In order for an application or vendor product to successfully acquire a TACAD, the following conditions must be met: For TIPSTER Application development:","• The TIPSTER Application development complies with the TIPSTER CM process, the details which are contained in this document. In short, the TIPSTER Application must undergo a Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and a Final Operating Capability (FOC) review. At these reviews, any discrepancy or deviation from the TIPSTER Architecture must be documented and justified/explained.","• Any new code or capabilities for the TIPSTER Application must be developed in accordance with the TIPSTER Architecture. Failure to do so will be documented and justified in the TACAD.","• To the extent possible and in the Government's best interest, existing code and capability to be incorporated into the TIPSTER Application will be re-engineered in accordance with the TIPSTER Architecture. Failure to do so will be documented and justified in the TACAD. For Vendor Products:","• If the vendor's product is used in a TIPSTER Application, the criteria stated above in \"For TIPSTER Application development\" will apply.","• A vendor's product may be determined to be TIPSTER compliant with the use of a TACAD independent of actually being part of a TIPSTER Application. To support the development of this TACAD, the vendor will demonstrate, by inspection, module-by-module compliance with the TIPSTER Architecture. On the basis of the TACAD, the Configurations Control Board (CCB) will determine that a TIPSTER Application is conformant or non-conformant, if it exhibits sufficient overlap with the Architecture Design Document. The extent of TIPSTER Conformance will be determined on a \"per module\" basis and documented in the TACAD. As a result of the TIPSTER Application reviews (described in section 1.2, below) a summary matrix will be available as shown in Appendix A, Figure A-I, below."]},{"title":"345","paragraphs":["The TACAD may be used by Vendors to facilitate teaming with other Vendors or insertions of new capability into existing TIPSTER systems."]},{"title":"1.3 Configuration Management in a TIPSTER Application LifeCycle","paragraphs":["The TIPSTER CM process imposes two control gates, PDR and FOC, on the TIPSTER Application development lifecycle, as shown in Figure 1-2. In preparation for these control gates, it is expected that the developing contractor and the SE/CM will work together to prepare the documentation and to identify any discrepancies between the Architecture Design and the TIPSTER Application's design. This cooperation will be in the form of an Engineering Review Board (ERB). At the PDR control gate, the following TIPSTER Application documentation is expected to be put in the TACAD and under TIPSTER CM control: • 1. TIPSTER Application Design Documentation.","• 2. Documentation detailing any design discrepancy or deviations from the TIPSTER Architecture on a per-module basis. This document will also justify or explain the discrepancy or deviations found.","• 3. Any Requests For Change (RFC) to the TIPSTER Architecture to cover the discrepancy or deviations in the TACAD. At the FOC control gate, the following are expected to be put in the TACAD and under TIPSTER CM control: • 1. TIPSTER Application As-Built Documentation.","• 2. Documentation detailing any as-built discrepancy or deviations from the TIPSTER Architecture. This document will also explain the discrepancy or deviations.","• 3. Any Requests For Change (RFC) to the TIPSTER Architecture to cover the discrepancy or deviations.

In practice, the Architecture Committee will appoint a small group of people to sit on the Configuration Control Board (CCB) to examine, in detail, the documentation and justifications provided at the PDR and FOC control gates. The CCB will then make a recommendation to the Architecture Committee as to whether or not the control gate has been satisfied. The specifics of how to run the CCB and the control gates are given in Section 3.0, below. The CCB will assign and use an Engineering Review Board (ERB) to compile the documentation necessary for the CCB's review. The ERB will be comprised of the SE/CM and the developing contractor's representatives. The specifics of how to run the ERB are given in Section 3.0, below. Discrepancies will originate from the ERB and will primarily be presented by the developing contractor's representatives. The discrepancies will be submitted to the CCB for disposition, which can be one of the following:","• An RFC can be initiated to incorporate the discrepancy as a change to the Architecture Design Document.","• The discrepancy can be \"Noted and Documented\".

However, incorporating the various algorithms and methods into usable applications under one TIPSTER Architecture requires close control and documentation of the constituent parts that comprise the TIPSTER II Architecture. This assumption is based on the following points:","• The detection and extraction systems were not developed to work together, although many important text processing tasks require interaction between detection and extraction technologies.","• Applications produced under Phase I have not been tested against the variety of tasks and natural languages that must be handled. The Government cannot treat every application requirement for natural language processing as a separate system; deployable systems must be flexible enough to handle a variety of tasks and languages with only minor modifications.","• Existing systems at both a component and module level implement similar functionality very differently. Standardizing on the Architecture and interfaces of a core set of such components and modules, so that they can be reused in many applications on many platforms, is the purpose of the TIPSTER Text Phase II Program. Specialized functions can have standard interfaces to operate with these core functions. This functional modularization will support the interoperability and flexibility that the Government believes is necessary to handle the variety and breadth of its text processing tasks. It will also reduce acquisition and maintenance costs and allow for the orderly expansion of an application's capability once deployed. Finally, functional modularization will support and advance the research community by making available a standardized, basic text handling architecture; no longer will an architecture have to be invented for every new experiment. 2,2 SE/CM Role Within the Overall"]},{"title":"TIPSTER Framework","paragraphs":["The TIPSTER II SE/CM effort involves supporting the Government in overseeing the development of an open architecture and integration of components and modules for comprehensive text handling capabilities. This will allow processing of character streams and text databases from many disparate sources through content detection and data base or knowledge base update. In addition, tools and interfaces for configuring architecture components to particular applications must be integrated and managed. Key issues in the development of the architecture requirements are defining the functions to be performed, the specific requirements of components and modules to perform each such function, particularly their input, output, and interface specifications, and also specifying an open architecture for integrating all components and modules. Key issues in the development of the Architecture itself are standardizing, documenting, and disseminating the module functional and interface specifications. The role of the SE/CM contractor is best understood within the context of the overall TIPSTER framework. This framework includes three separate but interrelated set of activities: the SE/CM effort; the Architecture efforts; and the Demonstration Activities. Figure 2-1 depicts the respective functions of each activity set, and their interrelationships. The figure highlights the communications between SE/CM and the other activities, which will typically be in the form of architecture component requirements or description documents, and completed software modules."]},{"title":"349 ","paragraphs":["rchitecture Rqmts\"~ Definition ..)",".

The SE/CM will assist the Government in evaluating architectures proposed by TIPSTER II contractors. Later, as demonstration prototypes are initiated, their requirements must be analyzed to determine the adequacy of the existing architecture, and to define necessary or desirable enhancements. Throughout this iterative process, the SE/CM will perform configuration identification activities including configuration definition, establishment of the Architecture baseline, review of applicable documentation and processing of Architectural changes. These activities will occur throughout the refinement effort and life of the Architecture. The SE/CM will work with the senior technical designers and engineers from all of the TIPSTER II teams to identify the Configuration Items (CIs). CM is responsible for gathering, storing, and presenting the current status of each configuration item. 2.3 Purpose of the CM Plan The purpose of this plan is to establish guidelines, responsibilities, methods and procedures for CM for the TIPSTER Text Phase II Architecture. Specific procedures for CM are in related Configuration Management Procedures (CMPs). CM is intended to provide a stable and consistent definition of the TIPSTER Architecture. 2.4 Scope of the CM Plan The scope of this plan encompasses anything related to the TIPSTER Architecture. As such, CM will be in effect during the life of the Architecture and will be primarily concerned with the documentation which describes the Architecture. It will not be applied to the software produced by the developers; CM for that software is the responsibility of the individual contractor. The CM process is expected to become active at such time as the first Architecture baseline is established and CM will remain active throughout the life of the Architecture. The CM process will monitor and control changes to the Architecture. Normally, changes to the baseline will be initiated when an TIPSTER Application has been designed and the PDR identifies potential deficiencies in the Architecture."]},{"title":"350","paragraphs":["Request For Changes (RFC) will go through the CM process and ultimately be approved by the Architecture Committee. It is expected that the TIPSTER Architecture will continuously be undergoing growth and change. It is therefore vital that the CM process be able to reconstruct the exact state of the TIPSTER Architecture at any given date in the past. Changes are categorized as either Class I, which is a change to the current Architecture baseline, or Class II, which is all other changes, such as correction of document typographical errors, resolution of ambiguities, and changes that clearly do not qualify as a Class I. Deviations are defined as discrepancies wherein an application does not conform to the particular Architectural standard."]},{"title":"2.5 CM Plan Synopsis","paragraphs":["In addition to what was already noted in Section 1.2, this CM Plan defines the configuration management activities and philosophy required to support the TIPSTER Text Phase II Architecture throughout its entire life cycle.
