The conference was sponsored by the Advanced Research Projects Agency, Software and Intelli\\ gent Systems Technology Office (Thomas Crystal, Program Manager) and was organized \\ by the MUC-5 program committee : Beth Sundheim, chair (NCCOSC/NRaD), Sean Boisen (BBN), Lynn Carlso\\ n (DoD), Nancy Chinchor (SAIC), Jim Cowie (CRL/NMSU), Ralph Grishman (NYU),\\ Jerry Hobbs (SRI), Joe McCarthy (UMass), Mary Ellen Okurowski (DoD), Boyan Onyshkevych (Do\\ D), Lisa Rau (GE), an d Carl Weir (UNISYS) .","The topic of the conference was performance assessment of text analysis \\ software systems designed to extract information from free text, Prior to the conference,\\ systems were developed and tested on information extraction performance in the domains of joint\\ business ventures and/or microelectronic chip fabrication in English and/or Japanese . The conference wa s attended by representatives of organizations that participated in the ev\\ aluation, Government representatives, and other invited guests . Sessions included a tutorial on informatio n extraction offered by Ralph Grishman (NYU), introductions to the infor\\ mation extraction evaluation tasks by Boyan Onyshkevych and Mary Ellen Okurowski (DoD), a paper describing a \"generic\" information extraction system by Jerry Hobbs (SRI), papers o\\ n systems and test results given by the participating organizations in the evaluation, syst\\ em demonstrations, presentations on the evaluation design and overviews of the test results\\ by Beth Sundheim (NCCOSCINRaD), Nancy Chinchor (SAIC), Mary Ellen Okurowski (DoD), \\ Boyan Onyshkevyc h (DoD), and Craig Will (IDA), workshops on special topics with presen\\ tations by some of the evaluation participants, and discussion meetings to critique the evaluat\\ ion and make recommendations for future evaluations .","MUC-5 was closely associated with phase one of the ARPA Tipster Text Pro\\ gram. Some o f the papers in this volume appear also in a published report on Tipster . Those papers ar e identified in this volume at the beginning of the section in which they \\ appear. 1"]},{"title":"TABLE OF CONTENT S Preface PAPERS : INFORMATION EXTRACTION TAS K Corpora and Data Preparation\\t","paragraphs":["1 L.
