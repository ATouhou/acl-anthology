The key template lists only two tie-ups, as follows : a) between Toukyou Kaijou Kasai Hoken and Daiwa Shouken , b) between Nisshin Kasai Kaijou Hoken, Douwa Kasai Kaijou Hoken and Yamaichi Shouken . In the case of b) above, a \"common sense\" reading of the text would probably argue that separate tie-up agreements are planned between Nisshin Kasai and Yamaichi, and between Douwa Kasai and Yamaichi . However, there is no clear textual evidence to support this interpretation completely over the interpretation where all three companies tie u p together. Therefore, in the case of b) above, the analysts felt that the best interpretation was to instantiate a single tie - up, since there is no explicit linguistic evidence in the text to indicate that these were separate tie-ups. (1) How does your system determine whether there is a reportable tie-up ? (2) In Article 0002, how many tie-ups were found? What strategies are used to determine the number of tie-ups in Sentence 2 ? ENTITIES (3) How does your system determine the entities in a tie-up? (4) How many discourse entities were identified anywhere in the text, and how did the system determine which of thes e were reportable? (5) Explain any difficulties you had in identifying the following : a) the correct number of reportable entities b) the correct number of tie-ups (correct, for the sake of this walk-through allows BOTH interpretation s described in b) above, even though the key template does not . ) c) the correct links between reportable entities and reportable tie-ups . (6) How does your system determine aliases for entities ? (7) What problems were there in detecting the alias for the ENTITY named Toukyou Kaijou Kasai Hoken ? OTHER SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ARTICL E (8) Sentence 2 ends with a general statement about products developed in tie-ups between insurance companies an d securities companies. How would your system determine that this is a generic, not a specific reference ? (9) Discuss any specific analysis your system does to handle teens like \"ryousha\", which appears in Sentence 2. How does your system deal with the usage of the particle \"no\" that precedes it ? 359"]},{"title":"4.
