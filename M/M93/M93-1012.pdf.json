(LSI) believes that the best system for producing a complete and accurate automate d analysis of natural language text is an in-depth text understanding system that employs linguistic as wel l as other analytical techniques to interpret the text . Our DBG (Data Base Generation) natural language processing system performs full-scale linguistic analysis of text in order to produce a system-internal text - level representation of the content of the text . This representation is composed of a set of entity and event frame structures, interrelated to reflect the organization and content of the text . This representation of the text can then be mapped into any data structure required by a downstream application, such as th e templates specified for the MUC-5/Tipster applications . DBG has been designed as a single core syste m for handling texts of different types in different domains for a variety of applications . Application types for which DBG has provided the input include information extraction and database generation tasks suc h as MUC-5, message fusion (the combination of information derived from various kinds of sources, includin g text ; see [1]), and the translation of text into another language using spoken input and output ([2]) .","It is clear to us that our DBG system, while achieving MUC-5 results comparable to EME scores attaine d by Tipster contractors in the MUC-5 tests, is still far from achieving the level of performance that we believ e is possible for it . LS I 's official MUC-5 P&R score for English Microelectronics (EME) texts was 42 .74, which represents a considerable improvement over our MUC-4 P&R score of 18 .87 on TST3 . As we continue t o incorporate improved versions of the various components of our natural language processing system (Figure 1 ) and to exploit more fully the capabilities of existing components, we expect that our scores will continue t o improve .","Founded upon research performed over the last twenty years, the DBG system has been under actua l development for the last seven years . The basic architecture of the core system has remained the same ove r that time . Because the system is modular, the individual modules can be redesigned and updated withou t affecting the rest of the system . Most of the current modules have been redesigned or extended within th e last three years .","1 Support for MUC-5 final testing was provided by the Army Research Laboratory/SLCBR-SE-C, under Contract No . DAAA15-89-C-0004 (Subcontract No . 05-562-01 to Logicon, Inc .) Also, we gratefully acknowledge the assistance of Andrew Brislen and Michael Possedi from Sun Microsystems, and Carrie Du Bois from Quintus, during the final testing period . 121 a) 0) a )"]},{"title":"C Y o u) as 122 INNOVATIVE ASPECTS OF THE SYSTE M","paragraphs":["Among the innovative aspects of the DBG system as used for MUC-5 are a flexible frame-based concep t hierarchy that is accessible at every stage of processing ; a principle-based syntactic parser which enables th e identification of sentence-level event-entity relations very early in processing ; an integrated ability to handl e incomplete information and structures ; and the frame-based text-level representation mentioned above whic h allows for intersentential reference resolution and for the explicit representation of the event-entity relation s and implicit content of the text . These relations were then easily mapped into EME templates .","LSI's main area of development for MUC-5 was the extension of the knowledge contained in the concep t hierarchy and the use of this knowledge at every stage of processing . Although the frame-based hierarchy was a component of the DBG system as early as MUCK-2, it was not exploited significantly until MUC-5 . This, more than any other factor, was responsible for the increase in our performance over MUC-4 . Each item in the lexicon is associated with a concept frame, as illustrated in Figure 2 . The frames or concept node s bear \" isa\" (set membership) relations to other concepts in the hierarchy . During lexical analysis, the lexical items in the text are linked to concepts in the hierarchy . These concept links then provide the framewor k for producing the set of instantiated concept frames and links (the frame-based text-level representation ) which is the final output of internal DBG processing . The frame-based concept hierarchy also allows fo r semantic checking at any point in processing and provides a mechanism for the inheritance of features an d other information to direct descendants in the hierarchy.","A related innovative DBG component is the Word Acquisition Module (WAM), which uses morphologica l analysis to provide grammatical category information for words for which no lexical entry exists . Based o n the category assignment, a lexical entry and an \"isa\" link to a concept frame are automatically generate d for each unknown item to allow complete processing of all sentences containing unknown words .","The DBG syntactic parser as implemented for MUC-5 has a number of innovative aspects . The parser is to a great extent language-independent ; it produces structures which reflect the partial isomorphism holding between syntactic and semantic structures in order to increase accuracy of processing . While the goal is to produce complete parses, the parser is also robust enough to produce usable partial parses in the absence o f a complete parse .","The design of the LSI parser is based on the Government-Binding theory of syntax . It is essentiall y a head-driven parser, and includes both bottom-up and expectation-based aspects . Argument structures associated with lexical items are projected into the syntax . Syntactic structure is determined from bot h item-specific lexical requirements as well as general requirements on syntactic structures (e .g ., all sentence s in languages like English require a subject) . The use of empty categories and syntactic chains, combine d with knowledge of event types contained in the concept hierarchy, enables the parser to associate themati c roles with entities expressed in noun phrases in a variety of construction types correctly and in a relativel y straightforward manner . Constructions which are usually assumed to include empty categories (i .e ., phonetically null syntactic elements) include passives, embedded infinitival sentences, questions, and relative clauses . The rationale for this assumption is that in constructions of this type, words (usually verbs) whic h typically require either an external argument (an argument in the specifier position), or an internal argumen t (an argument in complement position) appear with no appropriate argument in one of these positions . Sinc e syntactic structures are characterized as \"projections\" of lexical items, these positions are assumed to b e latently present, and linked to a phonetically realized argument in some other position via coindexing . Th e phonetically realized argument and the empty category thus form a syntactic \"chain\" . By using these chains , we can associate the usual thematic roles assigned to certain positions with a given overt noun phrase, eve n if the overt phrase is not in the usual position . So adherence to certain grammatical principles in conjunctio n with a well-engineered event knowledge base has enabled us to get something \"for free\", as it were, in th e MUC-5 task .","Several of the innovative aspects of the DBG frame-based text-level knowledge representation, whic h we will here call the LSI templates (as distinct from the MUC-5 application-oriented EME templates ) were not used extensively for MUC-5 . These include the ability to combine contextual information – e .g . , 123"]},{"title":"*lithography * %% \\t \"lithography\" is a process following layering, where th e %% \\t pattern of a circuit is rendered onto the layered surface . %% \\t It is done by exposing the surface to certain types o f %% \\t light/radiation . 0O %*lithography * % \\t isa : microelectronics proces s % \\t end_product : *device * % \\t process_granularity : device_structure_granularit y % \\t process_equipment : microelectronics_equipmen t '*lithography*' ( isa(microelectronics_process) , slotorder(name, definiteness, quantity, type, description , process product, end product, process material , process_actions, process_conditions , process_ equipment, process_granularity, device , 'fp name', head_fp_id, display(no)) , muc5_vct(m5_litho) , muc5_type('UNKNOWN') , related_equipment(lithography_system) , type(specifier('*lithography*')) , noun(lithography) , adj(lithographic)) . silicon oxid e %silicon oxid e % \\t isa : insulator — fil m % \\t comment : An insulator film resulting from the exposure o f % \\t the silicon surface in oxidation, chemical vapo r % \\t deposition, or sputtering . silicon oxide ( isa(insulatorfilm) , chemical_symbol('SiO') , muc5_type('SILICON_OXIDE') , noun('SiO', mstem(no_plural)) , noun ('silicon oxide')) .

Although these aspects of DBG are important in processing written and even transcribed voice messages i n the Air Force and Army messages to which the system has been applied, the MUC-5 application does no t depend heavily on outside information, and is not concerned with evaluation of the information received , and is characterized by more variability in information structure across texts .","The relational organization of the DBG event and entity templates, however, was extremely useful i n MUC-5 processing . Because it resembles the object-oriented organizational structure of the EME templates , the generation of EME template relations was relatively straightforward . Also, the thematic roles of th e entity templates in relation to the events is explicit in the LSI templates and so can be easily associate d with the role-specific slots (e .g ., manufacturer, distributor) in the EME templates . In addition, the ability to establish co-reference at the text level in the LSI templates prevents overgeneration of EME template s and facilitates the correct template linkage . In the next section, the basic processing is described and illustrated by an example sentence . ."]},{"title":"SYSTEM MODULES AND PROCESSING STAGE S Because the DBG system modules and the processing of text have been previously described in detail ([3] , [4]), we will here present only a brief summary of processing and then show a short example sentence to illustrate the innovative aspects of our system discussed in the previous section . The basic components of the DBG system are shown in the system diagram in Figure 1 . They are the preprocessing module, the lexical analysis module, the syntactic parse module, the semantic parse module , and the knowledge representation module . An additional module, the application interface, maps the extracted knowledge into appropriate data structures according to the requirements of a given downstrea m application . Processing is sequential–the output of each module is a data structure that serves as input to th e succeeding module and is then available to all later modules . Each module contains a processing mechanism and a knowledge base that includes general as well as domain-sensitive knowledge . The respective knowledg e bases, indicated in ovals, are the lexicon and morphological rules, the set of grammatical principles used t o construct the syntactic parse trees, the concept hierarchy, the discourse rules, and the rules for mapping int o external data structures . As described in the previous section, at the stage of lexical analysis, the lexica l items in the text are linked to nodes in the concept hierarchy, which enables information derived from the concept hierarchy to be used at any point in processing . Sample lexical items are shown in Figure 2 . In addition to the basic components, the DBG system has an Unexpected Inputs (UX) Subsystem tha t handles new or erroneous data and evaluates and records system performance . This subsystem consists of modules that are integrated into the system modules ; they are shown in the system diagram as small boxes inside the larger modules to which they apply. The two UX modules of the DBG system that were use d for MUC-5 are the Lexical Unexpected Inputs (LUX) module and the Word Acquisition Module (WAM) , both of which apply at the Lexical Analysis stage . The LUX module corrects errors by attempting partia l matches between unmatched words in the text and items in the lexicon, using rules based on certain erro r hypotheses . As mentioned previously, new or unidentified words are passed on to WAM, wherein word clas s information is assigned based on morphological analysis . To illustrate the processing, the lexical analysis, syntactic parse, and semantic parse for an exampl e sentence are shown in Figure 3, and the LSI internal templates for the same sentence, are shown in Figure 4 . The sentence used is the first sentence of the example text 2606871, i .e ., \"Hampshire Instruments has sol d an x-ray lithography system to AT&T Bell Laboratories .\" The syntactic parse is created by projecting lexical items into elementary phrasal trees, which are the n linked according to subcategorization and selectional requirements, as well as general principles of grammar . 125 TEXT OF EXAMPLE SENTENC E Hampshire Instruments has sold an x-ray lithography system to AT&T Bel l Laboratorie s LEXICAL ANALYSIS OF EXAMPLE SENTENC E 1 \\t lxi(noun,'Hampshire Instruments','Hampshire Instruments',[],[],[],[] , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , [hampshireinstruments inc] ) 2 \\t lxi(aux,has,has, [perf], [p(3),n(s)], [T, [], [xp('-agr','+past') ] , ['+agr','-past'], [], [has] ) lxi (third Ares, has, have, [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , [strict (np) ] , [ ' +agr' , ' -past' ] , [ ] , [have] ) 3 \\t lxi (past, sold, sell, [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , [strict (np, bi_np (to) , np_prpt) ] , ['+agr','+past'],[],[sell] ) lxi (pastpart, sold, sell, [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , [strict (np, bi_np (to) , np_prpt) ] , ['-agr','+ ast'],[],[sell] ) 4 \\t lxi(det,an,an, []p , [], [], [], [strict (gp,ap,np)], [], [], [an] ) 5 \\t lxi(noun,'x-ray','x-ray', [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [x_ray] ) 6 \\t lxi (noun, 'lithography system', 'lithography system' , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , [],[lithography_system] ) 7 \\t lxi(prep,to,to, \\t [], [strict (argp) ], [], [], [to] ) lxi(to,to,to, [l, [], [], [], [l, [], [], [to] ) 8 \\t lxi(noun,'AT&T Bell Laboratories','AT&T Bel l Laboratories', [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [a_t_and t bell_labs] ) SYNTACTIC PARSE OF EXAMPLE SENTENC E 'Cmaxl' :","paragraphs":["Cmax(Cbar(C ,","Imax(Nmax(Nbar(N(['Hampshire Instruments') :noun))) ,","Ibar (I (+agr , -past) , Aspmax(Aspbar(Aux([has] :aux) ,","Vmax(Vbar(Vbar(V([sold] :pastpart) ,","Dmax(Dbar(D([an] :det) ,","Nmax(Nbar(N(( x-ray'] : noun) ,","Nmax(Nbar(N(['lithography system'] :noun)))))))) ,","Pmax(Pbar(P([to] :prep) , Nmax(Nbar(N(['AT&T Bell Laboratories'] :noun))))))))))))) ."]},{"title":"SEMANTIC PARSE OF EXAMPLE SENTENC E fpl : 'MAINPRED'('1 .0') _ 'INDEX'('1 .1' ) 'SUBJECT/AGENT'('1 .1') = 'INDEX'('1 .2' ) 'NOUN/HAMPSHIRE INSTRUMENTS INC' \\t = 'Hampshire Instruments ' 'TENSE'('1 .1') _ 'PRESENT PERFECT ' 'VOICE'('1 .1') = 'ACTIVE ' 'PREDICATE/SELL'('1 .1') = sel l 'OBJECT/PATIENT'('1 .1') = 'INDEX'('1 .3' ) 'DETERMINER'('1 .3') = a n 'NOUN QUALIFIER/X RAY'('1 .3') = 'x-ray ' 'NOUN/LITHOGRAPHY SYSTEM'('1 .3') = 'lithography system ' 'PREPOSITIONAL PHRASE/RECIPIENT'('1 .1') = 'INDEX'('1 .4' ) 'PREPOSITION'('1 .4') = t o 'PREP OBJECT'('1 .4') = 'INDEX'('1 .5' ) 'NOUN/A T AND T BELL LABS'('1 .5') _ 'AT&T Bell Laboratories ' Figure 3 : DBG Analysis of Sample Sentenc e 126","paragraphs":["Among the principles which are most important in the current version of the parser are the projectio n principle, which constrains which positions in the tree can be assigned thematic roles, the extended projectio n principle, which attempts to link every clause to a subject, trace theory and the theta-criterion, which ensur e that every argument position has a one-to-one correspondence with a theta-role, and X-bar theory, whic h limits branching to binary structures following the X-bar schema . Structural characteristics of the tree are then matched with the thematic specifications of the lexical items heading the phrases in the tree .","In the semantic parse, shown in Figure 3, the thematic roles are explicitly labeled and related by indice s to the verb s̀ell' . The AGENT is H̀ampshire Instruments', the PATIENT is àn x-ray lithography system' , and the RECIPIENT is ÀT&T Bell Laboratories' . Other information, including the tense and voice o f the verb, is also given . Before a noun phrase can be assigned a given thematic role, it has to qualify bot h syntactically and by meeting semantic categorial requirements . This is established through checking the th e link into the concept hierarchy of the head noun of the noun phrase and matching it with the selectiona l information for the verb in the lexicon . All of this is done at the sentence level . Information from th e semantic parses of the text is then used to generate and instantiate the LSI templates .","The frame-based text-level data structures (LSI templates) for a text are generated on the basis of th e semantic parse of that text and the frame information associated with the lexical items in the semantic parse .","There are three major steps in LSI template generation : 1) the first pass, in which templates for specifie d events and the related entity templates are generated ; 2) the second pass, in which entity templates are generated for MUC-5 relevant words that are not treated in the first pass ; and 3) template linking, in which co-reference relations are determined .","An event template includes a set of empty slots which represent the various thematic roles associated wit h the event . The processing goal is to fill the thematic role slots of each of the event templates with a referenc e to an entity template . The slots for event and entity templates are pre-defined in our concept hierarchy . For MUC-5, the following event-related thematic roles were handled : agent, patient, experiencer, recipient , beneficiary, source, and location . For example, while attempting to fill the slots of a manufacture event, as i n \"Sony manufactured a new DRA M \" , \" Sony\" will trigger an agent template, and \"a new DRAM\" will trigger a patient template . The entity template has a pointer to the semantic parse node which triggered it . The slot s of an entity template are determined by the entity type. For MUC-5, all the entity templates have at leas t the following slots : name, type, quantity, definiteness . Different types of entities have different additiona l slots representing the relevant attributes for the given type of entity . For example, company entities will also have the slots for location and nationality; equipment entities have slots for model, manufacturer, and wafe r size ; and so on . A few attributes such as location and granularity are themselves represented by templates .","In the rule set for filling template slots, a rule is associated with a given slot . The rules make use of the indexed relational structure of the semantic parse, as well as the frame information associated with th e relevant lexical item . For example, to fill the agent slot of an event template, a semantic parse node which i s co-indexed with the event verb, and which is labeled \"AGENT\" is required . Similarly for patient, recipient , and others .","During the second pass, all the important MUC-5 words (specific processes, company names, equipment , devices) which were not handled in the first pass are processed, and each triggers an entity template . The filling of templates is carried out in the same way as in the first pass .","After all the templates are filled, co-reference links among the entity templates are established . The rules used for MUC-5 were extremely simple and applied only to definite NPs, using the precedence of th e entity templates and compatibility of semantic features to determine co-reference . In the next version of thi s component, a focus list will track each of the entities in the discourse to facilitate reference resolution .","In the templates for the example sentence, shown in Figure 4, all the relevant entities are handled durin g the first pass . \"Sell\" is identified as a critical EME domain verb and an event template is generated for it , with a set of theta role slots (agent, patient, recipient) to be filled .

Template rules for determining the patient identified \"excimer laser\" as the patient, since it has the PATIENT theta role label in the semantic parse . An entity template is also generated for it . To determine whether an attribute template should be generated for granularity , the sentence in which \"excimer laser\" occurred is searched for words indicating units of granularity such a s \"micro n\" , \"nm\", and if the search is successful, the previous co-indexed word indicating size is selected to fil l the gran-size slot .","MUC-5 relevant entities not identified during the first pass are handled during the second pass .

Output Templates for Walkthrough Tex t 133 in the second sentence, because the co-reference rules used for MUC-5 were too simple to distinguish betwee n two entities in different sentences having the same semantic features . The two occurrences of \"excimer. laser\" were linked together correctly, however, the entity \"light source \" did not get properly linked in, since our analysis was not complete .","Reference resolution is now performed using a discourse focus list . To determine whether a definite nou n phrase refers to an entity which has already been mentioned in the discourse, it is compared with the mos t recent entity in the focus list, semantic feature checking is performed as before .","Also, appositives such as \"NSR-1755EX8A, a new stepper \" and cases like \"X as Y\" are now handle d during the first pass . Thus \"light source\" can now be linked to \"excimer laser\" because it occurs in an \"as\" prepositional phrase and the two entities are of the same type .","Following reference resolution, the mapping from the LSI internal templates to the MUC-5 output templates is relatively straightforward .","Answers to the specific questions posed about the MUC-5 templates generated from the walkthroug h text are given below .","(1) What information triggers the instantiation of each of the two LITHOGRAPHY objects ?","\" NSR-1755EX8A \" triggered the first lithography object since it is a defined as a lithography system i n our concept hierarchy and there is a rule stating that equipment can trigger related process objects .","In the second sentence, \"the stepper\" triggered the second lithography object by the rule given above . This is wrong because \"the stepper \" is co-referent with \"NSR-1755EX8A \" . The two templates were no t linked properly because \"the stepper \" gets linked to \" a new stepper \" , and DBG was unaware that \"a ne w stepper\" is \"NSR-1755EX8A\" since appositives were not handled in that version of the system . This i s corrected in a more recent version of the system, where \" the company's latest stepper\" triggers the secon d lithography object .","(2) What information indicates the role of the Niko n Corp . for each Microelectronics Capability ?","The concept hierarchy contains the information that Nikon is the manufacturer of \"NSR-1755EX8A \" , s o the manufacturer slot of \"NSR-1755EX8A\" is filled with a pointer to the \"Nikon\" object . The MANUFACTURER role for the second Microelectronics Capability was not filled .","(3) Explain how your system captured the GRANULARIT Y information for \"The company's latest stepper . \"","We got \" 0 .5 micron\" for \"The company's latest stepper\" (which is correct) by pattern matching and b y accident . When we were filling out the granularity slot for \"The company 's latest stepper \" , \"0 .5 micron \" was the only granularity attribute available in the sentence, since \"0 .45 micron\" was already applied to \"th e stepper\" in the same sentence .","(4) How does your system determine EQUIPMENT_TYPE fo r \"the new stepper\"? and for \"the company's lates t stepper\" ? This knowledge is specified in our concept hierarchy (see above) . 134","(5) How does your system determine the STATUS of eac h equipment object ? Via a default rule, which fills otherwise unspecified \"status\" slots with \"IN USE \" .","(6) Why is the DEVICE object only instantiated fo r LITHOGRAPHY-1 ? The DEVICE object was not linked to LITHOGRAPHY-1 in our output ."]},{"title":"MUC-5 EXPERIENCE AND SUMMARY","paragraphs":["The innovative aspect most responsible for our success this year was exploitation of the concept hierarchy , especially the links from lexical items to concept nodes in the hierarchy, which facilitated generation of the internal LSI templates . Recall scores steadily improved during addition of slot-filling rules without significantly increasing overgeneration and compromising precision . The preliminary addition of event semantics did not degrade system performance, but the complete system is not yet able to take full advantage of it . Improvements in this aspect of the DBG system should push scores significantly higher ."]},{"title":"REFERENCE S","paragraphs":["[1] Montgomery, C . A ., Hirschberg, M . A ., De Cesare, A . G .
