The systems are compared for the same domain and language and, thus, there are four figures for each metric : English Join t Ventures (EJV), Japanese Joint Ventures (JJV), English Microelectronics (EME), and Japanese Microelectronics (JME) . The format of the reporting is according to the groupings of the systems which are not significantly differen t from each other at the 0.01 level with a confidence of at least 99% . Systems which are not significantly different fro m each other are underscored on the same line . The systems are numbered to save space and the correspondence of th e number and system site are given below the significance results .","It is interesting to note that the rankings of systems do not change when using the Error per Response Fil l metric or the F-Measure. The numerical rankings change slightly (numbers 6 and 7 in EJV reverse, and numbers 4 and 5 in JJV reverse), but those changes are not significant statistically because the two members in each of th e reversed pairs are both in the same significance grouping for both of the two metrics . It is also interesting to note tha t the Error per Response Fill metric distinguishes four more systems than the F-Measure over all domains and languages . The Richness-Normalized Error metric distinguishes far fewer systems statistically than the Error pe r Response Fill metric with 29 systems distinguished by Richness-Normalized Error as opposed to 55 by Error per Response Fill for EJV alone . Both the minimum and maximum Richness-Normalized Error metrics produce the sam e rankings and statistical results so are conflated here . The statistical groupings of systems for Richness-Normalized Error are so large and so numerous that systems cannot be distinguished well enough to reflect their perceived differences in performance . It is believed that this is due to the fact that the Richness-Normalized Error metric ignores th e amount of spurious data generated by a system and that the amount and kind of spurious data generated impacts th e perception of how well the system is doing in an operational setting ."]},{"title":"CONCLUSIONS","paragraphs":["The approximate randomization method has been used to determine the statistical significance of the rankings of systems for MUC-5 . It is also useful for reflecting on the relative merits of the evaluation metrics . The statistical results show that the Error per Response Fill metric is the most sensitive metric of the three in terms o f distinguishing systems. However, no statistically significant changes in ranking occur when F-Measure is used . The Richness-Normalized Error metric distinguishes far fewer systems than either of the other metrics . 79"]},{"title":"English Joint Ventures - Error per Response Fil l 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1 3","paragraphs":["1) GE/CMU \\t 2) BBN \\t 3) SRI \\t 4) UMASS/HU \\t 5) PMAX \\t 6) USUSSEX \\t 7) NMSUIBR 8) NYU \\t 9) SRA \\t 10) PRC \\t 11) USC \\t 12) MITRE \\t 13)TRW I) GE/CMU-OPT \\t 2) GFJCMU \\t 3) NMSU/BR \\t 4) SRA \\t 5) SRI \\t 6) BB N"]},{"title":"English Microelectronics - Error per Response Fil l 1 2 3 4 5 6 7","paragraphs":["1) GE/CMU \\t 2) BBN \\t 3) OMAN \\t 4) LSI \\t 5) NMSU/BR \\t 6) UMASS/HU \\t 7) UMIC H"]},{"title":"Japanese Joint Ventures Error . per Response Fil l 1 2 3 4 5 6 80 1 2 apanese Microelectronics Error per Response Fil l 3 4 5","paragraphs":["I) GE/CMU \\t 2) GE/CMU-OPT \\t 3) NMSUIBR \\t 4) NEC \\t 5) BB N 1) GE/CMU \\t 2) BBN \\t 3) SRI \\t 4) UMASS/HU 5) PMAX \\t 6) NMSU/BR 7) USUSSE X 8) NYU \\t 9) SRA \\t 10) PRC \\t 11) USC \\t 12) MITRE \\t 13) TRW 1) GE/CMU-OPT \\t 2) GE/CMU \\t 3) NMSU/BR \\t 4) SRI \\t 5) SRA \\t 6) BB N"]},{"title":"English Joint Ventures - F-Measure (P&R ) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1 3 Japanese Joint Ventures - Measure (P&R ) 1 2 3 4 5 6 81 English Microelectronics - F-Measure (P&R ) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7","paragraphs":["I) GE/CMU \\t 2) BBN \\t 3) UMAN \\t 4) LSI \\t 5) NMSU/BR \\t 6) UMASS/HU \\t 7) UMICH"]},{"title":"Japanese Microelectronics - F-Measure (P&R ) 1 2 3 4","paragraphs":["I) GFJCMU \\t 2) GE/CMU-OPT \\t 3) NMSU/BR \\t 4) NEC \\t 5) BB N"]},{"title":"English Joint Ventures - Richness-Normalized Erro r 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1 3","paragraphs":["I) BB N 8) SRA 2) SRI \\t 3) NYU \\t 4) UMASS/H U 9) MITRE I0) PRC \\t 1 I) PMAX 5) GE/CMU \\t 6) USUSSEX 7) NMSU/BR 12) USC \\t 13) TRW"]},{"title":"82 Japanese joint Ventures - Richness-Normalized Erro r 1 2 3 4 5 6","paragraphs":["I) GEICMU-OPT \\t 2) GE/CMU \\t 3) NMSUIBR \\t 4) SRI \\t 5) BBN \\t 6) SRA"]},{"title":"English Microelectronics - Richness-Normalized Error 1 2 3 4 5 6 7","paragraphs":["1) BBN \\t 2) LSI \\t 3) NMSUBR \\t 4) UMAN \\t 5) GE/CMU \\t 6) UMICH \\t 7) UMASS/H U 1) GE/CMU-OPT \\t 2) NMSUBR \\t 3) NEC \\t 4) GE/CMU \\t 5) BB N","[1] Chinchor, N ., L .
