These evaluations are intended t o advance our understanding of the merits of current text analysis techniq\\ ues, as applied to the performance of a realistic information extraction task . The lates t one is also intended to provide insight into information retrieval techn\\ ology (document retrieval and categorization) used instead of or in concert wit h language understanding technology . \\t","The inputs to the analysis/extraction proces s consist of naturally-occurring texts that were obtained in the form of e\\ lectronic messages . \\t","The outputs of the process are a set of templates or semantic frame s resembling the contents of a partially formatted database .","The premise on which these evaluations are based is that task-oriented t\\ ests enable straightforward comparisons among systems and provide usefu l quantitative data on the state of the art in text understanding . The tests ar e designed to treat the systems under evaluation as black boxes and to poi\\ nt up system performance on discrete aspects of the task as well as on the tas\\ k overall. These quantitative data can be interpreted in light of information known\\ about each system's text analysis techniques in order to yield qualitative ins\\ ights into the relative validity of those techniques as applied to the general problem \\ of information extraction .","The process of conducting these evaluations has presented great opportun\\ ities for examining and improving on the evaluation methodology itself. Although stil l far from perfect, the MUC-3 evaluation was markedly better than the prev\\ ious one, especially with respect to the way scoring was done and the degree to wh\\ ich the test set was representative of the training set . Much of the credit for improvemen t goes to the evaluation participants themselves, who have been actively i\\ nvolved in nearly every aspect of the evaluation . The previous MUC, known as MUCK-II (the naming convention has since been stripped down), proved that systems ex\\ isted that could do a reasonable job of extracting data from ill-formed paragr\\ aph-length texts in a narrow domain (naval messages about encounters with hostile \\ forces) and that measuring performance on such a task was a feasible and viable \\ thing to do . \\t","However, the usage of a very small test set (just 5 texts) and an extr\\ emely unsophisticated scoring procedure combined to make it inadvisable to pub\\ licize the 3 results . \\t","(Results obtained in experiments conducted on one MUCK-II system afte r the evaluation was completed are discussed in [1] . )","The MUC-3 evaluation was significantly broader in scope than previous on\\ es in most respects, including text characteristics, task specifications, perf\\ ormance measures, and range of text understanding and information extraction tec\\ hniques. MUC-3 presented a significantly more challenging task than MUCK-II, whic\\ h was held in June of 1989 . \\t","The results show that MUC-3 was not an unreasonabl e challenge to 1991 technologies . The means used to measure performance hav e evolved far enough that we no longer hesitate to present the system scor\\ es, and work on the evaluation methodology is planned that will take the next st\\ ep to determine the statistical significance of the results .","In another effort to determine their significance, some work has already\\ been undertaken by Hirschman [2] to measure the difference in complexity of M\\ UC-like evaluation tasks so that the results can be used to quantify progress in\\ the field of text understanding . This objective, however, brings up another critical area o f improvement for future evaluations, namely refining the evaluation metho\\ dology in such a way as to better isolate the systems' text analysis capabiliti\\ es from their data extraction capabilities . This will be done, since the MUC- 3 corpus and task ar e sufficiently challenging that .they can be used again (with a new test set) in a future evaluation . \\t","That evaluation will seek to examine more closely the tex t analysis capabilities of the systems, to measure improvements in perform\\ ance by MUC-3 systems, and to establish performance baselines for any new system\\ s.","This paper covers most of the basics of the MUC-3 evaluation, which wer e presented during a tutorial session and in an overview presentation at t\\ he start of the regular sessions . This paper is also an overview of the conferenc e proceedings, which includes papers contributed by the sites that partici\\ pated in the evaluation and by individuals who were involved in the evaluation in\\ other ways . Parts I, II, and III of the proceedings are organized in the order in \\ which the sessions were held, but the ordering of papers within Parts II and I\\ II is alphabetical by site and does not necessarily correspond with the order \\ in which the presentations were made during the conference . \\t","The proceedings als o includes a number of appendices containing materials pertinent to the ev\\ aluation."]},{"title":"OVERVIEW OF MUC- 3","paragraphs":["The planning for MUC-3 began while MUCK-II was still in progress, wit h suggestions from MUCK-II participants for improvements . A MUC-3 progra m committee was formed from among those MUCK-II participants who provide d significant feedback on the MUCK-II effort . The MUC-3 program committe e included Laura Blumer Balcom (Advanced Decision Systems), Ralph Grishm\\ an (New York University), Jerry Hobbs (SRI International), Lisa Rau (General\\ Electric), and Carl Weir (Unisys Center for Advanced Information Technology) . Since one of th e suggestions for MUC-3 was to add an element of document filtering to the\\ task of data extraction, David Lewis (then at the University of Massachusetts a\\ nd now at the University of Chicago) was invited to join the committee as a repre\\ sentative of the information retrieval community .","NOSC began looking for a suitable corpus - in late 1989 and obtained ass\\ istance from other government agencies to acquire it during the summer of 1990 . At that 4"]},{"title":"time, a call for participation was sent to academic, industrial, and commercia l organizations in the United States that were known to be engaged in system design or development in the area of text analysis or information retrieval . Participation on the part of many of the respondents was contingent upon receiving outsid e financial support ; approximately two-thirds of the sites were awarded financia l support by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) . These awards were modest, some sites having requested funds only to pay travel expense s and others having requested funds to cover up to half of the total cost o f participating . The total cost was typically estimated to be approximately equivalen t to one person-year of effort . The evaluation was officially launched in October, 1990, with a three-mont h phase dedicated to compiling the \"answer key\" templates for the texts in th e training set (see next section), refining the task definition, and developing th e initial MUC-3 version of the data extraction systems . These systems underwent a dry-run test in February, 1991, after which a meeting was held to discuss th e results and hammer out some of the remaining evaluation issues . Twelve site s participated in the dry run . One site dropped out after the dry run (TRW), and fou r new sites entered, three of which had already been involved to some extent (BB N Systems and Technologies, McDonnell Douglas Electronic Systems Company, an d Synchronetics, Inc .) and one that had not (Hughes Research Laboratories) . The second phase began in mid-February and, while system developmen t continued at each of the participating sites, updates were made to the scorin g program, the task definition, and the answer key templates for the training set . Final testing was carried out in May, 1991, concluding with the Third Messag e Understanding Conference (MUC-3), which was attended by representatives of th e participating sites and interested government organizations . During th e conference, the evaluation participants decided that the test results should b e validated by having the system-generated templates rescored by a single party . Two of the participants were selected to work as a team to carry out this task, an d the results of their effort are the official test scores presented in this volume . Pure and hybrid systems based on a wide range of text interpretatio n techniques (e .g ., statistical, key-word, template-driven, pattern-matching, in - depth natural language processing) were represented in the MUC-3 evaluation . The fifteen sites that completed the evaluation are Advanced Decision System s (Mountain View, CA), BBN Systems and Technologies (Cambridge, MA), Genera l Electric (Schenectady, NY), General Telephone and Electronics (Mountain View , CA), Intelligent Text Processing, Inc . (Santa Monica, CA), Hughes Researc h Laboratories (Malibu, CA), Language Systems, Inc . (Woodland Hills, CA), McDonnel l Douglas Electronic Systems (Santa Ana, CA), New York University (New York City , NY), PRC, Inc . (McLean, VA), SRI International (Menlo Park, CA), Synchronetics , Inc . together with the University of Maryland (Baltimore, MD), Unisys Center fo r Advanced Information Technology (Paoli, PA), the University of Massachusett s (Amherst, MA), and the University of Nebraska (Lincoln, NE) in association wit h the University of Southwest Louisiana (Lafayette, LA) . \\t Parts II and III of thi s volume include papers by each of these sites . In addition, an experimenta l prototype of a probabilistic text categorization system was developed by Davi d Lewis, who is now at the University of Chicago, and was tested along with the othe r systems . That work is described in a paper in Part IV . 5 CORPUS AND TAS K","paragraphs":["The corpus was formed via a keyword query'. to an electronic databas e containing articles in message format from open sources worldwide . These article s had been gathered, translated (if necessary), edited, and disseminated by th e Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS) of the U .S . Government . A training set of 1300 texts was identified, and additional texts were set aside for use as tes t data 2 . The message headers were used to create or augment a dateline and the tex t type information appearing at the front of the article ; the original messag e headers and routing information were removed . The layout was modified slightl y to improve readability (e .g ., by double-spacing between paragraphs), an d problems that arose with certain characters when the data was downloaded were rectified (e .g ., square brackets were missing and had to be reinserted) . The body o f the text was modified minimally and with the sole purpose of eliminating som e idiosyncratic features that were well beyond the scope of interest of MUC-3 3 .","The corpus presents realistic challenges in terms of overall size (over 2 . 5 megabytes), length of the individual articles (approximately a half-page each o n average), variety of text types (newspaper articles, TV and radio news, speech an d interview transcripts, rebel communiques, etc .), range of linguistic phenomen a represented (both well-formed and ill-formed), and open-endedness of th e vocabulary (especially with respect to proper nouns) . The texts used in MUCK- I and MUCK-II originated as teletype messages and thus were all upper case ; th e MUC-3 texts are also all upper case, but only as a consequence of downloading from the source database, where the texts appear in mixed upper and lower case .","The task was to extract information on terrorist incidents (incident type, date , location, perpetrator, target, instrument, outcome, etc .) \\t from the relevant texts i n a blind test on 100 previously unseen texts . \\t Approximately half the articles were irrelevant to the task as defined . \\t","In some cases the terrorism keywords in th e query used to form the corpus (see footnote) were used in irrelevant senses, e .g . , \"explosion\" in the phrase \"social explosion\" . \\t In other cases, an entity of one of the '. The query specified a hit as a message containing both a country/nationality name (e .g . , Honduras or Honduran) for one of the nine countries of interest (Argentina, Bolivia, Chile , Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Peru) and some inflectional form of a common word associated with terrorist acts (abduct, abduction, ambush, arson, assassinate , assassination, assault, blow [up], bomb, bombing, explode, explosion, hijack, hijacking, kidnap , kidnapping, kill, killing, murder, rob, shoot, shooting, steal, terrorist) . Some of the articles i n the MUC-3 corpus may no longer satisfy this query, since the message headers (including th e subject line) were removed after the retrieval was done . 2 Over 300 articles were set aside from the overall corpus to be used as test data . Th e composition of the test sets was intentionally controlled with respect to the frequency wit h which incidents concerning any given country are represented ; otherwise, the selection wa s done simply by taking every nth article about that country . 3 For example, transcriptions of radio and TV broadcasts sometimes contained sentences i n which words were enclosed in parentheses to indicate that the transcriber could not be certai n of them, e .g ., \"They are trying to implicate the (Ochaski Company) with narcoterrorism .\" (Thi s quote is from article number PA1807130691 of the Latin America volume of the Foreig n Broadcast Information Service Daily Reports .) In cases such as this, where the text i s parenthetical in form but not in function, the parentheses were deleted . 6 nine countries of interest -- the second necessary condition for a hit -- wa s mentioned, but the entity did not play a significant role in the terrorist incident . Other articles were irrelevant for reasons that were harder to formulate . \\t","Fo r example, some articles concerned common criminal activity or guerrilla warfare (or other military conflict) . \\t","Rules were developed to challenge the systems t o discriminate among various kinds of violent acts and to generate templates onl y for those that would be of interest to a terrorism news analyst . The real-life scenario also required that only timely, substantive information be extracted ; thus , rules were formulated that defined relevance in terms of whether the news wa s recent and whether it at least mentioned who/what the target was . \\t","Othe r relevance criteria were developed as well, again with the intent of simulating a real-life task . The relevance criteria are described in the first part of appendix A , which is the principal documentation of the MUC-3 task . Appendix D contains some representative samples of relevant and irrelevant articles .","It can be seen that the relevance criteria are extensive and would sometimes b e difficult to state, let alone implement .

Systems that generated generally correct internal data structures for a relevan t incident, only to filter out that data structure by making a single mistake on one o f the relevance criteria, were penalized for having missed the incident entirel y rather than being penalized for getting just one aspect of the incident descriptio n wrong . Some allowance was made in the answer key for the fact that incidents o r facts about incidents might be of questionable relevance, given the vagueness o f some texts and gaps in the statement of the relevance criteria ; the templat e notation allowed for optionality, and systems were not penalized if they failed t o generate an optional template or an optional filler in a required template .","If an article was determined to be relevant, there was then the task o f determining how many distinct relevant incidents were being reported . Th e information on these incidents had to be correctly disentangled and represented i n separate templates . \\t","The extracted information was to be represented in th e template in one of several ways, according to the data format requirements of eac h slot . (See appendix A .) Some slot fills were required to be categories from a predefined set of possibilities called a \"set list\" (e .g ., for the various types o f terrorist incidents such as BOMBING, ATTEMPTED BOMBING, BOMB THREAT) ; others were required to be canonicalized forms (e .g ., for dates) or numbers ; stil l others were to be in the form of strings (e .g ., for person names) .","A relatively simple article and corresponding answer key template from th e dry-run test set (labeled TST1) are shown in Figures 1 and 2 .

In Figure 2, the left-hand column contains the slot labels , and the right-hand column contains the correct answers as defined by NOSC . Slashes mark alternative correct responses (systems are to generate just one of the possibilities), an asterisk marks slots that are inapplicable to the incident typ e being reported, a hyphen marks a slot for which the text provides no fill, and a colon introduces the cross-reference portion of a fill (except for slot 16, where th e colon is used as a separator between more general and more specific place names) .

In these cases, one might expect the non-parsing systems to compare more favorably wit h the parsing systems, since the fill options are restricted to a fairly small , predefined set of possibilities . 6 However, none of the non-parsing systems appears at the leading edge in Figure G4, and the only non-parsing system in the cluster a t the leading edge in Figure G9 is ADS (which shares a data point with NYU-02) , 5 Recall is greater in G2 because Matched Only differs from Matched/Missing in that the \"tota l possible,\" i .e ., the recall denominator, does not include penalties for missing templates . 6 The results in G4 are somewhat contaminated due to the fact that some of the set-fill slot s require that the fillers be cross-referenced to fillers of string-fill slots (see, for example, th e fillers of slots 7, 11, and 13 in Figure 2 earlier in this paper) . The scoring of the set-fill slots is affected by these cross-reference tags . However, the TYPE OF INCIDENT results (G9) ar e not contaminated in this way . 13 although a few non-parsing systems have extremely high precision scores (UNI , UNL, UNL-01, and UNL-02) .","On the other hand, there is quite a range in performance even among th e systems in the parsing group, all of which had to cope with having limite d coverage of the domain . One thing that is apparent from the sites' syste m descriptions (see Part III of this proceedings) is that the ones on the leading edg e in Figure G1 have the ability to make good use of partial sentence parses whe n complete parses cannot be obtained . Level of effort is also an indicator o f performance success, though not a completely reliable one : GE, NYU, and UMass al l reported investing more than one person-year of effort in MUC-3, but severa l other sites with lower overall performance also reported just under or over on e person-year of effort .","It must be said that there were some extremely immature systems in the non - parsing group and the parsing group alike, so any general conclusions must b e taken as tentative and should certainly not be used to form opinions about th e relative validity of isolated techniques employed by the individual systems in eac h group . It could be that the relatively low-performing systems use extremel y effective techniques that, if supplemented by other known techniques o r supported by more extensive domain coverage, would put the system well out i n front . \\t","Neither should one assume that the systems at the leading edge are simila r kinds of systems . \\t","In fact, those systems have quite different architectures an d have varying sizes of lexicons, kinds of parsers and semantic interpreters, etc .","Figures G7 through G24 show how system performance varied from one slot t o another . Figures G7, G9, and G17 are useful as examples of the way spurious dat a generation combines with incorrect data generation to affect the precision score s in different kinds of slots . Figure G7 is for the TEMPLATE ID slot . The fillers o f this slot are arbitrary numbers that uniquely identify the templates for a give n message . The scoring program disregards the actual values and finds the bes t match between the system-generated templates and the answer key templates for a given message based on the degree of match in fillers of other slots in th e template .

In contrast to the TEMPLATE ID slot, the TYPE O F INCIDENT slot (Figure G9) shows no influence of spurious data on precision at all . This is because the TYPE OF INCIDENT slot permits only one filler.

Figure G7 shows the marked difference the experiments made i n spurious template generation ; Figure G1 shows the much smaller difference the y made in overall recall and precision . CONCLUSIONS The MUC-3 evaluation established a solid set of performance benchmarks fo r systems with diverse approaches to text analysis and information extraction . Th e MUC-3 task was extremely challenging, and the results show what can be done wit h today's technologies after only a modest domain- and task-specific developmen t effort (on the order of one person-year) . On a task this difficult, the systems tha t cluster at the leading edge were able to generate in the neighborhood of 40-50% o f the expected data and to do it with 55-65% accuracy . Breakdowns of performanc e by slot show that performance was best on identifying the type of incident -- 70 - 80% recall (completeness) and 80-85% precision (accuracy) were achieved, an d precision figures in the 90-100% range were possible with some sacrifice in recall . All of the MUC-3 system developers are optimistic about the prospects fo r seeing steady improvements in system performance for the foreseeable future . This feeling is based variously on such evidence as the amount of improvemen t achieved between the dry-run test and the final test, the slope of improvemen t recorded on internal tests conducted at intervals during development, and th e developers' own awareness of significant components of the system that they had not had time to adapt to the MUC-3 task . The final test results are consistent with the claim that most systems, if not all, may well be still on a steep slope o f improvement . However, they also show that performance on recall is not as goo d as performance on precision, and they lend support to the possibility that thi s discrepancy will persist . \\t It appears that systems cannot be built today that ar e capable of obtaining high overall recall, even at the expense of outrageously hig h overgeneration . \\t Systems can, however, be built that will do a good job a t potentially useful subtasks such as identifying terrorist incidents of various kinds . The results give at least a tentative indication that systems incorporatin g robust parsing techniques show more long-term promise of high performanc e than non-parsing systems . However, there are great differences in technique s among the systems in the parsing and non-parsing groups and even among thos e robust parsing systems that did the best in maximizing recall and precision an d minimizing the tradeoff between them . Further variety was evident in th e optional test runs conducted by some of the sites . Those runs show promise for th e development of systems that can be \"tuned\" in various ways to generate data mor e aggressively or more conservatively, yielding tradeoffs between recall an d precision that respond to differences in emphasis in real-life applications . Some conclusions can be drawn regarding the evaluation setup itself that wil l influence future work . First, the evaluation corpus and task were sufficientl y challenging that they can be used again in a future evaluation (with a refined tas k definition and a new test set) . \\t Second, the information extraction task need s modification in order to focus as much as possible on language processin g 15","paragraphs":["capabilities separate from information extraction capabilities, and new ideas fo r designing tests related to specific linguistic phenomena are needed . Finally, mor e work is needed to ensure that the statistical significance of the results is known , and a serious study of human performance on the task is needed in order to defin e concrete performance goals for the systems ."]},{"title":"ACKNOWLEDGEMENT S","paragraphs":["This work was funded by DARPA under ARPA order 6359 .
