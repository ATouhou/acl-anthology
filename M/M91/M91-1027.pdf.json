INLET relies heavily on the methodology developed for th e preceding VOX system . The goal of this work is to produce an NLP shell that can be customized t o a variety of tasks and domains . INLET provides user-friendly graphics-oriented tools for knowledge addition an d perusal, to support customization to a variety of domains and tasks . INLET is implemented in C on Sun SPARCstations, in order to support faster analysis than Lisp-based systems and t o provide a more widely usable end-product . At the present time, the basic knowledge addition system is in place, includin g vocabulary addition interfaces (e .g ., Figure 1), a dictionary book tool (Figure 2), a hierarch y editor (Figure 3), and a grammar rule editor (Figure 4) . A new Conceptual Grammar has bee n implemented for INLET, supporting concept hierarchies, a 'conceptual' dictionary, and othe r knowledge types (such as lexical interrelationships) . A conceptual analyzer, called the skimmer (Figure 5), has been implemented to provid e robust top-down language analysis capabilities . The skimmer will augment a bottom-u p analyzer currently under construction . A skimmer trace is shown in Figure 6 . DESCRIPTION OF THE SKIMME R The skimmer, implemented in 2 months time, is the only operational component of th e INLET analyzer (called LASS, for Language Analysis Support System) . Six major processe s comprise the skimmer, and are described in turn . The first process performs a pass throug h the input message to replace all fixed phrases with their atomic representation . Fo r example, the literal phrase \"farabundo marti national liberation front\" is replaced by a concep t that represents that phrase . The second process, called the pre-processor, locates and parse s specialized constructs in the text, such as proper names, number words, temporal and locativ e phrases, as well as some domain-specific phrases dealing with perpetrators, physical, an d human targets . Phrases like \"thirty-three\", \"Ricardo Alfonso Castellar\", \"three months ago\" , \"San Miguel department\", and \"member of the FMLN\", are all detected and parsed by the pre - processor . Next, a pass through the text detects key words and phrases . Words lik e \"attack\", \"murder\", and \"bomb\", as well as phrases like \"set fire to object\", \"bomb damage d object\" are located in the text . Incidents found in this pass are merged or segmented by th e grouping process . Groups of sentences associated with a single incident are then examined by the actor/object separation process to determine perpetrators and targets . The subsequen t 178 slot filling process further examines groups of sentences to fill remaining slots of the MUC 3 template . In order to assure self-consistency in a single template, a semantic trimming an d rejection process trims the templates prior to output . This last process is ad hoc, bu t substitutes for our current lack of script-based processing . SAMPLE TEMPLAT E 0. MESSAGE ID \\t TST2-MUC3-004 8 1. TEMPLATE ID \\t 1 2.

EFFECT ON HUMAN TARGET(S) \" A sample of the system's output for message 48 from TST2 is shown above . The system did fairly well, successfully applying an apposition rule in slot 11, for example . However, even though it found the appositive, it incorrectly assigned civilian type to the attorney general , due to an undiagnosed bug . The system often sloughs adjectives, e .g ., condensing \"urba n guerrillas\" to \"guerrillas\" in the perpetrator id slot . Even though the first sentence of messag e 48 says \" . . .accused the farabundo marti national liberation front (fmln) of the crime\", th e skimmer failed to fill the organization slot. In this case, failure was due to lack of patterns fo r accusations . Failure to find the instrument in \" . . .was killed when a bomb placed by urba n guerrillas on his vehicle exploded\" is due to the absence of a pattern like \"bomb placed by actor\" . Rather, the system knew the pattern \"bomb BE placed by actor\" where the verb 'to be' i s not optional .","paragraphs":["179 DONAIII : (none )SER : (none) (Qo i t. )","Ixurratml a ANALYZ 10 : ..̂ off \\t Children : O off \\t (Add Vocabulary) \\t recalculate Graph ) VOCABULARY ADDITION \\t (Next Word) (Cancel )","concept Wor","d Root \\t",": guerrill a Added : CONJUGATION S Presen t 3rd person : Progressive : Pas t Participle : Singular \\t : guerrill a Plural \\t : guerrillas EXTEND \\t SYNTACTIC FEATURE S O adj \\t 0 aux \\t O det \\t noun \\t 0 pro \\t 0 verb O adv \\t O c :onj \\t O modal O prep \\t 0 quan \\t O wh","SEMANTIC FEATURES Feature : terrorist/person/actor/object Figure 1 : Vocabulary Addition Too l SER : (none) \\t DONAIII : (none ) (KBEditor) \\t (Add Vocabulary) \\t (Dictionary) \\t (tent\\tool \\t (Options( \\t (Sun(I' :) \\t (Quit ) 10 (Entire Graph )","ANALYZ ID : e off \\t","Children : Oaf \\t (AddVocabulary) \\t SFr.' ..T abstract —action","organization —cici l io n —.name","~ actor nationality military","— assassi n — person \\t .. coemando - extremist —kil le a .—eurderr .. . narcotrrr 1 a t","tarrorisf\\trebel ...robber • subversiv","e .. guerrilla \\t attr{ \\t","terrorist nouns— guerrill a ~ terrorist ...thie","f ...attribute location ~ misc --scala r — Spanis h - thing Figure 3 : Hierarchy Edito r INLET : \\t Interactive Natural Language Engineering Too l USER : \\t (none) \\t DOIIA111 : \\t (none )","KB Ed","Knowledge Base Graph Tool ® O O O (] ® Find :","ob j c(} .' \\t",",] (Prune) \\t (Prune All) (Grow) \\t (Grow Al)) (Options) \\t (Done )(Entire Graph) \\t","(Redisplay) (\"off (Recalculate Graph)ANALYZ \\t ID : \\t C off \\t","Children :","(Add Vocabulary) L. .R»:cl","last-uni t","last-weekda y RULE EDITOR : professional (1 of 1) (Redisplay) (Insert) (Delete) (Delete Rule) (Salient) O 0 (Cancel) o n Node(s) : Rule modes : \\t ..̂ atom Suggested concept : \\t professional","profession general —stem-* civilian \\t of \\t det \\t quan adJ \\t country-adj \\t adj \\t abstractnumber ~iif3~ _a — ( anything n reader actor HOUSE BU11011S -.symbo l Figure 4 : \\t Rule Edito r Editor )- (L : Open Knowledge use objec t EXTEND 18 1 INLET : Interactive Natural Language Engineering Too l SER : (none ) (KB editor) (Dictionary) \\t (Text loot) \\t","(Options)","(Qui( )(So :Os ) DONA111 : (none ) (Add Vocabular y ANALYZER> Text file : nosc l Stat File : reject .tt User File : output .tt (Save) oa (Done ) Sort : 0 \\t","Of f","Trace : 00f f","(Frequency) (Context) (Next Unknown)","MAIM (Skim Step) (Skim) (Print )","WORD :","Msg : DEV-MUC3-0001 (NOSC) Left : 3 \\t","Right : 3 \\t","Within : 0 \\t"]},{"title":"O Processed : \\t Matches :","paragraphs":["EXTENDER> MEANWHILE, THE 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE REPORTED THAT PONCE BATTALION UNITS FOUND THE DECOMPOSED BODY OF A SUBVERSIVE IN LA FINCA HILL, SAN MIGUEL . \\t","AN M-16 RIFLE, FIVE GRENADES, AID MATERIAL FOR THE PRODUCTION OF EXPLOSIVES WERE FOUND IN THE SAME PLACE . \\t","THE BRIGADE, WHICH IS HEADQUARTERED IN SAN MIGUEL , ADDED THAT THE SEIZURE VAS MADE YESTERDAY MORNING .
