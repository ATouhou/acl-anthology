Instead, it presents you with guidelines and some examples, in order to imbue you with the spirit of the enterprise . It is up to you to carefully consider you r reasons before judging mismatching responses to be \"completely\" or \"partially \" correct .","Thus, you should attempt to set aside a substantial amount of time to do the interactive scoring and should plan to do it when you are rested and can be a s objective as humanly possible about your system's performance . Please refer to the file key-tst2-notes for examples of decisions NOSC made in preparing the answer key . If you have any doubt whether any given system \\t response deserves to be judge d completely/partially correct, count it incorrect ."]},{"title":"2. SETTING UP THE SCORING PROGRAM IN INTERACTIVE MOD E","paragraphs":["You must use the latest official version of the scoring program together with th e latest slotconfig .el file . You are not permitted to make any modifications of your ow n to the scoring software or the files it uses, except to define the pathnames in th e config .el file for the files that it reads in .","The configuration (config .el) files supplied with the test package set the :query - verbose option on, which places the scoring program in interactive mode . (See MU C Scoring System User's Manual, section 5 .2 .) The only feature of the interactiv e scoring that you are *not* permitted to take advantage of is the option to change a key or response template! This feature is controlled by the :disable-edit option, which is set on in the config .el files supplied in the test package and should not be modified .","Although there may be errors in the key templates, you are not permitted to fi x them, as we do not have sufficient time to make the corrections known to all sites . Score your system under the assumption that the answer key is correct, make note o f any perceived errors in the key, and email them to NOSC along with your results . I f there is sufficient evidence that errors were made that affect the scores obtained, a new key will be prepared after the conference, and sites will be given th e opportunity to rescore their system responses . The new scores will replace the ol d ones as the official results . Included among your options for interactive scoring is the manual \\t realignmen t of response templates with key templates (see section 3 .2 .1 \\t","below and section 4 .7 o f User's Manual) . If you are not already comfortable using the interactive scorin g features of the scoring program, take some time to practice on some texts in th e training set before you attempt to do the scoring for the test set . Also be sure to rea d the document on test procedures carefully re saving your history buffer to a file fo r C-I use in other scoring sessions required for completing the test procedure . Referenc e to key-tst2-notes while you are doing the interactive scoring might help yo u understand the key better and give you ideas on cases when alternative fillers migh t be justified ."]},{"title":"3 . SCORING MISMATCHED SLOT FILLER S","paragraphs":["3 .1 BY TYPE OF FILL","These subsections deal in turn with string fills, set fills, and other types of fills . Following that is a section concerning cross-reference tags . 3 .1 .1 STRING FILL S","Slots requiring string fills are slots 5, 6, 8, and 11 . In the case of a mismatch o n fillers for these slots, the scoring program will permit you to score the response a s fully correct, partially correct, or incorrec t 3 .1 .1 .1 FULLY CORREC T","NOSC has attempted to provide a choice of good string options for each string slot . If you get a mismatch, before you score a filler fully correct you should conside r carefully whether your system's filler is both complete enough and precise enoug h to show that the system found exactly the right information .","The most likely situation where \"fully correct\" would be justified is in a cas e where the system or the key includes \"nonessential modifiers\" such as articles , quantifiers, and adjectivals for nationalities (e .g ., SALVADORAN) .","EXAMPLE (slot 11) : RESPONSE \"THE 3 PEASANTS \" KEY \\t \"PEASANTS \"","In filling the key templates, such nonessential modifiers were generally include d in slot 5 (since there are no slots specifically for the number and nationality of th e perpetrators) . They were generally excluded from fillers for the other string slots , unless they seemed to be part of a proper name (e .g . THE EXTRADITABLES) .","\"Fully correct\" is also warranted if the system response contains more modifyin g words and phrases than the answer key, as long as all the modifiers are modifiers o f the noun phrase . However, in most cases the answer key should already contai n options such as these .","EXAMPLE (slot 11) : RESPONSE \"OLD PEASANTS WHO WERE WITNESSES \" KEY \\t \"PEASANTS\" / \"OLD PEASANTS \"","Finally, if your system does not generate an escape (backslash) character in fron t of the inner double quote marks of a filler that is surrounded by double doubl e quotes, you may score the system response as completely correct if it would otherwis e match the key . EXAMPLE : \\t RESPONSE \"'TOO KEY \\t '1 \"FOO\\\"\" / \"FOO \" C—2 3 .1 .1 .2 PARTIALLY CORREC T","You may score a filler partially correct, but not fully correct, if your system goe s overboard and includes adjuncts in the response string that aren't part of the desire d noun phrase .","EXAMPLE (slot 11) : RESPONSE \"THE 3 PEASANTS, WHICH TH E GOVERNMENT ADMITTED WAS A MISTAKE \" KEY \\t \"PEASANTS \"","Scoring a filler partially correct is also appropriate in cases where the ke y contains a proper name (in the most complete form found in the text) and th e response contains only part of the name (i .e ., uses an incomplete form found in th e text) .","EXAMPLE (slot 11) : RESPONSE TORRES\" (\"BODYGUARD\" ) KEY \\t \"ALBERTO ROBERTO TORRES\" (\"BODYGUARD\" ) 3 .1 .2 SET FILL S","Slots requiring set fills are slots 3, 4, 7, 10, 13, 14, 15, 17, and 18 . (Slot 16, th e LOCATION slot, is not treated by the scoring program as having set fills .) In the cas e of a mismatch on fillers for these slots, the scoring program will not permit you t o score them as fully correct . (But see section 3 .1 .4 below re an exception . Also, se e 3 .2 .7 and 3 .2 .15 for information concerning automatic assignment of partial credit b y the scoring program . )","NOSC has attempted to offer all the possible alternative correct fillers as options i n the key ; however, scoring a filler partially correct may be justified in certain cases . See the appropriate subsections of section 3 .2 below . 3 .1 .3 OTHER TYPES OF FILL S","Slots requiring other types of fills are slots 1, 2, 9, 12, and 16 . In the case of a mismatch on fillers for these slots, the scoring program will permit you to score th e fillers as fully correct, partially correct, or incorrect . \\t (But see section 3 .1 .4 below re an exception . \\t","Also, see 3 .2 .16 for information concerning automatic assignment o f partial credit by the scoring program . )","NOSC has attempted to offer all the possible alternative correct fillers as options i n the key ; however, scoring a filler completely or partially correct may be justified i n certain cases . \\t See the appropriate subsections of section 3 .2 below . 3 .1 .4 FILLS THAT INCLUDE CROSS-REFERENCE TAG S 3 .1 .4 .1 FULLY CORREC T","The scoring program permits you to score a slot as fully correct in the case of a mismatch on the slots listed in 3 .1 .2 and 3 .1 .3 above where the only mismatch is on a cross-reference tag . In such cases, you may score the entire filler as fully correc t only if the filler of the slot indicated by the cross-reference tag was also scored a s fully correct . C—3 3 .1 .4 .2 PARTIALLY CORREC T","If the non-tag portion of the filler is not judged completely correct (by th e criteria found in other sections of this set of guidelines), the best you can do is t o judge the entire filler partially correct . If the non-tag portion is *completely * correct and the tag is either missing or incorrect, it is appropriate to score the entir e filler partially correct .","Scoring the entire filler partially correct may also be done if the non-tag portio n of the filler is judged *partially* correct and the tag is either missing or incorrect . In this case, however, you must re-read the text and judge the partial correctness o f the non-tag portion with respect to the way the text refers to the *KEY'S* tag, no t the system response tag . In other words, you must be able to show that the syste m got the non-tag portion partially correct for the right reason . (Note that thi s guideline is based on the assumption that some systems might intentionally, no t accidentally, generate a correct filler and, for independent reasons, give it a n incorrect tag . )","EXAMPLE (slot 7) : RESPONSE SUSPECTED OR ACCUSED : \"RIGHT-WINGERS \" KEY \\t REPORTED AS FACT: \"LEFT-WINGERS \" (where SUSPECTED OR ACCUSED has been judged partially correct with respec t to its *CORRECT* intended referent, \"LEFT-WINGERS\", i .e ., on the basis of presuming that the whole system response was SUSPECTED OR ACCUSED : \"LEFT-WINGERS\" rather than SUSPECTED OR ACCUSED : \"RIGHT-WINGERS\" ) 3 .1 .4 .3 INCORREC T","If the non-tag portion of the filler is judged incorrect, then the entire filler mus t be judged incorrect, even if the tag portion is correct or partially correct . 3 .2 BY INDIVIDUAL SLO T 3 .2 .1 Slot 1 -- TEMPLATE I D","The guidelines here concern the manual realignment of templates in the cas e where the automatic template mapping facility provided by the scoring progra m fails to identify the optimal mapping between the set of response templates for a message and the set of key templates for that message . Guidelines are needed becaus e it is possible for the user to elect not to map a response template to any key templat e at all, i .e ., to map a response template to NIL and a key template to NIL rather tha n mapping the templates to each other. The user may wish to do this in cases where th e match between the response and the key is so poor and the number of mismatchin g fillers so large that the user would rather penalize the system's recall an d overgeneration (by mapping to NIL) than penalize the system's precision .","However, to ensure the validity of the performance measures and to ensur e comparability among the systems being evaluated, it is important that this option no t be overused . The basic rule is that the user must permit a mapping between a response template and a key template if there is a full or partial match on th e incident type . (The condition concerning a partial match covers the two basi c situations described in section 3 .2 .3 below .) If there is no match on the incident type , manually mapping to NIL is allowed, at the discretion of the user .
