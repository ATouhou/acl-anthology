The conference was sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Information \\ Technology Office (D . Gunning, Program Manager) under the auspices of the Tipster Text Prog\\ ram and was organized by the MUC-6 program committee, co-chaired by Beth Sundheim (\\ NCCOSC/NRaD) and Ralph Grishman (NYU) . Other members of the committee were Chinatsu Aone (SRA Corp .), Lois Childs (Lockheed Martin Corp .), Nancy Chinchor (SAIC), Jerry Hobbs (SRI International), Boya n Onyshkevych (U .S . Dept . of Defense), Marc Vilain (The MITRE Corp .), Takahiro Wakao (Univ . o f Sheffield), and Ralph Weischedel (BBN Systems and Technologies) .","The topic of the conference was performance assessment of text analysis \\ software systems that analyze free text in accordance with prespecified task definitions . To represent th e output of analysis, the systems either insert certain types of annotatio\\ ns into the text or extract certain types of information from the text . \\t","Prior to the conference, systems wer e developed and tested on up to four different tasks : insertion of Named Entity annotations , insertion of Coreference annotations, extraction of Organization and Per\\ son information, and extraction of event information concerning corporate management changes .","The conference was attended by representatives of organizations that par\\ ticipated in the evaluation, US Government representatives, and other invited guests . Sessions included tas k overviews presented by T . Wakao, C . Aone, L . Childs, and B . Sundheim ; a presentation concerning MUC-6 scoring methodology by N . Chinchor ; an overview of evaluation results by B . Sundheim ; system demonstrations and papers on systems and test results given by \\ the larticipating organizations in the evaluation ; and presentations on the Coreference task an d ther topics by some of the evaluation participants, accompanied by discu\\ ssions led by R. rishman to critique the evaluation and make recommendations for future e\\ valuations. Papers in this volume reflect the information presented at the conferenc\\ e. The Dductory paper by Grishman and Sundheim provides additional background, \\ and the paper Vilain et al . elaborates on the Coreference scoring method, which was new for thi s cation ."]},{"title":"TABLE OF CONTENTS Pag e Preface\\t PAPERS : EVALUATION Design of the MUC-6 Evaluation \\t \\t","paragraphs":["1","R .
