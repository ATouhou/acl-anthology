James, chairman an d chief executive officer of McCann-Erickson, and John J . Dooner Jr . , the agency's president and chief operating officer, is quit e telling : Mr . James enjoys sailboating, while Mr . Dooner owns a powerboat . </p > <p>","Now, Mr . James is preparing to sail into the sunset, and Mr . Dooner is poised to rev up the engines to guide Interpublic Group' s McCann-Erickson into the 21st century . Yesterday, McCann mad e official what had been widely anticipated : Mr . James, 57 years old , is stepping down as chief executive officer on July 1 and wil l retire as chairman at the end of the year . He will be succeeded b y Mr . Dooner, 45 . </p > <p>","It promises to be a smooth process, which is unusual given th e volatile atmosphere of the advertising business . But Mr . Dooner ha s a big challenge that will be his top priority . \"I'm going to focu s on strengthening the creative work,\" he says . \"There is room t o grow . We can make further improvements in terms of the perception o f our creative work . \"</p > <p>","Even Alan Gottesman, an analyst with PaineWebber, who believe s McCann is filled with \"vitality\" and is in \"great shape,\" says tha t from a creative standpoint, \"You wouldn't pay to see their reel\" o f commercials . </p > <p> While McCann's world-wide billings rose 12% to $6 .4 billion las t 1 . This article reprinted with permission from Dow Jones . 283 year from $5 .7 billion in 1992, the agency still is dogged by th e loss of the key creative assignment for the prestigious Coca-Col a Classic account . \"I would be less than honest to say I'm no t disappointed not to be able to claim creative leadership for Coke, \" Mr . Dooner says . </p > <p>","McCann still handles promotions and media buying for Coke . Bu t the bragging rights to Coke's ubiquitous advertising belongs t o Creative Artists Agency, the big Hollywood talent agency . \"We ar e striving to have a strong renewed creative partnership wit h Coca-Cola,\" Mr . Dooner says . However, odds of that happening ar e slim since word from Coke headquarters in Atlanta is that CAA an d other ad agencies, such as Fallon McElligott, will continue t o handle Coke advertising . </p > <p>","Mr . Dooner, who recently lost 60 pounds over three-and-a-hal f months, says now that he has \"reinvented\" himself, he wants to d o the same for the agency . For Mr . Dooner, it means maintaining hi s running and exercise schedule, and for the agency, it mean s developing more global campaigns that nonetheless reflect loca l cultures . One McCann account, \"I Can't Believe It's Not Butter,\" a butter substitute, is in 11 countries, for example . </p > <p>","McCann has initiated a new so-called global collaborative system , composed of world-wide account directors paired with creativ e partners . In addition, Peter Kim was hired from WPP Group's J . Walter Thompson last September as vice chairman, chief strateg y officer, world-wide . </p > <p>","Mr . Dooner doesn't see a creative malaise permeating the agency . He points to several campaigns with pride, including the Taster' s Choice commercials that are like a running soap opera . \"It's a $1 9 million campaign with the recognition of a $200 million campaign, \" he says of the commercials that feature a couple that must hold a record for the length of time dating before kissing . </p> <p>","Even so, Mr . Dooner is on the prowl for more creative talent an d is interested in acquiring a hot agency . He says he would like t o finalize an acquisition \"yesterday . I'm not known for patience . \" </p > <p>","Mr . Dooner met with Martin Puris, president and chief executiv e officer of Ammirati & Puris, about McCann's acquiring the agenc y with billings of $400 million, but nothing has materialized . \"Ther e is no question,\" says Mr . Dooner, \"that we are looking for qualit y acquisitions and Ammirati & Puris is a quality operation . There ar e some people and entire agencies that I would love to see be part o f the McCann family .\" Mr . Dooner declines to identify possibl e acquisitions . 284 </p > <p>","Mr . Dooner is just gearing up for the headaches of running one o f the largest world-wide agencies . (There are no immediate plans t o replace Mr . Dooner as president ; Mr . James operated as chairman , chief executive officer and president for a period of time .) Mr . James is filled with thoughts of enjoying his three hobbies : sailing, skiing and hunting . </p > <p>","Asked why he would choose to voluntarily exit while he still i s so young, Mr . James says it is time to be a tad selfish about how h e spends his days . Mr . James, who has a reputation as a n extraordinarily tough taskmaster, says that because he had a grea t time\" in advertising,\" he doesn't want to \"talk about th e disappointments .\" In fact, when he is asked his opinion of the ne w batch of Coke ads from CAA, Mr . James places his hands over hi s mouth . He shrugs . He doesn't utter a word . He has, he says, fon d memories of working with Coke executives . \"Coke has given us grea t highs,\" says Mr . James, sitting in his plush office, filled wit h photographs of sailing as well as huge models of, among othe r things, a Dutch tugboat . </p > <p>","He says he feels a \"great sense of accomplishment .\" In 3 6 countries, McCann is ranked in the top three ; in 75 countries, it i s in the top 10 . </p > <p>","Soon, Mr . James will be able to compete in as many sailing race s as he chooses . And concentrate on his duties as rear commodore a t the New York Yacht Club . </p > <p>","Maybe he'll even leave something from his office for Mr . Dooner . Perhaps a framed page from the New York Times, dated Dec . 8, 1987 , showing a year-end chart of the stock market crash earlier tha t year . Mr . James says he framed it and kept it by his desk as a \"personal reminder . It can all be gone like that . \" </p > </TXT > </DOC> 285"]},{"title":"NAMED ENTITY TASK : TAGGE D STRINGS IN ANSWER KEY FOR WALKTHROUGH ARTICLE","paragraphs":["ENAMEX : ORGANIZATIO N McCann-Erickson McCann-Erickson Interpublic Group McCann-Erickson McCann PaineWebbe r McCann McCann Coke (STATUS=\"OPT\" ) McCann Coke Coke (STATUS=\"OPT\" ) Creative Artists Agenc y Coca-Col a Coke CAA Fallon McElligot t Cok e McCann McCan n WPP Group J .
