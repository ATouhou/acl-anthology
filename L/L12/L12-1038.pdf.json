Translation studies have shown that translated texts often differ systematically from comparable original texts. Translators tend to be faithful to structures of the original texts, resulting in a “shining through” of the original language preferences in the translated text. Translators also tend to make their translations most comprehensible with the effect that translated texts can be more explicit than their source texts. Motivated by the need to use a parallel resource for cross-linguistic feature induction in abstract anaphora resolution, this paper investigates properties of English and German texts in the Europarl corpus, taking into account both general features such as sentence length as well as task-dependent features such as the distribution of demonstrative noun phrases. The investigation is based on the entire Europarl corpus as well as on a small subset thereof, which has been manually annotated. The results indicate English translated texts are sufficiently “authentic” to be used as training data for anaphora resolution; results for German texts are less conclusive, though.

Introduction","paragraphs":["This paper presents a validation of parallel texts in comparison to comparable texts in the Europarl corpus (Koehn, 2005). Parallel texts refer to bi-texts in a source language (Lo, the original language) and its translation to a target language (Lt), which have been aligned at the sentence level. Comparable texts are texts in different languages or varieties that deal with the same overall topic. Our domain of application is the resolution of abstract anaphora. We address the question whether translated texts (e.g., translations into English: ENt) are sufficiently similar to original texts of the same language (ENo) to be used as empirical evidence for feature induction in this domain, or whether original texts only should be used for this purpose. Abstract anaphora denote anaphoric relations between some anaphoric expression and an antecedent that refers to an abstract object like an event, fact or proposition (cf. Asher (1993)). In the classical example by Byron (2002), the pronoun it (underlined in (1a)) refers to an event: the migration of penguins to Fiji. In (1b), the demonstrative pronoun that refers to the fact that penguins migrate to Fiji in the fall.","(1) a. Each Fall, penguins migrate to Fiji. It happens just before the eggs hatch.","b. Each Fall, penguins migrate to Fiji. That’s why I’m going there next month. In (1), the anaphoric elements are pronouns. In this paper, we mainly consider anaphoric noun phrases, as in (2), which is taken from the Europarl corpus. In this example, the NP this task refers to the activity (a specific type of event) of investigating the best ways of promoting a system.","(2) The Commission will investigate the best ways of promoting this system across the Community and will involve the European Parliament in this task. This study is motivated by a larger project of analyzing abstract anaphora (Dipper and Zinsmeister, 2010; Dipper and Zinsmeister, to appear; Dipper et al., 2011; Zinsmeister et al., submitted), which pursues an approach of bootstrapping annotation from German to English and vice versa. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the background of our study: we define the core concepts of parallel and comparable data, address findings of translation studies on how translated texts differ from comparable original data, and present related work on the use of parallel and comparable corpora. Section 3 introduces our corpora, and Section 4 presents results from comparing general and anaphora-related properties. Section 5 concludes the paper."]},{"title":"2. Background 2.1. Parallel and comparable data","paragraphs":["Our study aims at contributing to the debate whether translated text can be used as (training) data in the same way as original text, as is commonly done in computational linguistics. Before going into the details of our approach, we define the relations that hold between different types of text. A multilingual corpus, such as the Europarl corpus, often consists of texts in various source languages and translations of them into multiple other languages. In our study, we concentrate on texts in German and English. Fig. 1 shows the four subcorpora that we deal with: DEo (original German texts), DEt (German texts translated from English), ENo (original English texts) and ENt (English texts translated from German)."]},{"title":"138","paragraphs":["DEo","parallel // compcorp ","comptrans ((QQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQ ENtoo","compcorp vvmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm ENo OO 66mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm parallel // DEtoo OOhhQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQ Figure 1: Relations between the four subcorpora DEo, DEt, ENo, and ENt: (i) parallel, (ii) comparable in the corpus-linguistic sense (compcorp), and (iii) comparable in the translation-studies sense (comptrans) The subcorpora DEo and ENt (and, similarly, ENo and DEt) are parallel corpora, i.e. original texts along with their translations. On the other hand, the subcorpora DEo and ENo (and DEt and ENt) are comparable corpora, i.e. corpora in different languages that deal with the same overall topic and are from the same overall register. This notion of comparable corpora is usually used in corpus-linguistic research. Hence, we call this type of relation comparablecorp. Finally, the subcorpora DEo and DEt (and ENo and ENt) are also comparable corpora, in that they represent varieties of the same language. Translation studies usually refer to such corpora as comparable, hence we call this type of relation comparabletrans. 2.2. Translation effects Using parallel texts for cross-linguistic investigations obviously benefits from the fact that the aligned units convey the same meaning and allow for direct comparison of how this meaning is encoded in the two languages. However, cross-linguistic use of parallel texts also has its limitations due to various factors. First, translated texts can differ systematically from their source texts due to language-inherent reasons, e.g., see Vinay and Darbelnet (1995), Dorr (1994). Klaudy (2008) lists stylistic preferences and cultural differences as further factors that can result in language-specific differences in translations. Second, the translation process itself has been shown to have an impact on the translated text, i.e., there can be a translation bias (Baker, 1993; Čulo et al., 2008). The translated text might be affected, e.g., by the shining through of source language preferences if the translation is too faithful to the source text, cf. Teich (2003). Another effect is described by the explicitation hypothesis, which assumes that translators usually strive to make their translations as comprehensible as possible. As a consequence, the translation might make explicit what was implicit in the source text (Vinay and Darbelnet, 1995; Blum-Kulka, 1986).1 For our study, we expect factors of the first type to result in differences between languages, i.e., in parallel and 1 For a recent survey and critical assessment of the explicitation","hypothesis, see Becher (2011, Ch. 2). comparablecorp corpora. Factors of the second type (shining through and the explicitation hypothesis) should show up as differences between original and translated texts, i.e., in comparabletrans texts. 2.3. Related work The exploitation of parallel corpora in Natural Language Processing has been growing in recent years.2","One reason is annotation projection for under-resourced languages, in which linguistic annotation is transferred from one language to another, when relevant resources and tools are only available in the former language (e.g., Bentivogli and Pianta (2005)). There are some studies that compare original and translated texts in the Europarl corpus. For instance, van Halteren (2008) shows that based on word n-grams it is possible to identify the source language in Europarl translations with accuracies between 87.2–96.7%. Cartoni et al. (2011) investigate the use of discourse connectives in original and translated French texts from Europarl. They find that translated texts contain significantly more discourse connectives than original texts. Korzen and Gylling (2011) find considerable differences between the sentence lengths of original and translated texts in Italian and Danish texts. These findings suggest that one has to look further into the properties of translated texts before using them as a resource for linguistic feature induction. Multilingual corpora have been annotated for investigations in (abstract) anaphora resolution in Recasens (2008), Navarretta and Olsen (2008), Navarretta (2008), Pradhan et al. (2007), Weischedel et al. (2010). These projects deal with comparablecorp rather than parallel corpora. Annotation of parallel texts has been performed in Vieira et al. (2002), who use a subcorpus from the parallel MLCC corpus.3","They investigate demonstrative NPs in French and Portuguese. Results for both languages are similar: demonstrative NPs predominantly have an abstract head noun. In their study, they do not distinguish between original and translated texts."]},{"title":"3.

Our corpus consists of 12,800 German original turns with 4.9 M tokens, and 11,500 English original turns with 3.4 M tokens. 3.1. Automatic preprocessing Automatic preprocessing of the German and English subcorpora included POS tagging and chunking by the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994), with German and English language models as provided by the official TreeTagger website.5 In addition, we automatically marked selected abstract noun chunks, which possibly function as abstract anaphors. Noun chunks that would be selected fulfill two conditions: first, they contain a demonstrative determiner — such noun phrases are usually used anaphorically. Second, the head noun is part of a pre-defined set of so-calledlabel nouns.6 The label nouns are highly inspired by the list of English abstract nouns provided by Francis (1994). For the English data, the set comprises 211 types of label nouns, which have been extracted in their singular and plural forms. Examples for English label nouns in the Europarl corpus are report, proposal, agreement, issue, point, etc. For the German data, the most probable German translations of the English label nouns have been used. This resulted in 452 German types of label nouns for which the inflected forms have been marked in the German data. (For more details on the selection of label nouns, see Zinsmeister et al. (submitted).) 3.2. Manual annotation of a subcorpus Most of the label nouns described above are unambiguously abstract, with some exceptions such as area or report. In contrast, pronominal anaphors are (mostly) ambiguous and can refer to entities other than abstract objects. We created a small manually-annotated subcorpus called Anaphora Corpus of approximately 100 turns for each language, in which annotators disambiguated pre-marked pronominals and demonstrative label-noun chunks. Manual annotation also provided information about the antecedent of pronominal anaphors, and about the position, function, etc. of the anaphoric element. (For a more detailed description of the manual annotation of pronominal abstract anaphors, see Dipper et al. (2011), for the annotation of label nouns, see Zinsmeister et al. (submitted).)","4","The original language of each turn was determined by means of the language tags provided in the Europarl corpus, and complemented by a lookup in databases listing the members of the EU Parliament along with their nationalities.","5","http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/ projekte/corplex/TreeTagger/. The German chunker was trained on the Tiger Treebank (Brants et al., 2004), the English chunker on the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993). The POS tagsets used in these annotations are the STTS tagset for German (Schiller et al., 1999), and the UPenn Treebank tagset for English (Santorini, 1990).","6","In the biomedical literature, label nouns are referred to as ‘sortal nouns’, e.g. Castaño et al. (2002)."]},{"title":"4. Results","paragraphs":["The texts that we investigate are highly similar in the sense that they are all from the same text type, namely parliament debates. They deal with different topics, depending on the agenda of the current session, but our basic assumption is that the choice of topic should have no significant impact on low-level properties such as, e.g., the number of nouns. In this study, we focus on features that are considered relevant for anaphora resolution, and the resolution of abstract anaphora in particular. That is, we mainly investigate the distributions of noun phrases, in particular demonstrative label-noun chunks, which are likely to be abstract anaphors. The investigations are based on the parallel and comparable corpora described in Section 3. As the study aims at testing the similarity of original and translated texts, the main focus is on differences between comparabletrans turns, i.e., we compare DEo with DEt, and ENo with ENt. In addition, we compare the language pair-ings DEo–ENo with DEo–ENt, and ENo–DEo with ENo– DEt. This can shed light on translational effects: if, e.g., the pairing DEo–ENt turns out more similar than the pairing DEo–ENo, this could be a shining through effect. The comparison would profit from deep linguistic processing (as has been shown by authorship attribution studies, e.g., Kaster et al. (2005)). Such processing is only provided in the manually annotated Anaphora Corpus. For investigating anaphora-related properties of the complete Europarl data, we therefore have to use approximations, such as the ratio of definite or demonstrative noun chunks as rough approximations of anaphoric elements.7 4.1. Sentence length We start by comparing the average sentence length as a highly general measure for similarity. The average sentence length is calculated as the average number of tokens per sentence, as identified in the preprocessing.8 Corpus #Sent Tok/Sent 95% CI SD DEo 220,609 22.2 22.1 . . 22.3 13.8 DEt 162,528 24.2 24.1 . . 24.2 13.2 ENo 147,375 26.6 26.5 . . 26.6 14.1 ENt 184,579 28.8 28.7 . . 28.9 16.2 Table 1: Average sentence lengths: total number of sentences, average number of tokens per sentence, 95% confidence interval, and standard deviation On average, English sentences are clearly longer than German sentences, as can be seen in Table 1. This could be, among others, attributed to the different realizations of compound nouns in both languages. Comparing DEo with DEt, and ENo with ENt, we observe that in both languages, sentences of translated texts tend to 7 Fraurud (1992) showed that 60.9% of the definite noun","phrases in her sample were first mentions, i.e. not used anaphor-","ically. However, it is clear that definite anaphors are the default:","only 8.3% of the indefinite noun phrases were anaphoric. 8 Punctuation marks have been included."]},{"title":"140","paragraphs":["be longer than sentences of original texts. This could be viewed as an effect of explicitation. The differences in average sentence length between the subcorpora are all statistically significant, as can be seen from the non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals. However, the confidence intervals are very small. This is an effect of the large sample size, i.e., the large number of sentences that contribute to the mean. It is a general problem in corpus linguistics that statistical hypothesis testing becomes hard to interpret when the sample size is large. Gries (2005) suggests to employ measures of effect size, in particular Cohen’s d 9","(also called standarized mean difference), to quantify the amount of observed differences in means independently of the sample size. Cohen’s d ranges from d = 0, if no effect is observed, to infinity. An effect size ofd between 0.2 to 0.3 is considered small, d = 0.5 medium, and d = 0.8 to infinitylarge (Cohen, 1988). Negative polarity means that the second mean in the equation is larger than the first one.

Table 1) The first two rows in Table 2 show that the effect sizes of the standardized mean difference between DEo and DEt on the one hand, and ENo and ENt on the other hand, are small (d = −0.14, d = −0.15). These differences can be ignored. The comparablecorp pair DEo–ENo shows medium differences between the languages (d = −0.31).10","This confirms the significant results displayed in Table 1. Turning to the parallel pairs (DEo–ENt, and ENo–DEt), the medium effect could either become more pronounced than in the comparablecorp pair, which could indicate an effect of explicitation, or it could become less pronounced, which would rather indicate an effect of shining through. Interestingly, we find indications for explicitation inENt (d in-creases from –0.31 to –0.44) and for shining through inDEt (d decreases from 0.31 to 0.18). 4.2. Nouns in general We start our task-related comparison by looking at the distribution of nouns and noun chunks (NC) in general. To compare the frequencies between the different subcorpora, we normalize the observed noun frequencies by token frequencies.

Important effect sizes are given in boldface. clause, definite NCs per NCs in general and the proportion of demonstrative NCs among definite NCs.11 Our null hypothesis is that the number of nouns, noun chunks, definite and demonstrative noun chunks should be similar across comparabletrans corpora, i.e., across DEo and DEt, and across ENo and ENt, respectively. Statistical significance tests (Welch’s t-test) reject the null hypothesis in most cases, as is shown in Table 3.12 However, as we have seen above (Section 4.1), such significance scores are hard to interpret with large sample sizes. Hence, we again turn to Cohen’s d as an alternative measure. Table 4 depicts the effect sizes of the comparisons. Looking first at the comparabletrans corpora, we see that the effect sizes for English are small for all features— despite the significant differences shown in Table 3. In contrast, the distribution of nouns (Nouns/Tok) and definite NCs (Def/NC) in German clearly differ in both subcorpora. Turning to the comparablecorp and parallel pairs, the picture is similar: The effect sizes of ENo and ENt do not in-crease or decrease considerably. In German, however, the distribution of nouns and definite NCs in translated texts, again, deviates considerably from the distribution in original texts. In particular, we observe an overuse of nouns and definite NCs, which could be an expliciteness effect (as-suming that definite NCs are more explicit than indefinite NCs). 11 The corresponding approximations for the German and En-","glish corpora are:","• Nouns: DE: pos=\"NN\"; EN: pos=\"(NN|NNS)\".

Label nouns We next investigate the use of typical label nouns such as fact, situation, based on our predefined sets of label nouns (see Sec. 3). In DEo, these label nouns represent 3.48% of all nouns, in ENo, 4.07%. For both languages, the ratios are higher in translated texts: 4.01% in DEt, 4.25% in ENt. We next compare the individual frequencies of these nouns across all corpora, normalized against the total number of nouns in the respective subcorpus (and multiplied by 1 million).13","Only nouns with (normalized) frequencies greater than 100 were considered; outliers have been removed.14 Fig. 2 displays the results for German (left plot) and English (right plot). The solid lines denote the number of label nouns that occur more often in translations (overuse), the dashed lines nouns that occur less often in translations (underuse). The plots show that in both languages, overuse dominates underuse: In German, 22% (100 out of 452) nouns show overuse vs. 17% (75 out of 452) nouns show underuse. In English, there are 39% (83 out of 211) overuse vs. 33% (69 out of 211) underuse nouns. The difference scores (y-axis) indicate the (normalized) ratios between original and translated frequencies. For instance, a score of 2 for an overuse noun indicates that the noun occurs twice as often in the translated than in the original texts. Especially with overuse nouns, the differences between the frequencies can be enormous, see below. We now turn to individual frequencies of label nouns rather than general tendencies. Pairwise comparison of label nouns frequencies in original and translated texts shows that they are clearly correlated.15 Fig. 3 show the frequencies of label nouns in German (left plot) and English (right plot), comparing original and trans-","13","The total number of nouns (tokens) in the subcorpora are: DEo: 890k (4.7m); DEt: 1.2m (5.7m); ENo: 660k (3.8m); ENt: 860k (5.0m). As an example of normalized frequencies, consider the noun Aussprache ‘debate’: raw frequencies in DEo: 226, in DEt: 2106; normalized frequencies in DEo: 255, in DEt: 1803, cf.

Again, only nouns with more than 100 (normalized) occurrences in both texts have been included. Furthermore, outliers with extremely high frequencies in either the original or translated corpus and outliers with extreme differences between both corpora are not displayed. The heights of the boxplots clearly illustrate the overuse of label nouns in translations, already mentioned above. Table 5 lists the label nouns with most extreme overuse and underuse. For instance, the noun Aussprache ‘debate’ occurs 7.1 times more often in DEt than in DEo. The figures show that the differences between original and translated noun frequencies are much more important with overuse (“Increase”) than with underuse (“Decrease”). These overuses result in some sort of constricted vocabulary in the translations. Disregarding individual noun preferences, the overall distributions of increasing and decreasing frequencies of label nouns are rather similar and they turn out not to be significantly different.16","Taken that label nouns are approximations for abstract anaphora, we conclude that the use of abstract anaphora as such is comparable in original and translated texts. This does not hold for the lexical realizations, though. Further investigations are needed to decide whether the lexical overuse and underuse of particular nouns also effects the distribution of the semantic types of abstract anaphors, such as fact or event. 4.4. Anaphora corpus The findings for the manually annotated Anaphora Corpus are mainly in line with the findings of the entire Europarl corpus. As an overall tendency, the differences between translated and original texts are not significant. We found no significant difference for function (subject, object, other) in the original and translated versions (for both German and English). For position, the only statistical significant difference concerns the discourse-linked left periphery (“pre-field”) in German: compared to DEo, DEt uses abstract anaphors less often in the pre-field. The difference could be due to shining through of English information structure, and possibly reflects the fact that English does not have a corresponding discourse-linked posi-tion that can be easily occupied by abstract anaphors. (For a more detailed discussion of the results of the Anaphora 16","A Mann-Whitney test (= Wilcoxon rank sum test) yields for German: W = 3981, p = 0.4871, and for English: W = 3335, p = 0.08133."]},{"title":"142","paragraphs":["Figure 2: Number of nouns that occur more often (solid line) or less often (dashed line) in translations than in original texts (left plot: German, right plot: English).

We conclude from the evaluation of effect sizes that English texts and texts translated from German into English are sufficiently similar to be both used as (training) texts for abstract anaphora investigations even if the translated texts tend to be longer, which we attribute to explicitation. For German texts and texts translated from English into German, the conclusions are not as straightforward as with their English counterparts.

Since the effect sizes are only of medium size, we would not completely refrain from using the translated texts, but further investigations are necessary. In addition to the general considerations, we also investigated the distribution of label nouns as an approximation of abstract anaphora. The subcorpora show similar overall distributions of label nouns but differ with respect to their lexical choices. It seems that translators employ a more restricted vocabulary than the original speakers. It has to be evaluated independently whether tools that are sensitive to lexical choice differ in performance when trained on either the original or translated subcorpora."]},{"title":"6.
