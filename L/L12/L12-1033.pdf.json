To this end, materials from the German Gutenberg Archive4","were selected and annotated by a suite of computational linguistics tools that are available as part of WebLicht5",",  1 CLARIN: www.clarin.eu 2 CLARIN-D: http://clarin-d.net/index.php/en/ 3 CLARIN was recently granted the official status of a Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC).

By including linguistic annotations in the TüBa-D/DC, it becomes possible to search the corpus materials in a much more fine-grained and targeted fashion than is possible in the case of an unannotated corpus. At the same time, the linguistic annotations can provide valuable information for the identification of subgenres included in the corpus and can also serve as cues for tracking language change. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the following aspects of the TüBa-D/DC: its textual basis (section 2.1), its linguistic annotations (section 2.2), its associated metadata (section 2.3), the assignment of persistent identifiers (section 2.4), the storage of the TüBa-D/DC in the CLARIN-D center repository, and means for metadata harvesting (section 2.5). Section 3 describes various methods and tools for accessing the TüBa-D/DC metadata and object data (section 3.1), as well as its linguistic annotations (section 3.2 to section 3.6). The paper concludes with a discussion of open research issues and of future directions for research (section 4). "]},{"title":"2.

It was automatically annotated by a suite of NLP tools integrated into WebLicht, the linguistic chaining tool used in CLARIN-D. The annotation quality has been evaluated manually for a subcorpus ranging from Middle High German to Modern High German. The integration of the TüBa-D/DC into the CLARIN-D infrastructure includes metadata provision and harvesting as well as sustainable data storage in the Tübingen CLARIN-D center. The paper further provides an overview of the possibilities of accessing the TüBa-D/DC data. Methods for full-text search of the metadata and object data and for annotation-based search of the object data are described in detail. The WebLicht Service Oriented Architecture is used as an integrated environment for annotation based search of the TüBa-D/DC.

For all tools that require a trained data model, version 5.0 of the TüBa-D/Z (Tübinger Treebank des Deutschen/Zeitungstext)7",", a  6 Dependency parsing is in preparation. 7 http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/tuebadz.shtml German treebank, was used as training data (Telljohann et al. 2004). Figure 8 in section 3.5 shows an example of the constituent structure layer of the TüBa-D/DC. It displays the parse tree of the sentence Die beste Bildung findet ein gescheiter Mensch auf Reisen ('The best education an intelligent person receives during travels') taken from Goethe’s novel Wilhelm Meister’s Lehrjahre. This novel is included in the GGP, and its syntactic structure is generated by the Berkeley parser. The preterminal nodes in the parse tree are labeled by part of speech tags taken from the Stuttgart Tübingen Tagset (STTS, Schiller et al. 1995). The phrasal nodes include a layer of topological fields such as VF (Vorfeld), LK (Linke Klammer), and MF (Mittelfeld). Topological fields in the sense of Höhle (1986) are widely used in descriptive studies of German syntax. Such fields constitute an intermediate layer of analysis above the level of individual phrases and below the clause level. Detailed information about the syntactic annotation scheme used in the TüBa-D/DC and in the TüBa-D/Z can be found in Telljohann et al. (2009). Since the linguistic annotation of the TüBa-D/DC was performed automatically, the resulting annotations are not 100% accurate. In order to assess the quality of the annotation, an evaluation of the POS tagging accuracy was performed via data-sampling. The selected data sample of six different subcorpora (see Table 3) was chosen in such a way that they cover a long time span.  For each of the six data samples, the part-of-speech tags automatically assigned to the first 13,000 tokens were manually inspected and corrected by an experienced research assistant. The error analysis has revealed three common types of errors: (i) errors due to the diachronic nature of the corpus, such as differences in orthographic conventions, (ii) errors due to unknown words, and (iii) mistaggings (due to limitations of N-gram tagging) that would also occur in purely synchronic material.8"," "]},{"title":"2.3 Metadata","paragraphs":["All texts from the GGP come with a set of metadata in a Dublin Core-like format. This metadata contains information about the individual texts such as author, year of publication etc. In the GGP, the set of metadata elements is not uniform across the data entries. For example, some of the metadata sets contain an entry for the year of first publication, while others don’t. This is partly due to the fact that it is not always easy, and in some cases not even possible, to determine the correct data. Another possible contributing factor to the incompleteness of the metadata may be that the GGP is an ongoing project that enlists the help of thousands of volunteers, which  8 See Hinrichs and Zastrow (2012) for a more detailed discussion."]},{"title":"1623","paragraphs":["can degrade uniformity9",". It was therefore necessary to manually check and correct, where possible, the metadata of all 19,377 texts in the TüBa-D/DC. After the manual correction, the metadata was then converted from its original format to the Component MetaData Infrastructure (CMDI)10","format, the metadata standard used in CLARIN. Figure 1 shows an excerpt of CMDI metadata, describing Goethe’s novel Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre. In addition to the CMDI files for the individual subcorpora, there are two additional CMDI files. One is the master document which contains advanced and detailed information about the TüBa-D/DC as a whole. This includes information about the linguistic layers as well as the process of creation the TüBa-D/DC. This master document provides the first point of access by one who is interested in information about the TüBa-D/DC. An excerpt of this master document is shown in Figure 2.

The Werther novel was published in the 18th century in two editions authorized by Goethe. The first edition was published in 1774 and replaced by Goethe himself in 1787 by the second edition. This second edition was later incorporated into the \"Weimarer Ausgabe\" of 1899. 10 More information on the CMDI metadata format can be found here: http://www.clarin.eu/cmdi  the PID to one or more external URLs11",".

In the case of the TüBa-D/DC, its PID points to the master CMDI document, discussed above, which contains links to all the 19,377 individual documents of the corpus. Although it would also be possible to assign a PID to each individual text, or to go even further, to every sentence or even every individual token of the corpus, this was not considered practical in the case of the TüBa-D/DC. But in principle it is possible to define an arbitrary depth of granularity for every resource individually.

This repository uses Fedora Commons, a general purpose open-source repository system, as a backend for storing digital objects.

The VLO is a web-based application with facetted search functionality for browsing and displaying metadata for language resources and tools. The VLO also provides functionality for full-text search and for displaying the site at which a resource or tool resides (see Figure 5). Another way of accessing the metadata and the full text of the TüBa-D/DC is via the Lucene full text search engine, hosted at the CLARIN-D center in Tübingen. This application allows a user to search, for example,  16 The VLO can be found here: http://catalog.clarin.eu/ds/ for specific words using Lucene’s query language.

For example, the lemmatization layer supports queries not only to individual word forms, but to all occurrences of a particular lemma in the corpus. The part of speech annotation layer can be searched for recurring N-Grams, and the syntactic constituent structure for particular phrase types or syntatctic constructions. The WebLicht Service Oriented Architecture is used as an integrated environment for annotation based search of the TüBa-D/DC.

CQP is widely used in computational linguistics to index and query large text corpora. With its integrated query language, linguistic annotations on the token level (the token itself, lemma or part of speech annotations) can be queried. With CQP, it is unfortunately not possible to query the syntax-level annotations. The following CQP query demonstrates how to use token, part of speech and lemma information in a search. It searches for constructs in which any token with the part of speech tag ADJD is followed by a token with the lemma Mensch. Then, a gap of one to four tokens is allowed after which a token Reisen with the part of speech tag NN should be present: @[pos='ADJA'] [lemma='Mensch'] []{1,4} [(word='Reisen') & (pos='NN')];  Depending on the configured context, CQP returns the results as „Keyword in Context“ (KWIC) or the entire sentence(s) in which a match was found.
