Such a way of tagging seems to be more efficient because it allows an intention description of morphological forms compared with the extensive collection of usual dictionaries. This method has already been experimented on French and has given promising results. It is very relevant since it allows both to bring hidden morphological rules to light which are very useful especially for foreign learners and take lexical creativity into account. Moreover, this morphological tagging was conceived in relation to the subsequent disambiguation which is mainly based on local grammars. The purpose is to create a morphological analyser being easily adaptable and modifiable and avoiding the usual errors of the ordinary morphological taggers linked to dictionaries."]},{"title":"Introduction","paragraphs":["“The usefulness of corpora as a resource for language related research is proportional to the degree to which they have been linguistically annotated.

Grammatical Categories 1.1. Generalities","paragraphs":["NLP2","has to deal with large variations about grammatical categories. Dictionaries don’t often agree on the number and nature of them. That’s the same in NLP devices where categories also differ in number and nature depending on their purpose. Looking at four dictionaries results tagging words – two of them are paper dictionaries, others are electronic ones – we can see the lack of norms through the great variations but could we talk about norms with natural languages? (see Table1, ANNEX1)) By observing the entries and categories of chosen words in the two former bilingual dictionaries we can see two major differences:","- first of all parts of speech are not always the","same,","- and, when they are the same, they can appear in a","different order. We can guess that it comes from the internal priorities lexicologists gave within a particular dictionary dedicated to a special usage. For instance Robert & Collins seem to make the parts of speech (when several) appear in relation to the decreasing frequencies whereas Harraps gives all the possible tags in a predefined order (N, Vtr, Vi, Mod, V substitute, Vaux...). At least we can guess that the order is based on the relative frequencies of each category. But, even if these methodologies seem both to be based on frequency, their results could be greatly different: there are much more nouns than modals in language but what about ambiguous forms? The word CAN, for example, is much often a modal than a noun.  1 [10] 2 NLP: Natural Language Processing 1.1.1. Traditionnal Grammatical Partition Concerning the first difference the problem is all the more difficult that linguists have never agreed on the number and nature of grammatical classes although grammatical categorisation has been studied since Antiquity. Antiquity gave 8 traditional parts of speech but modern linguistics refuses this partition which is not based on a strong theoretical basis since the partition is based on a multiplicity of heterogeneous criteria – formal (morphological), notional (semantical, psychological or logical) and functional (syntactical) ones.3 Some say that traditional partition has a real practical efficacy besides its unpleasant theoretical foundation. Others see it as a great intuition but can’t see any possible application. Thus we can see a lot of adaptations ranging from 2 to 23 (or more) parts of speech coming from the 8 fundamentals. 1.1.2. Grammatical Partition In Nlp NLP introduced new needs and new criteria and we assist at an increasing number of the grammatical POS (just look at the tags used by the electronic OED over there which not only gives the nature of words but also the function) in the devices. A large tagset is often used to prevent ambiguities and interferences in devices with a special purpose and it often runs. But it prevents from establishing pure theoretical rules, which could be used in many areas."]},{"title":"1.2. Practical Choice","paragraphs":["In front of such a vagueness and since our aim wasn’t to set a theory on how to establish grammatical parts, we adopted the classification of the electronic OED with some regularisations. In one way it seems to be important for NLP tools to be based on existing supports because it could bring the possibility to adapt them on other supports and maybe on other languages – it brings adaptability to the system. A large tagset could bring very good results on a very restricted field but what could that bring in a more general area? Using your own tagset can help you to avoid difficulties but on the other hand it implies building your own dictionary – the same tagset also brings functionality.  3 [6] According to me NLP cannot allow itself building a dictionary for each different purposes under the risk of losing efficiency. It must tend toward “a kind of normalisation” (even if it’s a utopian view in the field of natural language) and if not, try to use the existing tools to exploit them and have the same point of departure. We finally adopted the traditional partition (8 categories) divided into subdivisions as the OED does."]},{"title":"2. The Data","paragraphs":["We chose the Oxford English Dictionary because: - Its quality is agreed, - It includes large data, - Its electronic form makes the treatment easier."]},{"title":"2.1. Data Analysis 2.1.1. Data Extraction","paragraphs":["We studied the 8 traditional classes. We first extracted the four files of the four major categories4",":","- Adjectives,","- Adverbs,","- Nouns ,","- Verbs. Then we joint the four minor categories6",":","- Conjunctions,","- Interjections,","- Prepositions,","- Pronouns. Indeed, even if the relatively small number of the words contained in these categories could allow to set a complete dictionary with them we thought interesting to analyse their morphological behaviour to check whether their structure is less logical than in the four major classes - as it seems to be - or if the structure depends on a deep logic invisible from the surface. The further results will show if we can set out some regularities in the structuring rules or if not if we should implement them totally. Concerning the determiners we set them aside deliberately because of the own definition we wanted to give to them. In fact we can notice that even if there are no unilateral definitions of the classes, linguists relatively agreed on major classes (adjectives, adverbs, nouns and verbs). But that’s not the same with minor classes that’s why we followed the OED description for the minor classes (conjunctions, interjection, prepositions and pronouns) but not for the determiners which will be redefined in relation to the further analysis. The class will be totally implemented further. 2.1.2. Data Pretreatment We had to clean and check the files to eliminate the semantic information that could give birth to noise in an unsemantical analysis. Some errors remains but they only concern 0.04% of the ambiguous forms and 0.03% of the whole data. So we consider that such error rates are negligible and couldn’t question the following results. Here is the final repartition of the eight categories:","P.O.S WORDS NUMBER adjectives 48355  4 The expression must be understood quantitavely speaking. adverbs 7826 conjunctions 83 interjections 629 nouns 15306 prepositions 192 pronouns 134 verbs 24776 TOTAL 97301"]},{"title":"2.2.

We didn’t find a word belonging to more than six categories at the same time. 2.2.2.

Verb / Adj: 15,07% Noun/Adj: 14,28% Adv/Adj: 6,16% We can see that they only are combinations of the major classes. In the triple categories the four biggest ones constitute 82.2% of them: Noun/Adj/Verb: 53,48% Adv/Adj/Verb: 15,54% Noun/Adv/Verb: 7,68% Adv/Adj/Noun: 5,5% Once again they only are combinations of the major classes what is quite logical mathematically: the most numerous double class crossed with the most numerous simple one should make the most important triple class."]},{"title":"2.3.

Adjectives (6.73%) are not very ambiguous even if it is the biggest class. That’s the same for the adverbs. Table 4 The high ambiguity rates shows that the ambiguities in these classes are often included in other classes at the same time. We also can see that the minor classes are often over ambiguous (Conj_Adj: 80%, Conj_Adv: 80%) even if not numerous. Contrary to this are the simple classes Nouns and Verbs, which are very ambiguous but essentially form the double class Noun_Verb that is not very ambiguous (13,78%). This double class, which contains 6544 members among which 5642 are non-ambiguous ones, includes the great majority of the ambiguous verbal (7613) and nominal (7665) forms."]},{"title":"2.4.

Rules Formal Definition Establishing rules requires a formal definition. Here are the formal criteria used to set the rules: a) We firstly consider the non-ambiguous forms only. b) In any case: the number of exceptions ≤ the number of","forms treated by the rules. c) There’s a rule when the most important number of","forms is at least ≈ (± 10%) to the double of the just","inferior number.

We used the BNC annotated by CLAWS to extract the various contexts of the ambiguities. Then we wrote local grammars able to assign the right tag to an ambiguity in a specified context. 4.3.2.

Conclusion","paragraphs":["There is an increasing need for linguistically annotated corpora but a lack of such available corpora.We now achieve good precision with statistical models but we think linguistics can’t be satisfied with this solution.So we chose to create and implement a linguitic morphological model to disambiguate morphological ambiguities. The morphological tagging seems to be more efficient because it gives an intention description of morphological forms compared with the extensive collection of usual dictionaries. It is very relevant since it allows both to bring hidden morphological rules to light which are very useful especially for foreign learners and take lexical creativity into account. The very precise description of the methodology can drive to an automation of the procedure. The morphological disambiguation is based on local grammars since there is no complete definite linguistic theory able to describe all the syntax complexity. Moreover local grammars offer more flexibility than a global syntactic model. Of course we first didn’t take compounds into account, we are certainly going to let some syntactical structures aside and the corpus is oviously limited but the model seems to be linguistically efficient. Our purpose is to create an easily adaptable and modifiable morphological analyser which can avoid the usual errors of the ordinary morphological taggers and disambiguate the most refractory ambiguities. It could be used either as the first step of a more complete analyser, either under its descritive form, or to annotate corpora."]},{"title":"6. References","paragraphs":["[1] COTTE P. (1994).
