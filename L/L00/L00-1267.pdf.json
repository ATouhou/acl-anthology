The method called ARISTA (Kontos, 1980, 1983, 1992, 1998a, 1998b, 1999) which stands for Automatic Representation Independent Syllogistic Text Analysis has been proposed as an alternative to the traditional methods of knowledge extraction from text that rely on the formal representation of text content. These traditional methods have been applied so far in lexical processing projects that rely on the formal representation of the natural language definitions of terms. Characteristic examples of such projects that are based on formal representations are the family of GALEN projects (Rector, et al., 1996, 1998), as well as (Schulz & Romacker, 1998) in the medical domain.","The concept of a representation independent definition-generating lexicon for compound words is introduced in this paper following the ARISTA method. This concept is used as a basis for developing a generative lexicon of Greek compound medical terminology using the senses of their component words expressed in natural language and not in a formal language. The work reported is part of a larger human language technology project of our Research Centre. This project aims at the development of a human language technology system for the knowledge intensive support of a health professional in therapy management. The main knowledge sources of this system are medical lexical resources and textual material concerning drugs necessary for the therapy of infectious diseases.","Compound Greek medical terms used in the English medical sublanguage were analysed into their component words. The possible senses of each compound term were generated using a lexicon defining in natural language the senses of their component words. A Prolog program that was implemented for this task is presented that is capable of computing implicit relations between the components words in a sublanguage using linguistic and extra linguistic knowledge. An extra linguistic knowledge base containing knowledge derived from the domain or microcosm of the sublanguage is used for supporting the computation of the implicit relations. The kinds of relations between nouns that are used are derived from Greek grammar (Malagardi, 1996).","The performance of the system was evaluated by generating possible definitions of the compound words automatically and judging the correctness of the results by comparing them with definitions given in a medical lexicon expressed in the language of the lexicographer. The comparison involved the judgment by health professionals of the acceptability of the definition of the compound word in the cases of wording different than the one given by the lexicographer.","The method proposed could be used to compress the Greek part of a medical lexicon for the space critical applications of systems that will be used with a local interface for the health professionals that will interact with the system remotely. This remote interaction is envisaged to take place using the lightest possible hardware in order to facilitate the use of the system in as many emergency situations as possible.",""]},{"title":"2.

In example (1) the compound consists of two entity-nouns i.e. “sarcoma” which is a tumor and “chondros” which is a body part. Since we know that tumors are located in body parts it follows that the implicit relation is that of location, where chondros is the location of the sarcoma.","In example (2) the compound consists of two entity-nouns i.e. “hema” which is a fluid and “arthrosis” which is a body part. Since we know that liquids may have as origin body parts it follows that the implicit relation is that of origin, where arthrosis is the origin of hema. Note that the original Greek spelling of “hema” is “haima” or “haema” which means blood.","In example (3) the compound consists of two entity-nouns i.e. “staphylo” which is a fruit and “coccus” which is a microorganism. Since we know that fruits and microorganisms may have only common appearence it follows that the implicit relation is an attributive relation of appearance, where the coccus appears like staphylo.","In example (4) the compound consists of two entity-nouns i.e. “azot” which is a gas and “hema” which is a fluid. Since we know that gases maybe contained in fluids it follows that the implicit relation is that of content, where azot is inside hema or haima as explained above in example (2).","In example (5) the compound consists of two entity-nouns i.e. “bacter” which is a microorganism and “hema” which is a fluid. Since we know that microorganisms maybe contained in fluids it follows that the implicit relation is that of content, where azot is inside hema.","In example (6) the compound consists of two entity-nouns i.e. “neuro” which is a body part and “toxin” which is a harmful substance. Since we know that harmful substances damage body parts it follows that the implicit relation is that of causality, where toxin causes damage to neuro.","In example (7) the compound consists of one adjective denoting a comparative relation i.e. “aniso” and one entity-noun “coria”, which is a body part. Since we know that comparative relations may exist between body  parts it follows that the implicit relation is that of comparison.","In example (8) the compound consists of one entity-noun i.e. “cardio”, which is a body part and one adjective (property) i.e. “megaly” which concerns to size. Since we know that body parts have size it follows that the implicit relation is an attributive relation.","In example (9) the compound consists of one adjective (property) that concerns rating i.e. “ambly” and one process-noun i.e. “opia” which is a sensing-process. Since we know that sensing can be rated it follows that the implicit relation is an attributive relation.","In example (10) the compound consists of one entity-noun i.e. “aero” which is a gas (in reality a mixture of gases) and one process-noun i.e. “phagy” which is an ingestion process. Since we know that gases can be moved it follows that the implicit relation is a relation between a process and a moving object.","In example (11) the compound consists of one entity-noun i.e. “dermato” which is a body part and one process-noun i.e. “mycosis” which is a disease. Since we know that diseases are located in body parts it follows that the implicit relation is a locative relation between a disease and a body part.","In example (12) the compound consists of one entity-noun i.e. “acro” which is a body part and one process-noun i.e. “cyanosis” which is a discoloration. Since we know that discolorations can apply to body parts it follows that the implicit relation is a patient relation between the discoloration and the body part.","In example (13) the compound consists of one entity-noun i.e. “tracheo” which is a body part and one process-noun i.e. “tomy” which is a surgical procedure. Since we know that surgical procedures apply to body parts it follows that the implicit relation is a patient relation between the tomy and the body part.","In example (14) the compound consists of one entity-noun i.e. “manometer” which is an instrument and one process-noun i.e. “sphygmo” which is a physiologic process. Since we know that instruments are used for monitoring physiologic processes it follows that the implicit relation is that of use.","In order to be able to perform the computation of implicit relations similar to the ones mentioned above our program must have access to a knowledge base of extra linguistic knowledge derived from the medical domain. Both taxonomic and meronomic extra linguistic knowledge is used as knowledge base that supports the analysis of the Greek language phrases that are being processed by the system. Such a knowledge base will also contain rules of the following kind for the computation of the implicit relations:"," 1. If tumors are located in body parts it follows that the","implicit relation is that of location. 2. If liquids may have as origin body parts it follows that","the implicit relation is that of origin. 3.

The Computation of the Definitions of Compound Terms","paragraphs":["The definitions of all possible senses of each compound term were generated using a lexicon defining in natural language the senses of their component words. The ontology implicit in the definitions is used for choosing the appropriate rule of definition combination. A number of rules specifying the relations allowable between general concepts that group the component words also support this generation. A Prolog program that was implemented for this task is related to the one computing implicit relations between the components words in a sublanguage using linguistic and extra linguistic knowledge. An extra linguistic knowledge base containing knowledge derived from the domain or microcosm of the sublanguage that supports the computation of the implicit relations is used in the program. Some examples of definitions of component words are given below as coded in the program using the predicate “means”:  means([acro],[the,extremity_ties]). means([cyanosis],[a,bluish,discoloration]). means([aero],[air]). means([phagy],[eating]). means([phagy],[swallowing]). means([brady],[abnormal,slowness]). means([brady],[sluggineshness]). means([cardia],[the,heart]). means([cardia],[the,heart,beat]). means([kinesia],[movement]). means([kinesia],[the,physical,and,mental,response_es]). means([pnea],[the,breathing]). means([cardio],[the,heart]). means([genic],[caused,by,a,function]). means([genic],[caused,by,abnormal,function]). means([megaly],[large,size]). means([pathy],[disease]). means([pathy],[disorder]). means([cardio],[the,heart]). means([myo],[the,muscle]).  Part of the ontology used for processing these definitions is coded in the program as follows: isa([acro],entity). isa([aero],entity). isa([cardio],entity). isa([cardia],entity). isa([brady],property). isa([cyanosis],process). isa([phagy],process). isa([cardia],entity). isa([kinesia],process). isa([pnea],process). isa([genic],process). isa([megaly],property). isa([myo],entity). isa([pathy],process).  A sample of rules for generating definitions of compound terms is given below. For two component words: expl(X,Y,_,_,E) :- means(X,A,S), means(Y,B,S), isa(X,property),isa(Y,entity), conc([of],B,C), conc(A,C,E). and for three component words: expl(X,Y,Z,_,E) :- means(X,A,S), means(Y,B,S), means(Z,C,S), isa(X,entity), isa(Y,entity), isa(Z,process), conc([of],B,B1),conc([of],A,A1),conc(C,B1,D),conc(D,A 1,E). Using the predicate expl(A,B,C,D,T), and an output function of the form write(A,\"+\",B,\"+\",C,\"+\",D,\"=\",T), definitions of the kind illustrated in Table 2 are generated by the program."]},{"title":"[\"acro\"]+[\"cyanosis\"]=[\"a\",\"bluish\",\"discoloration\",\"of\",\"extremity_ties\"] [\"aero\"]+[\"phagy\"]=[\"eating\",\"of\",\"air\"] [\"aero\"]+[\"phagy\"]=[\"swallowing\",\"of\",\"air\"] [\"cardio\"]+[\"genic\"]=[\"caused\",\"by\",\"a\",\"function\",\"of\",\"the\",\"heart\"] [\"cardio\"]+[\"genic\"]=[\"caused\",\"by\",\"abnormal\",\"function\",\"of\",\"the\",\"heart\"] [\"cardio\"]+[\"megaly\"]=[\"large\",\"size\",\"of\",\"the\",\"heart\"] [\"cardio\"]+[\"pathy\"]=[\"disease\",\"of\",\"the\",\"heart\"] [\"cardio\"]+[\"pathy\"]=[\"disorder\",\"of\",\"the\",\"heart\"] [\"cardio\"]+[\"myo\"]=[\"a\",\"muscle\",\"of\",\"the\",\"heart\"] [\"cardio\"]+[\"pathy\"]=[\"disease\",\"of\",\"the\",\"heart\"] [\"cardio\"]+[\"pathy\"]=[\"disorder\",\"of\",\"the\",\"heart\"] [\"brady\"]+[\"cardia\"]=[\"abnormal\",\"slowness\",\"of\",\"the\",\"heart\"] [\"brady\"]+[\"cardia\"]=[\"abnormal\",\"slowness\",\"of\",\"the\",\"heart\",\"beat\"] [\"brady\"]+[\"kinesia\"]=[\"abnormal\",\"slowness\",\"of\",\"movement\"] [\"brady\"]+[\"pnea\"]=[\"abnormal\",\"slowness\",\"of\",\"breathing\"] [\"brady\"]+[\"kinesia\"]=[\"sluggineshness\",\"of\",\"the\",\"physical\",\"and\",\"mental\",\"response_es\"] [\"cardio\"]+[\"myo\"]+[\"pathy\"]=[\"disease\",\"of\",\"the\",\"muscle\",\"of\",\"the\",\"heart\"] [\"cardio\"]+[\"myo\"]+[\"pathy\"]=[\"disorder\",\"of\",\"the\",\"muscle\",\"of\",\"the\",\"heart\"]","paragraphs":["Table 2: Examples of generated definitions"]},{"title":"4.
