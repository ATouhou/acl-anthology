Introduction","paragraphs":["With the growing quantity of online multilingual information, automatic and semi-automatic techniques for lexical acquisition are more critical now than ever before. We describe an approach to large-scale construction of a semantic lexicon for Chinese verbs. We leverage off of three existing resources—a classification of English verbs called EVCA (English Verbs Classes and Alternations) (Levin, 1993), a Chinese conceptual database called HowNet (Zhendong, 1988c; Zhendong, 1988b; Zhendong, 1988a) (http://www.how-net.com), and a large machine readable Chinese-English dictionary called Optilex.1","Our approach involves extraction of candidate translations from Optilex for each of the Chinese verbs occurring in HowNet. We then create links between Chinese concepts and English classes using thematic-role mappings between HowNet entries and EVCA-based entries. Each Chinese-English link is subsequently associated with a sense from WordNet (Miller and Fellbaum, 1991), thus producing a new Asian companion to the current (Euro)WordNet initiative. The resulting lexicons are used for determining appropriate word senses in applications such as machine translation and cross-language information retrieval.","Several researchers have investigated the problem of assigning class-based senses to verbs (Dang et al., 1998), (Dorr and Jones, 1999), (Dorr and Jones, 1996) (Dorr, 1997), (Jones et al., 1994), (Nomura et al., 1994) (Olsen et al., 1998), (Palmer and Wu, 1995), (Palmer and Rosenzweig, 1996), and (Saint-Dizier, 1996). This work extends the techniques described by (Palmer and Wu, 1995), which used a concept space to produce a hierarchical organiza-tion of Chinese verbs. The extensions include the use of the entire EVCA database rather than a small set of verbs (the break class) and the provision of a thematic-role based filter. We adopt a technique that is similar in flavor to the 1 Optilex is the machine-readable version of the CETA dictio-","nary, licensed from the MRM corporation, Kensington, MD. intersective-class approach of (Dang et al., 1998), with the following extensions: (1) Concept alignment across two different language hierarchies (Chinese and English) rather than one; (2) Mappings between Chinese and English the-matic roles; and (3) Hooks into WordNet senses for both languages.","The next section describes the HowNet conceptual database. Following these, we will describe the approach we used to produce the concept-to-class correspondence. Section 4. presents the result of our automatic acquisition experiment."]},{"title":"2. HowNet Conceptual Database","paragraphs":["HowNet is an on-line conceptual common-sense knowledge base that contains hierarchical information relating concepts to the associated Chinese word. Our focus is on the verb hierarchy, which has the structure shown in Table 1.","The number labels given here are our own; we use these for indicating the level of each concept in the HowNet database. Note that the highest two concepts in the verb hierarchy are “static” (V.1) and “act” (V.2). These correspond, respectively, to verbs such as (become under the “static” node V.1.1.1) and (start under the “act” node V.2.1.1). The levels go much deeper than these, with the lowest ones at 8 levels deep, e.g., V.1.2.1.6.3.3.1.15 itch.","Within each of the HowNet classes is a thematic-role specification. For example, the verb “cure” has the thematic-role specification (agent,patient,content,tool). Consider the sentence The doctor cured the man of pneumonia using antibiotics. The roles in the specification have the following binding, respectively, for this sentence : doctor, man, pneumonia, antibiotics.2","The thematic-role specifications are used for prioritizing candidate HowNet-EVCA associations, as will be described below. 2","Thematic-role specifications and their use in generation of natural-language translations are described further in (Dorr et al., 1998).","V. 1 j","staticj","V. 2 j","actj","V.2.4 j","AlterStatej","V.1.1 j","relationj","V.2.1 j ActGeneralj","V.2.4.1 j","AlterPhysicalj","V.1.1.1 j","isaj","V.2.1.1 j startj","V.2.4.2 j","AlterStateNormalj","V.1.1.2 j","possessionj","V.2.1.2 j doj","V.2.4.3 j","AlterStateGoodj","V.1.1.3 j","comparisonj","V.2.1.3 j DoNotj","V.2.4.4 j","AlterQuantityj","V.1.1.4 j","suitj","V.2.1.4 j Ceasej","V.2.4.5 j","AlterStateBadj","V.1.1.5 j","inclusivej","V.2.1.5 j Waitj","V.2.4.6 j","AlterMentalj","V.1.1.6 j","connectivej","V.2.2 j ActSpecificj","V.2.5 j","AlterAttributej",":","V.1.1.7 j","CauseResultj","V.2.2.1 j AlterGeneralj","V.2.5.1 j","MakeHigherj","V.1.1.8 j","TimeOrSpacej","V.2.2.2 j AlterSpecificj","V.2.5.2 j","MakeLowerj","V.1.1.9 j","arithmeticj","V.2.3 j AlterRelationj","V.2.5.3 j","AlterAppearancej","V.1.2 j","statej","V.2.3.1 j AlterIsaj","V.2.5.4 j","AlterMeasurementj","V.1.2.1 j","StatePhysicalj","V.2.3.2 j AlterPossessionj","V.2.5.5 j","AlterPropertyj","V.1.2.2 j","StateMentalj","V.2.3.3 j AlterComparisonj","V.2.6 j","MakeActj",":","V.2.3.4 j AlterFitnessj","V.2.6.1 j","CauseToDoj","V.2.3.5 j AlterInclusionj","V.2.6.2 j","CauseNotToDoj","V.2.3.6 j AlterConnectionj","V.2.6.3 j","usej","V.2.3.7 j AlterCauseResultj","V.2.3.8 j AlterLocationj","V.2.3.9 j AlterTimePositionj Table 1: HowNet Verb Hierarchy"]},{"title":"3. Approach","paragraphs":["We have associated 478 Chinese HowNet concepts with 485 EVCA classes, demonstrating a clear concept-to-class correspondence in a large majority of the cases.3","The mapping between Chinese HowNet and English EVCA (hence WordNet) involves three steps.","The first step is to produce all possible English Optilex glosses (translations) for all 12342 Chinese verbs in HowNet and associate each Chinese verb with one or more of the 478 HowNet concepts, forming 48,884 verb-to-concept candidates. For example, there is a common Chinese verb (la) that is multiply ambiguous, corresponding to 13 Optilex-based English glosses: slash, cut, chat, pull, drag, transport, move, raise, help, implicate, involve, defecate, and pressgang. This verb is associated with 9 HowNet concepts: j","Transportj",", j","Attractj",", j","Excretej",", j","Forcej",", j","Helpj",", j Includej",", j","Pullj",", j","Recreationj",", and j","Talkj",".","The second step involves associating each verb-to-concept candidate with one or more of the 485 EVCA classes, forming an average of 2 thousand verb-to-class entries per HowNet concept (on the order of 1 million verb-to-class candidates, total). For example, the Chinese verb (la) is associated with 22 EVCA classes: Admire (31.2.b, implicate, involve); Amuse (31.1.b, transport, move, cut; Braid (41.2.2, cut); Breathe (40.1.2, defecate); Build (26.1.a, cut); Carry (11.4.i, carry, pull, drag); Chitchat (37.6.a, chat); Crane (40.3.2, raise); Cut (21.1.a, slash, cut); Cut (21.1.d, cut); Equip (13.4.2, help); Force (12.a.ii, pull); Get (13.5.1.a, pull); Grow (26.2.a.ii, raise); Hurt (40.8.3, pull, cut); Meander (47.7.a, cut); Play (009, pawn); Put (9.4.a, raise); Search (35.2.a, drag); Send (11.1, smuggle, transport, ship, convey); Send Slide (11.2.b,","3","There are actually more than 800 concepts in HowNet that define events. The number was reduced to 478 for the purpose of this preliminary experiment; a more in-depth acquisition process is currently underway to fill out the final 300+ concepts. See (Dorr move); Split (23.2.b, cut, pull).","The final step is to partition each HowNet concept into groups of Chinese-English pairs whose English glosses correspond to EVCA classes. This involves three subtasks:"," Order the candidate EVCA classes so that the highest-ranking classes are those that contain the highest number of English verbs matching the Optilex glosses."," In cases where a tie-breaker is needed, reorder the candidate EVCA classes according to the degree to which the thematic-role specification in HowNet concept matches that of EVCA class."," For each Chinese-English entry associated with the HowNet concept, assign the highest ranking candidate EVCA class.","Consider two HowNet concepts associated with the the Chinese verb (la): j","Helpj","and j","Transportj",". The thematic-role specification associated with j","Helpj is (agent,patient,scope) (as in John helped him with his work). This specification most closely matches that of Equip EVCA Class (where (la) is translated as help) which has the specification _ag_th,mod-poss(with); thus, the j","Helpj","HowNet concept is associated with the Equip EVCA Class, and the mapping between the two is (agent->ag), (patient->th), (scope->mod-poss).","On the other hand, the j","Transportj","HowNet concept is associated with the thematic-role specification (agent, patient, LocationIni, LocationFin, direction) (as in John transported the goods from Boston to New York (westward)). This specification most closely matches that of the Send EVCA Class (where (la) is translated as transport); thus, the j","Transportj Hownet concept is associated with the Send EVCA class, and the mapping between the two is (agent->ag), Number of EVCA Classes per Concept: 0 1 2 3 4 5 Number of HowNet Concepts: 2 371 71 20 10 4 Table 2: Partitioning of HowNet Concepts into EVCA Classes HowNet Concept EVCA Class(es) j Transportj","11.1 Send j Helpj","13.4.2 Equip j Apologizej","32.2.a Long j Namingj","29.3 Dub j Judgej","29.4 Declare j Moistenj","45.4.a Change of State j Excretej","40.1.2 Breathe j TakeVehiclej","51.4.2.a.ii Motion by Vehicle j PlayDownj","33.b Judgment (75%), 31.2.a Admire (25%) j Establishj","29.2.c Characterize (90%), 26.4.a Create (19%) j Decoratej","9.8.b Fill (50%), 26.1.b Build (43%), 9.9.ii Butter (25%) j Buyj","10.5 Steal (08%), 13.5.1.a Get (30%), 13.5.1.b.ii Get (54%), 13.5.2.d Get (46%) j Teachj","29.2.c Characterize (24%), 33.b Judgment (71%), 37.9.a Advise (29%), 37.1.a Transfer","Message (45%), 31.1.a Amuse (19%) Table 3: Examples of HowNet Partitionings with Respect to EVCA (patient->th), (LocationIni->src), (LocationFin->goal).","The end result is that the English glosses associated with","(la) are filtered down to help in the Equip semantic class and transport in the Send semantic class; the corresponding WordNet senses are assigned (for free) from the handtagged EVCA database. These are Senses 1–3 in the case of transport (i.e., move/carry/displace) and Sense 1 in the case of help (i.e., aid/assist):"," transport: Sense 1: transport Sense 2: transport, carry Sense 3: transport, send, ship"," help: Sense 1: help, assist, aid"]},{"title":"4. Results","paragraphs":["Table 2 characterizes the number of EVCA classes required for coverage of 478 HowNet concepts. We consider the approach to be a success for several reasons: (1) Association of a unique EVCA class to a HowNet concept was achieved in 371 cases—77% of the HowNet classes; (2) Most of the other cases partitioned the HowNet entries into 2 EVCA classes; (3) Only 2 cases did not correspond to any EVCA class (i.e., every word associated with the concept belonged to a different EVCA class); (4) There were no partitionings exceeding 5 EVCA classes.","Examples of the HowNet partitionings into EVCA classes are given in Table 3, with a focus on the cases where 1 partition was found. In cases where there is more than 1 partition, percentages are given with respect to the number of Chinese verbs in each HowNet class.4 4 The astute reader will notice the percentages don’t always to-"]},{"title":"5. Summary","paragraphs":["We have presented an approach to aligning two large-scale online resources, HowNet and EVCA. The lexicon resulting from this approach is large-scale, containing 17284 Chinese-English conceptual links. The technique for producing these links involves matching semantic-role specifications in HowNet with those in EVCA. Our results indicate that the correspondence is very high between the 478 Chinese HowNet concepts and the 485 EVCA classes. Because each Chinese-English link is additionally associated with a WordNet sense, we see this resource as the first step toward producing a new Asian language companion to on-going (Euro)WordNet initiatives."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["The University of Maryland authors are supported, in part, by PFF/PECASE Award IRI-9629108, DOD Contract MDA904-96-C-1250, and DARPA/ITO Contract N66001-97-C-8540.
