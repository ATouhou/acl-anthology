Introduction","paragraphs":["We propose a simple procedure to extract some phrases from an aligned bilingual corpus observing differences in the sequence of words between two aligned sentences. For example: given two sentences: “The black cat runs” and its translation to Portuguese: “O gato preto corre” and the alignment: (O = The, black = preto, cat = gato, runs = corre); then it is possible to detect an inversion between the words “black” and “cat” in the Portuguese translation. Based on this inversion we extract the phrase: “black cat” = “gato preto”."]},{"title":"2. Procedure","paragraphs":["The idea is to observe an inversion in the sequence of","words (ex: black cat = gato preto) in two sentences and","extract three pairs of phrases: (P1- , P2+), (P1+, P2-), (P1,","P2): First phrase: P1-: Phrase in Language 1 to the left of the inversion","(P1-) (ex: black). P2+: Phrase in Language 2 to the right of the","inversion. (ex: preto). P2+ is the translation of P1-. Second phrase: P1-: Phrase in Language 1 to the right of the inversion","(P1+) (ex: cat). P2-: Phrase in Language 2 to the left of the inversion.","(ex: gato). P2- is the translation of P1+. Third phrase: We can join P1- and P1+, as well as P2- and P2+ in","the following way: P1 = P1- , J, P1+ P2 = P2-, K, P2+ where: J is a string that appears between P1- and P1+ and that","is not translated to Language 2. Usually it is an empty","string. K is a string that appears between P2- and P2+ and","that is not translated to Language 1. Usually it is an empty","string.","Two aligned sentences can be represented in a graph (Melamed, 1996). For instance, two statements: The black cat drinks the white milk O gato preto bebe o leite branco","were aligned in figure 1. A word is assigned to each position of the horizontal axis and vertical axis.","A point in this graph is generically given by (X, Pos(X)). Language 1 (ex: English) refers to the first argument and Language 2 (ex: Portuguese) to the second.","Pos(X) is defined if there is some translation (word or string) to the word in X. Pos(X) is undefined if there is no translation to the word in X. A point (X,Y) exists when Pos(X) is defined.","Given two points (X,Y) and (A,B) where X < A, they are adjacent if there is no other point (J,K) for X<J<A.","Usually, for two adjacent points (X,Y) and (A,B), if X<A then Y<B.","An inversion occurs when X < A and Y > B.","Now we can redefine P1-, P2+, P1+, P2- in a more precise way. Theses phrases are next to an inversion between adjacent points (X,Y) and (A,B) where X < A.","P1- is the sequence of adjacent words to the left of X with positions: X, X-1, ..., X-i, ... X-n where Pos(X-i) > B or Pos(X-i) is undefined.","P2+ Corresponds to (Pos(X), J1, Pos(X-1), J2, ... Pos(X-n)) rearranged in crescent order. Ji corresponds to words or an empty string between Pos(X-i) and Pos(X-i-1) with no translation.","P1+ is the sequence of adjacent words to the right of A with positions: A, A+1, A+2,...,A+i,...A+n where Pos(A+i) <Y or Pos(A+i) is undefined.","P2- corresponds to (Pos(A), J1, Pos(A+1), J2, Pos(A+2), ... Pos(A+n)) rearranged in crescent order. Ji corresponds to words or an empty string between Pos(A+i) and Pos(A+i+1) with no translation.","In figure 1, we observe two inversions. The first one yields:","P1- = black; P2+ = preto","P1+ = cat; P2- = gato","P1 = black cat","P2 = gato preto We decided to make an experiment with Japanese. In figure 2, we show the alignment between an English","and the Japanese sentence: “kuroi neko ha shiroi miruko","wo nomimasu”, yielding the following aligned phrases: drinks = nomimasu shiroi miruko = white milk drinks the white milk = shiroi muruko wo nomimasu. In figure 3, we repeated the process for Portuguese and","Japanese, yielding the following phrases. gato preto = kuroi neko leite branco = shiroi miruko bebe o leite branco = shiroi miruko wo nomimasu We observe that this simple procedure detects some","phrases in a robust way.","Figure 1.

He numbered each Greek word (each stem with a number) and added the same numbers to the English version (Bible, 1998). For instance, Jhon 1:1 in Greek and English was annotated as:","John 1:1 en <1722> arch <746> hn <2258> (5713) o <3588> logoj <3056> kai <2532> o <3588> logoj <3056> hn <2258> (5713) proj <4314> ton <3588> qeon <2316> kai <2532> qeoj <2316> hn <2258> (5713) o <3588> logoj <3056>","John 1:1 ¶ In <1722> the beginning <746> was <2258> (5713) the Word <3056>, and <2532> the Word <3056> was <2258> (5713) with <4314> God <2316>, and <2532> the Word <3056> was <2258> (5713) God <2316>.","There are many other versions in other languages annotated in the same way. For instance, the version in Portuguese is","João 1:1 ¶ No <1722> princípio <746> era <2258> (5713) o Verbo <3056>, e <2532> o Verbo <3056> estava <2258> (5713) com <4314> Deus <2316>, e <2532> o Verbo <3056> era <2258> (5713) Deus <2316>.","We created a Perl script to extract some phrases from texts given in the Strong's annotation. This script:","1) aligns two texts","2) searches for the inversions in the graph and","displays the aligned phrases.","The alignment is made according to the numbers. Our idea is very simple: to align the first occurrence of a number in Greek to the first occurrence of the same number in English, and the second occurrence in Greek to the second occurrence in English, etc. This simple idea does not always work correctly. An example of an error is given in John 1:3.","Applying our procedure to John 1:1, we got the following phrases: P1-, P2+ : < qeoj :: God > P1+, P2-: < hn o logoj :: the Word was > P1, P2: qeoj hn o logoj :: the Word was God Applying it until John 1:5, we have:","1- John 1:2 outoj <3778> hn <2258> (5713) en <1722> arch <746> proj <4314> ton <3588> qeon <2316>","2- John 1:2 The same <3778> was <2258> (5713) in <1722> the beginning <746> with <4314> God <2316>.

The number 1096 appeared 3 times in Greek and 4 times in English.

Conclusion","paragraphs":["This procedure must be applied in bilingual pre-","aligned corpus. If the bilingual corpus is not aligned, it is","possible to use alignment methods such as (Melamed,","1996), (Melamed, 1997). (Wu, 1995a","), (Wu, 1095b) proposes a method to","extract phrases from bilingual corpus. In (Wu, 1995a","),","words do not have to be aligned. His method uses a very","simple grammar (but very ambiguous) and a very precise","dictionary. Analysing the procedure in (Wu, 1995a","), we","concluded that his method works better when there are","inversions in word sequence. This observation encouraged","us to search for another way of phrase extraction focused","in word sequence inversions. When dealing with multilingual texts, it is possible to","extract more phrases. For instance, in verse John 1:4, the","phrase “In him, was life” can not be extracted when","comparing just Greek and English, but it can be extracted","when observing the Portuguese phrase that was given in a","different order: “A vida estava nele”. Some weak points to our ideas are: 1) There are many phrases that can not be collected","because our approach is based only in order","inversion. For instance: in John 1:2 there was not","any phrase extracted. 2) The quality of the phrase extracted (it is not","numerically measured) is doubtful. For instance:","in John 1:4, “a vida estava” was considered a","phrase but a normal parser would never get the","phrase “a vida estava” from the statement “a vida","estava nele”.","We hope that depending on the application, these weak points are not relevant. We intend to apply these ideas in a Example Based Machine Translation system. Now we are trying to solve the question “how can we foresee an inversion in the translated sentence after collecting many phrases?”","acknowledgement: this research is supported by FAPESP (Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo; www.fapesp.br)."]},{"title":"5.
