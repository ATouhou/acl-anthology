Introduction","paragraphs":["With the increase of demand in information access together with the increase of the volume of information in multimedia (online, offline), the use of indexing and tools for intelligent search becomes crucial. It is now well known that query-answering systems give more precise results when using an abstract and logical graphical representation of the knowledge expressed in the searched text.","Until now, technologies used in reference CD-ROM industry were mostly oriented towards full text search, with the limits linked to the lack of independence between the logical representation of the information and its morphosyntactic representation in the text. A first step towards the thematic indexing of the Hachette-Multimedia Encyclopedia (Hachette, 2000) has been achieved using a tree of 3500 themes. This tree indexes the encyclopaedia via a logical and abstract representation of the information. This work has been one of the most innovative of Hachette Multimedia. Although thematic indexing allows a better abstract representation compared to full text indexing, it is still difficult to encode all relations between units (cf. (Alcouffe, 98) ).","In this paper is in line with previous works on query answering (e.g. CoBrain and Murax (Kupiec, 1993)) and presents the first steps of the joint CIRCE project, which goal is to build an NLP based architecture dedicated to the automatic semantic indexing of the Hachette Encyclopedie. Because the encyclopedia has been written in order to describe founding principles of knowledge on one hand, and the links between those units on the other one we start from the hypothesis that an Encyclopedic corpus is a description of a relevant and prototypical set of semantics links."]},{"title":"2. Encyclopedic corpus","paragraphs":["The Hachette Encyclopedia 2000 contains more than 120 000 articles and 17 000 media. It corresponds to a corpus of more than 23 million words. For the articles, the logical representation is XML (Extensible Mark up Language), a mark-up language whose particularity is to identify the information regardless of its presentation (title, italic...).Using XML makes it possible to create as many tags as one wants, which means to integrate new semantic markers within the very same tags.","Using XML turns the encyclopedic corpus into a structured knowledge data-base."]},{"title":"3. Feasability study","paragraphs":["Having a predicate dictionary is a prerequisite of indexing any text: it is necessary to know which are the relevant relations that will be used to index any text.","In next sections, we present an extraction methodology and illustrate it with the example of one specific semantic link and its arguments. The association of an event and a predicate is the starting point of our work. Process step: (schema) Step one: Preliminary tagging Step two: Contextual study of numbers Step three: Identification of predicates and arguments"]},{"title":"3.1. Preliminary tagging","paragraphs":["We tagged the entire Encyclopedic corpus (23 million words) with the XeLDA software (XelDa, Xerox). This allowed us to underline various kinds of encoded data (step one).

Identification of predicates and arguments","paragraphs":["We then extract a set of semantic links that includes a date argument, and gather those relations together using synonymy classification (about 30 classes have been defined).","To Found = {create, elaborate, erect, build, construct, institute}","It is worth noticing that it is the first study of this kind conducted on a tagged French encyclopedic corpus.","In order to construct the extraction process, the identification with arguments and to test the methodology we chose the semantic relation: “FONDER” (“TO FOUND”). The methodology is based on two main steps:","-first, building syntactic rules for identifying relevant arguments (dates, places)","-second, link these arguments to the predicates through roles (agent). We start with the hypothesis that prepositions provide salient information for the recognition of predicate arguments. In fact, prepositions “in” or “to” often mark temporal information while prepositions “from” and “with” comprise information about the agent .","The search of the object complement is based on the syntactical nature of the predicate that determines the location of the object into the syntactical structure of the sentence and on the use of an elimination process of units recognized during the previous stage.","Each relevant component is identified by its functional nature (PERS,CM,...) within a sentence and by its localization ([x]).

In 92% of the studied cases, the extraction of the arguments of the relation “FONDER” has been correct. Such relation can then be integrated into the CD-ROM of the encyclopaedia to be queried in Natural Language."]},{"title":"3.4. conclusion of the feasibility study","paragraphs":["Moreover, such a net is crucial to NLP algorithms: the temporal anaphora “la chute du mur de Berlin” (“The destruction of Berlin wall”), identified with a unit, would allow to date correctly information in a sentence such as: ”Au lendemain de la chute du mur de Berlin” (“the following day of the Berlin wall destruction”).","The extracted semantic relations with arguments is currently incorporated into the NLP search module of the encyclopedia. Thus when we asked “who instituted the pan musulmane league of India”, the answer will be “Agha Khan founded the pan musulmane league of India” and the user will be presented with this view of information in the text of the relevant article. Encouraged by this first results we decided to go further and defined a the CIRCE project, a joint research project between Hachette-Multimedia and the Xerox research Centre Europe."]},{"title":"4. CIRCE: first experiments","paragraphs":["The main result of CIRCE is a semantically indexed version of the Hachette encyclopedia. In other words, it is interested in automatically building a semantic graph out of the different articles of the encyclopedia.","Once this graph have been built, it is stored and traversed by the query-answering system each time readers of the encyclopedia ask a question. When a matching path is found, readers are returned the part of the encyclopedia which answers their question.","The next section describes the different natural language processing modules that are used by the system as well as how we plan to integrate them."]},{"title":"4.1. Making the Semantic Graph","paragraphs":["The foreseen semantic graph is composed of the words, terms, proper nouns, dates and locations that have been detected in the encyclopedia. They are nodes in the graph which are connected to each other through specific relations that have been inferred from the sentences that are the fabric of these articles. The construction of this graph requires different tools: an entities detector (i.e. proper nouns, locations, titles, dates), a semantic analyzer to enlarge or restrict the semantic notions of each terms, a robust parser to find out which relations connect the different words, deduction semantic rules to define and name semantic relations between entities and a graph manager to store this information. 4.1.1. Detecting the entities","An entity can be a proper noun, a location, a title, a date or an event (Battle of Waterloo). We use ThingFinder together with an already defined list of entities defined by Hachette Multimedia in order to extract all the entities from the encyclopedia. These entities can be such as: • Proper Nouns: Napoléon, Pasquale Paoli, Charles Le","Téméraire, Charles de Gaulle, Le comte de Toulouse • Locations: Les châteaux de la Loire, Paris • Events: La bataille de Tolbiac, La guerre de sept ans • Dates:février 1785, jusqu’en 1914, 3000 à","1500 avant J.C. • Measures: 1163 m., 10 %. We then compare these entities against sentences in the encyclopedia and mark them with special XML tags. As a result we got an entity-tagged version of the encyclopedia which looks as:","Quand <Personne> Charles le Téméraire </Personne>, maître du puissant <Loc> état bourguignon </Loc>, meurt devant <Loc> Nancy </Loc> <date>en 1477</date>, le <Loc> duché de Bourgogne</Loc>, <Loc> la Picardie </Loc> et le <Loc> Boulonnais </Loc> tombent dans l'escarcelle de <Personne>Louis XI </Personne>","When Charles le Téméraire, master of the powerful Burgundy State, dies in front of Nancy in 1477, the domain of Burgundy, Picardie and the Boulonnais falls in the hands of Louis XI. Where the tag <Personne> indicates a person name., <date> a date and <Loc> a location.","The next step consists of syntactically parsing the encyclopedia in order to extract functional dependency relations. The parsing is done thanks to the Xerox robust parser. 4.1.2. Parsing the encyclopedia","The robust parser is specially designed to extract syntactic relations between words in a sentence. This parser (currently developed at XRCE) splits a text in sentences. Each sentence is then processed and relations such as subject, object, complement are extracted for each word1",". The robust parser extracts the following functional dependencies from the previous sentence: SUBJ(tombent,Picardie) SUBJ(tombent,Boulonnais) SUBJ(meurt,Charles) SUBJ(tombent,duché) VPPMOD (tombent,dans,escarcelle) VPPMOD(meurt,devant,Nancy) VPPMOD (meurt,en,1477) NNPP(maître,du,état) NNPP(duché,de,Bourgogne) NNPP(Nancy,en,1477) NNPP(escarcelle,de,Louis) Where:","SUBJ stands for the subject relation between a verb and a noun.","VPPMOD is an indirect complement of a verb. This relation is extracted when a verb is followed by a PP that belongs to the sub-categorization frame of the verb.","NNPP is noun complement relation that links to NPs.","Functional dependency relations that involve an entity serve as input to the writing of semantic deduction rules. 4.1.3. Writing the semantic deduction rules","The next step consists of building semantic links between entities and to semantically type the link.","What we now want to do is to link Charles le Téméraire and Nancy via a semantic link that has the type “location-death).","In order to do this we use the robust parser output to write semantic deduction rules.","For example, if we examine the following syntactic functions: SUBJ(meurt,Charles) VPPMOD(meurt,devant,Nancy) VPPMOD (meurt,en,1477)","We see, that we can connect the verb meurt (dies) with three different objects that are of a specific type. We have recorded in our file that Charles was a","person, that Nancy was a location and 1477 a date.","We can use this information to write the following rules: if (SUBJ(mourir,person) and","VPPMOD(mourir,prep,location)) then LocationDeath(person,location). if (Subj(mourir,person) and","VPPMOD(mourir,prep,date)) then DateDeath(person,location).  1 At the moment the robust parser extracts around 30 functional dependency relations If we apply these two deduction rules to the output of","the Robust Parser, the result is: LocationDeath(Charles,Nancy) DateDeath(Charles,1447)","The robust parser provides a formalism to write these deduction rules. First designed for syntactic purpose we can extend it and use it to write semantic rules.","In order to go one step further into semantics it is now important to semantically disambiguate words using the Xerox semantic disambiguator (Brun, Segond, 2000 & Dini et al. 1998). 4.1.4. Disambiguating words The functional dependencies extracted by the robust parser provide a first layer to store and manage information, but this step is usually not sufficient to answer every query about a specific subject. Very often, the query contains words that are explicitly used in the documents. For example, the documents may described a king as a sovereign, while the query will use the word king to refer to this person. We need tools to connect the words that have similar meanings. The Xerox semantic disambiguator uses a database of semantic disambiguation rules which have been extracted from dictionary content2",". Rules extraction has been performed using the dictionary as a semantically tagged corpora and functional dependency relations obtained with the robust parser. Semantic disambiguation rules are then applied to any new text via an applier which uses both a linguistic strategy and the semantic of dictionary tags (in our case SGML) in order to prioritize rules application3",". Performing word sense disambiguation helps the system in choosing through a list of possible synonyms the most appropriate ones according to the meaning of a given word appearing in a given context. The next section describes how the system uses synonyms list in order to retain in the resulting graphs only the appropriate semantic links. 4.1.5. Using synonyms As words are polysemous it is important to choose between the different possible meanings in order to retain in the final graphs only the appropriate semantic links. Indeed, consider the sentence : Le Roi de France vit le jour en Gascogne. (The King of France was born in Gascogne). In this example, the expression voir le jour is semantically equivalent to the word naquit (naître, to be born). If a query contains the word naître and the sentence in the text uses the expression voir le jour, the system should be able to find a correct match between these expressions.  2 In our case we used the Oxford-Hachette French dictionary (Oxford-Hachette, 1993). 3 For more details about the semantic disambiguation system see (Brun, Segond, 2000). The final graph for the previous sentence is:","<- voir le jour -> France -> King <- naître -> Gascogne","As we can see the disambiguation process restricts this enrichment of the semantic graph only to the synonyms of a specific meaning of a word as revealed by the context.","Indeed in the sentence “L'armée comprenait des Basques et des Bretons” (The armee was composed of Basques and Bretons) the meaning of comprendre is to contain not to understand. The graph will be enriched with words like composer or contenir, but will not contain words like voir or compréhension.","To summarize, the overall CIRCE process is as follows: the robust parser output is reassembled as a semantic graph where concepts are directly mapped over words. Next, the names of the syntactic relations are mapped over conceptual relations as agent, patient etc. Each sentence is analyzed in the same way and the resulting graphs are then merged to build one single graph for each article. Entities previously detected by the ThingFinder serve as bridges in this graph to gather scattered information among the article. For example, if Charles le Téméraire is mentioned several times through different sentences, the name will be used as a pivot to unify the different descriptions given by the text about this entity."]},{"title":"5. Conclusion","paragraphs":["This paper presented the first steps of the automatic semantic indexing of an encyclopedia. We showed that natural language processing tools, such as robust parsing and semantic disambiguation, are now ready to perform such a task in a fine-grained way. Issues that we have not addressed yet concern the building of semantic resources such as general ontologies as well as the treatment of anaphora.","Since we mainly work with an encyclopedia with a focus on proper nouns, locations and dates, the ontologies we are firstly interested in concern specific classes of verbs (such as mourir, naître, écrire, vaincre etc.).","Anaphora is a widely spread phenomenon throughout the encyclopedia. There are divided into different sorts, some of them are common nouns utilized as such (le président des Etats-Unis a dit..., Le directeur de la banque de France a affirmé etc.), others are pronouns or relative reference expressions (dans le même pays... trois ans avant...). They can occur within a sentence or at the paragraph level. A typical example is as below:","En 580, Carthage défend les Phéniciens de Motyé et de Palerme contre les Grecs, dont elle défait les armées à Sélinonte, sur la côte sud-ouest de la Sicile.","Un demi-siècle plus tard, elle s'allie aux Étrusques d'Italie occidentale et expulse de Corse les Phocéens de Marseille.","In 580, Carthage helps the Phenicians of Motyos and Parlerma against the Greeks. Carthage defeats the armies at Sélimonte on the South-West coast of Sicily. Half a century later, it allies with the Etruscans of West Italy and expels from Corsica the Phoceans from Marseilles."]},{"title":"6. References","paragraphs":["Aït-Mokhtar S., J.-P. Chanod, 1997.
