The system identifies relevant terms for classification within involved documents by means of natural language processing techniques. These techniques are based on the isolation and normalization of syntactic unities considered relevant for the classification, especially noun phrases, but also other constituents built around verbs, adverbs, pronouns or adjectives. After a general introduction about the research project, the second Section relates our approach to the problem with other previous and current approaches, the third one describes corpora used for evaluating the system. The linguistic analysis architecture, including pre-processing and two different levels of syntactic analysis, is described in following fourth and fifth Sections, while the last one is dedicated to a comparative analysis of results obtained from the processing of corpora introduced in third Section. Certain future developments of the system are also included in this Section."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["The work described in this exposition partially reports on the DoRo1","research project, which set the main requirements for its concrete development. The Doro project aims at improving traditional results of Information Retrieval applications, specifically Document Routing. Document Routing is the automatic routing of incoming text documents based on content analysis of text by a computer and knowledge of the characteristics of the candidate destinies. The innovative idea in the case of DoRo is to achieve this improvement of results by performing what may be considered, with respect to more traditional approaches, a deep linguistic analysis, non interpretative, of involved texts. This analysis should be based on linguistic resources (formal grammars and lexicons) developed in order to be able to (i) precisely identify keywords and phrases that characterize the input document and are relevant for the classification, (ii) normalize them to avoid sparsity of data caused by linguistic variation.","The role of the University of Santiago de Compostela as one of the members of the consortium constituted for the development of the project consisted of the production of the linguistic resources needed for Spanish, together with a first scientific testing of the whole system. The purpose of this article is the description of the linguistic components of the system as it works for Spanish, this is done by means of the description and analysis of the test 1 The DoRo project (1997-1999) was partly financed within the framework of the 6th Call of the Information Technologies Research and Technology Development (RTD) ESPRIT programme, managed by the European Commission Directorate General III (DGIII) and included in the Fourth Framework Programme (1994-1998) of European Union. performed at USC, which showed a strong dependency of results on the typology of texts involved.","After this introduction, the structure of the article is the following: the second Section compares various approaches to the problem, the third Section describes the two corpora used for testing, the following fourth, fifth and sixth Sections describe various phases of the entire system for the classification. The fourth Section is dedicated to the pre-processing phase, which constitutes the first phase of the processing of documents, pre-processing prepares documents for being processed by parsers described in the fifth Section. Parsing of the documents is described in the fifth Section, it constitutes the second phase of the process of classification, it is performed in two steps and delivers documents as collections of, possibly, nested terms. Classification itself, the assignment of documents to categories, is performed by the LCS2",", Linguistic Classification System, an statistical module which unnests terms delivered by previous phase, assigns frequencies to these terms and compares them with previously stored class profiles of documents. Sixth Section shows results of various tests performed on the corpora described in third Section, it also includes an evaluation of these results."]},{"title":"2. Approaches to the problem","paragraphs":["The problem faced by Information Retrieval and other more specific applications in the field, such as Document Routing, is, in first place, an statistical problem based on the estimate of the weigth of frequencies of terms found in documents to be retrieved. In this article we will not be concerned by the statistical side of the problem, but by the identification of terms used for the calculations: What is to be considered as a term and how terms are to be found.  2 See footnote 14.          ","From this point of view, conventional approaches to the problem rely on the identification of letter sequences —a term is a single word, or, with a slight refinement, a term is a pair of contiguous words (this is known as the SMART system, Buckley et al., 1996)—. These conventional approaches make also use of limited linguistic information. Certain heuristics are used to eliminate frequently occurring words that carry no important information for classification (stop words) and to group the morphological variants of a word (rough stemming).","Since then, several improvements have been proposed, which include more accurate stemming, incorporation of lexicon resources, heuristics on the weighting of proper names, relevance feedback, various purely statistical refinements, etc.","However, these improvements do not change the nature of the basic approach: it remains a keyword-based, enhanced with several useful heuristics which do not qualitatively affect the way terms are identified.","A qualitative change in the way the problem is faced takes place a bit later: the new idea is to replace keywords with more expressive units of texts, identified by means of the use of Natural Language Processing techniques.","A first approach of this type makes a limited use of such techniques. By means of various linguistics heuritics, it basically identifies noun phrases, including in certain cases, non continuous groups of heads and modifiers (Evans et al., 1996).","Finally, a second approach of this type is more ambitious with respect to the exploitation of NLP techniques. Not only noun phrases are considered, but also other predicate-argument binary (not necessarily continuous) structures are taken into account. Most of these approaches (Strzalkowski et al., 1997) rely on a specifically IR-oriented linguistic analysis, which may even previously eliminate stop words, performing after a rough “parsing” for the identification of certain patterns of linguistic relations. With respect to these approaches, ours syntactically analyses the complete sequences contained in documents, without eliminating parts of them. This makes the analysis more independent of its concrete application in Document Routing, leaving open, for instance, the possibility of integrating the grammar in a grammar for full-sentence analysis."]},{"title":"3.

This is a definitive factor and numbers in Table 2 have to be evaluated taking into account that they have more or less weight as terms depending on the total number of tokens (that is, types in one department for domain texts are not only more, but they are also much more relevant than types in one department for newspaper texts, because the number of tokens in the first example almost doubles the second). The percentage of proper  16 In Figure 8 keys for the identification of categories are the following : cul, Culture, dep, Sports, eco, Economy, int, International news, nac, National news.           name types, on the other side, in domain texts is higher (26.9%) than in newspaper texts (only 21.78%). Even though the difference between frequencies is not excessive, we must take into account two features: on the one hand, the lack of balance between number of types and tokens in corpora (as we have described before), and, on the other hand, the way in that we have extracted information about proper names from corpora, manually for the domain texts but automatically for the newspaper corpus (by matching regular expressions that reject ambiguities such as upper case after period).","The improvement of results for newspaper texts, to meet results of domain texts, may be achieved by means of the following strategies, which constitute the obvious future developments of the proposed system:","-General resources: obviously, grammars and lexicons should be extended to cope with not only newspaper texts, but various types of them, with the same efficiency they can ensure for domain texts. Together with them, additional specific domain resources must be developed for concrete applications, ensuring that certain particularities of concrete texts will be correctly interpreted by the system.","-The pre-processing phase may be considerably improved by the implementation of mechanisms for the identification of headings, addresses, signatures and other fixed expressions, as well as of tables, charts and other figures not strictly linguistically motivated. More interaction between segmentation and tokenization, on the one side, and the lexicon, on the other one, would be also desirable.","-Last but not least, integration of morphological and semantic normalization, that is, lemmatization and reduction of synonyms, hypernyms and hyponyms to a conventional representative should cause a strong improvement of results.","For the time being, we expect to have showed an operative methodology for syntactic normalization in the wide area of Information Retrieval, whose results, in absolute terms, may be considerably improved by normalization at morphological and semantic levels. We wanted also to show that certain strategies for Information Retrieval which may constitute a solution for certain kind of texts, need to be enriched to become effective in other contexts, which may considerably influence results."]},{"title":"7.
