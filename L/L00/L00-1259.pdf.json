This paper presents the PARADISE methodology for developing predictive models of spoken dialogue performance, and shows how to evaluate the predictive power and generalizability of such models. To illustrate the methodology, we develop a number of models for predicting system usability (as measured by user satisfaction), based on the application of PARADISE to experimental data from two different spoken dialogue systems. We compare both linear and tree-based models. We then measure the extent to which the models generalize across different systems, different experimental conditions, and different user populations, by testing models trained on a subset of the corpus against a test set of dialogues. The results show that the models generalize well across the two systems, and are thus a first approximation towards a general performance model of system usability."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["The development of methods for evaluating, comparing and predicting system performance is a major open research issue in the area of spoken dialogue systems (SDSs). In 1997, we proposed PARADISE (PARAdigm for DIalogue System Evaluation) as a general integrative framework for evaluating SDSs (Walker et al., 1997). PARADISE addressed three research goals:"," to support the comparison of multiple systems or multiple versions of the same system doing the same do-main tasks."," to provide a method for developing predictive models of the usability of a system as a function of a range of system properties."," to provide a technique for making generalizations across systems about which properties of a system impact usability, i.e. to figure out “what really matters to users”.","In previous work, we conducted several within-system comparisons, based on the application of PARADISE to experimental dialogues(Kamm et al., 1998; Litman et al., 1998; Walker et al., 1998a), and used PARADISE performance models as an objective performance function for learning optimal dialogue strategies via reinforcement learning (Walker et al., 1998b; Walker, 2000). In this paper, we test the predictive power and generalizability of the models using experimental data from ANNIE, a SDS for voice dialing and messaging, and ELVIS, an SDS for accessing email. We first develop a number models for predicting system usability (as measured by user satisfaction). Then we measure the extent to which these models generalize across systems, experimental conditions, and user populations, by testing models trained on a subset of the corpus against a test set of dialogues. The experimental corpus consists of 376 ANNIE and ELVIS dialogues consisting of approximately 30 hours of speech, representing both expert and novice populations.","The structure of the paper is as follows. We first review the PARADISE evaluation framework in section 2.. Then section 3. describes the ANNIE and ELVIS systems and the experimental setup for collecting the corpus of dialogues. Section 4. presents results from developing predictive models of user satisfaction and testing these models on subsets of the corpus. We then discuss the results and suggest areas for future work."]},{"title":"2. PARADISE","paragraphs":["The state of the art in evaluating SDSs, prior to the proposal of the PARADISE framework, was to evaluate the SDS in terms of a battery of both subjective and objective metrics. Some of these metrics focused on task completion or transaction success. Others were based on the performance of the SDS’s component technologies, such as speech recognizer performance (Sparck-Jones and Galliers, 1996; Hirschman et al., 1990; Ralston et al., 1995; Pallett, 1985). Subjective metrics included measures of user satisfaction (Shriberg et al., 1992), or ratings generated by dialogue experts as to how cooperative the system’s utterances were (Bernsen et al., 1996).","The motivation for PARADISE was twofold. First, it is often useful to have a single number to use as a performance function for feedback to the system or for evaluation (Walker, 2000). When a set of metrics are used, several metrics may contradict one another. For example, Danieli and Gerbino compared two train timetable systems (Danieli and Gerbino, 1995), and found that one version of their SDS had a higher transaction success rate and produced fewer inappropriate and repair utterances, but that the other version produced dialogues that were approximately half as long. However, it was unclear whether a higher transaction success or the length of the dialogue was more critical to performance, or what tradeoffs between them might be acceptable.","Second, in order to make generalizations across different systems performing different tasks, it is important to know how multiple factors impact performance and how users’ perceptions of system performance depend on the dialogue strategy and on tradeoffs among other factors like efficiency, usability and accuracy (Sparck-Jones and Galliers, 1996; Hirschman et al., 1993)."]},{"title":"EFFICIENCY MEASURES MEASURES MINIMIZE COSTS QUALITATIVE SUCCESSMAXIMIZE TASK MAXIMIZE USER SATISFACTION","paragraphs":["Figure 1: PARADISE’s structure of objectives for spoken dialogue performance.","The PARADISE framework derives a combined performance metric for a dialogue system as a weighted linear combination of a task-based success measure and dialogue costs. In order to specify what factors should go into this combined performance metric, PARADISE posits a particular model of performance, illustrated in Figure 1. The model proposes that the system’s primary objective is to maximize user satisfaction. Task success and various costs that can be associated with the interaction are both contributors to user satisfaction. Dialogue costs are of two types: dialogue efficiency and quality. Efficiency costs are measures of the system’s efficiency in helping the user complete the task, such as the number of utterances to completion of the dialogue. Dialogue quality costs are intended to capture other aspects of the system that may have strong effects on user’s perception of the system, such as the number of times the user had to repeat an utterance in order to make the system understand the utterance.","Applying PARADISE to dialogue data requires that dialogue corpora be collected via controlled experiments dur-ing which users subjectively rate their satisfaction. In addition, the other components of the model, i.e. task success and interaction costs, must be either automatically logged by the system or be hand-labeled. The PARADISE model posits that a performance function can then be derived by applying multivariate linear regression with user satisfaction as the dependent variable and task success, dialogue quality, and dialogue efficiency measures as independent variables. ","Developing qualitative cost measures that can be measured automatically is an active area of research (Hirschman and Pao, 1993; Walker et al., 2000a).","Modeling user satisfaction as a function of task success and dialogue cost metrics is intended to lead to predictive performance models for SDSs, so that values for user satisfaction could be predicted on the basis of a number of simpler metrics that can be directly measured from the system logs, without the need for extensive experiments with users to assess user satisfaction. In order to make this predictive use of PARADISE a reality, the models that are derived from experiments with one set of systems or user populations should be generalizable to other systems or other user populations. This paper reports results from applying PARADISE to two different systems amd several different user populations, in order to begin to show what generalizations can be made across systems and user populations."]},{"title":"3. Experimental Design 3.1. Experimental Setup","paragraphs":["All of the experimental data used for the application of PARADISE was collected with a similar experimental setup. In each experiment, human subjects carried out a dialogue using one of the dialogue systems, which was implemented using a general-purpose platform for phone-based spoken dialogue systems (Kamm etal. 1997). The ANNIE experiments were designed to evaluate (1) the effect of novice versus expert user populations, and (2) the impact of a short tutorial on novice users. The ELVIS experiments were designed (1) to evaluate the effect of different dialogue strategies for managing initiative and presentation of information; and (2) to conduct experiments applying reinforcement learning to dialogue so that the ELVIS system could learn from experience which dialogue strategies are optimal (Walker et al., 1998b; Walker, 2000). The experiments required users to complete a set of application tasks in conversations with a version of the system. Each set of tasks was also designed to be representative of typical tasks in that domain. We collected task completion, dialogue quality and dialogue efficiency metrics, as well as a user satisfaction measure for each dialogue.","Experiments with ANNIE were designed to be comparable with ELVIS so the users in the ANNIE experiments performed the same tasks as those for ELVIS. Each user had to perform three tasks in sequence in three difference conversations with the system. To examine the effect of a short tutorial, some users also performed an additional task as part of a tutorial interaction before starting the experimental tasks. The example email access task below was used for both ANNIE and ELVIS:"," You are working at home in the morning and plan to go directly to a meeting when you go into work. Kim said she would send you a message telling you where and when the meeting is. Find out the Meeting Time and the Meeting Place.","To complete this task with ANNIE, users accessed their email by either linearly navigating through an email folder, as in Dialogue D1 in Figure 2, or by using referring expressions like message 2 to jump back to messages that had been heard already. ANNIE’s prompts were pre-recorded, and ANNIE would switch from pre-recorded prompts to text-to-speech when reading the message headers and the bodies of the messages.","A sample dialogue illustrating the completion of the same task with the system-initiative version of ELVIS is shown in the sample dialogue in Figure 3. In ELVIS, users could ask to hear a summary of their inbox, or ask to go ahead and read their messages. Once reading messages was initiated, users were prompted for message selection criteria, which allowed them to select messages based on their content by specifying values from the sender or the subject field. Since users could select a message directly rather than needing to linearly navigate through the folder, it was possible for users of ELVIS to complete the task more efficiently. All of ELVIS’s utterances were realized via text-to-speech. A. Annie here. U. Get my messages. A. First message. “This is a message from Michael about Evaluation Technical memo”... (user barges in) U. Next message. A: Message 2. “This is a message from Kim about interviewing Antonio. I’d like to interview him. I could also go along to lunch. Kim.” 2:16 P.M. Monday, March 23rd. What’s next? U: Next message. A: Message 3. “This is a message from Kim about meeting today. The meeting this morning is at 10:00 in 2d 516. See you there, Kim.” (user barges in) U: I’m done here. Figure 2: Sample Dialogue with the ANNIE system E: Hi, ELVIS here. You have 5 new and 0 unread messages in your inbox. Say Read, Summarize, or say Help for more options. U: Summarize. E: In your top level inbox, from Kim, there’s 1 message about “Lunch.” and 1 message about “Meeting To-day”. From Michael, there’s 1 message about “Evaluation group meeting.” From Noah, there’s 1 message about “Call Me Tomorrow” and 1 message about “Interview-ing Antonio.” And from Owen, there’s 1 message about “Agent Personality.” U: Read. E: Select by Sender, Subject or in order of arrival? U: Sender. E: Which Sender? U: Kim. E: In the messages from Kim, there’s 1 message about “In-terviewing Antonio” and 1 message about “Meeting To-day.” The first message is titled, “Interviewing Antonio.” ( user barges in) U: Next message. A: “This is a message from Kim about meeting today. The meeting this morning is at 10:00 in 2d 516. See you there, Kim.” U: I’m done here. Figure 3: Sample Dialogue with ELVIS","The experiments resulted in 108 dialogues with the ANNIE system and 268 dialogues with the ELVIS system, consisting of approximately 30 hours of speech. 3.2. Data Collection","Here, we discuss in detail the metrics that were logged and hand-labeled in experiments with both systems. We have not previously made specific recommendations about what metrics to use, as we consider this an active area of research (Walker et al., 2000a; Polifroni et al., 1998; Hirschman and Pao, 1993; Rudnicky, 1993; Danieli and Gerbino, 1995; Bernsen et al., 1996; Sanderman et al., 1998; Larsen, 1999). However, any metric for task success, dialogue efficiency or dialogue quality previously proposed in the literature can be easily incorporated into the PARADISE framework.","The metrics for these experiments are based on a combination of dialogue quality and efficiency measures, and mainly focus on those measures that could be automatically logged or computed. Three different methods were used to collect the data: (1) All of the dialogues were recorded; (2) The dialogue manager logged the system’s dialogue behavior and a number of other measures discussed below; (3) Users filled out web page forms after each task (task success and user satisfaction measures). Measures are summarized in Figure 4 and described in more detail below."," Dialogue Efficiency Metrics – elapsed time, system turns, user turns"," Dialogue Quality Metrics","– mean recognition score, timeouts, rejections, helps, cancels, bargeins (raw)","– timeout%, rejection%, help%, cancel%, bargein% (normalized)"," Task Success Metrics – task completion as per survey"," User Satisfaction","– the sum of TTS Performance, ASR Performance, Task Ease, Interaction Pace, User Expertise, System Response, Expected Behavior, Comparable Interface, Future Use. Figure 4: Metrics collected for spoken dialogues.","The dialogue efficiency metrics were calculated from the dialogue recordings and the system logs. The length of the recording was used to calculate the elapsed time in seconds (ET) from the beginning to the end of the interaction. Measures for the number of System Turns, and the number of User Turns, were calculated on the basis of the system logging everything it said and everything it heard the user say.","The dialogue quality measures were derived from the recordings, the system logs and hand-labeling. A number of system behaviors that affect the quality of the resulting dialogue were automatically logged. These included the number of timeout prompts (timeouts) played when the user didn’t respond as quickly as expected, the number of recognizer rejections (rejects) where the system’s confidence in its understanding was low and it said something like I’m sorry I didn’t understand you. User behaviors that the system perceived that might affect the dialogue quality were also logged: these included the number of times the system played one of its context specific help messages because it believed that the user had said Help (helps), and the number of times the system reset the context and returned to an earlier state because it believed that the user had said Cancel (cancels). The recordings were used to check whether users barged in on system utterances, and these were labeled on a per-state basis (bargeins).","Another measure of dialogue quality was recognizer performance over the whole dialogue, calculated in terms of concept accuracy. The recording of the user’s utterance was compared with the logged recognition result to calculate a concept accuracy measure for each utterance by hand. Concept accuracy is a measure of semantic understanding by the system, rather than word for word understanding. For example, the utterance Read my messages from Kim contains two concepts, the read function, and the sender:kim selection criterion. If the system understood only that the user said Read, then concept accuracy would be .5. Mean concept accuracy was then calculated over the whole dialogue and used, in conjunction with ASR rejections, to compute a Mean Recognition Score MRS for the dialogue.","Because the goal is to generate models that will generalize across systems and tasks, we also thought it important to introduce metrics that are likely to generalize. All of the efficiency metrics seemed unlikely to generalize since, e.g. the elapsed time to complete of a task depends on how difficult the task is. Other research suggested that the dialogue quality metrics were more likely to generalize (Litman et al., 1999; Walker et al., 1999), but it seemed likely that the raw counts would be task specific. Thus we normalized the dialogue quality metrics by dividing the raw counts by the total number of utterances in the dialogue. This resulted in the timeout%, rejection%, help%, can-cel%, and bargein% metrics.","The web page forms are the basis for calculating Task Success and User Satisfaction measures. Users reported their perceptions as to whether they had completed the task (Comp).","They also had to provide objective evidence that they had in fact completed the task by filling in a form with the information that they had acquired from the system.","In order to calculate User Satisfaction (USAT), users were asked to evaluate the system’s performance with a user satisfaction survey. The survey probed a number of","","Yes,No responses are converted to 1,0.","","This supports an alternative way of calculating Task Success objectively by using the Kappa statistic to compare the information that the users filled in with a key for the task (Walker et al., 1997). However earlier results indicated that user’s perception of task success was a better predictor of overall satisfaction, so here we simply use perceived task success as measured by Comp."," Was the system easy to understand in this conversa-tion?

A sample survey is in Figure 5. The surveys were multiple choice and each survey response was mapped into the range of 1 to 5. Then the values for all the responses were summed, resulting in a User Satisfaction measure for each dialogue ranging from 8 to 40."]},{"title":"4.

An alternative to the more traditional regression analyses, tree modeling uses the predictor variables to split the dataset into its most informative subsets. The goodness-of-fit measure is the proportion reduction in error (PRE) achieved by using the subsets (rather than the overall mean) to predict the dependent variable. When the dependent variable is continuous, as it is here, the goodness of fit measure from the regression tree model is directly comparable to the multiple R","in linear regression. We also constructed regression tree and linear models for subsets of the data corresponding to the two different systems, Annie and Elvis. As shown in Table 2, the explanatory power of the tree models was quite similar to that obtained via linear models, and similar sets of predictor variables were observed. However, there is reason to be cautious with respect to the linear models. In each of the three analyses, 5-10were ”high-leverage” points, which exert excessive influence on the path of the fitted model.","Our next step was to explore the generalizability of the linear models by training a model on 90% of the data, then testing the model on the remaining 10%. Our primary motivation is an interest in using regression models to predict user satisfaction, both within and across systems and tasks. A secondary reason to explore the generalizability of the linear models, in particular, is the concern raised by the high-leverage values.","An overall summary of the results for testing and training predictive models is in Table 3. Each model discussed was trained by performing a stepwise multivariate linear regression on some set of dialogues with user satisfaction as the dependent variable and the other metrics discussed above and shown in Table 1 as the independent variables. For each model we describe the training set, indicate the performance of the trained model on the training set in terms of the amount of variance in user satisfaction in the training set accounted for by the trained model.

The table also describe the test set, and indicate the performance of the trained model on the test set in terms of the amount of variance in user satisfaction in the test set accounted for by the trained model.

Results for each system are given in the first two rows of Table 3, showing the degree to which the model is able to predict user satisfaction in the training set (Column labeled R","Training).","We then tested whether a model trained on a random 90% of the corpus for a particular system could predict user satisfaction in the remaining 10% of the dialogues for that system. The results in the first two rows of Table 3 suggest that both the ELVIS and ANNIE models generalize quite well.","We then examined models trained on the combined data from both systems. The ALL row in Table 3 gives the results for training on a random 90% of the dialogues from the combined corpus and testing on the remaining 10% of the dialogues.

We examined this in two ways.","First, we had a group of expert users who participated in the ANNIE experiments. These users had been using the ANNIE system for over 6 months on a regular basis. All of the other users who participated in the experiments were novice users who were not familiar with the limitations of spoken dialogue systems. Out of the 376 dialogues, 36 were dialogues with expert users and the remaining 340 dialogues were collected with novice users. We trained a model with the dialogues from the novice users and tested it against the dialogues with the experts. The results are shown in Table 3 in the NOVICES row. The results show that models trained on novice users do not easily generalize to an expert user population. The correlation of the predicted values to the actual values is only .19; the novice model only accounts for 4% of the variance in user satisfaction in the expert population.","Second, speech recognition performance varies a great deal from user to user, and thus it is important to assess whether the models trained on ANNIE and ELVIS would generalize to systems whose speech recognition performance overall was much better. In order to examine this question, we selected the 65 out of 376 of the dialogues that had a Mean Recognition Score (MRS) better than .95 (GoodASR dialogues). We used the 311 dialogues where MRS was less than or equal to .95 to train a model for predicting user satisfaction and then tested it on the GoodASR dialogues. The results shown in the MRS",".95 row of Table 3 show that the model only accounts for 23% of the variance in R","in the test data. This is actually higher than one might expect given the large contribution of MRS to user satisfaction in all the models.","Table 4 also shows which factors were found to be significant predictors of user satisfaction in each of the trained models (Factors column), ordered by degree of contribution. Except for the ANNIE system model, recognizer performance (MRS) and task success (COMP) are always the largest contributors to user satisfaction, followed by the percentage of the dialogue turns that were rejections (RE-JECT%), where the system asked the user to repeat or paraphrase what they had just said. The models for the ANNIE experiments reflect the fact that the population of users was deliberately varied in these experiments. ANNIE experts had been using ANNIE for a period of about 6 months and many of them had considerable experience with other spoken dialogue systems. The ANNIE model reported in row 1 shows that the percentage of requests for help was a significant predictor of user satisfaction, reflecting the fact that some users needed help significantly more than others, and these same users typically had much lower satisfaction with the system."]},{"title":"5. Discussion and Future Work","paragraphs":["When we introduced the PARADISE framework for evaluating spoken language dialogue systems (SDSs) we hoped to apply an empirical approach to developing general models of system usability. We proposed that user satisfaction could be used as a measure of system usability, and that it would be possible to develop models for predicting usability by learning which of a range of other metrics were good predictors of user satisfaction.","This paper focused on developing general models for predicting user satisfaction based on experimental data collected with two different SDS. Our initial findings suggest some reasons to be optimisitc, as well as some limitations. We found that: (1) a model developed on 90% of the dialogues for ANNIE accounted for 50% (","1%) of the variance in the training data and 40% (","7%) of the variance in the test data; and (2) a model developed on 90% of the dialogues for ELVIS accounted for 39% (","0.3%) of the variance in the training data and 43% (","3%) of the variance in the test data.

In other words, the performance of the general model trained on 90% of the data is performing just as well on the test set as on the training set.","We also tested the extent to which a model trained on one system (ELVIS) can predict user satisfaction for ANNIE. These tests showed that the ELVIS model could account for 36% of the variance in user satisfaction in ANNIE. The ELVIS model’s predictive power on the ANNIE data is no worse than a model trained on 90% of the ANNIE dialogues. This suggests that there are general factors that predict user satisfaction that are shared by the models; this finding is also supported by the fact that the models share many predictive factors as shown in Table 4.","However, the models generalized less easily across user populations. When we tested models trained on dialogues with novices against dialogues with experts, the novice models did not predict user satisfaction in the expert population. This shows that it is important in future work to carry out longitudinal studies of users as they gain experience with the system, and that general models must be trained on a sample of dialogues including both expert and novice users. Similarly, the models trained on dialogues with users who experienced average recognizer performance did not do a very good job predicting user satisfaction in dialogues with users who experienced excellent recognizer performance, although the correlations were higher than one might have expected.","At a higher level of generalization, we compared the explanatory power of regression trees and linear models. Although we initially thought that tree modeling might improve predictive performance (Brieman et al., 1984), we found that the two types of models yielded quite similar results, both in terms of overall explanatory power and in the predictor variables that emerged. Nonetheless, we suspect that tree models can provide explanatory models in cases where linear regression is inappropriate. For example, in future work, we plan to explore the predictive power of tree models for estimating categorical dependent variables, as well as dependent variables like ”completeness,” which can be coded continuously, but have a strongly skewed distribution.","The results reported contribute to the goal of developing general models of system usability, however there are several ways in which this work should be extended. First, it would be useful to repeat this analysis with a large corpus of cross-system dialogues collected via participation in the DARPA COMMUNICATOR evaluations (Walker et al., 2000a). Second, it is important to extend these techniques to dialogues collected in field studies, as opposed to the controlled experimental environment described here, per-haps by first examining the differences between dialogues collected with predefined scenarios for a particular user to dialogues collected with open tasks, i.e. when the user defines the task, as in (Baggia et al., 1998). We plan to utilize the DARPA COMMUNICATOR evaluation data to examine these differences (Walker et al., 2000a). Finally, it is important to determine whether it is possible to achieve better model fits than those reported here. The model fits range from the ELVIS model that accounts for 39% of the variance in user satisfaction to the ANNIE model that accounts for 50% of the variance in user satisfaction.","There are at least two other possible avenues for improving the models of user satisfaction in addition to the tree models tested here. One possibility is that larger dialogue corpora might help, although when we examined the model fits as a function of training set size the curve appeared to start levelling out at 250 dialogues (Walker et al., 2000b). However it is possible that this data set is some-what homogeneous since it was all collected with the same platform. Second, it may be possible to develop a number of additional metrics for predicting user satisfaction that would generalize across systems (Walker et al., 2000a). The results presented here suggest that users are highly at-tuned to the quality of the interaction rather than efficiency, but it is a challenge to develop metrics that assess the quality of the interaction that can be reliably hand-labelled or automatically measured. In future work, we hope to contribute to the development of metrics that assess the quality of the system’s strategies for presenting information and for providing context-sensitive help."]},{"title":"6.
