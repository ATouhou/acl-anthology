The special case are words with the frequency f(x) = 1.","The possible value of a word rarity depends on its frequency. The rarity of a word is always at least 1 and at most equal to its frequency. In mathematical notation: R(x) ∈ <1, f(x)>.","Thus, low frequency words have always low rarity. Otherwise it is not true, frequent words can have a low rarity. Low rarity of a frequent word implies even distribution of the word within the corpus. If the corpus was representative, the combination of high frequency and low rarity means that the word belongs to a common vocabulary, in other words that it is not rare in the language.","This conclusion is impossible to make on the basis of frequency only, because there can be (and there are) words with high frequency, that are present in a small section of the corpus only. Their distribution is uneven, so they have low reduced frequency, and so their rarity is high.","A high rarity of a word always implies very uneven distribution of the word within the corpus. Such words, even if they are frequent in the corpus, are not common in the language.","For examples from the Czech National Corpus see (Hlavá ová & Rychlý, 1999).
