They represent a tool which makes it possible to have the roles like agent, patient, instrument, location, direction, subevent and others, marked in a lexical database and to associate them with the individual lexical units (or synsets in Czech WordNet).","Here we would like to demonstrate that an interesting link between the particular ILR’s (roles) and some regular word formation processes in Czech can be found and explored in a more detailed way.","","In our research we have dealt with the ILR’s, mentioned above and tried to relate them to the regular suffix derivation processes in Czech. In this way Czech lexical database can be considerably enriched and enlarged and its items can be associated with the respective ILR’s. We also suggest a semiautomatic procedure that can serve as a means allowing us to perform this task, i.e. to modify a Czech lexical database of the WordNet type. This procedure takes advantage of Czech lemmatizer (LEMMA, Ševecek 1995, 1994) and the tool developed for the generation and analysis of derived words (Klímová 1999). These instruments can be used to determinate the paradigmatic and semantic aspects of the affixes, they enable to assign the grammatical categories to the words derived by certain suffixes by the means of a set of derivational patterns and rules."," An example of the above mentioned procedure may","have the following form:","Program LEMMA gives as one of the possible outputs for any Czech word form the information about its POS and the respective grammatical categories, which in the case of the nouns involve the gender. Take, for example, the quite frequent Czech suffix -tel (it may correspond to English -er, as in teach-er).
