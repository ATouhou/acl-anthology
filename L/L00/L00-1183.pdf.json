Specification","paragraphs":["In development environments for the new generation of multimodal systems there is a growing need for processing many simultaneous and heterogeneous sources of lexical knowledge representing acoustic and visual signal information, references to marked up corpora, and symbolic information at many levels of linguistic representation. Advanced techniques for processing data with multiple tiers of annotation, often in high-level markup languages such as XML, are currently under development at a number of centres.","Here we address the complementary problem of user access to complex information of this kind, and develop a hyperlexicon interface for such resources as a first step to-wards creating a standardisable lexicographic resource. We contend that the notion of a document is too complex to be dealt with using purely application oriented decisions, and consequently we base our approach on a theoretical definition of documents as complex signs, using the term ‘sign’ in the same sense in which it is used for smaller linguistic units such as word and sentence in current linguistic theory. Advances in computational techniques have led to a rapprochement between lexicon theory in computational linguistics and large–scale corpus–based computational lexicography, minimising possible theory–application conflicts in the present case. In the present approach, a complete document representation contains","1. a text syntax or document structure DS, specifying (a) the category or context of occurrence of the document and (b) the parts (immediate constituents or daughters) of a document;","2. a text interpretation or interpretation structure IS, specifying on semiotic grounds an interpretation of DS in terms of a Content Structure CS and a Presentation Structure PS (analogous to the semantic and phonetic interpretation pair of mainstream linguistic theories).","These distinctions are not made simply on theoretical grounds, however, but in order to provide a specification for practical lexicographic implementation. In the case of a lexicon,","1. DS specifies the structure of a lexical database, e.g. relational, object–oriented, SGML/XML, or as a lexical knowledge base in DATR or another LKRL (lexicon knowledge representation language), its context (e.g. in relation to a corpus, a grammar, other lexica), its parts, and their contexts.","2. IS specifies","(a) CS in terms of category definitions for the fields of the lexicon (e.g. ‘types of lexical information’),","(b) PS in terms of a superimposed set of relations over document constituents defining ‘surface realisations’ as"," a database view with appropriate front end,"," a hyperlexicon in hypertext format in an on-line help environment, on CD–ROM, on the web, in clipped version for WAP or a PDA,"," a printed book,"," ...","The existing resource on which the present work is built is a relational database, with lexical microstructure at DS level as a database record structure, and fields representing underlying types of lexical information which are relevant for IS","(CS","and PS",") interpretation (Gibbon et al., 1999). We do not address the issue of CS","semantic representations but take these to be implicit in the user’s understanding of his or her domain. The database concerned has been in regular use on the web with a JavaScript/HTML form interface for SQL queries some two years.","The domain selected for this task is spoken language and multimodal system terminology, as required by an in-telligent software agent for potential developers and users. The domain was selected because it also defines an an important resource type for HLT (human language technologies) system development, the technical terminology of the field.","Although we adhere to ISO specifications for terminology, practical experience in HLT and recent developments in lexicology theory show that there are fundamentally untenable constraints involved in current ISO definitions, e.g.","1. The inherently procedural onomasiological view of terminological lexicography, i.e. a direct mapping from concepts to terms, is an obstacle in the way of flexible lexicographic views (and, though adhered to in theory for pure terminologies, generally flaunted in practical termbanks thanks to the quasi–isomorphic relation postulated between concepts and wordforms).","2. The identification of keys with concepts is just as much a confusion of categories in onomasiological dictionaries as the identification of keys with spelling in conventional semasiological dictionaries. Since this ke y","","concept","assumption only holds within one homogeneous discipline and domain, in the multidisciplinary domain of HLT in which concepts evolve dynamically, approaches change, and conceptual structures are hybrid, it fails seriously. We resolve these conflicts by applying the distinction","between underlying DS",", conceptual CS","and surface PS","representations (Gibbon et al., 2000, forthcoming), taking","a declarative stance in regarding DS","as neutral between CS","and PS","."]},{"title":"3.

Specifying","paragraphs":["DS"]},{"title":",","paragraphs":["PS"]},{"title":"and","paragraphs":["PI"]},{"title":"for a hyperlexicon Hyperlexicon","paragraphs":["PS",". A hyperlexicon is a lexicon with hypertextual PS",", in general based on the ‘latent hypertext’ structure formalised in DS",". We take a set–theoretic view of the structure of hypertexts such as hyperlexica and other hyperdocuments, and define hypertexts as relations between text constituents, where the relations represent hyperlinks. We depart from conventional wisdom in regarding conventional linear textual structure simply as a special case of hypertextual structure, and a simple document as the elementary hypertext.","We note that PI","is determined by procedural considerations of lexical lookup, and in addition to the traditional onomasiological–semasiological distinction we also distinguish between two main procedural notions:","1. generator hypertext, i.e. the complete structure designed by the author or constructed by software,","2. receiver hypertext, i.e. the structure actually navigated and retrieved by the reader (or perhaps a hypertext spider agent), possibly fragmentary in relation to the generated hypertext, and with different relations over the parts.","The specification of receiver PI","may well be pretty nearly identical for different PS","— after all, a dictionary user may simply look up an entry, find a synonym, look up the synonym and check out its definition. This path is not too different in paper or electronic books, though the details of PS","may be different.","In principle, the relations which may be specified ad hoc for receiver PI","will be arbitrary members of the powerset of the Cartesian product E","","E",", where E is the set of linked documents in PS",". The members are completely arbitrary, because in principle a user may make arbitrary on the fly jumps. However, more straightforward cases can be taken as the norm, in which receiver PI","is simply a subset of generator PI",". We therefore concentrate on generator PI",".","The traditional onomasiological and semasiological criteria for organising lexica are procedural: an onomasiological lexicon favours concept–based lookup in search of appropriate forms, while a semasiological lexicon favours form–based lookup in search of definitions. The typical semasiological lexicon has a top node, the lexicon, second level nodes for lexical entries, and leaf nodes representing types of lexical information; some lexica have lemma– sublemma structures, thus involving an additional level in the tree structure. However, the tree structure does not capture a fundamental feature of semasological lexica, since each pre–leaf node has, in general, the same number of leaves, in the same order, and information types; this suggests a tabular structure as being more suitable, though a user may not actually find this a convenient format. An onomasiological lexicon, often a thesaurus or synonym lexicon, is more naturally represented as a tree structure; this is a presentation structure which would in theory be suited to conventional termbanks, though these are in practice presented as onomasiologically oriented structures. Tree–structured and tabular DS",". The Document Structure of a lexical document could be organised on the procedurally biassed lines; however, we propose adhering to as strictly declarative a DS","as possible, with procedural criteria being used to define different PS",". But a declarative DS is not simple. We propose a multi–level DS",":","1. An underlying n","–place relation L",", where n","is the number of types of lexical information (the intensional coverage), and each n","–tuple represents a lexical entry. A tabular or matrix structure of this kind does not on its own yield natural representations of multiple mappings between types of lexical information however (the injective onomasiological mapping of polysemy or homonymy etc., including homophony, homography, or the injective semasiological relations of synonymy). In a tabular representation, such relations have to be spelled out, leading to a massive inflation of table structure.","2. A set of more complex relations superimposed on the elements of the relation L",", which can be represented graphically as a tree (e.g. for the hyperonym–hyponym relation), a ring (e.g. for partial synonyms), a fully connected graph (e.g. for co–hyponyms, antonyms), a linear graph (e.g. for predicate–argument type relations).","The basic matrix concept DS","is supplemented in current theoretically well–founded lexica by generalisa-tion (type or default inheritance) hierarchies coupled with attribute–value structures, which permit underspecified (‘sparse’) representations of lexical entry vectors, and reduction of overly inflated tabular structures to more interesting and tractable tree structures. We do not discuss these methods here, however.","Traditional problems with the matrix representation structure are (cf. also (Gibbon et al., 1997a), Chapter 6, and (Gibbon et al., 1999 forthcoming), Chapter 4):","1. polysemy, i.e. closely related meanings associated with one lexical form (does each meaning require a separate entry?);","2. homonymy (homophony, homography), i.e. the more straightforward case in which one lexical form has completely disparate meanings, with variants of multiple spellings for one pronunciation or multiple pronunciations for one spelling;","3. (partial) synonymy, i.e. a lexical form shares at least one meaning with another (the extreme case being abbreviations and their full forms).","The simplest solution, conceptually (though in general intractable) is to spell out all these additional entries and define a superimposed superstructure of more complex relations which may then be used to reduce the tabular structure systematically as a tractable PS",", with the maximal table preserved by associating the rows or records with explicit superimposed relations or ‘rules’. The rules are then available as hyperlinks between relevant types of lexical information, e.g. ‘pointing’ to synonyms, alternative spellings. More abstractly: the ‘rules’ are available as specifications of a type or default hierarchy over attribute–value structures in a higly–structured and theoretically motivated lexicon.","In summary: the basic, procedurally neutral lexicographic DS","is tabular with well–defined superimposed tree structures representing paradigmatic similarity relations within the lexicon. It is this concept of DS","for a flexible hyperlexicon which we suggest as a suitable design. In a sense, this is no surprise, because numerous lexical databases adhere to this structure."]},{"title":"5. Implementation of the","paragraphs":["DS"]},{"title":"graph","paragraphs":["The standard text resource annotation languages SGML (Standard Generalised Markup Language) (ISO 8879:1986, 1986) and its derivative XML (eXtensible Markup Language) are not entirely adequate for lexicon markup as they are primarily tree–based, and therefore not immediately suited to formulating relation tables or non–tree graph structures in the most expressive manner. They are adequate for many purposes, however, as tree structures are very common at all levels of lexicon representation. In particular they can easily be construed as typed attribute– value languages, and therefore isomorphic mappings can conveniently be constructed between SGML/XML markup and the conventional attribute formalisms of current linguistic theory. Practical advantages of SGML/XML are their standardised status, which promotes reusabillity of resources, and the availability of Document Type Definitions and tools such as parsers and structure editors. This technique was adopted for mapping the the EAGLES-Termbank (EAGLET, 1997-99) database relation to additional tree structures, as described above, using the MARTIF DTD (ISO 12200, 1998) with the lexical categories described in (Gibbon et al., 1997b) based on (ISO 12620, 1998). The EAGLES Termbank covers the domain of terminology for spoken language and multimodal systems.","This procedure is illustrated here with the lexicographic term abstract lemma.
