Spelling errors are introduced by either cognitive or typographical mistakes. A robust spelling correction algorithm is needed to cover both cognitive and typographical errors. For the most effective spelling correction system, various strategies are considered in this paper: ranking heuristics, correction algorithms, and correction priority strategies for the best selection. The strategies also take account of error types, syntactic information, word frequency statistics, and character distance. The findings show that it is very hard to generalise the spelling correction strategy for various types of data sets such as typographical, orthographical, and scanning errors."]},{"title":"1. Backgrounds 1.1. Typographical/Orthographical errors","paragraphs":["Humans often make errors during communication, in either spoken or written language, at four levels: lexical, syntactic, semantic, and contextual (Eastman & McLean, 1981; Young, Eastman, & Oakman, 1991). This paper focuses on the correction of spelling errors such as typographical (Damerau, 1964; Pollock and Zamora, 1983), orthographical (Sterling 1983; Mitton, 1987), and scanning errors at the lexical level. The typographical errors involve regular forms of mistyping rather than cognitive errors (e.g. grammatical slips). For example, typographical errors may substitute a letter for a letter adjacent on the keyboard (Damerau, 1964; Pollock and Zamora, 1983). Orthographical errors arise from errors in cognitive processing such as guessing, or phonetic attempts at spelling, or selecting the wrong word - to for too or two, or respectable for respective.","Spelling errors have been studied in various contexts: typographical errors in a coordinated indexing and retrieval system (Damerau, 1964), misrecognition of written text (Galli and Yamada, 1968; Hanson, Riseman, and Fisher, 1976), spelling errors in scientific and scholarly text (Pollock and Zamora, 1983), and orthographical errors in spontaneous writings of children (Sterling, 1983; Mitton, 1987)."]},{"title":"1.2. Approaches of Spelling Correction","paragraphs":["Humans correct ungrammatical sentences by using preferred priority. Shanon (1973) tested the interpretation of spoken ungrammatical sentences in Hebrew, with one to three errors (e.g. violation of agreement rules in number, gender, and tense) in a sentence. Shanon found that humans preferred particular types of correction, for example in number-agreement violation, the verb is replaced rather than the noun, and in tense-agreement within a verb group.","Many researchers have worked on the correction of spelling errors, using various methods: dictionary look-up (Damerau, 1964), a code compression method (Pollock and Zamora, 1984); N-gram methods (Ullmann, 1977; Zamora, Pollock, and Zamora, 1981), a tagger (Atwell and Elliott, 1987), and integrated methods (Kese, Dudda, Heyer, & Kugler, 1992; Vosse, 1992; Carbonell and Hayes, 1983).","Different selection strategies for the best correction among candidate corrections were studied: word frequencies (Galli and Yamada, 1968), character distance (Min & Wilson 1995, 1999), frequency of the alternatives and prevalence of error types (Pollock and Zamora, 1984), and the probability of satisfying error rules (Yannakoudakis and Fawthrop, 1983)."]},{"title":"2. Implementation of Two Spell Correctors","paragraphs":["This section describes the design of two spelling correctors and two schemes for selection of the best correction. The spelling corrector employs a dictionary lookup technique, applied to two selection strategies: a character distance method and a word frequency method."]},{"title":"2.1. Implementation of two ranking heuristics","paragraphs":["The spelling corrector generates re-spelling candidates made by 55N + 26 spelling transformations1","which include the possibility that the first character of a word may be an error. After transforms generated by the spelling corrector are verified by dictionary lookup, a selection strategy is applied to the remaining verified words. The similarity between a misspelt word and a transform (i.e. a correct word) suggested is computed by two methods: word frequency statistics and character distance. The frequency statistics method depends on the fact that frequently used words are more prone to an error  1 Comprising the 26N possible substitutions, the 27(N+1) possible additions, the N possible deletions, and the N-1 possible transpositions, where N = the length of misspelt word, with 26 alphabetic characters plus apostrophe. than words that are rarely used in a context (Peterson, 1980a, 1980b). The character distance method applies phenomena related to generation of typographical errors to the similarity measurement. In the case of frequency measurement, a more frequent word is considered more similar than lessa frequent word. However, in the character distance method, the possibility with the smallest character distance is chosen as the best correction. • Word Frequency Method","For the purpose of selection of the best correction, the LOB-corpus (Atwell and Elliott, 1987) is used for word frequency information. For example, the misspelt word \"whith\" gave rise to the possibilities (\"with\" 7201), (\"which\" 4467), (\"white\" 261), and (\"whit\" 0) - where the numbers are the frequency of the associated words in the corpus. The most frequent word among the possible corrections for \"whith\" (and hence the best correction according to this method) is thus \"with\". Note that \"whit\" is a correct word which does not occur in LOB corpus. If syntactic information is applied to the example above (e.g. (\"whith\" ADJ)), then just one possibility would be suggested (e.g. (\"white\" 261)). Thus using syntactic information increases the efficiency of a spelling corrector. Character Distance Method","This method uses a Pythagorean-type metric to measure the distance between a misspelt word and a possible correction, based on the Qwerty keyboard layout (Min and Wilson, 1995). The Qwerty keyboard is represented by two 2-dimensional arrays: one for the lower case keys and another for the upper case (shift) keys (Figure 1)."]},{"title":"i\\j01234567891011 01234567890- = 1q we r t Yu i o p [ ] 2a s d f g H j k l ; ‘ 3zxcvbNm, . /","paragraphs":["Figure 1. Keyboard array (lower case) for Pythagorean metric.","For example, the character distance between w (3,5) and n (1.1) is ||(3,5)-(1,1)|| = √22+42 ≈ 4.47. Using this character distance, the scores for correction of \"whith\" are (\"whit\" 1.41), (\"with\" 2.24), (\"which\" 2.83), and (\"white\" 3.16). In contrast to the method using word frequencies, \"whit\" is the best correction. Once again, syntactic information could be used for filtering out more invalid spelling corrections, then \"with\" would be the best correction."]},{"title":"2.2.

Experimental results for 20 versions of the spelling corrector","paragraphs":["Table 4 shows tested results based on correction process priority, use of syntactic information, and two ranking heuristics.

When using correction priority (as in spelling correctors with version numbers ≥.3.0) to select the best correction among alternatives, the correction priority based on error frequency, in which the correction process for misspelt words with the most frequent error type is applied first, showed better results than that employing error rarity, by 9% to 10% in table 4.","Another finding was that the different ranking heuristics, for example between ‘common3.0’ and ‘chapter3.0’ , made a small difference (2.1%) in the first hitting rate - see Table 4. Error correction methods using  2 This false alarm rate means that the corrections suggested do not include the manually corrected word because original word had multiple spelling errors. character distance on the qwerty keyboard gave nearly the same results as that using word frequency statistics.","The spelling corrector cannot correct multiple spelling errors and so some words (with multiple errors) were corrected wrongly.

However, the strategy employing correction priority based on general error rarity (in versions ‘common3.1 & 4.1’ and ‘chapter3.1 & 4.1’) shows better results by 1.4% to 2.5% in the first hitting rate than that employing correction priority based on specific error rarity (in versions ‘common3.11 & 4.11’ and ‘chapter3.11 & 4.11’). In addition, the performance of spelling correction employing correction priority based on general error frequency showed better results than that based on specific error frequency (in versions 'common3.0 & 4.0' vs 'common3.01 & 4.01' and 'chapter3.0 & 4.0' vs 'chapter3.01 & 4.01').","Table 5 shows the degree of efficiency using syntactic information for spelling error correction.

Conclusion","paragraphs":["This paper has focused on finding the best spelling correction based on various strategies, including ranking heuristics, various correction algorithms, and priority strategies by using error types, syntactic information, word frequency statistics and character distance. The findings are as follows:","(1) The COMMON-speller algorithm and the CHAPTER-speller algorithm differ by less than 2% in the first hitting rate. In the case of ‘COMMON-speller’, reliable word frequency statistics are needed for better results. However, the ‘CHAPTER-speller’ does not need such data and reflects the structure of a keyboard.","(2) The use of syntactic information for spelling correction increased the of the first hitting rate quite significantly, in fact by 6.1 – 10.7 %.","(3) The application of correction priority based on error type frequency increase the first hitting rate by 1.2 to 5.8% compared with that based on error type rarity.","(4) The employment of correction priority shows better results of the first hitting rate than the versions without the priority strategy by 2.8 - 4.4% (i.e. ‘common2.1’ vs ‘common4.0’ and ‘chapter2.1’ vs ‘chapter4.0’).","A spelling correction algorithm with higher-level information (e.g. syntactic and semantic information) would give better result for spelling correction. However, a generalised error correction algorithm is unlikely to apply with equal success to errors from different sources, as they are likely to have different characteristics."]},{"title":"5.
