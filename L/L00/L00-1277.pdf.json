This paper firstly introduces some basics about HuaYu in brief, as its genre distribution, fundamental considerations in designing it, word segmentation and part-of-speech tagging standards. Then the complete list of tag set used in HuaYu is given, along with typical examples for each tag accordingly. Several pieces of annotated texts in each genre are also included at last for reader’s reference.  1 This work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China and National Basic Research Development Scheme(973) of China."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["Corpus with part-of-speech annotation plays very important role in many natural language processing tasks, for instances, part-of-speech-tagging, compound noun analysis, chunking, and collocation extraction. Annotated corpora of English texts, e.g., LOB corpus, Brown corpus, have been intensively utilized by researchers of the above fields in last decade. On contrary, a widely accepted (or, ‘standard’) large scale annotated Chinese corpus is still not available to date. Chen et al (1996) established a well-known Chinese corpus, SINACA corpus, with more than 3.5 million part-of-speech tagged tokens, however, the texts collected in this corpus are with Taiwan styles, which only represent language phenomena in part area of China. From the mid of 90’s, much effort on constructing annotated Chinese corpora has been continuously paid in mainland of China. There are mainly two separate research teams working on this domain, one is from the Institute of Computational Linguistics of Peking University, another one is ours, from the State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Technology and Systems of Tsinghua University, and the Language Information Processing Institute of Beijing Language and Culture University. The work of these two teams resulted in two annotated corpora: Peking University corpus and HuaYu corpus. HuaYu corpus, built up by the latter team, will be addressed here. Readers who are interested in Peking University corpus please refer to the paper of Hu&Yu, 2000)."]},{"title":"2. Basics of HuaYu 2.1. Distribution of HuaYu","paragraphs":["HuaYu takes full article as basic unit of text collections. Articles in HuaYu are mainly published in 90’s, and are distributed as four genres, i.e., literature, news, academy and practical writing. firstly, we used CSeg&Tag1.0, a word segmentation and part-of-speech tagging integrated system developed by Tsinghua University (Sun et al, 1997), to automatically process the raw corpus. The output of CSeg&Tag1.0 was then proofread by human annotators. The distribution of HuaYu is summarized in table 1 (raw corpus) and table 2 (annotated corpus) respectively.","Genre # of articles # of Chinese characters Ratio Literature 295 880,057 44% News 376 600,490 30% Academy 29 402,623 20% Practical writing 258 119,488 6% Total 958 2,002,658 100% Table: 1 Distribution of the raw corpus","Genre # of punctuation # of words Ratio Literature 148,453 760,337 48% News 86,163 438,095 28% Academy 52,823 278,728 18% Practical writing 28,727 91,929 6% Total 316,116 1,569,089 100% Table 2: Statistics of HuaYu"]},{"title":"2.2. Aim of HuaYu","paragraphs":["The aim of HuaYu is to be as either training set or testing set in particular for Chinese word segmentation and part-of-speech tagging algorithms. For example, all character strings with ambiguous segmentations and their underlying pattern can be easily found from HuaYu, then we’ll able to make use of machine learning techniques to extract relevant knowledge out of the corpus, so as to improve the performance of the existing models. Another example is, we further divide person names in Chinese texts into many subcategories: Chinese full name (including Chinese-style full name of Korean, Vietnamese etc), Chinese given name (including Chinese-style given name of Korean, Vietnamese etc), Chinese surname (including Chinese style surname of Korean, Vietnamese etc), Chinese name of minority nationalities, transliterated foreign name as well as Japanese name (including full name, surname and given name). As indicated by (Sun et al, 1997), person name identification will cause additional segmentation ambiguities, i.e. ambiguities among person name candidates and common words as well as ambiguities among different person name candidates (different from ambiguities among common words). The relevant detailed information in HuaYu will be definitely helpful for working out a robust person name identification module in word segmentation programs.","Another aim of HuaYu is to serve as data preparation for a ongoing research project of Tsinghua university to construct a Chinese tree bank with 10,000 representative sentences (Zhou & Sun, 1999). Obviously, a ‘good’ tree bank should cover variety of grammatical phenomena as much as possible in terms of their distributions in real texts. Because of the critical role of verb in grammatical analysis, plenty of verb sub-categorization information, as shown in table 3, has been incorporated into HuaYu. With this kind of information, it is very easy to write a computer program to randomly select sentences from HuaYu with the expected percentage of sentence patterns (Note, the expected percentage is estimated via HuaYu too).","SubCat. POS Descriptions 1 Vgi Intransitive verb 2 Vgn verb taking an NP as object 3 Vgv verb taking an VP as object 4 Vga verb taking an AP as object 5 Vgs verb taking an embedded sentence","as object 6 Vgd verb taking double objects 7 Vgj Verb taking a pivotal sentence 8...... Table 3: The common verb subcategories"]},{"title":"2.3. Word segmentation standard and part-of-speech tagging standard","paragraphs":["The boundary between word and phrase in Chinese is quite fuzzy. No any linguistic rule proposed by linguists can work in a deterministic and systematic way if it is applied to language of real world. Consequently, the largest obstacle encountered in manually segmenting HuaYu is how to make segmentation consistent over the entire corpus. We set up a word segmentation standard, with emphasis on consistency issue, as guidance of manual segmentation. We also explored quantitative analysis means such as mutual information and difference of t-test values (Sun et al, 1998) supported by a raw corpus of 250 million Chinese characters, as an absolutely necessary supplement of the qualitative linguistic analysis. The word segmentation standard of Chinese texts is too language-specific, thus we do not intend to extend it here.","We also designed a part-of-speech tagging standard for annotating unrestricted Chinese texts. Any type of possible tokens in texts, no matter whether it is of word, morpheme, Chinese character, or non-Chinese-character string, should be able to be assigned a tag without exception, as required by language computation in open environment. The complete list of the tag set involved in the part-of-speech tagging standard, will be given in section 3."]},{"title":"3.

Concluding Remarks ","paragraphs":["Though we have been doing very carefully in the procedure of conducting HuaYu, there still remain some unsolved or not satisfactorily solved issues, for example, annotation consistency. The lessons learned from previous stages of establishing HuaYu will be surely beneficial to the improvement of it. Several ongoing research projects on Chinese computing at Tsinghua University, including one with destination of implementing a high-performance Chinese word segmentation and part-of-speech tagging system for unrestricted texts and another one with destination of setting up a Chinese tree bank composed of 10,000 sentences (as mentioned in section 2.2), are exploiting HuaYu intensively to facilitate the work as retrieving linguistic evidence systematically and then making further analysis (statistical analysis in most cases) based on these rich observations. In the future, we’ll update HuaYu continually, making the annotated corpus more consistent and more satisfactory.
