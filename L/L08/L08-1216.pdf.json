We adapted the French Interlanguage Database FRIDA tagset (Granger, 2003a) to the data. We chose FRIDA in order to follow a known standard and to see whether the changes needed to move from a French to an Arabic tagset would give us a measure of the distance between the two languages with respect to learner difficulty. The current collection of texts, which is constantly growing, contains intermediate and advanced-level student writings. We describe the need for such corpora, the learner data we have collected and the tagset we have developed. We also describe the error frequency distribution of both proficiency levels and the ongoing work."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["We describe a pilot study in which we developed a tagset for error-annotation of Arabic learner data. We compiled a small pilot corpus of Arabic learner written productions and adapted the French Interlanguage Database FRIDA tagset (Granger, 2003a) to the data.

Language Learner Corpora","paragraphs":["Computer Learner Corpus research is grounded in both corpus linguistics and Second Language Acquisition (SLA) studies. It uses the methods and tools of corpus linguistics to gain better insight into authentic learner language at different levels – lexis, grammar, and discourse. (Pravec, 2002; Granger, 2003b)."]},{"title":"2.1 Contrastive Interlanguage Analysis (CIA)","paragraphs":["Learner corpus research has concentrated on Contrastive Interlanguage Analysis (CIA), which involves two types of comparison – 1) native productions (NS) vs. non-native productions (NNS) to highlight the features of nonnativeness in the learner language; 2) two or more varieties of NNS to determine whether non-native features are limited to one group of learners, in which case they are most probably transfer-related phenomena, or whether they are shared by several groups of learners, which would point to a developmental, or interlanguage, issue."]},{"title":"2.2 Computer-Aided Error Analysis","paragraphs":["Computer-aided Error Analysis (CEA) has led to a much more limited number of publications than CIA due to the cost of manual error annotation. Apart from articles describing error tagging systems, there are a few articles covering certain specific error categories including lexical errors (Man-Lai et al., 1994; Källkvist, 1995; Lenko-Szymanska, 2003), tense errors (Granger, 1999; Fitzpatrick and Seegmiller, 2004) and a more recent article (Neff et al., 2007) covering the range of error types in the ICLE corpus from Spain. These analyses offer great promise for identifying the sources of error (L1 interference, features of novice writing, limited vocabulary and language structure, etc.) so the need to annotate for error and to reduce the cost of annotation by automating where possible is great."]},{"title":"3. Error Tagging","paragraphs":["There are two ways to annotate learner data for error. One approach is to reconstruct the correct form (e.g. Fitzpatrick and Seegmiller, 2001). The other approach is to mark different types of errors with special tags (e.g. Granger, 2003a). The former is used for developing instructional materials that can provide (automatic) feedback to learners; the latter is used for SLA research to compare type of error and error frequency among different learners at different levels of language development."]},{"title":"3.1 Applications of Error Tagging","paragraphs":["Error tagging is a highly time- and labor-consuming task. At the same time, a corpus annotated for error provides an invaluable resource for SLA research and practice. For researchers, errors can reveal much about the process by which L2 is acquired and the kinds of strategies the learners use in that process. For language instructors, errors can give hints about the extent to which learners have acquired the language system and what they still need to learn. Finally, for learners themselves, access to the data marked for error provides important feedback for improvement."]},{"title":"3.2 FRIDA (French Interlanguage Database)","paragraphs":["Error tagging in FRIDA implements both reconstruction"]},{"title":"1347 ","paragraphs":["and tagsets. To develop an error tagset for learner Arabic, we adapted the FRIDA tagset designed specifically for French. We chose FRIDA because of the explicit description of the tags in Granger (2003a). FRIDA is a three-level error annotation system, with 9 domains, 36 error categories and 54 word categories. The domain level is the most general: it specifies whether the error concerns typography and spelling, morphology, grammar, lexis, syntax, punctuation, register, or style. Each error domain is subdivided into a variable number of error categories. For example, the lexical domain L groups all lexical errors due to: 1) insufficient knowledge of the conceptual meaning of words; 2) violations of the co-occurrence patterns of words; 3) violations of the grammatical complementation patterns of words. The word categories (adjective, adverb, article, etc.) are subdivided into 54 subcategories, such as ‘simple, comparative, superlative, complex for adjective errors. This particular tier makes it possible to sort errors by grammatical category and to draw up a list of relevant errors for each category."]},{"title":"4. A Pilot Arabic Learner Corpus","paragraphs":["To the best of our knowledge, there are no learner Arabic corpora available for public use. Prior lack of interest in Arabic as a foreign language, the existence of more than thirty dialects and subdialects of the language, and previous technical difficulties with non-roman scripts have meant that resources for the systematic investigation of the acquisition of Arabic by non-native speakers are extremely scarce. Currently, not only is there a lack of learner corpora resources for critical languages, but there is no portable software that can be easily adapted to generate instructional materials automatically based on specified criteria, such as the level of linguistic complexity, different levels of competence, genre, target linguistic structure or discourse style. The current demand for the rapid generation of teaching materials for Arabic makes the creation and internet dissemination of a learner corpus such as this a critical need."]},{"title":"5. Error Annotation of Arabic 5.1 Linguistic Properties of Arabic Relevant to Error Tagging","paragraphs":["The most salient difference between French and Arabic is in the basic word formation process, French being a stem and affix language and Arabic being a triliteral root language. However, like French, Arabic has inflectional affixes that mark gender, person, number, tense, etc. In addition, there are general errors that will be present for all L2s, e.g., errors involving word order, missing or confused elements, and spelling.   "]},{"title":"5.2 The Learner Data","paragraphs":["We have analyzed eight different texts written by learners of Arabic as a Foreign Language. The level of the students was either intermediate (3818 words) or advanced (4741 words). The students are American native speakers of English who studied Arabic in an intensive program and then went to study abroad in Arab countries. Some of the texts were written during their study in the United States and others represent their writing while abroad.  For this pilot study, the tagset was developed by one author and applied by this author and a second author on different data in order to test the coverage of the tags. Once the tagset is complete, we will test for interrater reliability."]},{"title":"5.3 The FRIDA Tagset Applied to Arabic","paragraphs":["We have adopted FRIDA’s first level of tagging with only one addition: diglossia, a common error when students are exposed to the many dialects of Arabic. For the second level, we deleted some tags and added others. The tags that we dropped include upper/lower case, auxiliary and euphony (Arabic does not have these), diacritics, and homonymy, which will only occur in fully voweled texts and do not appear in learner writing. We do not anticipate using these tags on a larger scale set.  In terms of phonology, we added the long/short vowel distinction, emphatic/non-emphatic consonants, nunation (a mark of indefiniteness), hamza (a glottal stop that learners often do not hear), and shadda (consonant doubling). In terms of morphology and syntax, we added infixation, verb pattern confusion, negation (Arabic has several negation particles based on the form of the sentence and verb tense), and definite and indefinite structure (different from (in)definite agreement). The phenomenon of partial, or weak, agreement in Arabic caused us to modify the tagset to include full inflection, partial inflection, and zero inflection, which FRIDA does not need for French. We also made minor modifications to gender agreement, (in)definite agreement, and number agreement. In terms of style, we kept ‘heavy’, though we found no instances of turgid writing in our samples. We added ‘pallid’, for writing that is oversimplified.  We also anticipate that we will need more tags as we deal with texts of beginning and highly advanced learners. Additionally, as we apply FRIDA’s third tagging level, we anticipate that we will need to adjust it to fulfill particular needs the corpus will dictate.

Each annotator covered only 500 words of text per hour due to the need to go up and down the levels of annotation to mark each error. A pull-down menu of tags at each level is planned to speed the annotation. The frequency of error types based on student level already provides useful data for pedagogical purposes.

One notable difference between the intermediate and advanced writers is that the former are still struggling with phonological/orthographical issues (e.g., the glottal stops known as ‘hamza’, which are difficult to hear or involved in spelling rules) while the latter group have left these errors behind and are struggling, not surprisingly, with features of advanced writing like word order and cohesion. Both groups still have difficulties with lexis and the morphologically marked agreement."]},{"title":"6. Ongoing Work","paragraphs":["Our intention is to test this tagset on our most elementary writing students’ work and modify further if necessary. We will continue error tagging on the three levels of beginning, intermediate, and advanced, and make the tagged essays publicly available via the web for further second language acquisition analysis and design of pedagogical tools."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Fitzpatrick, E. and Seegmiller, M.S.
