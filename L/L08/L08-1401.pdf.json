Contextual quality models can thus be constructed, but entering into FE\\t\\bI the knowledge required for this operation is a complex task. An experiment has been set up in order to transfer knowledge from \\t\\b evaluation experts into the FE\\t\\bI guidelines, by polling experts about the evaluation methods they would use in a particular context, then inferring from the results generic relations between characteristics of the context of use and quality characteristics. \\bhe results of this hands-on exercise, carried out as part of a conference tutorial, have served to refine FE\\t\\bI’s ‘generic contextual quality model’ and to obtain feedback on the FE\\t\\bI guidelines in general.

In this paper, we report results from an experiment aimed at transferring knowledge from \\t\\b evaluation experts into the FE\\t\\bI guidelines. After a brief reminder of FE\\t\\bI’s main features (Section 2), we demonstrate their relevance by relating them to two recent examples of contextualized evaluation of \\t\\b systems, for real-world uses (Section 3). \\bhe conditions of the hands-on \\t\\b evaluation exercise are outlined in Section 4, while the method for transforming the experts’ output into FE\\t\\bI knowledge and the results obtained with this approach are described in Section 5.

For example, context C10 is linked to quality Q24 indicated by a non-zero value and the weight of the link is 3, as shown in Figure 1.

Experts can assign weights on the links as mentioned above, including the ‘n/a’ mention if a relation is hypothesized but its precise strength is not apparent to them (many links imported from the initial version of FE\\t\\bI are currently marked with ‘n/a’). \\bhe two interfaces to FE\\t\\bI are tightly related, since it is through the experts’ interface that GCQ\\ts are created, but it is in the evaluators interface that an averaged GCQ\\t combining those created by experts is used.

For many \\t\\b developers, evaluation remains a matter of measuring the “quality” of output text using reference-based metrics such as BLE\\f or human-based metrics such as accuracy/fluency. However, when evaluating software dedicated to real-life commercial applications, context-based evaluation cannot be avoided if optimal choices have to be made for large organizations, as the two following case studies show. GPHIN is a multilingual Internet-based early warning system that gathers preliminary reports with potential public-health significance on a nearly real-time basis (Blench 2007). GPHIN continuously gathers and disseminates multilingual information from newswire and web sites, which requires several \\t\\b sub-systems or ‘engines’, which were carefully selected to ensure the success of the system as a whole. \\bhe requirements for these engines are very strict, given the mode of operation of GPHIN. In consequence, a list of important qualities that determine whether or not to incorporate a new \\t\\b engine into the system was defined, which includes robustness, high interoperability and ease of dictionary update. Robustness is a critical aspect, and no actual engine passed the stress tests, so a special module was developed to fix this issue. \\bhe GPHIN system proved to be very productive in monitoring and efficient in early detection of outbreaks, the most relevant case being the detection of a SARS outbreak almost three months in advance. From an even more systematic perspective close to FE\\t\\bI, Stadler and Peter-Spörndli (2007) present a quality model developed for \\t\\b systems to be used by a translation service provider, which was based on the ISO definition for quality and on the premise that different types of customers have different needs. \\bhe main quality attributes in this model were extracted from user feedback and include translation quality, usability, actual translation directions and supported file formats. \\bhis work shows many similarities to the FE\\t\\bI context-based approach to evaluation; in particular, as the selected quality attributes are present in FE\\t\\bI, this model is fully compatible with FE\\t\\bI provided the same terminology for quality"]},{"title":"934","paragraphs":["characteristics is used.

In addition, it is worth noting that the contexts of use that were defined not only focused on the translation task, but also included other important items such as the user of the \\t\\b system, thus suggesting that FE\\t\\bI offers indeed a richer methodology for evaluation. In the answers obtained from the four expert groups participating in these experiments, several context characteristics were shared by more than one group, independently of the exact translation task chosen by the groups, suggesting that for scenarios similar to the one proposed in Figure 2, the following context characteristics are of significant interest for an evaluation:","domain or field of application (text/document","type – 1.3.1.2 in FE\\t\\bI)","superior proficiency in source language (author –","1.3.2.1.4)","novice proficiency in source language (user –","1.4.1.2.1)","superior / distinguished proficiency in target","language (user – 1.4.1.3.4/5) \\bhe numbers after a context or quality characteristic indicate their position in the FE\\t\\bI framework, available at http://www.issco.unige.ch/femti/. We also expected links (relations between context and quality characteristics) to reach a significant number of terminal nodes in Part II, i.e. the measurable attributes. Indeed, if most of the context characteristics were linked to only one quality characteristic, this would mean that the context has no longer an impact on evaluation and assessing that single quality characteristic would always be enough, which is not the case for real-world systems, as illustrated above. In our experiment, we observed a diversity of answers, due to the different contexts defined in the first place.
