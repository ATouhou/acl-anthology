The key to success of knowledge sharing in the field of agriculture is using and sharing agreed terminologies such as ontological knowledge especially in multiple languages. This paper proposes a workbench with three authoring tools for collaborative multilingual ontological knowledge construction and maintenance, in order to add value and support communities in the field of food and agriculture. The framework consists of the multilingual ontological knowledge construction and maintenance workbench platform, which composes of ontological knowledge management and user management, and three ontological knowledge authoring tools. The authoring tools used are two ontology extraction tools, ATOM and KULEX, and one ontology integration tool.  "]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["Currently, knowledge management systems (Linger H., et al, 2004) have been considered useful for knowledge sharing. In specific domains such as agriculture or nutrition, experts need considerable time to build and share common knowledge, using several ad-hoc resources such as documents, databases1,2","or traditional thesauri3",". Sharing accepted terminologies is the result of collaboration where terms creation comes from computer-to-human interaction and human-to-human interaction via computers.","Recently, the needs of monolingual and multilingual ontologies have been increased because of their possible use into many applications or systems (Reddy, P , et al,2007; Kemp, Z., Tan, L., and Whalley, J., 2007) . These systems may be search engines 4,5",", query & answer systems6",", web applications such as RSS feeders and query expansion web services, etc. General web search services (e.g. Google, Yahoo) also use ontology-based approaches to find and organize content over the Web. Because of knowledge and information explosion over the web, and the increased number of communities using them, a need arises for combining automatic ontology construction and collaborative ontology development (Ahmad, M. N. and Colomb, R. M., 2007). The resulting knowledge base must be accessible over internet to external specific applications.","Ontology construction has been a hot research topic (Liu, C., Chen, W., and Han, Y. 2006; Alani, H. 2006; Casellas, N. et al, 2007) in the past few years.

Basic search returns the concept(s) that contains the query term. Some options are available to provide better results, such as regular expressions (contain, exact match and start with), case sensitive and include description. Advanced search: provides more accurate results by filtering concepts using concept relationships, sub-vocabulary (geographic, scientific term, etc.), term code, and concept status or classification scheme 3.1.3 Relationship Management Function The ontology based data model of this system is kept in OWL format. As OWL format follows triple pattern (subject-predicate-object), users can use the relationship management module to add, edit or delete these predicate that will be used in the system. These predicate can be a relationship between concept-to-concept, concept-to-term, or term-to-term. The relationship hierarchy consists of two types of relationship properties (object property and data type property). The users can also add more related information to the relationship and edit or delete the related information components (see figure 3)."," Figure 3: Workflow of relationship management 3.1.4 Consistency Check Function An important advantage of the Workbench tool is the ability to check whether the loaded ontology contains parts that are inconsistent. This functionality checks the ontology over consistency conditions such as do not has duplicated preferred terms for different concepts, do not has published sub-concepts for deprecated concepts, etc. This function will return inconsistent sections with a proposed solution for that issue. 3.1.5 Validation Function All ontology elements contained in the workbench need to be approved by two types of users: “validators” and “publishers” (ontology expert). The validation function allows these users to accept or reject changes done by all other users before releasing the updates to the public. 3.1.6 Import Function Enables to import external ontologies in OWL format that have the same schema used by the system.

Kawtrakul, M. Suktarachan and A. Imsombut, 2004) developed in 2004 by applying a hybrid approach for especially (semi-)automatic building and maintaining ontology from corpus, thesaurus and dictionary. Concerning to the corpus, a methodology for extracting ontological concepts and taxonomic relations was utilized explicit cue expressions, i.e. lexico-syntactic patterns (e.g. NP such as NP1, NP2,...) (Hearst, M, 1992) and an item list (i.e. bullet list and numbered list). This technique poses certain problems, i.e. ambiguity of cue words, item list identification, and numerous candidate terms. The problems solving methodology is proposed in (A. Imsombut, and A. Kawtrakul, 2007) by using lexicon and co-occurrence features and weighting technique from information gain. Besides, the semantic relations embedded in Thai NPs were inserted, by translating Thai words into English, with a method of selecting the word sense from WordNet and by applying machine learning techniques to learn the semantic relations. In order to extract ontology from a specific dictionary, a task oriented parser is used to build the ontological tree. From the thesaurus resource, the thesaurus’ relationships were refined to ontological relations by using machine learning and some heuristic rules. Finally, all of the ontologies were integrated to the ontological sub-trees by using the technique of term matching and then the ontology is reorganized for consistency. The accuracy of the final result from three sources is 0.86 4.1.2 The semi-automatic Computational Lexicon construction (KULEX) The semi-automatic Computational Lexicon construction (KULEX) ) (D. Noikongka, M. Suktarachan and A. Kawtrakul, 2007) purposes to greatly reduce the labor work and time consuming in acquiring the lexical information. It is originated in concept hierarchy with varieties of necessary word information by integrating word information from multiple Thai language dictionaries such as Klangkam (Nawawan Pantumata , 2004), Royal Institute Dictionary (RID) (Royal Institute, 1988) and Matichon Dictionary (Matichon Public Co.,Ltd., 2004). These dictionaries were respected as very good and reliable sources that are in printed form. Thus the optical characters recognition is applied for converting the image document into the electronic text. The lexicon construction by this process consists of two main steps.

After the process of task-oriented parsing, the system has to acquire word entries and theirs information from Klangkam e.g. concept hierarchy, and then acquires word entries and theirs information from RID e.g. part of speech, word definition. Next, the system will integrate extracted information into the concepts by using word definition based classification. This semi-automatic classification is based on two approaches: using head word matching and using definition of words with the same concept matching. The first approach applied the algorithm (M., Lesk, 1986) for finding similarity of word senses where the surface forms from RID are consistent to the word in Klangkam. The correctness is 91.50%. The second approach has been applied for the rest words which have different head word and the rest senses. This approach uses term weighting (Christopher, D. M., S., Hinrich, 2002) for integrating the rest words and theirs information with the appropriate concept. The correctness is 65% of a top ten rank’s concepts."]},{"title":"4.2 Ontology Integration tool","paragraphs":["As mentioned in section 2 that AOS Workbench is a collaborative work between FAO and Kasetsart University. The workbench is distributed by FAO for the community to develop agricultural ontology in their language(see figure7). However, to construct ontology manually is laborious and time consuming. In order to integrate the existing ontology and ontology created by different communities in their languages, an integration system is necessary.  Figure 7: Shows multi-lingual ontology integration  Thus, Ontology integration is the process of combining two (or more) ontologies into a single one. It is a very important process for building multi-lingual ontology from existing ontology resources and also a challenging task for Ontology Construction System. Before integrating ontologies, it should be carefully checked so that the ontology will be reliable, realistic and useful. The automatic ontology integration system should have high precision. Thus in this paper, the integration tool was developed using two techniques: automatic strings matching and manual mapping process, called as “DRAG & DROP”. The string matching technique is used to find the appropriate concept node of existing ontology tree in AOS workbench and inserting the new term extracted by ATOM. If that new term extracted from ATOM tool cannot be matched with existing AOS’s ontology, the tool will be switch to “Drag & Drop” for manual insertion by experts. The system was developed by using Java and Google Web Toolkits. 4.2.1 Ontology Integration Operation In general, to merge the ontology, two steps ontology integration and ontology reorganization process are used. 4.2.2.1 Ontology Integration In this step, the related word/phrase pairs, collected from different sources will be united: AOS’s ontology and ATOM’s ontology. In order to integrate them, two heuristics are applied: Same label or term matching If the separated ontological trees have the same label nodes, then they are merged. Figure 8a) shows the example of ontology integration by using this technique.  Partially Term’s Head Words Matching If the terms’ head words match partially, then matched terms can be merged.

Figure 9: Operations for ontology integration  Addition: A Child node will be added to the core tree, if the parent node has the same label or partially term’s head word matching to the existing node in the core tree in figure 9a)  Insertion: If the children nodes have the same label as the head word of the parent nodes then the new, more specific term will be inserted between two existing ontological terms in figure 9b) The remaining terms that could not be integrated are left for the expert to be added later on, manually. 4.2.1.2 Ontology Reorganization When all nodes and relationships from the ontologies are added to the core ontology tree completely, the ontology reorganizing operation will be processed respectively. It involves three operations in ontology reorganizing: deleting, pruning and merging. Figure 10 shows the example of the process of these operations.","Figure 10: Operations for ontology reorganization"," Deleting: In any case if there are duplicate relations, the system will delete the relation of the last node in the tree as shown in figure 10a).  Pruning: Node, which does not have its own property and its children is the same set as its parent, such nodes should be deleted and its children should be transferred to under its immediate parent as shown in figure 10b).  Merging: If the two nodes or more than two have the common set of children nodes and these node’s labels are similar then these nodes are merge to the new node and the common set of children will be transferred to the new node. The similarities of node’s label are compared by using edit distance technique. Furthermore, the system will select the label that is the most frequency occurred in the corpus to be concept label or concept representation of the new node in figure 10c). 4.2.2 Ontology Integration System Architecture The work flow of the integration system is shown in the figure 11. In the first step, the concepts tree will be extracted from ATOM as a new entry’s concept in order to match with AOS Workbench’s concept. In case of new entry’s concept already existed in AOS Workbench, it will store in Matched table to show the lists of matched concept between the new entry’s concepts and AOS Workbench’s concepts as shown in figure 11 a). In case of new entry’s concept that does not fits in AOS Workbench, it will be shown in Drag and Drop panel where user can see the concept’s tree of both sources and can Drag and Drop concept from the new entry’s concept tree into AOS Workbench’s concept tree as illustrated in figure 11 b).
