Introduction Valency","paragraphs":["of a lexical unit, in particular a verb, is a set of its obligatory and/or optional arguments potentially or actually realized in an utterance. Valency information is useful in restoring the syntactic structure of an utterance, and has consequences for the study of the meaning. The goal of this paper is to prepare the theoretical (Sections 2 and 3) and methodological (Sections 4 and 5) background for creating the valency lexicon of the most frequent Arabic verbs, exploiting various resources of information. Our approach is inspired by the VALLEX lexicon of Czech verbs (Lopatková et al., 2006, 2008) and its treebank-oriented twin project, the PDT-VALLEX (Haji č et al., 2003, 2006). In our case, we focus on Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and take as reference the Prague Arabic Dependency Treebank (PADT). It provides refined linguistic annotations whose multi-level description scheme discerns func-tional morphology, analytical dependency syntax, and tectogrammatical representation of linguistic meaning. The current, largely extended version of PADT (cf. Hajič et al., 2004; Smrž, 2007) covers over one million words of text."]},{"title":"2. Theory of Valency in FGD","paragraphs":["Before we focus on some issues concerning verbal valency in Arabic and our proposed methodology for creating the valency lexicon, let us briefly outline the theoretical framework we have adopted. The Functional Generative Description (FGD) theory, which has been elaborated since the sixties of the last century (in particular in Sgall et al., 1986; Hajičová and Sgall, 2003), is a multi-stratal dependency-oriented description of language. The valency theory of verbs has been thoroughly researched within the framework of FGD since the seventies (Panevová, 1974, 1975, 1994; Lopatková and Panevová, 2005). The ques-tion of valency is closely associated with the underlying tectogrammatical level of language description represent-ing the meaning of the discourse. According to the valency theory of FGD, valency information of the given verb is defined by the valency frame—the sequence of frame slots—which is filled by a specific number of various valency complements, i.e. a variety of either required or specifically permitted syntactic units dependent Actant Meaning Example ACT Actor Peter read a letter. ADDR Addressee Peter gave Mary a book. PAT Patient I saw him. EFF Effect We made her the secretary. ORIG Origin She made a cake from apples.

For the complete list, cf. (Mikulová et al., 2006). on a verb. Each verb has at least one valency frame. The exact number of valency frames depends on the number of different meanings of the particular verb. For expressing relations between a verb and its complements, FGD uses various functors. These functors are divided into actants (inner participants, arguments) and free (adverbial) modifications (adjuncts). The entire number of actants is five (for examples in English, see Table 1): ACTor – usually the agent (the surface subject) or the bearer of some property/quality; PATient – the goal/target or the object affected by the action with consequences for its morphemic representation (the case in inflectional languages) brought about by verbal government (usually the direct object of transitive verbs); ADDRessee – usually the indirect object on the surface; ORIGin – this participant is probably never obligatory; EFFect – usually the second (inanimate) object, the predicative complement or the adverbial of result. As regards the actants, they have to fulfill two conditions. The first condition is that the set of certain actants is characteristic for a particular verb—in other words, not every actant can depend on every verb. The second is that every actant can occur only once as a complement of the given verb, disregarding coordination or apposition."]},{"title":"2300","paragraphs":["On the contrary, there are different kinds of free modifications denoting various types of adverbial complementation (e.g. time, location, direction, manner, aim, cause, regard, accompaniment). These free modifications can appear more than once with a single verb and theoretically can modify any verb. It means that they are actually not restricted to a certain group of verbs, as is the case with actants. For examples of free modifications, see Section 3. The verbal valency frame in its narrow sense consists of both obligatory and optional inner participants and obligatory free modifications (see Table 3). The criterion of obligatoriness or optionality of verbal complements was introduced in the dialogue test by (Panevová, 1974, 1975) with respect to possibility to intentionally omit a contextually bound obligatory complement on the surface morphemic level of representation through the ellipsis or, for instance, as a general (“dummy”) subject or object, etc.","obligatory optional inner participants (actants) + + free modifications (adjuncts) + − Table 3: Members included in the valency frames. It is to be stated that the approach adopted by the FGD takes into account both syntactic and semantic criteria for assigning functors to verbal complements (contrary to other more semantically-based approaches). Within this approach the concept of “shifting of cognitive roles” was adopted (Panevová, 1974, 1975, 1994). This “shifting” denotes application of primarily syntactic criteria for identifying the first two actants (Actor and Patient). Due to this fact, the first actant of the given verb is always identified as Actor and the second one as Patient regardless of their actual semantics. On the contrary, semantic criteria are applied when assigning functors to other actants as well as to all free (adverbial) modifications of a verb. For the concept of “shifting” see Figure 1. Some examples of “shifting” will be illustrated on Arabic in Section 3. ACT PAT ORIG ADDR EFF Figure 1: Shifting of cognitive roles as a criterion for assigning functors to actants (inner participants) of a verbal frame (Panevová, 1994: 234). The valency frames as appeared in the valency lexicon of Czech verbs VALLEX are enriched with two other sets of complements, namely quasi-valency complements and typical complements (Lopatková and Panevová, 2005; Lopatková, 2003). The former quasi-valency type (consist-ing of newly introduced Obstacle and Difference and of revised previously existing complements Intention and Mediator) is the kind of complement lying somewhere in between the free modifications and actants, while the latter typical type denotes optional free modification usually cooccurring with a particular verb. Those complements will not be taken into consideration in our present study of Arabic and will be the subject of our further research. In this preliminary phase of our research, we adopt the valency frames in their narrow sense, i.e. including obligatory and optional actants and only obligatory free modifications as has been pointed at in Table 3."]},{"title":"3. Valency in Arabic: Preliminary Overview","paragraphs":["In this section, we will adapt some aspects of the above mentioned theoretical approach of FGD for Arabic in order to make our preliminary observations about the valency be-havior of Arabic verbs and their verbonominal derivatives. The only elaborate work on valency in Arabic which has come to our knowledge is (Al-Qahtani, 2004). Contrary to FGD, al-Qahtani has adopted predominantly semantic approach, since he deals with verbal valency in terms of Case Grammar theory. He applies the Matrix Model of (Cook, 1979) to the semantic classification of Arabic verbs (state, action, and process verbs). To each class a specific set of required semantic complements (“deep cases”) is assigned— namely Agent, Experiencer, Benefactive, Object, and Locative. The obligatory Object is omnipresent with every verb (in contrast to Actor in FGD) and can occur more than once in a case frame. Experiencer, Benefactive, and Locative are mutually exclusive. Sometimes, a particular case is not realized on the surface (“covert case role”), i.e. it is either partially covert (“deletable”) or totally covert (“coreferential” or “lexicalized”). Those deletable case roles can be omitted on the surface (optional or elided complements in terms of FGD, see (X) and Table 4), whereas the so-called coreferential and lexicalized case roles are always absent from the surface. The former coreferential roles denote instances where a single noun cumulates two case roles simultaneously (not permitted in FGD, see (Y)), while the latter lexicalized roles include instances where a certain case role (usually Object) is incorporated in the semantics of the verb (see (Z)). No shift of case roles takes place in this approach.

MSA (contrary to Arabic dialects), as the successor of Classical Arabic, has preserved one of its characteristic features—regularly formed passive by changing the vowel pattern of active verb (so-called inflectional, internal or apophonic passive)—which is usually used when the agent of an action is not known or is preferred not to be mentioned. With some rare exceptions, only transitive verbs1 undergo passivisation, no matter if they are transitive directly or indirectly through the preposition. In the passive, the position of the underlying Actor is reduced and the understood surface object (usually PAT or ADDR) of the active verb becomes a subject (Agameya, 2008: 558). However, besides this type of diathetical transformation, another type of passive exists in Arabic, namely “a derivational passive, where a derivational verb form (typically V, VII, or VIII) is used to convey a passive, reflexive or mediopassive sense of the action involved in the verb” (Ryding, 2005: 657). Those cases are then, as a result of derivation through verbal morpho-semantic patterns, autonomous lexicalized passive or passive-related verbs with their own valency frames with more or less probable word-formational relation to some active verb (causative, factitive, etc.) they are derived from, cf. Figure 2. With directly transitive verb, Actor is reduced and the direct object (Patient) becomes a grammatical subject (compare to the active voice in (3)).

Some verbs with reflexive meaning have been already illustrated in examples (2) and (5). Another closely related phenomena to reflexivity, i.e. reciprocity, is expressed in MSA either by derived morpho-semantic form VI (29) (then lexicalized) or by an anaphoric means using the noun ba↪d. ‘part, some’ (Badawi et al., 2004: 391–394).

Valency of verbonominal derivatives Valency—a potential of a particular lexical unit to bind some other syntactic element(s)—is not limited only to verbs but it is the property of all autosemantic words, i.e. including nouns and adjectives. In case of Arabic, studying the verbal valency should be very fruitful with respect to its verbonominal derivatives—a participle (active and passive) and a verbal noun (mas. dar). Not only can these bear similar syntactic function as the verb (e.g. active participle as a predicate), but in many cases they preserve the same or almost the same valency frame as the verb they are derived from. In this respect, we have to emphasize that almost all verbonominal derivatives (except for verbal nouns of form I) are in Arabic derived regularly. A great number of verbonominal derivatives can also be used as substantives and adjectives. In case of many verbal nouns, they are no longer used in their verbal meaning of action and they are capable of forming plural. As regards the participles, many of them have been substantivized and also form plurals or are used as adjectives. Despite the loss of the verbal character of both types of verbonominals, not only do they preserve some of their valency complements (esp. in case of participles), but those complements are usually expressed on the surface level by the same morphemic representation, as it is with the verb (by preposition or with accusative). However, only those cases where the verbonominals preserve their verbal character (action) are in the scope of our interest in this paper. As concerns the verbal noun, it is capable of preserving all slots of the original verbal valency frame when Actor is an-nexed to it in the position of nomen rectum (mud. āf ↩ilay-hi ). It is worth pointing out that those verbal nouns derived from directly transitive verbs can emphasize their verbal character through affecting the accusative case in their object (see (33)) (Badawi et al., 2004: 238). As regards the participle, namely the active participle, in cases where it substitutes for verbal predicate, it behaves the same way as the verb and keeps all the verbal valency slots (see (34)). Actor is realized as a surface subject or is absorbed by the subject of the governing sentence in such frequent cases where the active participle as a verbal at-tribute (h. āl) develops the preceding sentence. As an example of preserving the valency frame (Table 5), we can mention here verb t. ālab ‘to demand’ and its active participle mut. ālib ‘demanding’ and verbal noun mut. ālabah ‘demanding, a demand’.

The key concept in our scenario is that of PDT-VALLEX (Hajič et al., 2003; Hajič and Urešová, 2003). The lexicon is gradually developed by linking its conceivable entries with their instances in the treebank. Conversely, the treebank’s annotations are linked to the lexicon, so that the validity of annotations can be verified, and the mutual consistency of the treebank and the lexicon can be established. Due to Petr Pajas (p.c., 2008), the TrEd2","annotation environment can be extended for the new linking and editing tasks, as the data of the valency lexicon can conveniently be formatted in terms of trees (note the valency frame treelets and the capturing of alternatives in the trees of Figure 2). While a comparable functionality is readily in place for the Czech treebank projects, our own contribution is to design and implement this model thoroughly for Arabic and the PADT data. The new valency lexicon will be interlinked with the morphological lexicon of ElixirFM, which itself is linked with the morphological annotations. ElixirFM3","(Smrž, 2007) is an open-source implementation of inflectional and derivational morphological processes in Arabic allowing, among other things, to automatically compute the conversions between verbs, participles, and verbal nouns required for the study of valency. Entries of the ElixirFM lexicon are encoded using morphophonemic templates (shown in Figure 2). Most of the lexical information is adapted from the Buckwalter lexicon (Buckwalter, 2002). Converting the ElixirFM lexicon into a data structure accessible and editable with TrEd leaves open the possibility to expand the annotation of valency also to general nouns and adjectives (cf. Hajič et al., 2003). The work on the valency lexicon will however first concern the most frequent verbs and verbonominal derivatives, as discussed previously. Using the PADT data for the extraction of Arabic valency information brings significant advantages. In the development version of the treebank (to be published as PADT 2.0 in 2008), over one million tokens are annotated into surface syntactic trees, and more than thirty thousand tokens are equipped with tectogrammatical features. The underlying morphological annotations provide disambiguated lexical and inflectional (functional and structural) morphological abstractions compatible with the ElixirFM system. The contents of the arising valency lexicon will not be limited to evidence from PADT. The Arabic Gigaword (Graff, 2007) supplies even more raw data of the newswire domain, while the CLARA4","corpus offers documents from literature and other types of texts. The printed dictionaries to be consulted include (e.g. Wehr, 1979; Baalbaki, 2000; Hoogland et al., 2003; Zemánek et al., 2006). We believe that the valency frames gathered in VALLEX5 ( Žabokrtský, 2005; Lopatková et al., 2006, 2008) and PDT-VALLEX can serve as a useful source of inspiration for describing valency in other languages as well. Based on our previous experience with exploring and managing large linguistic corpora, the search tools used in the 2 http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/∼","pajas/tred/ 3 http://sf.net/projects/elixir-fm/ 4 http://enlil.ff.cuni.cz/ 5 http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/vallex/2.5/ project will include TrEd, Netgraph, and Xaira. TrEd and Netgraph6","allow structural queries into the trees. Xaira7 searches in linear text, but the underlying data for it can comprise node-related annotations of various kinds, in particular some automatically disambiguated morphological information (cf. Hajič et al., 2005). The complex representation of the valency lexicon based on the principle of links will yet enable miscellaneous options for the reuse, processing, and exporting of the data. One of the possible linearizations of the lexicon is depicted in Figure 2. Other output formats can follow, for instance, the online, printed, or interactive interfaces of VALLEX."]},{"title":"5. Proposed Structure of the Lexicon","paragraphs":["With respect to specific needs of Arabic, a slightly modified","structure of a lexical entry used in VALLEX will be adopted","(Lopatková et al., 2006). Entries will be organized alpha-","betically according to the Arabic three-/four-consonantal","root, as is usual in most lexicographic works.8","The pro-","posed lexical entry will provide the following information:","Word Root an abstract consonantal morpheme that can include more than one lexical entry (lexeme);","Lexeme the most abstract notion represented by the lemma (citation form); one lexeme encompasses all inflectional morphological forms and discerns one or more lexical units corresponding to different meanings;","Morphological Information identification of the derivational class (I–X) and the corresponding verbal noun;","Lexical Unit each lexeme would contain at least one lexical unit, i.e. a particular meaning of the given verb with its syntactic properties described by the valency frame; a potential idiomatic usage of a verb with its restricted collocability will be taken into account—those cases will be treated as separate lexical units;","Valency Frame a sequence of frame slots—each of them is assigned to a different valency complementation of the given verb (lexical unit) bringing the valency information in terms of the FGD functors as well as the surface morphemic representation of such complementation (e.g. 4- (accusative case), -I (indefinite state), the form of a particular bound lexeme, conjunction, or preposition, like li- , ↩an, etc.);","Obligatoriness/Optionality valency frames will consist of both obligatory and optional inner participants (actants) and only of obligatory free modifications;","Diathesis possible passivisation of the given verb by changing the internal vowel pattern, in case it is semantically permitted, should be mentioned and illustrated with an example taken from available corpora;","Additional information examples from the corpus as well as the exact frequency of occurrence and rank of a lexeme in PADT will be provided; syntactic-semantic verb class will be the subject of our future research.9 6 http://quest.ms.mff.cuni.cz/netgraph/ 7 http://sf.net/projects/xaira/ 8 Weak verbs will be treated as triconsonantal with w or y in-","cluded among the root consonants. 9 In this respect, works of (McCarus, 1976) and (Al-Qahtani,","2004) as well as verb classes proposed in VALLEX are of high","inspiration for us."]},{"title":"2305","paragraphs":["|> \"‘ q d\" <| [ FaCaL ‘verb‘ [ \"hold\", \"convene\", \"conclude\" ] ‘imperf‘ FCiL, FaCCaL ‘verb‘ [ \"complicate\" ], TaFaCCaL ‘verb‘ [ \"be complicated\" ], TaFACaL ‘verb‘ [ \"contract\", \"convene\" ], InFaCaL ‘verb‘ [ \"be held\", \"be gathered\", \"be convened\" ], IFtaCaL ‘verb‘ [ \"believe\" ] ] "," ↪aqad I (i)     ↪aqqad II     ta↪aqqad V  ta↪āqad VI  in↪aqad VII "]},{"title":"\\t","paragraphs":["i↪taqad VIII    ↪aqad     ACT PAT 4-ACT ADDR ma↪a PAT 4-ACT ADDR ↪alā PAT ↩amal 4ta↪āqad  ACT ADDR ma↪a PAT ↪alā i↪taqad    ACT PAT ↩anna 4- bi- ↩anna bi-I ↪aqad ya↪qid ↪aqd      ","∼ 526","ACT PAT (4-) to call, to hold (a meeting, a conference, etc.) |act","↪aqadat-i ’l-la ǧnatu ’l-wiz ārı̄yatu ’s-s ūrı̄yatu al-kuwayt ı̄yatu ’ǧtimā↪a-h ā ’d-dawr ı̄ya fı̄ Dimašqa the committee of Syrian and Kuwaiti ministers held its regular meeting in Damascus |pas","wa-lam yu ↪qad ↩ayyu mu↩tamarin s. ih. āfı̄yin muštarakin and no joint press conference was held","ACT ADDR (ma↪a) PAT (4-) to conclude (a contract, a treaty, etc.) |act","al-mut","̄","aqqafu ’llad ̄","ı̄ ya↪qidu s. afqatan ma↪a ’l-h. ukūmati the intelectual that is concluding a bargain with the government |pas","↪uqidat-i ’ttif āqı̄yatu ’l- Ǧazā↩iri ↪āma 1975 bayna ↩Īrāna wa-’l- ↪Irāqi the Algerian agreement between Iran and Iraq was con-cluded in 1975","ACT ADDR (↪alā) PAT (↩amal 4-) to set one’s hope(s) to (idiom) |act","ya↪qidu ’n-n ādı̄ ’l- ↩isbānı̄yu ↩āmālan ↪alā ↩an tusā↪ida ša↪bı̄yatu Bı̄khām al- ǧārifatu fı̄ ’h","̆","tirāqi","’s-s ūqi the Spanish club is setting its hopes to that","Beckham’s great popularity will help to penetrate into","the market |pas","allad","̄","ı̄na yu↪qadu ↪alay-him al- ↩amalu fı̄ ta↪lı̄mi ’s. -s. iġāri wa-’l-kib āri li-lu ġati-n ā ’l-h. ayyati those to whom the hope is set that they will teach both the young and the old our live language II ↪aqqad  ","∼ 9","ACT PAT to complicate |act","d","̄","ālika ↩amrun yu↪aqqidu ’lmuškilata wa-l ā yah. ullu-h ā this is a thing that only complicates the problem and does not solve it V ta↪aqqad ∼ 3","ACT to be/become complicated |act","al-wad. ↪u ta↪aqqada","lāh. iqan bi-m ā h. adat ̄ a li- ↩Almāniyā min taqsı̄min the situation became complicated afterwards as a consequence of the division of Germany VI ta↪āqad","∼ 20","ACT ADDR (ma↪a) PAT (↪alā) to come to an agreement, to make a contract |act","kamā ta↪āqadat [aš- šarikatu] ma↪a ’l-banki ’l- ↩islāmı̄yi bi-Dubay ↪alā ↩idārati funduqi ↩Abū Z. abı̄ ’t-t ābi↪i la-hu it [the company] also came to the agreement with the Islamic Bank in Dubai on managing its Abu Dhabi Hotel VII in↪aqad "]},{"title":"\\t","paragraphs":["∼ 42","ACT to assemble, to meet, to be held, to take place (a meeting, a conference, etc.) |act","wa-f ı̄ tišrı̄- na ’t ̄ -t ̄","ānı̄ 1995, in↪aqada fı̄ Baršilūnah al-mu ↩tamaru ’l-wiz ārı̄yu li-’ š- širākati ’l- ↩ūrūbı̄yati ’l-mutawassit.ı̄- yati in November 1995, the Ministerial Conference of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership was held in Barcelona","VIII i↪taqad  ","∼ 285","ACT PAT (4-, bi- , ↩anna, bi- ↩anna) to believe, to think |act","kamā ↩anna-n ı̄ ↩a↪taqidu ↩anna ’r-ra ǧula ’š- šarqı̄ya lā yuh. ibbu ↩an yakūna murattabu zawǧati-hi ↩a↪lā min murattabi-hi I also think that the man from the Orient does not like when his wife’s salary is higher than his own | fa-’l- ↪Irāqu laysa milkan li-q ūwāti ’t-tah. ā- lufi, wa- ↩in i↪taqada ba↪d. u ’l-muh. āfiz. ı̄na ’l- ǧududi d","̄","ā- lika Iraq is not property of the ally forces even if some neo-conservatives have that opinion |pas","ba↪da našri h ̆ arı̄t.ati ’t.-t.arı̄qi ’llatı̄ yu↪taqadu ↩anna-h ā sa-tak ūnu h. ayawı̄yatan fı̄ h. alli ’l-qad. ı̄yati ’l-filast.ı̄nı̄yati after the publication of the Road Map, which is believed to be vital for the solution of the Palestinian Question Figure 2: Top left: Verb entries of the ElixirFM lexicon nested under the ↪ q d","root.

Conclusion","paragraphs":["In our contribution, we have overviewed the theoretical concept of valency developed in FGD and have adapted its essential part for Modern Standard Arabic. We have illustrated various valency-related phenomena on a number of instances, extracted mainly from the PADT treebank. We have presented the methodology, tools, and resources used for creating the valency lexicon of Arabic verbs, which is intended for applications in computational parsing or language generation, and for use by human researchers. The proposed valency lexicon will be exploited in particular during further tectogrammatical annotations of PADT, and might possibly serve for enriching the expected second edition of the corpus-based Arabic-Czech Dictionary (Zemánek et al., 2006)."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["We would like to thank Petr Zemánek, Markéta Lopatková, Petr Pajas, and Zdeněk Žabokrtský for their valuable comments and inspiring ideas.
