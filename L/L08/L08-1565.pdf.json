I\\ftr\\tducti\\t\\f","paragraphs":["Dur\\tng the past three years, the METIS-II project (Vandegh\\tnste et al., 2006) has explored the feas\\tb\\tl\\tty of translat\\tng us\\tng a monol\\tngual target corpus and a b\\tl\\tngual d\\tct\\tonary only. The b\\tl\\tngual d\\tct\\tonary funct\\tons as a flat translat\\ton model that prov\\tdes a number of translat\\tons for each source word. The stat\\tst\\tcal ngram models, wh\\tch have been bu\\tlt off the target language corpus 1",", are then used to score and val\\tdate the most probable translat\\ton cand\\tdate. Vandegh\\tnste et al. (2007) presents a deta\\tled evaluat\\ton of the outcome of th\\ts project. The METIS strategy, compared to other stat\\tst\\tcal MT systems, \\tmpl\\tes a sh\\tft of emphas\\ts from the translat\\ton model to the target language generat\\ton. In the part\\tcular case of the Span\\tsh-Engl\\tsh METIS system, the sh\\tft \\ts even more pronounced, s\\tnce we do not use any k\\tnd of mapp\\tng rules between source and target language structures (see Sect\\ton 2). Th\\ts strategy favours modular\\tty and language \\tndependence and, thus, should be eas\\tly translatable to new language pa\\trs, requ\\tr\\tng only very bas\\tc l\\tngu\\tst\\tc resources. In the present exper\\tment we put to test the portab\\tl\\tty of the METIS \\tdeas. Rap\\td deployment of a new language pa\\tr has been approached by corpus-based systems \\tn the past. Among the most recent attempts \\tn the SMT commun\\tty, we f\\tnd Abdelal\\t et al. (2006), Engelbrecht & Schultz (2005), Maj\\tth\\ta et al. (2005) and \\bav\\te et al. (2004). P\\tnkham & Smets (2002) descr\\tbe the same th\\tng for a hybr\\td EBMT system. Both data dr\\tven approaches (SMT and EBMT) requ\\tre large parallel corpora. Parallel corpora s\\tmply do not ex\\tst for many language comb\\tnat\\tons, and are scarce even for ‘b\\tgger’ languages. They are an expens\\tve resource that low-dens\\tty languages such as Catalan cannot afford. To overcome th\\ts problem, G\\tspert & Mar\\tño (2006) present a Catalan-Engl\\tsh SMT system, wh\\tch does not use a Catalan-Engl\\tsh parallel corpus. What they actually do \\ts use Span\\tsh as a br\\tdge language. They are able to do \\í \\í \\í 1 The Engl\\tsh corpus \\ts a lemmat\\tzed vers\\ton of the Br\\tt\\tsh Nat\\tonal Corpus tagged us\\tng the C\\bAWS5 tagset. It conta\\tns over 6 m\\tll\\ton sentences. w\\tthout a parallel Catalan-Engl\\tsh corpus, only by us\\tng two other parallel corpora: Catalan-Span\\tsh and Span\\tsh-Engl\\tsh. Along the same l\\tnes, Pytl\\tk & Yarowsky (2006) use French-Engl\\tsh and Ital\\tan-Engl\\tsh b\\ttexts to tra\\tn the\\tr Span\\tsh-Engl\\tsh system. On the other hand, the METIS approach allows us to bu\\tld a translat\\ton system between Catalan and Engl\\tsh w\\tthout resort\\tng to any b\\tl\\tngual corpus at all. In the exper\\tment that we have env\\tsaged, s\\tnce we keep Engl\\tsh as the target, we can opt\\tmally reuse our ex\\tst\\tng Span\\tsh-Engl\\tsh system by s\\tmply plugg\\tng \\tn a Catalan low-level preprocess\\tng system and a Catalan-Engl\\tsh d\\tct\\tonary."]},{"title":"2.
