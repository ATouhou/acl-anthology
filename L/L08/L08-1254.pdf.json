Introduction","paragraphs":["Entities -- people, organizations, locations and the like - - have long been a central focus of natural language processing technology development, since entities convey essential content in human languages. For multilingual systems, accurate translation of named entities and their descriptors is critical. For instance, [Babych 2003] reports that integrating a named entity recognition module into existing machine translation systems would improve MT system performance by 20%. The Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) Program develops extraction technology to support automatic processing of source language data, including classification, filtering, and selection based on the language content of the source data. In 2007 ACE extended its standard suite of evaluation tasks to include a pilot entity translation (ET) task. ET participants take Arabic or Chinese text as input, and output an English language catalog of all entities mentioned in those documents. The task is not limited to named entities, but also includes descriptors (nominal phrases) and pronouns across seven entity types: Persons, Organizations, Locations, GeoPolitical Entities, Facilities, Vehicles and Weapons. System performance is evaluated along a number of parameters, including coverage of the entities recognized as well as the quality of the English language renderings of each entity's mentions [NIST 2007]. Systems are not required to identify where in the Chinese or Arabic source document a given entity mention or temporal expression has been detected; this is in keeping with a desire to gradually move information extraction technology for ACE toward a knowledge base model where evaluation will consist of measuring the state of a  database (knowledge base) after some amount of source text has been processed."]},{"title":"2. Production of the ACE-07 Entity Translation corpus","paragraphs":["Linguistic Data Consortium creates linguistic resources -- annotated corpora, tools and best practices -- to support the ACE Program. For the ET pilot evaluation, LDC created annotated devtest and evaluation corpora in two genres: newswire and weblogs. Source data from each language is translated into the remaining two languages; so for instance, Arabic texts are translated into both Chinese and English. Devtest consists of 22.5Kw of source data per language, while eval consists of 15Kw per language. Prior to translation, the source data is manually segmented into sentence units (SU). Each segmented source document is translated by professional translators following guidelines developed by LDC for the DARPA GALE program [LDC 2006a, 2006b]. SUs are preserved during the translation, resulting in parallel text that is aligned at the segment level. Character offsets for each SU are retained during subsequent annotation and document processing.  After translation, both source and translated documents are annotated by LDC for entities and temporal expressions, following the standard ACE annotation task definitions [LDC2006c, Ferro2005]. Entity annotation includes labeling the extent, head, type, subtype, class (specific/generic) and level (name, nominal or pronoun) for every entity mentioned in the text, and co-referencing multiple mentions of the same entity within each document. Manual co-reference of entities across documents and languages is not performed.

Entity Mention Alignment","paragraphs":["The current paper delves more deeply into the entity mention alignment issue, combining the automatic alignment techniques developed for ACE-07 with manual alignment. The manual alignment task identified 15 Chinese-English and 15 Arabic-English translation documents pairs from the ET evaluation corpus. Starting with the Predicted Entity Alignment Table plus automatic alignment output, we sort entity mentions for each segment by type, subtype and mention level. This output is validated by human annotators to maximize possible matches. Each entity pair is then judged for its alignment status, using eight categories illustrated in the table below. Alignment pairs may be assigned to multiple categories.
