The lexicon is designed for the target application of prosodic phrase break prediction but is also relevant to other machine learning and language engineering tasks. It supplements the existing record structure for wordform entries in CUVPlus with syntactic annotations from rival PoS-tagging schemes, mapped to fields for default closed and open-class word categories and for lexical stress patterns representing the rhythmic structure of wordforms and interpreted as potential new text-based features for automatic phrase break classifiers. The current version of the lexicon comes as a textfile of 104052 separate entries and is intended for distribution with the Natural Language ToolKit; it is therefore accompanied by supporting Python software for manipulating the data so that it can be used for Natural Language Processing (NLP) and corpus-based research in speech synthesis and speech recognition. "]},{"title":"1. ProPOSEL: Derivation and Rationale","paragraphs":["A pronunciation lexicon is an integral part of the front-end NLP module in a generic Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis system and constitutes a natural way of giving such a system both prosodic and syntactic insights into input text. For English, three such resources - originally developed for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and listing words and their phonetic transcriptions - are widely used: CELEX-2 (Baayen et al, 1996); PRONLEX (Kingsbury et al, 1997); and CMU, the Carnegie-Mellon Pronouncing Dictionary (Carnegie-Mellon University, 1998). The latter is used in Edinburgh’s Festival speech synthesis system (Black et al, 1999; Williams, 2008) and is included as one of the datasets in NLTK - the Natural Language ToolKit (Bird et al, 2007a). Similarly, lexicons or machine-readable dictionaries have been developed for TTS engines in other languages: for the German TTS system MARY (Schroder and Trouvain, 2003); for French (cf. Auberge, 1993; Thomas, 2003); for Norwegian (cf. Stensby et al, 1993; Heggtveit and Natvig, 2001). Recently, Nokia have used an extensive lexicon of 92,901 words and 68 PoS for Mandarin TTS (Tian et al, 2005); and large lexica with phonetic, prosodic and morpho-syntactic content have been generated for 13 languages, including US-English, as part of the LC-Star project (Hartikainen et al, 2003). The starting point for our new prosody and PoS lexicon is CUVPlus (Pedler, 2002). This is a computer-usable dictionary of wordforms, derived from CUV2 (Mitton, 1992) and the Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary of Current English (Hornby, 1974), which identifies wordclass for each entry via C5 PoS tags, the syntactic annotation scheme used in the BNC or British National Corpus (Burnard, 2000). LC-Star and associated publications (cf. Hartinkainen et al, 2003; Vriend et al, 2003; Conejero et al, 2003) highlight a shortage of language resources that meet the needs of ASR, TTS and speech-to-speech translation applications which depend on wide coverage lexica with detailed morpho-syntactic information. The incorporation of C5 PoS-tags in CUVPlus provides this kind of detail and distinguishes this lexicon from other paper-based and electronic English dictionaries, including CELEX, PRONLEX and CMU; it also facilitates linkage with machine-readable corpora like the BNC. However, CUVPlus entries compact PoS variants for a given wordform into one field; ProPOSEL introduces one-to-one mappings of wordform to wordclass to facilitate their use as compound keys when the lexicon is transformed into a Python dictionary or associative array. Phonological data in ProPOSEL has been generated from CELEX-2 and CMU. An analysis of prosodic and syntactic information in all three sources - CUVPlus, CELEX-2 and CMU - plus a full account of lexicon build is planned for a subsequent paper. Our lexicon was originally created to assemble information relevant to prosody in one language resource customised for language engineering tasks which involve the prosodic-syntactic chunking of text; and we want to make this resource freely available to other researchers."]},{"title":"2. Fields in the Prosody-PoS English Lexicon","paragraphs":["The prototype prosody lexicon comes as a textfile of 104052 separate entries, each comprising 14 pipe-separated fields arranged as follows: (1) wordform; (2) C5 tag; (3) capitalisation flag; (4) SAM-PA phonetic transcription; (5) CUV2 tag and frequency rating; (6) C5 tag and BNC frequency rating; (7) syllable count; (8) lexical stress pattern; (9) Penn Treebank tag; (10) default content or function word tag; (11) LOB tag; (12) C7 tag; (13) IPA syllabified phonetic transcription; (14) stressed and unstressed values mapped to syllable transcriptions.

For some homographs, this lexical stress pattern can fluctuate depending on part-of-speech category and meaning. The wordform present is a case in point, as demonstrated by fields 1, 2, 4, 7, 8 and 10 for all its entries in ProPOSEL: present | AJ0 | ’preznt | 2 | 10 | C | present | NN1 | ’preznt | 2 | 10 | C | present | VVI | prI’zent | 2 | 01 | C | present | VVB | prI’zent | 2 | 01 | C | Table 2: Rhythmic structure for the homograph present is inverted when it functions as a verb"]},{"title":"3. Prosodic Phrase Break Prediction","paragraphs":["As previously stated, the purpose of this work is to integrate information from different dictionaries into one lexicon, customised for language engineering tasks which involve the prosodic-syntactic chunking of text. One such task is automated phrase break prediction: the classification of junctures (whitespaces) between words in the input text as either breaks (the minority class) or non-breaks (Brierley and Atwell, 2007a,b,c). The machine learner is trained on the annotated speech corpus, processed as a list of tokenised PoS tags including punctuation and boundary tags. The latter are represented by pipe symbols: /|/ for minor tone unit boundary; /||/ for pause (Roach, 2000). Phrase break classifiers have been trained on additional text-based features besides PoS tags. The CFP status of a token - is it a content word (e.g. nouns or adjectives) or function word (e.g. prepositions or articles) or punctuation mark? - has proved to be a very effective attribute in both deterministic and probabilistic models (Liberman and Church, 1992; Busser et al, 2001) and therefore, a default content-word/function-word tag is assigned to each entry in the prosody-PoS lexicon in field (10). It is anticipated that further research will suggest modifications to this default status when the CFP attribute interacts with other text-based features. Syllable counts - field (7) in our lexicon - have already been used in phrase break models for English (Atterer and Klein, 2002). This rather assumes uniformity in terms of duration of syllables whereas we know that in connected speech, an indefinite number of unstressed syllables are packed into the gap between one stress pulse (Mortimer, 1985) and another, English being a stress-timed language. A lexical stress pattern for each entry has therefore been included in ProPOSEL - fields (8) and (14) - because of its potential as a classificatory feature in the machine learning task of phrase break prediction. This intimation is further supported by the presence of rhythmic annotation tiers in the Aix-MARSEC corpus project (Auran et al, 2004), with its focus on speech synthesis applications and the theoretical modelling (acoustic, phonetic and phonological) of intonation and speech prosody."]},{"title":"4. Manipulating Data in the Lexicon: Python Dictionaries","paragraphs":["The Python programming language has a dictionary mapping object with entries in the form of (key, value) pairs. Each key must be unique and immutable (e.g. a string or tuple), while the values can be any type (e.g. a list). This syntax can be exploited by transforming the prosody lexicon into a Python dictionary, where the lookup keys are (wordform, C5 tag) tuples and the corresponding values are lists of tokens representing selected information from the remaining fields for a given entry. Thus, using a sample of 4 entries to represent our lexicon and version 0.8 of NLTK, we can use the code in Listing 1 below to transform the lexicon into Python dictionary format.   from nltk.book import * # import statement for NLTK version 0.9 would be: import nltk, re, pprint lexicon = \"\"\" cascaded|VVD|0|k&’skeIdId|Ic%,Id%|VVD:1|3|010|VBD|C|VVD|VBD cascaded|VVN|0|k&’skeIdId|Ic%,Id%|VVN:0|3|010|VBN|C|VVN,VVNK|VBN cascading|VVG|0|k&’skeIdIN|Ib%|VVG:1|3|010|VBG|C|VVG,VVGK|VBG cascading|AJ0|0|k&’skeIdIN|Ib%|AJ0:0|3|010|JJ|C|JJ,JK|JJ,JJB,JNP \"\"\" lexicon = [line.split(’|’) for line in list(tokenize.line(lexicon))] lexKeys = [(index[0], index[1]) for index in lexicon] lexValues = [[index[6], index[7], index[9]] for index in lexicon] proPOSEL = dict(zip(lexKeys, lexValues)) Listing 1: Code snippet using Python list comprehensions and built-ins to transform the prosody-PoS English Lexicon into an associative array"]},{"title":"2850","paragraphs":["The Python dictionary method for displaying a list of (key, value) pairs returns an as yet unsorted dictionary; nevertheless, listing 2 below demonstrates how multiple values representing a series of linguistic observations on syllable count, lexical stress pattern and content/function word status have now been mapped to compound keys (cf. Bird et al, 2007b, chapter 6; Martelli et al, 2005 pp. 173-5). proPOSEL.items() # calls built-in method which returns a list of key-value pairs [((’cascaded’, ’VVN’), [’3’, ’010’, ’C’]), ((’cascading’, ’VVG’), [’3’, ’010’, ’C’]), ((’cascaded’, ’VVD’), [’3’, ’010’, ’C’]), ((’cascading’, ’AJ0’), [’3’, ’010’, ’C’])] Listing 2: Each individual entry tuple is a collection of objects with different linguistic interpretations Incoming corpus text - also in the form of (token, tag) tuples - can now be matched against dictionary keys; and thus intersection enables corpus text to accumulate additional values which have the potential to become features for machine learning tasks. There is one caveat, however. Listing 2 identifies an instance where the -ing form of a verb (the present participle) is sometimes tagged as an adjective, whereas the -ed form (the past participle) is not. This is just one example of a general problem: a corpus may include syntactic variants as yet unrecorded in ProPOSEL; and if so, these will not be matched because the lookup keys and the syntactic values generated from them - the Penn, LOB and C7 fields - can only represent the variance in CUVPlus and its parent corpus, the BNC."]},{"title":"5. Manipulating Data in the Lexicon: Managing Different Tagsets","paragraphs":["The aforementioned lookup mechanism is relatively straightforward for corpora tagged with C5, the basic tagset used in the BNC. For corpora tagged with alternative schemes, incoming tokens and tags will first need to be matched against wordforms and the corresponding tagset fields in the lexicon. Different tagsets (Penn, C7 and LOB) were mapped to C5 as part of the lexicon build; we are still experimenting with these mappings and it is anticipated that user feedback will also be important in fine-tuning them. However, the lexicon is supported by a range of Python software compatible with NLTK to facilitate the cross-referencing of linguistic data from the lexicon’s record structure to corpus text (cf. Bird et al, 2007b, chapter 13). It is possible, nominally, to map between C5 and different PoS-tagging schemes in ProPOSEL via a one-step process. In the following line of code, C5 tags are mapped to LOB: mapTags = list(set([(line[1], line[10]) for line in lexicon])) Listing 3: Code snippet maps the set of all C5 PoS tags in the prosody-PoS English Lexicon to equivalent symbolic values in LOB However, the resulting mapTags object uncovers a new set of problems. The C5 tagset comprises 62 part-of-speech tags, including 4 tags for punctuation; but the set of C5 tags in the lexicon includes combinations for enclitics and possessive forms like “I’ll” <PNP+VMO> and “Lloyd’s” <NPO+POS> and has 95 items. The mapTags object also reveals 39 instances (around 41%) of one-to-many mappings - mostly, but not entirely, in the direction C5 > LOB. The challenges of converting between different tagsets have been extensively documented (Atwell et al, 1994; Atwell et al, 2000; Atwell, 2007). One-to-many mappings uncover ‘indelicate’ areas of each tagset and syntactic information is lost both ways even when the tagsets favour fine-grained linguistic distinctions. ProPOSEL is supported by a toolkit of software solutions and an explanatory tutorial to help surmount such problems, with sections on: preparing the textfile for NLP; mapping variant syntactic information (with subsidiary sections on enclitics, Saxon genitives and one-to-many mappings); using the lexicon as a prosodic annotation tool; and implementing ProPOSEL as a Python dictionary. In the following code snippet, the Python itertools() module is used to loop through two parallel iterables: match - a list of token, C5 tuples; and corpusText - a list of lists comprising the original token, LOB tag pairings from the corpus plus an equivalent C5 tag generated from the lexicon. For each item, a successful lookup via the dictionary object proPOSEL in turn generates a deeply nested sequence object holding orthographic form mapped to both LOB and C5, plus further annotations from whichever additional fields have been selected. for x, y in itertools.izip(match, corpusText):","if x in proPOSEL.keys():","# if tuple format matches dictionary keys","y.append(proPOSEL[x])","# append corresponding values for selected","fields","else:","y.append(’No match’)","Listing 4: Code snippet illustrating one solution for","automatic dictionary lookup","Outputs from this lookup process after formatting","functions have been applied are shown in Listing 5 below.","These illustrate problems with function words mostly,","which can only be addressed through further research: • What are the best default CFP settings for phrase","break prediction in field (10)? • What is the CFP status of an enclitic? • Under what circumstances do function words","carry a beat?

Conclusions","paragraphs":["This paper describes a new combined prosody and PoS-tag lexicon for corpus-based research and language engineering in English. The lexicon builds on established language resources and maps wordform entries to a range of attributes which have proved, or may prove, significant for machine learning and linguistic analysis of prosody: the open or closed-class status of words, for example, and their symbolic rhythmic structure. The paper argues the case for word class identification via PoS tags in computer-usable dictionaries. Syntax is an important intermediary in TTS systems between input text and synthesized speech output (Loquendo, 2004). The prototype prosody lexicon already holds four variant PoS-tagging schemes widely used in English speech corpora. Finally, it is planned to make this lexicon freely available to other speech and language researchers - under the auspices of the open source Natural Language Toolkit - and therefore it is supported by Python software and tutorial documentation."]},{"title":"7.
