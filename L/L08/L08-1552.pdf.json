Relations are extracted from an annotated and manually corrected corpus. Semantic relations added to the database are retrieved from noun-appositive relations found in the corpus. The method uses clustering to generate labeled sets of words with hypernym relations between set label and set elements."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["We constantly create new words and new uses for old words. Even if we could, at some point in time, completely describe a language through some resource such as a dictionary, it would inevitably become incomplete in a matter of months (Manning and Schutze, 1999). Moreover, since building lexical resources is a time consuming and expensive task, reusing and improving existing resources is easier and more productive then building new ones. The aim of the work described in this paper is to take an existing database of lexical resources (de Matos and Ribeiro, 2004) and enrich the noun classifications it holds by adding missing information such as semantic relations (e.g. hypernymy). This new information includes noun categorization and restrictions on predicate argument selection retrieved from noun-appositive relations. A database with a rich predicate argument structure is important in natural language processing (NLP) tasks like generation, summariza-tion, language analysis, and automatic machine translation, among others. Section 2. talks about related work; section 3.1. explains the corpus structure; section 3.2. describes the categorizations of nouns and relations; section 4. discusses the results; and section 5. contains the conclusions."]},{"title":"2. Lexical acquisition using apposition","paragraphs":["Apposition is a syntactical construction, in which two noun phrases are placed side by side, commonly used by news-paper writers to categorize subjects. Nouns in appositives are semantically related, as discussed in (Riloff and Shepherd, 1997). Two noun phrases related by apposition explain each other and help the reader to understand the nouns involved. Moreover, apposition can also be used to introduce acronyms or to complete technical definitions. Automatic lexical acquisition is the ability that computers have to learn lexical information from machine-readable texts, and has been widely developed in recent years. Extracting methodologies, that include text mining and mapping items to a set of properties, emerged from research (Nicholson et al., 2006). In particular, some authors use apposition to define lexical relations between nouns. This paper explores apposition as a source of automatic lexical acquisition. Caraballo proposed a method where nouns are clustered to-gether based on conjunction and appositive data collected from the Wall Street Journal corpus. The method uses bottom-up clustering to built a hierarchy of related nouns. The internal nodes of the resulting tree are then labeled with hypernyms for the nouns clustered underneath them (Caraballo, 1999). This work was intended to extend the Word-Net (Fellbaum, 1998) with domain specific text. Pantel and Pennacchiotti have an algorithm that automatically converts semantic relations in an ontology. The algorithm uses patterns extracted from a corpus to determine relations between nouns (Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006; Pennacchiotti and Pantel, 2006). McIntosh and Curran uses noun-appositive relations to extract technical definitions from biological texts. Their work generates tables of biological compound definitions (McIntosh and Curran, 2007). This work uses apposition to relate nouns and clustering to define classes."]},{"title":"3. Building semantic relations","paragraphs":["The program, first analyzes the corpus and identifies the noun-apposition pairs. Then uses clustering to categorize relations between nouns in hypernymy and synonymy. 3.1. Corpus analyzes Floresta Sintáctica (FS) (Afonso et al., 2002) is a Portuguese language treebank created from CETEMPúblico, a collection of articles from the Portuguese daily Público. FS has 41,406 syntactic trees and about 1 million words, automatically annotated using PALAVRAS (Bick, 2000). A subset of FS, the first 184,773 words, are manually corrected. This subset is called Bosque Sintáctico (BS). We use BS as our source of annotated noun-apposition pairs. A corpus analysis found apposition chunks included in subject and direct object chunks. Co-occurrent nouns related by apposition could be of the type {proper name, common name indicating title}, {common name, common name indicating function}, and {proper name, acronym}, as shown in sentence 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3. Example 1. The following sentence uses apposition to in-dicate that “Yasser Arafat” is the “president of Palestina”:"]},{"title":"2521","paragraphs":["1.1 (SUBJ Yasser Arafat, (APP presidente da Palestina)), comeu com Bill Clinton na Casa Branca. (SUBJ Yasser Arafat, (APP the Palestinian president)), ate with Bill Clinton at the White House. The following sentence uses apposition to indicate that “manufacture” is a “company”:","1.2 (SUBJ O mundialmente conhecido fabricante de ratos, (APP a empresa Suı́ca̧ Logitech)), encerrou o fabrico de ratos mecânicos. (SUBJ A worldwide known mice manufacturer, (APP the Swiss Logitech company)), closed the production of mechanical mice. The following sentence uses apposition to introduce the acronym for the United Nations:","1.3 (SUBJ A Organização das Nações Unidas, (APP ONU)), enviou tropas para África. (SUBJ United Nations, (APP UN)), sent soldiers to Africa. 3.2. Categorizing nouns We searched the corpus extracting every chunk containing an apposition sub-chunk. The program saves the two nouns that are heads of the noun and apposition sub-chunk in two-element sets. We use two element sets instead of pairs, because the same noun can appear in the noun or apposition sub-chunk, as shown in example 2. Example 2. In the following sentences the noun presidente (president) is used as the appositive in sentence 2.1 and as the subject in sentence 2.2.","2.1 (SUBJ Yasser Arafat, (APP presidente da Palestina)), comeu com Bill Clinton na Casa Branca. (SUBJ Yasser Arafat, (APP the Palestinian president)), ate with Bill Clinton at the White House.","2.2 (SUBJ O presidente da Palestina, (APP Yasser Arafat)), deu uma conferência de imprensa. (SUBJ The president of the Palestine, (APP Yasser Arafat)), gave a press conference. The noun set that implements the relation between chunk heads is saved. For instance, the sentence of example 1 produce the set {Yasser Arafat, presidente (president)} and sentence of example 2 produce the set { presidente (president), Yasser Arafat}, but only the first one is used. Note that only the word presidente (president) is included in the two element set, and not the expression presidente da Palestina (president of Palestine), because presidente (president) is the appositive chunk head. 3.2.1. Hypernyms The system searches for two noun sets with a common elements and generates sets of related nouns. Sets with similar nouns are clustered together. The noun included in all the sets is the cluster label and the related nouns are the elements of each cluster. Nouns like Bill Clinton, Boris Ieltsin, and Anı́bal Cavaco Silva occurred in sets with the noun presidente (president). These nouns originated a set labeled presidente (president), as shown in example 3. Example 3. Noun sets: 3.1 {presidente, Bill Cliton} 3.2 {Boris Ieltsin, presidente} 3.3 {presidente, Anı́bal Cavaco Silva} presidente = {Bill Clinton, Boris Ieltsin, Anı́bal Cavaco Silva} Elements of the cluster are related to the cluster label by a is-a relation and the cluster label is a hyperonym of cluster elements (figure 1). presidente","Bill Clinton Aníbal Cavaco Silva Boris Ieltsin is-ais-a is-a Figure 1: is-a relations Multi-word organization names, eligible for acronym use, were grouped in sets tagged after the common word, as shown in example 4. Labels hold a hypernymy relation with set elements, i.e., the label is an abstraction of the set elements. Example 4. The sets 4.1 {Museu do Ar (Air Museum), MA } 4.2 {Museu da Cidade (City Museum), MC} generated the set museu = {Museu da Cidade (City Museum), Museu do Ar (Air Museum)} Figure 2 shows the word organização (organization) as the hypernym of concrete organization names. Each organization is also related by a is-a relation to the corresponding acronym. This way, when processing corpus, the program can refer to same entity if it either finds acronyms or complete names and assumptions made for an organization are also true for each organization in particular. 3.2.2. Synonym Words like empresa (company) co-occurred with proper nouns (company names) and with common nouns such as fabricante (manufacturer) raising the possibility of creating synset (Fellbaum, 1998) entries. We noticed that relations between nouns are transitive: it is, thus, possible to create a network of semantic relations between the extracted nouns. Figure 3 shows the semantic relations between six nouns. Each connection represents a set extracted from the corpus and implements the relation is-a."]},{"title":"2522 Organização","paragraphs":["das Nações Unidas Organização de Países Exportadores de Petróleo ONU OPEP Organização para a Cultura e Desenvolvimento OCDE Organização","is-a is-a is-a Figure 2: Hypernym of multi-word nouns. grupo fanfarra banco estado accionista Sonae Figure 3: Semantic relations between nouns."]},{"title":"4. Results","paragraphs":["We were able to extract over 486 sets of related nouns from Bosque Sintáctico. We compared the classification of our system with the manually annotated examples to calculate recall and precision. Recall was calculated using the number of annotations correctly marked (ch for hypernyms and cs for synonyms), and the number of annotations that were consider as hypernyms/synonyms by the system, but were manually annotated as synonyms/hypernyms (mas/mah):","recallhypernym = ch ch+mas and recallsynonym = ch","ch+mah To calculate precision, we also used ch/cs, and the number of annotations that the system classified with synonyms/hypernyms but were manually annotated as hypernyms/synonyms (mah/mas).","precisionhypernym = ch","ch+mah and","precisionsynonym = ch","ch+mas Table 1 shows the obtained precision, recall and F-measure.

Conclusion","paragraphs":["Automatic lexical acquisition is a hard task and lexical resources are essential for NLP tasks. We proposed a simple method to categorize nouns using a small syntactically annotated corpus. The method uses apposition and clustering to define relations between nouns. We conclude that nouns in apposition are related by synonymy and that multi-word nouns that are not proper names, but share common words, are related by hyponymy with the common words. These results are an important step toward the objective of our research work: enrich-ment of the information on predicate argument structure contained in our lexical resources database. Other corpus will be explored to extract noun apposition relations."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This work was partially funded by PRIME National Project TECNOVOZ (number 03/165) and FCT project CMU-Pt/0005/2007."]},{"title":"6.
