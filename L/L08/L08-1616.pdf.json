Introduction","paragraphs":["Automatic sentiment analysis in texts, also called opinion mining, has attracted considerable attention in recent years, primarily because of its potential use in marketing study. It aims to answer questions such as ‘Is the customer who sent a mail to an after-sales service particularly dissatisfied?’ ‘Are the opinions about a product posted on blogs positive or negative?’ ‘What is the image of a political party or leader in the press?’. All these questions, which relate to the way something is presented and evaluated in a text, are particularly difficult for traditional information extraction techniques (Das & Chen, 2001; Strapparava & Mihalcea, 2007; Wilks, 1997). They present, however, many applications like transmitting to the senior members of an after-sales service the mails of which the emotional tone is the most intense. Most of the approaches developed to classify texts or sentences as positive or negative rest on unsupervised knowledge-based methods and on a very specific kind of language resource: emotional lexicons (Andreevskaia & Bergler, 2007). These lexicons contain words tagged with their affective valence (also called affective polarity or semantic orientation) that indicates whether a word conveys a positive or a negative content. To build these resources, several automatic techniques have been proposed. Some of them are based on dictionaries and lexical databases (e.g. Esuli & Sebastiani, 2006; Kamps et al., 2004; Kim & Hovy, 2004), while others use corpora (e.g. Bestgen, 2002; Hatzivassiloglou & McKeown, 1997; Sahlgren et al., 2007; Turney & Littman, 2002, 2003). One of the main advantages of the corpora techniques is that they can build lexicons that are tailored to a specific application simply by using a specific corpus. Currently, only anecdotal observations and data from other areas of language processing plead in favour of the utility of specific corpora (Bestgen, 2002, 2006). This research aims at testing this hypothesis explicitly."]},{"title":"2. Determining the affective valence of words from small corpora","paragraphs":["To my knowledge, the first researchers to propose an automatic procedure to determine the valence of words on the basis of corpora are Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997). Their algorithm aims to infer the semantic orientation of adjectives on the basis of an analysis of their co-occurrences with conjunctions. The main limitation of their algorithm is that it was developed specifically for adjectives and that the question of its application to other grammatical categories has not been solved (Turney & Littman, 2003). If several other techniques have been proposed to determine affective valence from corpora, only a few of them have been designed to work with relatively small corpora (ten million words or fewer), a necessary property for building specific affective lexicons. Two techniques that fulfil this condition are described below."]},{"title":"2.1 SO-LSA","paragraphs":["The technique proposed by Turney and Littman (2003) tries to infer semantic orientation from semantic association in a corpus. It is based on the semantic proximity between a target word and fourteen benchmarks: seven with positive valence and seven with negative valence (see Table 1). A word is considered as positive if it is closer to the positive benchmarks and further away from the negative benchmarks. Turney and Littman proposed two techniques for estimating the strength of the semantic association between words on the basis of corpora. The first technique estimates the semantic proximity between a word and a benchmark on the basis of the frequency with which they co-occur. Its main limitation"]},{"title":"496","paragraphs":["is that it requires a very large corpus to be effective. Turney and Littman (2003) used in their analyses a corpus made up of all the English texts available on the Internet, that is to say, some 100 billion words1",". The origin of this limitation is in the need for observing co-occurrences between the word and the benchmark to obtain an index of proximity. ","Positive words Negative words good bad nice nasty excellent poor positive negative fortunate unfortunate correct wrong superior inferior","","Table 1. The seven positive and the seven negative","benchmarks used by Turney and Littman (2003).  For relatively small corpora (i.e. ten million words), they recommend the use of Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), a mathematical technique for extracting a very large ‘semantic space’ from large text corpora on the basis of the statistical analysis of the set of co-occurrences in a text corpus (Deerwester et al., 1990; Landauer, Foltz & Laham, 1998). The point of departure of the analysis is a lexical table (Lebart & Salem, 1992) containing the frequencies of every word in each of the documents included in the text material, a document being a text, a paragraph or a sentence. To derive semantic relations between words from the lexical table the analysis of mere co-occurrences will not do, the major problem being that even in a large corpus most words are relatively rare. Consequently, the co-occurrences of words are even rarer. This fact makes such co-occurrences very sensitive to arbitrary variations (Burgess, Livesay & Lund, 1998; Kintsch, 2001; Rajman & Besançon, 1997). LSA resolves this problem by replacing the original frequency table with an approximation producing a kind of smoothing effect on the associations. To this end, the frequency table undergoes singular value decomposition and it is then recomposed on the basis of only a fraction of the information it contains. Thus, the thousands of words from the documents have been substituted by linear combinations or ‘semantic dimensions’ with respect to which the original words can be situated again. Contrary to a classical factor analysis the extracted dimensions are very numerous and non-interpretable. One could, however, compare them to semantic features describing the meaning of words (Landauer et al., 1998). In this semantic space, the meaning of a word is represented by a vector. To determine the semantic proximity between two words, the cosine between their corresponding vectors is calculated. The more two words (or one word and a benchmark) are semantically similar,  1 Turney and Littman (2003) used for this analysis the Altavista search engine. the more their vectors point in the same direction, and consequently the closer their cosine will be to one (which corresponds to coinciding vectors). A cosine of zero shows an absence of similarity, since the corresponding vectors point in orthogonal directions. The emotional valence of a word corresponds to the sum of the cosine between this word and the positive benchmarks minus the sum of the cosine between it and the negative benchmarks. Turney and Littman evaluated the effectiveness of their technique by comparing the predicted orientation of words with that defined in the General Inquirer Lexicon (Stone et al., 1966), which contains a list of 3596 English words labelled as positive or negative. Calculated on the basis of a corpus of ten million words, PR-LSA labels 65% of the words correctly."]},{"title":"2.2 DI-LSA","paragraphs":["The technique proposed independently by Bestgen (2002), DI-LSA, is very similar to the one proposed by Turney and Littman. The main difference is at the level of the benchmarks used to evaluate a word. While SO-LSA uses a few benchmarks selected a priori, DI-LSA is based on lexicons that contain several hundred words rated by judges on the pleasant-unpleasant scale This kind of lexicon was initially developed in the field of content analysis. As early as 1965, Heise proposed to constitute a valence dictionary by asking judges to rate a sample of the most frequent English words on the pleasant-unpleasant scale. Since then, lexicons for various languages have been made up (Hogenraad et al., 1995; Whissell et al., 1986). As an example, Table 2 shows the evaluation scores of several words randomly extracted from the dictionary and used in the present study (Hogenraad, Bestgen & Nysten, 1995).

More precisely, the unknown valence of a word corresponds to the average valence of its thirty closer neighbours, neighbourhood being identified on the basis of the cosine in the semantic space extracted by LSA. To evaluate this index, Bestgen (2002) compared the predicted values for words with their actual values according to the dictionary and obtained correlations ranging from 0.56 to 0.70. He also showed that taking into account the thirty closer neighbours yields a better estimate than taking into account only five neighbours."]},{"title":"3. Experiment","paragraphs":["This experiment aims to determine the effect on an automatic sentiment analysis task of the similarity between test materials and a corpus from which an affective lexicon is extracted. The materials for this sentence-level classification experiment (Riloff, Wiebe, & Phillips, 2005) are composed of 702 sentences 2"," published in the Belgian French-language newspaper Le Soir in 1995. These sentences were evaluated by ten judges. Their task was to indicate, on a seven-point scale, up to what point the contents of each sentence evoked an unpleasant, neutral or pleasant idea. Participants read, individually and in a different random order, the 702 sentences of the corpus on a computer screen. The sentences were successively displayed just above the rating scale. Participants gave their ratings by clicking on the button corresponding to the level of pleasantness they felt. A ‘validate’ button enabled them to confirm their choice and to start processing the next sentence. Participants could pause at any time. The instructions specified that a break of at least one hour was to be taken around the middle of the task. On average, the participants took fifteen seconds to rate each sentence. Table 3 provides some examples of the sentences and their emotional valence. The inter-rater agreement, computed by means of Cronbach's alpha, was very high (0.93). The average correlation between the ratings of one participant and the average ratings of all the other participants was 0.75 (the leave-one-out technique). The average correlation between the ratings provided by two participants was 0.60. A detailed presentation of the procedure used to build the materials is given in Bestgen, Fairon and Kevers (2004)."]},{"title":"3.1 Method","paragraphs":["The two techniques described above were used in this experiment.

French (bon, gentil, excellent, positif, heureux, correct et supérieur: mauvais, méchant, médiocre, négatif, malheureux, faux et inférieur). For DI-LSA, a French lexicon made up of 3000 words evaluated on the pleasant-unpleasant scale was used (Hogenraad et al., 1995). A minimum of thirty judges rated the words on a seven-point scale from ‘very unpleasant’ (1) to ‘very pleasant’ (7).

To be able to compare these three corpora in a fair way, the three semantic spaces were extracted, one from each corpus, according to an identical procedure adapted from Bestgen (2006). These corpora were subdivided into segments of 125 words. All the words of a segment had to come from the same text. All the segments of fewer than 125 words (articles of small size and the last incomplete segment of a text) were removed. These rules produced 40635 segments for the Literary corpus and more than 50000 for the other two corpora. In order to be able to compare corpora of different types, but of same sizes, only the first 40635 segments of the Soir1995 and Soir1997 corpora were taken into account.Singular value decomposition was realised with the program SVDPACKC (Berry, 1992), and the first 300 singular vectors were retained."]},{"title":"3.2 Results","paragraphs":["The predicted valences, corresponding to the average valence of the words belonging to the sentence were compared with the judges' ratings by means of Pearson's correlation coefficients (see Table 4). Two levels of reference to measure the effectiveness of the techniques are given by previous analyses of the test materials (Bestgen et al., 2004). First, a correlation of 0.39 was obtained between the judges' ratings of the sentences and those based on the original lexicon of 3000 words, a value statistically significant (p<0.0001). In order to determine the effectiveness of a lexicon which takes into account all the words included in the sentences, two judges were asked to decide if each word present in the sentences, but absent from the original lexicon, was positive, neutral or negative. The correlation between the sentence ratings and that obtained on the basis of this exhaustive dictionary was 0.56. The most important result has a bearing on the large difference in efficiency between the three corpora used to compute the word-benchmark similarities. Both techniques are far more efficient when the word’s affective valence is estimated from the semantic proximities in corpora that contain texts very similar to the one from which the test materials have been extracted. Interestingly, there is little difference between the Soir1995 and the Soir1997 corpora, leading to the conclusion that it is the genre or the source of the texts that matters and not the fact that the test materials and the semantic space were extracted from the very same texts. As regards the difference between the techniques, DI-LSA outperforms SO-LSA as well as the original lexicon. It even almost reaches the level of efficiency of the manually-expanded lexicon. If SO-LSA only weakly outperforms the lexicon approach, this performance is notable because SO-LSA is based on only fourteen benchmarks while the original lexicon includes 3000 words evaluated by numerous judges.

"]},{"title":"4. Conclusion","paragraphs":["The experiment reported above shows that automatic techniques developed for estimating the valence of words from relatively small corpora (five million words) are more efficient if the corpora used contain texts similar to the one that must be evaluated. Obviously, the beneficial effect of using a corpus similar to the test materials would have been more strongly supported if the opposite demonstration could have been carried out: the Literary corpus should outperform the newspaper ones when the test materials are made up of sentences extracted from literary texts. More generally, it seems that in the present experiment we are close to the maximum effectiveness of the lexical approach to evaluating sentences, since the automatic technique is nearly as effective as the traditional approach based on an exhaustive dictionary. The correlation between the predicted valences and the valences obtained from judges, however, is just higher than 0.50. If one wishes to go beyond this level of efficiency, it is probably essential to combine lexical information and more complex linguistic analyses. The ‘simplistic’ character of an approach based solely on the words considered individually has been strongly criticised (Bestgen, 1994; Pang et al., 2002; Polanyi & Zaenen, 2003). For example, Polanyi and Zaenen (2003) underline the need to take into account negations but also some connectors (‘Although Boris is brilliant at maths, he is a horrific teacher’) and the modal operators (‘If Mary were a terrible person, she would be mean to her dogs’). It is, however, noteworthy that these criticisms of the lexical approach do not reject it but underline the need to supplement it. Having the most powerful lexical indices possible is a prerequisite for following this new avenue of research."]},{"title":"5.
