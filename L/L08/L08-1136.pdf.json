Basque Country {igor,agurrutxaga,nereaa,eli}@elhuyar.com Abstract Morphological query expansion and language-filtering words have proved to be valid methods when searching the web for content in Basque via APIs of commercial search engines, as the implementation of these methods in recent IR and web-as-corpus tools shows, but no real analysis has been carried out to ascertain the degree of improvement, apart from a comparison of recall and precision using a classical web search engine and measured in terms of hit counts.  This paper deals with a more theoretical study that confirms the validity of the combination of both methods. We have measured the increase in recall obtained by morphological query expansion and the increase in precision and loss in recall produced by language-filtering-words, but not only by searching the web directly and looking at the hit counts –which are not considered to be very reliable at best–, but also using both a Basque web corpus and a classical lemmatised corpus, thus providing more exact quantitative results. Furthermore, we provide various corpora-extracted data to be used in the aforementioned methods, such as lists of the most frequent inflections and declinations (cases, persons, numbers, times, etc.) for each POS –the most interesting word forms for a morphologically expanded query–, or a list of the most used Basque words with their frequencies and document-frequencies –the ones that should be used as language-filtering words–. "]},{"title":"1. Introduction 1.1. Basque web searching problems","paragraphs":["There are two main reasons why existing web search services are unsuitable for the case of Basque. The first is that Basque is an agglutinative language, and the problems that non-English languages, and agglutinative languages in particular, have with search engines are well known (Bar-Ilan, 2005; Bar-Ilan & Gutman, 2003; Bar-Ilan & Gutman, 2005). In Basque, a given lemma produces many different word forms, depending on the case (genitive, locative, etc.) or the number (singular, plural, indefinite) for nouns and adjectives, and the person (me, he, etc.) and the tense (present, past, etc.) for verbs. A brief morphological description of Basque can be found in (Alegria et al., 1996). All this means that looking only for the exact given word or the word plus an “s” for the plural is not enough for Basque. The second reason is that none of the existing search services can discriminate Basque pages in their searches. Searching in any of them for a technical word that also exists in other languages –anorexia, sulfuroso, byte or allegro, to cite just a few examples of the many that exist– or a proper noun or a short word, will not only not yield results exclusively in Basque, but often not yield any results in Basque at all."]},{"title":"1.2. API based approach","paragraphs":["A possible solution could be to set up our own search services, which would only include pages that are in Basque and which would not index the word forms that a page contains, but its lemmas, as proposed in (Langer, 2001). However, instead of taking this approach and implementing and maintaining all the infrastructure that a search engine and its crawling, indexing and serving involves –bandwidth, disk, reliability, etc.–, two recent Basque web search services have been developed that make use of the APIs of classical search engines: Elebila, a search engine (Leturia et al., 2007:1), and CorpEus, a web-as-corpus tool (Leturia et al., 2007:2). They both solve the two problems we have mentioned by means of morphological query expansion and language-filtering words. The approach is a very cost-effective one, and it could be applied to other agglutinative or under-resourced languages as well."]},{"title":"1.3. Looking for conjugations and inflections","paragraphs":["When asking the API of a search engine for a word, we need it to return pages that contain its conjugations or inflections, too. The way we have approached this matter is based on morphological query expansion. The importance and use of morphology for various IR tasks has been widely documented (Ambroziak & Woods, 1998; Krovetz, 1993; Woods, 2000; Woods et al., 2000), although it is normally applied by lemmatisation at the indexation stage, which is an unattainable objective for us, as has been stated above. Instead, we apply morphological generation at the querying stage: we use a tool created by the IXA Group of the University of the Basque Country that gives us all the possible inflections or conjugations of the lemma, and we ask the search engine to look for any of them by using an OR operator. For example, if the user asks for etxe (“house”), the search engine is asked for “(etxe OR etxea OR etxeak OR etxeari OR etxeek OR etxearen OR...)”. This is how a lemma-based search is obtained."]},{"title":"720","paragraphs":["But the APIs of search engines have their limitations with regard to search term count, length of search phrase, etc. These limitations render a proper lemmatised search for Basque impossible, as we cannot search for all the conjugations or inflections. So we send the most frequent ones, which will cover a high enough percentage of all the occurrences. A similar approach is taken in (Kettunen, 2007; Kettunen et al., 2007)."]},{"title":"1.4. Language discrimination","paragraphs":["We have mentioned already that there is no commercial search engine that can distinguish pages in Basque and return them alone. To achieve this we include, in the search phrase that is sent to the API, the most frequently used words in Basque, in conjunction with an AND operator. We used a corpus to see which these most used words were. But the most frequent words in Basque are short and, as such, the chances of their existing in other languages or being used as abbreviations or acronyms is quite high –in fact, the first two words at least have well-known meanings in other languages–. Therefore, we include a number of these language-filtering words in the queries to obtain a high percentage of Basque results, although this also involves a loss in recall (some Basque pages can be left out because they do not contain one or more of the words)."]},{"title":"2. Motivation","paragraphs":["The combination of morphological query expansion and language-filtering words has been successfully applied in the search service Elebila and the web-as-corpus tool CorpEus. But some details of their implementation that could be of importance in their performance have not been tested sufficiently thoroughly. For example, the choice of the most frequent word forms for the morphological query expansion has been made quite intuitively, without analysing a corpus for the most frequent inflections of each POS; choosing the number of language-filtering words has been done empirically by observing the results of some searches, instead of properly analysing their effect on precision and recall in order to find a compromise between them; and the only evaluation the methodology has been subjected to is based on hit counts of real web searches. So the aim of this work is to make a more detailed analysis of the effects of the methodology: to perform corpora-based precision and recall measurements on both morphological query expansion and language-filtering words, and to compare these with the precision and recall observed by applying them in web searches. We also wanted to produce corpora-based lists of the most frequent cases for each POS."]},{"title":"3. Design of the study","paragraphs":["As stated above, the study described in this paper consists of various corpus-based measurements. One of the corpora used for carrying it out is the ZT Corpus (Areta et al., 2007), a lemmatised Basque corpus on science and technology made up of 7.6 million words. But since the typology of the documents that form a classical corpus and those that form the WWW might differ (Sharoff, 2006), we have considered it advisable to use not only a classical corpus, but also a web corpus. So we have compiled a web corpus by crawling the Basque branch of the Google Directory (http://www.google.com/Top/World/Euskara/). We downloaded the 3,000 plus page present there and recursively followed all the links found in pages that LangId, a language identifier developed by the IXA Group of the University of the Basque Country, identified to be in the Basque language. The downloading process has been designed to ensure as much website variety as possible, by queuing the links found, prioritising different domains in each parallel downloading stage, etc. The web corpora obtained is made up of over 44,000 documents and approximately 20 million words. The various measurements using these corpora had to be done by employing many different words. Instead of choosing random words, we used the search logs corresponding to the four months that the Elebila search engine has been in existence. These accounted for over 400,000 searches involving over 800,000 words, which after lemmatisation made over 70,000 different words. We ordered them by decreasing frequency and used the topmost ones for our work. This way, by basing our study on these most searched-for words and afterwards optimising the aforementioned IR tools with the results of the study, we will be maximising their performance for real-life searches."]},{"title":"4. Morphological query expansion 4.1. Most frequent cases","paragraphs":["Morphological query expansion consists of sending the different conjugations or inflections of a lemma with an OR operator to the API, but since the number of words that the APIs allow in a query is limited, it is important, in order to improve recall as much as possible, that these be the most frequent ones. In the morphological query expansion implemented in CorpEus and Elebila, the most frequent cases had been chosen intuitively, without making a corpora-based analysis. So in order to base the expansion on more empirical data, we have looked for these most frequent cases in both of the aforementioned corpora. For each of the morphologically productive POSs in Basque –nouns, proper nouns, place names, adjectives and verbs–, we took the most searched-for words of the Elebila logs. Because of the non-tagged nature of the web corpus, the words chosen had to be non-ambiguous. Then each different surface form of the words was assigned its case. By grouping them by case and ordering them by decreasing frequency, we produced a list of the most frequent cases for each POS, both in the classical corpus and the web corpus. The lists of each corpus, although similar, reveal some differences between them, so we have preferred to choose the web corpus lists. These were the most frequent cases of each POS:"]},{"title":"721 ","paragraphs":["Ve r b : 1. Participle / perfective aspect (sortu) 2. Imperfective aspect (sortzen) 3.

Gain in recall","paragraphs":["Once the most frequent cases of each POS were known, we tried to measure the increase in recall we would obtain for each POS by including 1, 2, 3... of the cases of the same words as before in an OR. We have performed this using both corpora and also by looking at the increase in hit counts returned by Microsoft’s Live Search API. For the overall measure of the POSs, we made a weighted average of them, taking into account the frequency of use of each POS. To calculate these frequencies, we classified approximately the first 900 words (all that have a query frequency over 100) out of the more than 70,000 of the Elebila logs into one of the categories. This may not seem very much, but they do in fact account for more than 44% of the queries. The global increase in recall for each corpus is shown in Figure 1. A conclusion we can draw from the graph is that with as few as 5 cases, we can obtain an increase in recall of 50%, thus proving the validity of the morphological query expansion method. The gain shown in the chart is an average of the gains obtained by each POS; the individual gains for the web corpus are shown in Figure 2. The differences between them are obvious: some POSs, namely verbs, adjectives and place names, really benefit from the query expansion while the others do so to a lesser extent."]},{"title":"722","paragraphs":["0%10% 20% 30% 40%50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%110% 120% - 123456789101112131415 ZT Corpus Web Corpus Hit counts ","Figure 1: Gain in recall produced by including more cases in the queries "]},{"title":"0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% 120% 140% 160% 180% 200% - 123456789101112131415 Verbs Adjectives Nouns Proper nouns Place names Average ","paragraphs":["Figure 2: Gain in recall produced by including more cases in the queries, for each POS and in the Web Corpus "]},{"title":"5.

In view of this, we preferred to choose the candidates to act as language-filtering words from the first list, as this corpus is supposedly more similar to the one to which we will apply our tools, that is, the Internet. So the candidates will be the topmost six words from the web corpus list: eta, da, ez, du, bat and ere. Also, previous to this work, choosing how many language-filtering words should be added to the queries had been done by observing their behaviour in a number of searches. Now we have performed precision and recall studies on different combinations of the six candidates to be language-filtering words. Looking at the document-frequencies of the candidate words, it is clear which should be the words to choose for one-word and two-words language-filters, since there are significant gaps between the frequencies of the first three words in both corpora. Choosing which should be the third and fourth words is more difficult, because the next words have quite similar document-frequencies. For these ones we can even consider OR combinations.

We also measured the decrease in hit counts obtained by searching the web for Basque words alone, using Microsoft Live Search’s API. The results are shown in Figure 3. By taking a look at the graph, we can see the remarkable similarity between the web corpus and hit counts series, proving that the web corpus we have crawled from the web is a good sample for predicting the behaviour of the web. Furthermore, we can observe that the recall in the ZT Corpus is significantly greater, most likely due to the fact that the type of documents of which this corpus is composed of –books and articles on science and technology– is, on average, greater in size than most web pages, which confirms our previous supposition that it was better to base our study on a corpus collected from the web."]},{"title":"5.3. Gain in precision","paragraphs":["The addition of more of the language-filtering words to the query leads to a gain in language precision. For quantifying this gain the ideal thing would be, as before, to measure it on the corpora, but this is not possible, since we would need a multilingual corpus that would have the same proportion of each language as the web does, which is very difficult, if not impossible, to obtain. So we had no other option but to measure the gain in precision by searching the web through Microsoft’s API and looking at the percentage of results in the Basque language. For classifying the results into Basque or non-Basque we used LangId again, applying it to the snippets returned. We mentioned above that the performance of the language-filtering words method is most noticeable when the search term exists in other languages, or when it is short, or when it is a proper noun.

The most searched for words in Elebila from this category (and consequently the ones used for our evaluation) were words like herri (“people”, “town”), berri (“new”), haur (“child”), ipuin (“tale”), gabon (“Christmas”) or mapa (“map”).","Proper nouns: Proper nouns are usually the same in other languages. Some of the words for this category were Wikipedia, Google, Elhuyar, Egipto, Euskadi (“Basque Country”), etc.","International words: Words that we know definitely exist in another language (usually English, Spanish or French). These were some of the most searched for words in this category: biografia (“biography”), historia (“history”), energia (“energy”), animalia (“animal”), mitologia (“mitology”), arte (“art”)...","Words that are likely to be found in other languages: Technical words which, despite not being exactly the same in the three languages mentioned above, have quite similar spellings in all of them, so the probability of their existing in some other language is high.

All the valleys are combinations containing du and the highest peaks contain the word ere, so these two are, respectively, the worst and best words of the four for filtering. Between ez and bat there is no significant difference, although ez seems to behave a little better. These conclusions are logical: du is a word that is present in almost any text in a big language like French; bat is a word that, although not very frequent, exists in the language with the highest presence on the web, that is, English; and, as far as we know, ez and ere are not widely used words in at least three major languages, such as English, Spanish and French, but ere is longer and hence yields better results."]},{"title":"5.4.

So maybe it is a better idea to use 3-word combinations that do not include the word du –like eta AND da AND (ez OR bat OR ere), eta AND da AND (ez OR ere) or eta AND da AND (ez OR bat)–, with which we can achieve a precision of 86-87% and a recall of 68-65%. In fact, these are the combinations with the highest F-measure. But we must take into account that for proper nouns or international words the precision would fall to around 70%. The best thing might be to keep a list of the most searched proper nouns and international words, and when someone wants to search for one of them, use 4-word combinations, and otherwise use 3-word ones.
