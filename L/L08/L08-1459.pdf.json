The motivation for the study is to gain a better understanding of the rhetorical properties of parentheticals in order to enable a natural language generation system to produce parentheticals as part of a rhetorically well-formed output. We argue that there is a correlation between syntactic and rhetorical types of parentheticals and establish two main categories: ELABORATION/EXPANSION-type NP-modifier parentheticals and NON-ELABORATION/EXPANSION-type VP- or S-modifier parentheticals. We show several strategies for extracting these from the two corpora and discuss how the seemingly contradictory results obtained can be reconciled in light of the rhetorical and syntactic properties of parentheticals as well as the decisions taken in the annotation guidelines."]},{"title":"1. Definition","paragraphs":["Parentheticals are constructions that typically occur embedded in the middle of a clause. They are not part of the main predicate-argument structure of the sentence and are marked by special punctuation (e.g. parentheses, dashes, commas) in written texts, or by special intonation in speech. Syntactically, parentheticals can be realized by many different constructions. Some examples of different types of parentheticals are given in (1): appositive relative clause (1a), non-restrictive relative clause (1b), participial clause (1c), subordinate clause (1d) . Throughout this paper we will show parenthetical constructions in square brackets.","(1) a The new goal of the Voting Rights Act [– more minorities in political office –] is laudable.

(wsj0604) A common characteristics of parentheticals is that they express information that is not central to the meaning of the overall message conveyed by a text or spoken utterance and since they are specifically marked by punctuation or intonation, they allow the reader to distinguish between more and less important parts of the message. By structuring information this way, parentheticals make it easier for readers to decode the message conveyed by a text. Consider for example the following message that has been expressed by two different texts: one without parentheticals (2a) and one that contains two parentheticals (2b).","(2) a Eprex is used by dialysis patients who are anaemic.

Background and Motivation","paragraphs":["Parentheticals have been much studied in linguistics ( see (Dehe and Kavalova, 2007), (Burton-Roberts, 2005) for a recent overview) but so far they have received less atten-tion in computational linguistics. Only a few studies have attempted a computational analysis of parentheticals, the most recent ones being (Bonami and Godard, 2007) who give an underspecified semantics account of evaluative adverbs in French and (Siddharthan, 2002) who develops a statistical tool for summarisation that separates parentheticals from the sentence they are embedded in. Both of these studies are limited in their scope as they focus on a very specific type of parentheticals. From the perspective of natural language generation (NLG), as far as we know, nobody has attempted to give a principled account of parentheticals, even though these constructions contribute to the easy readability of generated texts, and therefore could significantly enhance the performance of NLG systems (Scott and Souza, 1990). Since the input to most NLG systems is a text plan expressed in some variant of Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and Thompson, 1987), the first step towards generating parentheticals is to understand which parts of the input text plan can be expressed as parenthetical constructions. The purpose of the present study is to take this first step by examining the rhetorical context of parentheticals. We describe a corpus study on two differently annotated discourse treebanks: the RST Discourse Treebank (RST, (Carlson et al., 2001)) and the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB, (PDTB-Group, 2008)). We show how parentheticals can be extracted from these treebanks and identify the discourse"]},{"title":"2668","paragraphs":["relations whose arguments are realized as parentheticals. We argue that the type of rhetorical or discourse relation that holds between parenthetical and its host correlates with the syntactic construction used for the parenthetical.

We show how the seemingly contradictory findings from the two corpora can be reconciled in light of these two types and the different perspective on discourse adopted in each corpus. The next two sections of the paper discuss the strategies we used to extract parentheticals from our chosen corpora. Section 5. discusses our findings and shows how the results of the study can be used to inform a natural language generation system."]},{"title":"3. Corpus Study on RST Treebank","paragraphs":["The RST Discourse Treebank (Carlson et al., 2001) consists of 385 Wall Street Journal texts from the Penn Treebank, segmented into Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs) and annotated with rhetorical relations (78 different relations in total). The corpus annotation manual defines embedded units as EDUs which break up another legitimate EDU or modify a portion of an EDU only, not the entire EDU. The corpus defines a pseudo-relation called Same Unit, which is used as a device for linking two discontinuous text fragments that are really a single EDU, but are broken up by an embedded unit. Same Unit is a multinuclear relation, where one of the nuclei corresponds to the parenthetical and the part of the host sentence that the parenthetical is related to (e.g. head noun of a relative clause). The other nucleus either simply contains the rest of the sentence or it can be similarly complex if there is more than one parenthetical in the sentence. To illustrate, Figure 1. shows an example of a sentence annotated with the Same Unit relation, where Nucleus 1 contains the subject NP broken up into a head noun and a complex relative clause, the latter being the parenthetical. Same Unit annotations identify EDUs that are embedded linearly or syntactically within another EDU, including parentheticals that are not syntactically related to the sentence but are separated by punctuation. We have extracted all the examples of Same Unit annotations from the corpus, 1117 cases in total and counted the number and type of rhetorical relations that occur within a complex nucleus.1","There were 1401 complex nuclei in total, of which we have excluded 630 cases that contained ELABORATION-OBJECT-ATTRIBUTE annotations. The reason for this is that by definition, in the corpus ELABORATION-OBJECT-ATTRIBUTE relations are assigned to restrictive relative clauses, which from a natural language generation system’s perspective, are generated as referring expressions. We therefore don’t consider ELABORATION-OBJECT-ATTRIBUTE annotations as parentheticals. 1 For complex cases like the example in Figure 1 we only","counted the top relation. within SameUnit Total in corpus 331 42.93% 3510 20.64% elab-add 128 16.60% 2520 14.82% attribution 58 7.52% 558 3.28% circumstance 35 4.54% 463 2.72% purpose 22 2.85% 97 0.57% restatement 20 2.59% 181 1.06% condition 19 2.46% 266 1.56% example 18 2.33% 337 1.98% antithesis 14 1.82% 110 0.65% elab-set-member 13 1.69% 223 1.31% concession 11 1.43% 368 2.16% elab-gen-spec 102 13.23% 8371 49.23% Other 771 100.00% 17004 100.00% Table 1: Most frequent relations within Same Unit Table 1 shows the frequency of relations that occurred more than ten times inside the Same Unit relation.

As can be seen by comparing the numbers in the two columns, all the relations in the table occur more frequently than usual within Same Unit. The most common relations expressed by parentheticals are ELABORATION-TYPE relations, which occur 51.49% of the time, with ELABORATION-ADDITIONAL accounting for 42.93% of all cases. The rest of the cases are CIRCUMSTANCE, PURPOSE, CONDITION, ANTITHESIS or CONCESSION relations which altogether occur 35.27% of the time. In order to generate parentheticals, a system needs to know not only which rhetorical relations can be realized as parentheticals, but also which of the available syntactic constructions to choose to realize it. To determine which syntactic constructions co-occur most frequently with parenthetical rhetorical relations, we have looked at 640 examples of Same Unit annotations and noted the syntactic type of the embedded parenthetical. The summary of our typology is illustrated in Table 2. As the table shows, although each rhetorical relation can be realized by several different syntactic types, there are one or two types for each relation that are more frequent than others. These are shown in the table in boldface. Based on which syntactic construction is most frequently used, we can distinguish two types of rhetorical relations. ELABORATION-TYPE relations (ELABORATION-ADDITIONAL, ELABORATION-SET-MEMBER, ELABORATION-GENERAL-SPECIFIC, RESTATEMENT and EXAMPLE) are most frequently expressed by NP-modifiers (non-restrictive relative clauses, NPs and participial clauses) which appear immediately following 2","Most examples of Same Unit had two nuclei.

According to the annotation manual, EDUs that are expressed by certain syntactic constructions such as relative clauses, nominal postmodifiers with a non-finite clause and appositives by definition always play the role of the Satellite and enter into “embedded” rhetorical relations, marked by a “-e” following the name of the relation.

This is a consequence of the definition of ELABORATION-OBJECT-ATTRIBUTE, which is by definition assigned to restrictive relative clauses. Indeed, many of the “non-embedded” examples of ELABORATION-OBJECT-ATTRIBUTE seem to be due to annotation errors. Again, we have excluded ELABORATION-OBJECT-ATTRIBUTE-E relations from the set of ’-e’ relations considered. Table 3. gives the statistics for occurrences of ’-e’ relations in the corpus, showing the frequency of embedding for relations that occur more than ten times in an embedded form in the corpus and excluding ELABORATION-OBJECT-ATTRIBUTE-E. Table 3 agrees with our study of Same Unit relations in that the most frequently embedded relations are subtypes of elaboration.

The numbers in Table 3 give us an idea about which relations occur frequently in a syntactically embedded form, and confirms that the set of relations that we found within Same Unit annotations are indeed the most frequently embedded ones. However, there is a significant difference in the distribution of the individual relations and it seems that ’-e’ annotations are not a good indicator for parenthetical status since we found both ’-e’ and “regular” rhetorical relations within Same Unit. For the purposes of this corpus study we decided therefore to ignore the distinction between ’-e’ and regular occurrences of rhetorical relations and only consider a relation parenthetical when it appears within a Same Unit annotation."]},{"title":"4.

The two arguments of a discourse connective are labelled Arg1 and Arg2 in the corpus, where Arg2 is the argument that is syntactically bound to the discourse connective, and Arg1 is the other argument. In the PDTB all connectives have exactly two arguments and there are no constraints on the relative order of these arguments. One way to identify parenthetical constructions in this corpus is to find annotations where one argument of a discourse connective occurs linearly embedded within the other argument. There are two logical possibilities for this: either Arg1 is embedded within Arg2 or Arg2 is embedded in Arg1. We will call the first type, where Arg1 forms the parenthetical, Arg1-parentheticals. This type is illustrated in (5a). The second type, where Arg2 is parenthetical, is shown in (5b). We’ll call this type Arg2-parentheticals.","(5) a [...] [ARG2 late Tuesday the Chinese government, [ARG1 which often buys U.S. grains in quantity,] turned instead to Britain to buy 500,000 metric tons of wheat] (wsj0155)","b [...] [ARG1 pollination, while [ARG2 easy in corn because the carrier is wind,] is more complex and involves insects as carriers in crops such as cotton] (wsj0209) In Arg1-parentheticals the discourse connective appears in the host sentence, whereas in Arg2-parentheticals it appears within the parenthetical. In total there are 219 cases of “embedded-argument” parentheticals in the corpus, of which 207 are examples of Arg2-parentheticals and only 12 are Arg1-parentheticals. The distribution of these two types is illustrated in table 4. The rows of the table show the number of parentheticals found for four different semantic type of connectives: TEMPORAL, CONTINGENCY, COMPARISON and EXPANSION, i.e. the number of cases where a discourse relation of a given type holds between the parenthetical and its host. The striking difference between the numbers in the two columns of table 4 shows that when one of the arguments of an explicit discourse relation is expressed as a parenthetical, in most cases the embedded string contains the explicit connective. The connectives that appear within the parenthetical are mostly structural connectives (mainly subordinating conjunctions and their modified forms, e.g., after, although, as, because, before, if, once, since, though, until, when, while), whereas all the connectives that appear in the host sentence are adverbs (e.g., also, instead, later, nevertheless, nonethe-less, previously, still, thereafter). The distribution of parentheticals across types of discourse relations in table 4 shows that there is no restriction on what relations allow their Arg2 to be expressed as a parenthetical.

We will discuss the reason for this discrepancy in more detail in section 5. Nevertheless, it should be noted that a lot of expansion-type relations can be inferred from another type of annotation in the PDTB: supplementary material annotations. These are extensions to a discourse argument that are relevant but not “minimally necessary” for the interpretation of a relation. Supplementary material often appears as a parenthetical embedded within one of the arguments of a discourse relation and therefore we need to consider these cases as well to get the correct distribution of parentheticals over rhetorical relations. The problem with the annotation of supplementary material is that these units have not been annotated for discourse relations so we do not know what relation (if any) holds between a parenthetical of this type and its host (although we suspect in most cases these spans convey a relation similar to expansion). To give an example, (6) illustrates two cases of parentheticals annotated as supplementary material in Arg1 (6a) and Arg2 (6b) of a connective.","(6) a The trust, which was created as part of Manville’s bankruptcy-law reorganization to compensate victims of asbestos-related diseases, ultimately expects to receive $2.5 billion from Manville, but its cash flow from investments has so far lagged behind its payments to victims.

Supplementary material appears more frequently within arguments that contain a connective: there are 127 examples of Arg2-embedded supplementary material, compared to 76 Arg1-embedded cases. However, more work will have to be done to evaluate the parenthetical nature of supplementary material in the PDTB, and then to distinguish among the various syntactic types that are indeed parentheticals. Our intuition is that many of these parenthetical supplements will be quite compatible with the syntactic types noted in the RST. We end this section by pointing out that the annotation of supplementary material also allows us to investigate the larger discourse context in which the parenthetical and its host appear (e.g. in (6a) the host of the parenthetical func-tions as Arg1 of the connective ’but’). Table 5 shows the distribution of discourse relations where one of the arguments contains supplementary material, broken down according to the semantic type of the connective. The table shows that there is no significant difference between discourse relations in terms of allowing parentheticals to occur in their arguments, however parentheticals do occur slightly more frequently in the clause that contains the connective (Arg2).","Relation Sup within Arg1 Sup within Arg2 TEMPORAL 7 31","CONTINGENCY 15 28 COMPARISON 30 36 EXPANSION 24 32","TOTAL: 76 127 Table 5: Distribution of Supplementary material"]},{"title":"5. Discussion 5.1. The Elaboration/Expansion Distribution","paragraphs":["The relation types classed as elaboration, as used in the RST, or expansion, as used in the PDTB, are the most common types of relations found in the respective corpora. Since their definitions overlap considerably, we therefore consider them jointly under the rubric Elaboration/Expansion. In extracting parentheticals from the RST and the PDTB, we might ask therefore whether the set of relations that we obtained also show the same preponderance of elaboration- and expansion-type relations. We classify our data into two primary types - ELABORATION/EXPANSION and NON-ELABORATION/EXPANSION type relations. Since the PDTB treats attribution as a separate phenomenon, we leave out the ATTRIBUTION relation encountered in the RST to facilitate comparison.3 Table 6 shows the proportions of ELABORATION/EXPANSION and NON-ELABORATION/EXPANSION relations in the two corpora, culled from the numbers seen in Tables 1 and 4. For the RST, we take subtypes of ELABORATION to be-long to the ELABORATION/EXPANSION group, as well as EXAMPLE and RESTATEMENT since recapitulation and exemplification are clearly related to a notion of elaboration.","3","ATTRIBUTION seems to be a different type of relation altogether, relating some agent to a rhetorical argument (“X said Y”) rather than being a relation between two full-fledged discourse arguments."]},{"title":"2672","paragraphs":["RST PDTB E L A B / E X P A N S I O N elab-add 331 restatement 22 expansion 20 example 19 elab-set-member 14 elab-gen-spec 11 TOTAL 397 (73.4%) TOTAL 20 (9.1%) N O N - E L A B / E X P A N S I O N circumstance 58 purpose 35 temporal 103 condition 20 contingency 53 antithesis 18 comparison 43 concession 13 TOTAL 144 (26.6%) TOTAL 199 (90.9%) Table 6: Elaboration/Expansion vs Non-Elaboration/Expansion relations NON-ELABORATION/EXPANSION is the residual class consisting of a heterogeneous set of rhetorical relations (CIR-CUMSTANCE, PURPOSE, CONDITION, ANTITHESIS, CONCESSION) but excluding ATTRIBUTION. The data in the first column clearly supports the general observation that this type of relations predominate in discourse, with ELABORATION/EXPANSION relations out-numbering NON-ELABORATION/EXPANSION relations by a considerable ratio of 73% to 27%. In the PDTB, EXPANSION belongs to the ELABORATION/EXPANSION group, and the remaining three types (TEMPORAL, CONTINGENCY and COMPARISON) fall into the NON-ELABORATION/EXPANSION type. The numbers from the PDTB however show a striking paradox relative to the numbers seen in the first column of Table 6 for the RST. Here, ELABORATION/EXPANSION relations account for only 9.1% of parentheticals extracted, whereas the residual NON-ELABORATION/EXPANSION category makes up a much larger 90.9%. How do we account for the discrepancy in the ELABORATION/EXPANSION numbers between the RST and the PDTB? The key to answering this question is to recognize that discourse relations are manifested syntactically in two different ways: i) a relation between an object and a proposition is realized through some NP-modification structure; and ii) relations between two full-fledged propositions are realized through S- or VP-modification. As we have noted for the RST (see Table 2), the distinction between ELABORATION/EXPANSION and NON-ELABORATION/EXPANSION parentheticals correspond quite neatly to these two syntactic types. ELABORATION/EXPANSION parentheticals are mostly postmodifiers of a nominal object in the host whereas NON-ELABORATION/EXPANSION parentheticals are mostly instantiated as some VP or S modification of their clausal hosts. The PDTB takes a different approach to discourse annotation in that it recognizes only relations between two propositions, or more generally, two abstract objects (Asher, 1993), the kinds likely to be syntactically instantiated as VP- or S-modification.4","Given our observations that ELABORATION/EXPANSION parentheticals occur mostly as NP-modifiers, it follows straightforwardly that we should find a much lower number of such relations in the PDTB, since these types would not have been annotated. A follow-up question naturally arises: why is there such a paucity of ELABORATION/EXPANSION type parentheticals manifested as S- or VP-modifiers? As we noted previously, S- or VP-modifier structures involve a relation between two clausal elements. The kind of ELABORATION/EXPANSION relations which would involve two clauses are overwhelmingly of the conjunctive kind - which would be relations marked by a cue phrase such as and in the PDTB, or treated as JOINT or LIST type relations in the RST. But such conjunctive relations are quite incompatible with a parenthetical structure. By definition, parentheticals are used to express less salient material in the discourse and therefore are used when one argument (the parenthetical) is of less importance than the other (the host). NP-modifier structures such as relative clauses are particularly suitable for express-ing such relations. On the other hand, paratactic structures such as conjunction usually require the conjoining of two equally prominent sister nodes, and it is unusual, if not quite impossible, to nest one clausal conjunct within another. Hence, we would not expect to find conjunctions expressed as parentheticals.5 In fact, of the parentheticals extracted from the RST, none are of the paratactic JOINT or LIST type. And the handful of ELABORATION/EXPANSION parentheticals that we do encounter in the PDTB are of a more complex and rare syntactic nature, a nuance that is only hinted at by the annotations. (7) shows one such parenthetical (shown in italics).","(7) a Some may have forgotten - and some younger ones may never have experienced - what it’s like to invest during a recession. (wsj1623) In this case, there is a more complex process of constituentsharing than is indicated by the annotations. We have a clausal object (“what it’s like to invest during a recession”), which is associated by the annotator only with the host (“Some may have forgotten”) but not with the parenthetical (“and some younger ones may never have experienced”). But the clausal object is clearly linked to both the parenthetical and the host, so what we have here is a complex conjunction structure where two non-constituent NP(SUBJ)+verb are conjoined and this unusual conjunction shares a common NP(OBJ). This is quite possibly a borderline case of parenthetical although the annotation (and the dashes in the text) do suggest it. The discourse annotation of NP-modifier type ELABORATION/EXPANSION relations in the RST is also not without","4","The corpus does contain annotations of entity-based coherence through a category called Entity Relations (EntRel). Nevertheless, EntRels do not correspond to the Object-Proposition type relations found e.g., in relative clauses and annotated in the RST as discourse relations.","5","This property of parentheticals has been discussed for example by (Scott and Souza, 1990)"]},{"title":"2673","paragraphs":["issues. If a proposition is related only to some nominal object in a higher clause, a reasonable annotation strategy would be to simply link the parenthetical to the relevant nominal phrase. However, the segmentation of discourse units is not done at this level of granularity, so by conven-tion, the host sentence is split up into two halves and nominal postmodifiers are linked to the part of the host containing the nominal phrase. Therefore, structurally at the discourse level, real cases of S- or VP-modifier relations, where two propositions are actually related, become virtually indistinguishable from NP-modifier relations, where an entity and a proposition are related. The only way to make this distinction is to sift through the various labels of rhetorical relations in the RST, and then falling back on the syntax to disambiguate them into NP-modifier or S-/VP-modifier types, as we have done. In sum, from a structural point of view, the RST conflates two discourse-level phenomena - NP-modifier vs S- or VP-modifier types of relations - into one, whereas the PDTB recognizes the distinction but only annotates one of them! 5.2. Location and Distribution of Cue Phrases Cue phrases are the most salient indicators of discourse relations in a piece of text. Therefore, to better understand the behavior of parentheticals in discourse, we also need to understand the characteristic behavior of cue phrases in this context. A corpus like the PDTB is most useful for such an endeavour. Here, cue phrases - known as discourse connectives - are taken to be discourse-level predicates which lexically anchor discourse relations. In other words, much of the annotation took place when there was an explicit discourse connective which signalled the presence of a discourse relation. The examples extracted for this study, in fact, were all discourse relations anchored by a lexicalized connective. But there is a striking imbalance in the distribution of the data. As seen in Table 4, out of 219 parentheticals extracted from the corpus, 207 were cases of Arg2-parentheticals, i.e., contained a discourse connective within the parenthetical. Type of Connective Arg1-Parenth. Arg2-Parenth.

To answer this question, we note that there are two main grammatical types of discourse connectives which appear within parentheticals: i) subordinating conjunctions (e.g. while, because, since); and ii) adverbials (instead, however, meanwhile). Interestingly, the overwhelming majority of the pervasive Arg2-Parenthetical type are cases where Arg2 contains a subordinating conjunction (205 tokens out of 207, see Table 7). Subordinating conjunctions in fact never co-occur with Arg1 Parentheticals. In addition, discourse adverbials, even though they may appear in both Arg1- and Arg2-Parentheticals (12 and 2 times respectively), are comparatively rare and their infrequency means that they do not affect the skewered distribution seen in Table 7. It appears then that subordinating conjunctions are the most “conducive” to parentheticals. This makes sense when we consider the grammatical nature of these connectives - a subordinating conjunction introduces an S-BAR subordinate clause (the parenthetical) which is structurally integrated into the matrix clause (the host). This structural integration provides for a number of structural transformations, including moving the subordinated clause medially or initially, which would otherwise not be possible. A parenthetical construction is “born” essentially when the subordinate clause is moved medially. Since Arg2 is the clause containing the connective (the subordinating conjunction), these would be Arg2-parentheticals. The converse does not hold however: to obtain Arg1 parentheticals when Arg2 contains the subordinating conjunction, the Arg2 subordinate clause would have to be split into two and then be transformed in such a way that it winds up nesting the Arg1 matrix clause, a completely unheard of structural transformation. The case with discourse adverbials is more complex. Syntactically, an adverbial clause is not necessarily structurally integrated into a matrix clause in a subordinated structure but in most cases it introduces an independent new sentence. The relation of the discourse adverbial to a preced-ing Arg1 argument is therefore not syntactic, as was the case with subordinating conjunctions. In fact, (Webber et al., 2003) argue that the adverbial is anaphoric instead of structural, the notion being that the adverbial contains some integrated deictic particle which refers back to a preced-ing discourse argument. In other words, the discourse argument containing the adverbial (Arg2) needs to linearly precede the other argument (Arg1). This anaphoric property of discourse adverbials reduces the space of structural configurations that would be compatible with parenthetical constructions, as illustrated in Table 8. The first configuration (row i) shows the canonical non-parenthetical pattern, where Arg2 containing the adverbial simply follows Arg1. Among the parenthetical configurations, there is only one possible configuration of Arg2-Parentheticals (row ii). This configuration is rarely encountered, possibly because the adverbial here only refers to the first portion of its Arg1 an-tecedent (ARG1a) and not the entire Arg1 clause (ARG1a + ARG1b). Among the Arg1-Parentheticals, one of the configurations (Table 8, row iii) is impossible , since the adverbial here does not precede ARG1 at all. This leaves only the option in row iv) where the adverbial points to the nested ARG1 parenthetical.","Configuration Parenthetical Type Observations i) ARG1 ARG2+adv Not Parenthetical Common ii) ARG1a ARG2+adv ARG1b Arg2-Parenthetical Rare iii) ARG2a+adv ARG1 ARG2b Arg1-Parenthetical Impossible iv) ARG2a ARG1 ARG2b+adv Arg1-Parenthetical Possible Table 8: Configurations involving discourse adverbials. 6 An analysis of the location of cue phrases is more difficult with the RST corpus, since the corpus does not distinguish between relations containing cue phrases and those that do not. However, we have reliable information for the parentheticals extracted from the RST to make another observa-"]},{"title":"2674","paragraphs":["tion about the behavior of cue phrases: S- or VP-modifier type parentheticals tend to contain cue phrases, whereas NP-modifier parentheticals do not. From Table 2, we can see that a large majority of VP- or S-modifier parentheticals fall into the following syntactic types: cue+S, to-infinitive (where the “to” might be treated as a shortened form of the purpose cue-phrase “in order to”), cue+N, cue+Adj, cue+participial. NP-modifiers are mostly relative clauses, participial clauses, NPs, PPs or S’s. In sum, the combined use of the PDTB and the RST tells us quite a bit about the location of cue phrases: they generally occur with the parenthetical and not the host, and they appear with parentheticals which are VP- or S-modifiers. As a side rule, we could also surmise that generally these cue phrases are subordinating conjunctions. Discourse adverbial cue phrases might be more likely to appear in the host sentence, but the data is sparse and further study would be needed to understand the behavior of adverbials with parentheticals. 5.3. On the Generation of Parentheticals Our corpus study provides information to design a generation strategy for several types of parenthetical constructions. The overwhelming majority of parentheticals annotated in the two corpora are syntactically related to their host sentences. We only found 9 examples of interpola-tions in the RST that consist of full sentences and in the PDTB, the 12 cases of Arg1-parentheticals containing discourse adverbs are the only ones that can perhaps be in-cluded in this category. A generator should therefore focus more on parentheticals that are syntactically related to their host. There are two main groups of syntactically related parentheticals. The more popular group, ELABORATION/EXPANSION- type parentheticals should be generated most frequently, using syntactic constructions such as relative clauses, nominal postmodifiers with non-finite clauses and NPs. No cue phrases or discourse connectives should be generated in these cases. Conjunctive or paratactic types within the ELABORATION/EXPANSION group should also be avoided. The other group, NON-ELABORATION/EXPANSION-type parentheticals should be generated less frequently and should always involve the use of a cue phrase. The syntactic types used for this group should be subordinate clauses, to-infinitives and perhaps PPs. Assuming that the distribution of rhetorical relations in the input of the generator is similar to the distribution of rhetorical relations in our two corpora, the numbers in Table 3 should give an indication as to how often to realize each type of relation as a parenthetical. There are several types of parentheticals that the present corpus study is missing because of the nature of the annotation guidelines of the corpora used. For example, in the RST corpus phrasal expressions beginning with prepositions or connectives that have ambiguous discourse cues are not segmented as EDUs (8a), and neither are reduced relative clauses that contain an adjective without a verbal element (8b):","(8) a But the technology, [while reliable,] is far slower than the widely used hard drives.

(wsj1161) We expect that these constructions will behave similarly to subordinating conjunctions and relative clauses respectively. This hypothesis could be confirmed by incorporat-ing these non-annotated constructions into the grammar of an NLG system according to the strategy described above, and evaluating the output of the system."]},{"title":"6.
