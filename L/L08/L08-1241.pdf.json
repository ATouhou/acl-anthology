We designed a tagset specific to Hebrew while focusing on four aspects: the tagset should be consistent with common linguistic knowledge; there should be maximal agreement among taggers as to the tags assigned to maintain consistency; the tagset should be useful for machine taggers and learning algorithms; and the tagset should be effective for applications relying on the tags as input features. In this paper, we illustrate these issues by explaining our decision to introduce a tag for beinoni forms in Hebrew. We explain how this tag is defined, and how it helped us improve manual tagging accuracy to a high-level, while improving automatic tagging and helping in the task of syntactic chunking."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["This paper discusses decisions taken during our work in establishing a tagset for Hebrew. The method we adopted for this purpose aims to find a tagset that maximizes agreement among taggers but maintains maximal consistency with morphological characteristics of the words, and consequently with traditional perceptions of syntactic, semantic and lexical resources. One of the main issues relevant when tagging Semitic languages is that the orthographic form of words allows for agglutination of prefixes and suffixes into a single token. Taggers for Hebrew as described in Adler and Elhadad (2006) assume a word-based model, the tagset we will design must consequently be word-oriented – that is, we expect the tags to describe full words as opposed to separate morphemes. In this paper, we focus on the case of beinoni1","forms in Hebrew. The issue is how beinoni should be tagged. We consider three main approaches: treat beinoni (participle) forms as either verbs, nouns and adjectives according to the context; treat beinoni forms as verbs; or – the approach we adopt – add a participle tag to the tagset. Existing lexical resources do not include such a participle category. We show that these resources exhibit high disagreement on the POS they predict for beinoni forms, which causes inconsistencies in tagging. In contrast, using the guidelines we designed, taggers achieved a very high level of agreement. We also discuss how the presence of the participle tag affects tasks that depend on the tagged corpus, such as syntactic chunking."]},{"title":"2. Corpus and Tagging Process","paragraphs":["In recent years, two large-scale computational resources have been developed for Hebrew as part of the Hebrew Knowledge Center initiative: a corpus compiled and manually tagged at Ben Gurion University, and the Hebrew Treebank generated at the Technion (Sima’an et al., 2001). Tagging in the treebank project is syntax-oriented, while in the","1","We use the Hebrew beinoni instead of the English term participle since the correlation and definition of these types in the two languages is not exact. However, if not otherwise stated, we may use these terms interchangebly within this paper. tagged corpus we describe here, the approach is lexicon-oriented: a lexicon of Hebrew words proposes for each word a list of possible tags, and the tagged corpus indicates the correct tag in context. One of the main objectives we assigned to ourselves while developing this corpus, was to design a specific tagset appropriate for Hebrew. We did not assume a priori that an existing tagset (adopted from English or from traditional dictionaries) would be appropriate to fulfil the requirements on a high-quality computational corpus. Our first objective is to maximize agreement among human taggers, in order to ensure consistency of the tagged corpus. However, agreement among taggers cannot be our only criterion for tagset quality, otherwise the trivial tagset of one tag (WORD) would be optimal – but non-informative. Most meaning-carrying words belong to one of the main three categories (verbs, nouns and adjectives). Taggers achieved above 70% agreement (between 4 people) on the very first training round while focusing on these three base categories. In a minimalistic approach, we would adopt the following heuristic: define an OTHER category for all the words where no clear-cut agreement on a category can be reached (if a word is not a clear and well-behaved verb, noun or adjective - tag it as OTHER). We found that such a method did not increase agreement in any way. In addition, this approach would have also caused bad learning of a stochastic model of context. It is critical to model words such as prepositions or conjunctions to correctly disambiguate verbs or nouns. One of the main confusing factor we found among taggers was related to the status of what we call beinoni. The main reason is that the beinoni form (literally the “middle form” of verbs) is a form that shares morphological and syntactic properties of nouns, verbs and adjectives. We explain below our decision to introduce a distinct participle tag in the tagset, and present the guidelines we have designed to define it. Our corpus is comprised of short news stories. It includes about 40M tokens, in articles of length between 200 and 1,000 tokens. Of the full corpus, a sample of articles comprising altogether 200K tokens was assembled at random,"]},{"title":"3167","paragraphs":["and manually tagged for part of speech by four taggers (for details see Adler (2007, chapter 4)). An initial set of guidelines was first composed, relying on the categories found in several dictionaries and on the Penn treebank POS guidelines (Santorini, 1995). As many words from the corpus were either missing or tagged in a non uniform manner in the lexicons, we recommended looking up missing words in traditional dictionaries. However, disagreement was found in these dictionaries, among traditional dictionaries, both for open and closed set categories. Given the lack of a reliable lexicon, the taggers were not given a list of options to choose from, but were free to tag whatever tag they found suitable. Initially, each text was tagged by four people, and, iteratively, the guidelines were revised according to questions or disagreements that were raised. As the guidelines became more stable, the disagreement rate decreased, each text was tagged by three people only and eventually by two taggers and a referee that reviewed disagreements between the two. The disagreement rate between any two taggers was initially as high as 20%, and dropped to 3% after a few rounds of tagging and guidelines revision.

Major sources of disagreements include, preposition phrases, adverbial phrases, modals (Netzer et al., 2007) and beinoni. We focus in this paper on beinoni forms. Beside the disagreement among taggers, we also found significant disagreement among Modern Hebrew dictionaries. Table 1 lists the various selected POS tags for words we identify as beinoni form, as determined by: (1) Rav Milim (Choueka et al., 1997), (2) Sapir (2002), (3) Even-Shoshan (2003), (4) Knaani (1960), (5) HMA (Carmel and Maarek, 1999), (6) Segal (2000), (7) Yona (2004) and (8) the Hebrew Treebank (Sima’an et al., 2001). As can be seen, there is almost systematic confusion between Verb, Noun and Adjective tags for these words. We propose guidelines which remove this confusion, and allowed us to reach very high agreement among taggers. We also discuss how the new ‘participle’ tag we introduce is used by a syntactic chunker."]},{"title":"3. Previous Work","paragraphs":["The question of which tags should be used in a tagset goes back to early work on tagging corpora for computational purposes. The issues that guide and determine the design of a tagset may be purely linguistic or to the other extreme applicative. This distinction has strong connection to the method that is chosen to evaluate its quality. Tagging a corpus along with the development of a tagger may influence the tagset design in order to achieve better results and eliminate weak points of the tagger. The pioneering Brown Corpus was lexical-oriented, and its tagset was used as a baseline for many subsequent tagging projects. The Penn Treebank tagset was planned with a stochastic orientation and aimed to reduce redundancy, and therefore, elaborated the definition of tags to be less lexical and to carry less information that can be recovered automatically (e.g. past tense morphemes). In addition, tags with more general denotation are less bound to inconsistencies (e.g., compare a tagset with a single RB tag for all adverbs instead of tagset distinguishing RB and RN for nominal adverbs). The Penn Treebank tagging process was more syntactic and less lexical in nature, therefore, the same lexical item could be tagged differently in distinct syntactic contexts. In cases of disagreement among human annotators or where the POS was ambiguous, a word could be assigned more than one tag (Marcus et al., 1993). Many tagging projects were influenced by English tagsets, which were used as the starting point for design for other languages as well. However, such tagset adoption is not a straightforward matter, and different language-families require careful treatment. Van Mol (2002) presents the problems of tagging the Arabic language, where words can be used in more than one syntactic function (an adjective used as noun), or even two lexical categories (both noun and adjective for the same lexeme). As in Hebrew, beinoni in Arabic can be used as adjectives, nouns, even prepositions and verbs. The proposed method tends towards the syntactic direction, allowing a word to be tagged according to its specific syntactic functions. For the Hebrew Treebank project, the Penn Treebank tagset also served as a basis, however, due to the agglutinative and inflective morphological nature of Hebrew, complex tags (IN+PRP) were added and morphological features could be added to tags. The tagging approach of the Treebank was strictly syntactic, distinguishes for instance the tag CDT for numerals in determiner position and CD for other occurrences (Sima’an et al., 2001). As mentioned above, a tagset design is influenced by the purpose of the tagging process, and therefore, there are various possible measures to test quality. Dejean (2000) distinguishes between internal (i.e., the quality of the tagger) and external measures. External quality, means the extent to which it allows retrieval of all important grammatical distinction in the language (Sampson cited by Dejean), practically – this was tested by evaluating how a tagset supports effective syntactic parsing."]},{"title":"4. Hebrew beinoni","paragraphs":["As noted by the traditional Hebrew grammarian Gesenius (1976, p.355), the so-called beinoni form occupies a middle place between noun and verb. Morphologically, beinoni forms are simple nouns or adjectives, i.e., they carry gender, number, and status inflections, prefixation, definite-ness, and no person and tense/mood inflections. From the semantic point of view, according to traditional descriptions, Hebrew beinoni forms do not denote a fixed state, but activities, in contrast to nouns and adjectives.

A Lexical Category for beinoni","paragraphs":["We are interested in the classification of the above beinoni forms. Rosen (1977, pp.106–107) argues for a participle category, which covers the participle and present verb forms. Blao (1966, p.186), on the other hand, treats the participle forms as either noun, adjective or verbs. A similar disagreement is found among modern analyzers: Rav Milim and Yona have no participle category, i.e., all the verbal interpretations are classified as verbs with a beinoni tense, which is the tense of the present forms as well, e.g., םילגלוגמ ,םירמוש šomrim, mgulgalim (are guarding, are being rolled). Participles are classified in the lexicon into three categories: (1) ‘exclusively’ nouns/adjectives, with no possible verbal analysis, e.g., רפוס ,דמולמ ,רופת tapur, mlumad, soper (sewn, scholarly, writer), (2) nouns and adjectives, which have a verbal interpretation as well, e.g., לבחמ ,רמוש ,לגלוגמ mgulgal, šomer (rolled/is rolled, guard/guards, terrorists/sabotages), (3) exclusively verbal forms, e.g., ףרחמ ,רפוס ,רדושמ is broadcast, counts, curses. The Hebrew Knowledge Center morphological analyzer3 (hereafter KC analyzer) defines a participle category, generally composed of the beinoni tense verbs of Rav Milim and Yona. This categorization decision is related to several issues: can the list of nouns and adjectives in the lexicon be extended by all participle forms? What is the correct reading of the ה h prefix of the above beinoni forms: definite article or relativizer/subordinate conjunction (see Rosen (1977, pp.107, footnote 92))? Is there a conceptual difference between participle tense and present tense? Is there a hidden person mark for present and participle verbs? How do participles relate to generics formation in Hebrew? In our analysis, we conclude that a distinct participle category should be defined. In contrast to the KC analyzer, we propose that present verbs should be assigned to the verb category, and distinguished from participles. 5.1.

The same surface form (beinoni) can be used as a noun/adjective or as a present verb. How can we distinguish between these two usage types? Present verb usages are bound to present tense, while noun/adjective can occur in any tense context. Aspect is not relevant to this distinction – beinoni in verbal usage can denote both progressive and simple tenses (in contrast to the English present participle which is bound to the progressive aspect). The following examples indicate simple syntactic tests that distinguish between verbal and noun/adjective usages:","(2) וישכע םינמאתמ םילייחה [verbal usage: *לומתא םינמאתמ םילייחה present progressive] hah. ayalim mit’amnim ‘akšaw *hah. ayalim mit’amnim ’etmol the-soldiers that-are-training now *the-soldiers that-are-training yesterday the soldiers that are training now *the soldiers that are training yesterday","(3) ולא םימיב םינמאתמ םילייחה [verbal usage: *םהה םימיב םינמאתמ םילייחה present simple] hah. ayalim mit’amnim byamim ’elu *hah. ayalim mit’amnim bayamim hahem the-soldiers train at-days these *the-soldiers train at-days those the soldiers train these days *the soldiers train those days","(4) םיעיגמ םינמאתמ [nominal usage] ועיגה םינמאתמ mit’amnim magi‘im mit’amnim higi‘u training are-arriving training arrived trainees are arriving trainees arrived Shlonsky (1997, chapters 2-5) claims that verbal beinoni is a participle, and Hebrew has a null auxiliary. Shlonsky employs Chomsky’s government and binding approach in order to present tense sentences on a par with compound tense constructions – beinoni is a hybrid form, a verb whose agreement features are participial but raised to",". In spite of his elegant word-order and clause-structure analysis, we prefer, for our purpose, to avoid modeling syntactic movements, and formalize a definition which is based on the tokens as they appear in the text. Explicit Subject Noun/adjective usages do not require an explicit subject. Beinoni in verbal usages require an explicit subject, which can be absent from noun/adjective constructions, i.e., the token םיספטמ mt.apsim (climbers) in the phrase וקשוה םיספטמ mt.apsim hušqu (climbers were given water) can only be interpreted as a noun/verb usage but not as a present verb. 5.2.2.

Summary In summary, we recommend to introduce a distinct tag for beinoni forms specifically to avoid the systematic confusion that would otherwise occur between noun, adjective and verb tags.

The ambiguity level of the analyzer, i.e., the average number of analyses per token, was not significantly changed. Following Dejean (2000), we use Hebrew Simple NP chunking (Goldberg et al., 2006) as an external application on which to test our tagset. Chunking NPs is advantageous for this task as participles and NPs are closely related. Our chunks definition is based on that of Goldberg et.al.,(2006), with the exception that chunk boundaries are not allowed to break orthographic token boundaries. We trained 3 SVM-based chunking models (Goldberg et al., 2006; Kudo and Matsumato, 2000), each with a different tagset on the same data. We used the same feature set and SVM configuration for all models.5 The tagsets we used were: (1) all beinoni forms are tagged as Participle ( ), (2) beinoni forms are tagged as either Participle or Present Verb ( ) and (3) each beinoni form is tagged as either Noun, Verb or Adjective ( ). Looking at the train and test sets, the beinoni forms appear in less than 3% of the tokens. Of the beinoni forms, 90% are present-Verbs. This leaves about 50 non-Verbial beinoni forms and 297 Verbial beinoni forms in the test corpus. The resulting chunk accuracies (F) were: 91.09 ( ), 91.23 ( ), 91.31 ( ). While the number","5","We looked at a 5 morphemes window surrounding the word to be classified, and considered the lexical form, POS and construct-state information as features. We used a polynomial kernel of degree 2."]},{"title":"3173","paragraphs":["are very close to each other, our proposed tagset performs marginally better for this task. Considering the low count of beinoni occurences in the corpus, and the even lower count of non-verbal beinoni forms, one can not expect to achieve bigger improvements on an external task. The experiment verifies that distinguishing present-verbs from participles improves chunking, and that noun and adjectival uses of the beinoni form should be grouped together. The experiment verifies that our proposed tagset does not harm chunking performance, while being linguistically justified and greatly improving the agreement between human annotators."]},{"title":"8. Conclusion","paragraphs":["This paper illustrates the issues faced when designing a tagset for POS tagging for Hebrew. Our objectives are to ensure high consistency among human taggers, to offer adequate linguistic description, and to verify that the tagset allows us to perform precise machine learning for syntactic parsing. We specifically investigated the decision to introduce a distinct tag for beinoni forms in Hebrew. We have verified that with proper guidelines, and an adapted lexicon, this participle tag allowed us to reduce inconsistent manual tagging errors (increased internal tagging quality). From the linguistic point of view, we justify the addition of new lexical category - participle. In contrast to Rosen (1977) and the KC analyzer, our new category excludes present verbs. Although evaluation on chunking did not show significant improvement, it does verify that the addition of such category does not harm chunking. Besides linguistics arguments, practical considerations (e.g., the easiness of tagging, agreement among taggers and dictionaries) strongly support the usage of this category in the Hebrew tagset."]},{"title":"9.
