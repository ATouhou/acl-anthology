The lexicon was derived from the first and second NTCIR evaluation collections for research into cross-language information retrieval for Asian languages. While it can be utilized for translation between Japanese and English, the lexicon is also suitable for language research and language engineering. Since it is collection-derived, it contains instances of word variants and miss-spellings which make it eminently suitable for further research. For a subset of the lexicon we make available the collection statistics. In addition we make available a Katakana subset suitable for transliteration research."]},{"title":"1. NTCIR Cross-Language Retrieval","paragraphs":["NTCIR1","is a large evaluation initiative for Asian Language Search and Question Answering, currently in its Seventh evaluation. NTCIR is similar in scope to the TREC2","series of evaluations for English and to CLEF, the Cross Language Evaluation Forum3","a large European evaluation initiative dedicated to cross-language retrieval for European languages (Peters et al., 2007). NTCIR was developed to meet need for cross- and multi-lingual retrieval research specifically for East Asian languages (Chinese, Japanese and Korean). The first and second NTCIR Workshops utilized a collection of abstracts from the journal proceedings of 66 Japanese technical societies. As such, the NTCIR-1 and NTCIR-2 collections are the only evaluation resources available to test automatic retrieval of scientific and technical documents in Japanese. Further details about NTCIR-1 may be found in (Kando et al, 1999). Later NTCIR workshops utilized news collections from newspapers and newswire services and expanded the language scope to Japanese, Chinese and Korean. In this paper we are concerned with aspects of deriving a lexicon of technical terminology which can be utilized for both translation and language engineering for further research into finding technical content between the English and Japanese languages."]},{"title":"2.

The salient characteristic, however, of the collection is that 313,673 (92.3%) of the documents have author-assigned keywords in both Japanese and English. The following is an example of keywords assigned:  <KYWD TYPE=\"kanji\">画像センサ // コンピュテーショナルセンサ // 画像圧縮 // 画像符号化</KYWD> <KYWE TYPE=\"alpha\">Image Sensors // Computational Sensors // Image Compression // Image Coding</KYWE>  Because only slightly more than half the documents have English abstracts, pairing keywords may be more useful than the more complicated task of pairing sentences in documents (the usual approach of statistical machine translation) to align term pairs.

Thus if we had a keyword sequences: J1 // J2 // J3 // J4 // J5 and E1 // E2 // E3 // E4 // E5  In almost all cases we would find that Ji ≡ Ei. For some records, we found that the count of Japanese keywords differed from the count of English keywords. This occurred in 5.2% (16,289 records) of NTCIR-1 documents with both English and Japanese keywords present and in 3.7% of NTCIR-2 gakkai documents with both language keywords present. For records with |KYWJ| = |KYWE| we simply extracted the corresponding keyword pairs and counted their number of occurrences in the collection.

As mentioned above there is considerably more diversity in subject of the documents in the collection; subjects are not grounded by ‘domain’ of a particular technical society as with the Gakkai collections. In addition their statistical characteristics differ, particularly with respect to equality of count of number of Japanese keywords matched to English keywords.

This called for examination of keyword sequencing. We found by manual examination that the keywords which were translations often did not occur in the same linear sequential order. The most reasonable approach to generating this lexicon has been to take the maximalist approach of matching each Japanese keyword with all English keywords assigned to that document. Thus if a document has 5 English and 7 Japanese keywords:  E1 E2 E3 E4 E5 J1 J2 J3 J4 J5 J6 J7  we construct 35 keyword pairs:  (E1,J1)(E1,J2) ... (E1,J7) (E2,J1)(E2,J2) ...  and proceed to accumulate collection statistics for each unique keyword pair according to the following 2-way contingency table: "]},{"title":"Count Jk ~Jk Ei a b ~Ei c d ","paragraphs":["The lexicon is distributed in the following formatted list of term pairs with counts: Jk Ei a b c d In this way the users of the Kakan lexicon can experiment with different measures of association such as Yates Chi Square (Yates, 1934) or Dunning’s log likelihood ratio (Dunning, 1994) to choose the most likely equivalence.

Lexicon Validation","paragraphs":["Lexicon validation is a complex topic. Rather than doing a manual examination by professional Japanese translators, we chose to see what could be obtained from matching against other available dictionaries. The second author of the paper had assembled a selection of 21 freely available Japanese English dictionaries. The dictionaries had a total of 1,033,244 entries. Some of these are specialized lexicons that cover life sciences, computer terminology, and so on. A program was written to look up each Japanese term in all the dictionaries, and records when it finds a match. A match is an exact string match on the Japanese term. If the Japanese term is hiragana only, matches are also performed over the kana readings of dictionary terms. The summary below gives some information on how many terms were found and the weights of those terms. Nothing was done to automatically validate whether the matched translation from the lookup is valid (using, for example, a check whether the English is a complete substring of one of the translations – although that information is presented in Table 5) Such a check would be possible, but of course there are many translations that would be judged as incorrect despite being valid, or incorrectly marked valid when the English is only a small substring of a more complex translation. In addition to counting raw hits of an English term in the dictionaries, a term weighting by frequency scheme was also utilized to compensate for the frequency counts of the lexicon term. For the three lexicons, we had, respectively:  NTCIR-1: unique terms: 598,424, total weights of terms: 1,314,161 number of dictionary hits:121, 032 (0.20225124) number of misses: 477,392 (0.79774874) weighted hits: 502,547 (0.382409) weighted misses: 811,614 (0.617591)  NTCIR-2 gakkai: unique terms: 172,400 weights of terms: 312,922 number of dictionary hits: 41,311 (0.23962297) number of misses: 131,089 (0.76037705) weighted hits: 119,763 (0.38272476) weighted misses: 193,159 (0.61727524)  NTCIR-2 kaken: Unique terms: 238,819 weights of terms: 331,900 number of hits: 59,370 (0.2485983) number of misses: 179,449 (0.75140166) weighted hits: 121,490 (0.36604398) weighted misses: 210,410 (0.633956)  We also created three sample files of approximately 1000 J-E term pairs. The sample was stratified by frequency in order to obtain a larger sample for low-frequency term pairs. Thus we selected 100 pairs for frequency count >4, 100 pairs for frequencies = 3 or 4, 200 pairs for frequency 2 and 500 pairs for frequency 1.  For comparison, the same dictionary match was run for the NTCIR-1 sample with the following results:  NTCIR-1 sample: uniqueTerms: 1000 weights of terms: 3212 number of hits: 229 (0.229) number of misses: 771 (0.771) weighted hits: 1062 (0.33063513) weighted misses: 2150 (0.66936487)  If you compare this with the complete collection match statistics above, we find that the sample overestimates the raw number of hits and underestimates the number of weighted hits for this collection.  The CJK Dictionary Institute4","volunteered to automatically match the sample terms against their technical dictionary. Their results were  163 (Japanese and English found in cjkiterm) 227 (Japanese found in cjkiterm with different English) 208 (English found in cjkiterm with different Japanese) 478 (Japanese, English not found)  We will be reviewing these results with CJKI.  Table 5 shows the number of Japanese terms that were found in the dictionary lookup and the number of instances where the English term was found as a substring of the translation. As expected, the percentage of English terms in the lexicon that are found as substrings in the dictionaries increases with the frequency of the observed JA-EN term pair. A matched English substring in the dictionary translation is a likely indication of a good translation.
