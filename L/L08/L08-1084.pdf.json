The method relied on a Wizard of Oz scenario-based induction of varying affective states. The subjects were interacting with a supposedly voice-recognition driven computer application using simple command words. Audio and video signals were captured for the 7 recorded subjects. After the experiment, the subjects watched the video recording of their session and labelled the recorded corpus themselves, freely describing the evolution of their affective states. The obtained labels were later classified into one of the following broad emotional categories: satisfaction, dislike, stress, or other. A listening test was performed by 25 naïve listeners in order to validate the category labels originating from the self-labelling. For 52 of the 149 stimuli, listeners’ judgements of the emotional content were in agreement with the labels. The result of the listening test was compared with an earlier test validating a part of the French corpus. While the French test had a higher success ratio, validating the labels of 79 tested stimuli, out of the 193, the stimuli validated by the two tests can form the basis of cross linguistic comparison experiments.

Introduction","paragraphs":["Recent experiments on expressive speech synthesis and recognition for Hungarian (Zainkó et al., 2007; Tóth et al., 2007; Fék et al., 2005; Zainkó et al., 2006) used solely acted speech corpora. The use of acted speech allows great control over the type of emotions and the content of the utterances in the recorded speech corpus. Acted speech, on the other hand, can result in less authentic (e.g. exaggerated, overacted) expressions, unless the actor is using the technique of elicitation (Enos, 2006). Even in the latter case, acted speech may not rely on the same set of cues as spontaneous expressive speech. Therefore it is important to collect spontaneous data for a refined analysis of the cues conveying emotions and affect in speech.","Collecting spontaneous expressive speech data is difficult because of the lack of control over the quality of recordings, the emotions expressed, and the content of the utterances. To tackle these problems, a methodology for spontaneous expressive corpus collection was developed for the recording of a French corpus (Aubergé et al., 2004). The method relies on a Wizard of Oz scenario-based induction of varying affective states, designed and set up in lab using the dedicated software platform E-Wiz1",".","This paper presents a Hungarian multimodal spontaneous expressive speech corpus, recorded following the framework of the French E-Wiz corpus. As the recorded data is parallel to the French corpus, cross-cultural analyses can be performed in the future. In the following, we summarize the method of corpus collection for the French data, then, we describe the modifications of the setup for Hungarian recordings. A  1 http://www.icp.inpg.fr/EMOTION/EWiz/ listening test was performed to assess the emotions expressed in the collected speech material. We evaluate its results and compare them with the results of an earlier French listening test."]},{"title":"2. Collection of the French Corpus","paragraphs":["The method used for the recording of the French corpus relies on a Wizard of Oz scenario-based induction of varying affective states, designed and set up in lab using the dedicated software platform E-Wiz. Considering the expressions of affects in speech as shared between the 3 levels of (1) direct emotional expressions as a consequence of emotion-related physiological changes, (2) attitudinal expressions of social affects and (3) linguistic expressiveness (Aubergé, 2002), this corpus aimed at collecting more specifically expressions of direct emotions. This was achieved by allowing the recorded subjects to interact only with a computer application supposed to be voice-recognition driven, without the presence of anyone else in order to prevent subjects from producing social expressions of affects. Moreover the values of linguistic prosodic functions were also frozen by restraining the interaction in a major part of the corpus to a strict command language composed of French monosyllabic colour names ([bʁik], [ʒon], [ʁuʒ], [sabl] and [vɛʁ]), to which was added the command [paʒsчivãt] (next page). Another goal of the use of such a command language was to make possible further perceptive experimentations using the standard content paradigm and acoustic analyzes on standardized utterances.","The software was presented as a futuristic phonetic-learning tool called Sound Teacher and based on the perception-action theory findings that would enable subjects to easily produce vowels of foreign languages"]},{"title":"3483","paragraphs":["using their brain plasticity and needed to be further tested prior to its commercialization, and was indeed manipulated by the experimenter. After a training phase in which subjects could get familiar with phonetic characters and with the layout of the interface, most of the tasks consisted of discriminating a pair of synthetic audio stimuli visually highlighted in the acoustic space by telling the corresponding colour name. In addition of that, production tasks in which the subject had to pronounce vowels were performed at the beginning of each phase of the scenario, and subjects were regularly requested to give free comments. In order to induce positive emotional states to the subjects, their performances were presented in the first, deliberately easy, training phase as better than previous mean performances, and in the second phase as within the best 3 performances ever realized, allowing the subject to skip directly to the last and more complex phase. Negative induction was then performed by attributing very bad scores to the subjects, telling them that their skills for the perception of French might have been damaged by the software and had to be checked again. In this latter phase the synthetic audio stimuli were tuned to force subjects to answer randomly and give credit to the claim that their skills for perceiving the vowels of their mother tongue could have been perturbed.","Audio, video and bio-physiological signals were captured and synchronized for the 17 recorded subjects, including 7 actors who were asked to reproduce the utterances of the command language using their actors’ skills immediately after the recording. In addition of that the articulatory signal (EGG2",") was recorded for 2 subjects. Each recording session lasted around 45 minutes, the collected speech material in the spontaneous part consisted of 195 command language stimuli per speaker in average, as well as free comments.","The corpus was labelled by the recorded subjects themselves shortly after the recording session, in order to take advantage of the autobiographic memory accuracy for the recollection of emotional episodes (Aubergé et al., 2006). This labelling task was performed using the video recording and a spreadsheet with pre-filled times, but without additional instructions given to the subjects in order to let them freely describe the evolution of their affective state. Analysis of labels collected from the French corpus revealed that subjects tended to label expressions rather than felt emotions when they were not congruent with each other. Though reactions to the same induction differed according to subjects’ psychological profile, broad classes of reactions to the induction could be found, including satisfaction/amusement, stress/anxiety, irritation and boredom."]},{"title":"3. Collection of the Hungarian Corpus","paragraphs":["Linguistic adaptation of the E-Wiz platform was necessary before collecting data for the Hungarian corpus.  2 EGG: Electroglottograph, a non-invasive device of measuring vocal fold contact during voicing without affecting speech production. Most Hungarian colour names consist of more than one syllable, therefore we have chosen monosyllabic words as command words, whose meanings (e.g. grass, snow) could be easily associated with colors. The following words were used: [la:ng], [ho:], [fy:], [vɒj] and [ke:k], along with the [køvɛtkɛzø:oldɒl] (next page) command. Further, it was necessary to adapt the screen of the vowel recognition task to the Hungarian vowel system (Figure 1). An initial test showed that it was easy to forget the Hungarian command words, therefore we have explicitly indicated them on screen during each task.","  Figure 1. Screens showing the vowel recognition task in the French (top) and the Hungarian (bottom) version of","E-Wiz. ","The recording was performed in a soundproof room. The audio signal was captured by a condenser microphone mounted before the subject, and digitized at 44 kHz, using 16 bits per sample. The video signal was captured by an analogue Hi-8 camcorder and was digitized with a resolution of 384x288 pixels. In contrast to the French setup, the camera was hidden, a wider zoom angle was applied, and neither special lighting nor blue background was used (see Figure 2). The reason behind this decision was that the layout of the Hungarian soundproof room did not enable the filming of subjects under similar conditions.","The data was collected from 7 (1 male, 6 female) subjects. All of them were students of a phonetics course."]},{"title":"3484 ","paragraphs":["Figure 2. Video snapshots from the French (top) and Hungarian (bottom) database. ","Table 1 shows the mean number of utterances (per subject) collected in the French and Hungarian experiments. The Hungarian corpus contains less monosyllabic command words, because the reduced number of vowels (compared to the French vocalic system) allowed for fewer vowel discrimination tasks. The Hungarian subjects were less active in giving comments compared to the French subjects, which might be explained by their younger age and by cultural differences.","Similarly to the French corpus, the recorded subjects labelled themselves the recorded data. An initial analysis showed that the broad classes of reactions to the induction are similar to that found in the French corpus: satisfaction/amusement, stress/anxiety, irritation and boredom"]},{"title":"4. Listening Test","paragraphs":["We performed a perceptual test to assess the emotions expressed in the collected speech data and to create a subset in which emotions perceived by naïve listeners match the self-labelling.","The retained subset is meant to be used in a cross-linguistic evaluation together with French stimuli. Therefore the experimental design of the listening test for Hungarian data follows as much as possible the design of an earlier experiment evaluating the French data as a part of (Laukka et al., 2007).","The methodology of the two tests differed in some respects, however, which makes the direct statistic comparison of the results infeasible. We will report individual analyses and discuss the possible reasons explaining the differences in the outcome of the two experiments.",".","Per subject mean","values French Hungarian # of ‘next page’ utterances 54 54 #of monosyllabic command words 141 98 # of vowels 35 34 # of comments 20 7","","Table 1. Mean number of utterances per subject in the","French and Hungarian databases","","The French test used the productions of 6 (3 male and 3 female) of the 17 recorded speakers. All 6 speakers were actors who were asked, immediately after having participated in the Wizard of Oz experiment, to portray expressions of the same affects they had just been feeling. In addition, the actors were asked to portray expressions of six basic emotions still using the same utterances (French colour names and “next page”). Both the acted and the spontaneous stimuli were included in the listening test, but we will only report here the results obtained for the non-acted stimuli.","The self-reports of the 6 subjects were classified by the authors into four broad categories: anger, fear, joy, and other. These categories were intended to be suitable for both spontaneous and acted stimuli, of which the acted stimuli were supposed to express stronger emotions. A subsequent expert listening was performed by the authors where a set of 246 stimuli was selected consisting of 146 spontaneous and 100 acted stimuli. The goal of this selection was to retain a number of stimuli that can be considered as good exemplars of each emotion class, with as much variation as possible in activation level and prosodic morphology.","The selected 246 stimuli were evaluated by 15 French speaking naïve listeners (8 male and 7 female, mean age = 29.8 years), who were allowed to listen to the stimuli as many times as they wanted and had to select one of 3 emotion classes: anger, fear, or joy, or an “other emotion” label. The listeners received a detailed explanation on how they should interpret the broad classes of anger, fear and joy. Examples of emotions that should be considered to belong to the broad classes were also given. For example, they were told that “fear” could designate any phenomenon ranging from anxiety or stress to terror or panic. Moreover, the listeners were asked to rate the perceived emotion intensity of each stimulus using a scale ranging from 0 (very weak intensity) to 10 (very strong intensity). Stimuli were presented in a different"]},{"title":"3485","paragraphs":["random order to each listener. The presentation and the recording of the answers were automated using a graphical interface.","The Hungarian listening test included recordings from all the 7 subjects (1 male, 6 female) participating in the experiment. The self-reports given by the subjects were not as easily interpretable as the French ones. The reports of three subjects were partially incomplete, and one of the subjects misinterpreted the task and mostly reported his thoughts instead of his feelings. Moreover, some of the reports included ambiguous descriptions of emotional states.","The quality difference of the French and Hungarian self-reports may be explained by the younger age of the Hungarian participants compared to the French ones, and by the supposed expert knowledge of the French actors regarding their own emotions. The accuracy difference between self-reports given by actors vs. non-actors was not systematically evaluated, and the number of recorded speakers does not allow us to draw strong conclusions. However, the majority of actors recorded in the French corpus seem to have indeed provided self-labels easier to interpret than non-actors.","In order to make a first selection of a reasonable number of stimuli to be included in the Hungarian listening test, a pre-test was performed by 4 listeners who volunteered to evaluate all the 962 stimuli consisting of monosyllabic words and ‘next page’ utterances, independently of self-reports. The stimuli were presented in a different random order to each listener. The listeners had to select one of the following labels best describing the perceived emotion for each stimulus: satisfaction, dislike, stress, feeling low, boredom, determination, uncertainty, or “other emotion”. During the subsequent evaluation “boredom” answers were incorporated into the “dislike” category, while “uncertainty” answers were merged into the “stress” category. Next, stimuli for which the answers of at least 3 listeners were in agreement were selected, and they were labelled according to the selected category. Finally, 149 stimuli labelled as “satisfaction”, “dislike” or “stress” were retained for the subsequent test.","The 149 pre-selected stimuli were evaluated by 25 Hungarian native speakers (8 male and 17 female, mean age = 25.8 years) in a second listening test. The test was performed using the (translated) graphical interface applied in the French 15-listener test. The broad category labels used in the French test were changed here to “satisfaction”, “dislike” and “stress”, according to the labels used in the pre-selection. These labels were considered to better represent weak or mild expressions, that were expected to be found in the spontaneous stimuli, than the stronger labels used in the French test. It allowed us to give less complicated explanations to the listeners, decreasing the possibility of confusion. The listeners, similarly to the French test, were instructed to consider the labels as broad categories representing a range of emotions. The 10-point intensity scale was replaced by a 100-point (practically continuous) scale, with labels at 15, 50, and 85 indicating “mild”, ”medium”, and ”strong” respectively.","The self-reports corresponding to the 149 selected stimuli were carefully evaluated by the authors and classified into one of the following 5 categories: “satisfaction”, “dislike”, “stress”, “other”, or “no data”. 103 of the 149 stimuli were labelled as satisfaction, dislike, or stress. Only these 103 stimuli are analyzed in the Results section."]},{"title":"5.

The overall mean intensity values (French: 34, Hungarian: 45) calculated for all stimuli differ in the two experiments.

Discussion","paragraphs":["The shortcomings of the Hungarian self-evaluations can in part explain why the French experiment produced more validated stimuli. We examined the non-validated stimuli in an informal post-test listening to seek for further explanations. We have found, that although utterances labelled as ”dislike” by a particular speaker seemed to be easily recognizable when compared to the expressions of satisfaction by the same speaker, those utterances were largely perceived as dislike when presented alone. We have also noticed that some of the Hungarian stimuli which were labelled as “dislike” (or “stress”) based on the self-reports but were recognized as “stress” (or “dislike”) could be considered as acceptable expressions for both emotion categories. This might be an explanation to the weaker perceptual separation between these two categories, and therefore to the lesser number of stimuli expressing stress or dislike validated in the Hungarian data."]},{"title":"7.
