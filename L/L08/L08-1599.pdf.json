The first step in our work is the selection of the most significant frames in the English FrameNet according to a representative medical corpus. These frames were subsequently attached to different EuroWordNet synsets and translated into Spanish. Results show how the translation was made with high accuracy (95.9 % of correct words). In addition to that, the original English lexical units were augmented with new units by 120%  "]},{"title":"1. Introduction ","paragraphs":["Most lexical semantic resources have been created for English. This is mainly because most modern approaches to computational lexical semantics emerged in the United States. Some of these projects have been subsequently extended to other languages; however in all cases this requires a big human effort and time to create them. Transferring linguistic information automatically is therefore an attractive possibility to extend such resources to other languages.","FrameNet is a free on-line resource based on frame semantics and supported by corpus evidence (Ruppenhofer et al., 2006). It documents a range of different situations or frames and the list of lexical units that account for such frames in English. Frames are information packets about how to put across and understand information about a certain situation. Currently it covers 10195 different words in 795 different frames (approx. 14.14 per frame). The special conformation of FrameNet allows creating similar resources for other languages by maintaining the structural organization."]},{"title":"2. Approach ","paragraphs":["If the list of words of a certain language is limited, then the frames that are supported by them must be limited, too. However, the number of topics that human beings can talk about is unlimited; therefore frames combine with each other in our daily speech to convey information: medicine, politics, family, etc.","In addition to that, Frames can be described in terms of a variety of EuroWordNet concepts. EuroWordNet (Vossen, 1998) is a multilingual database like WordNet for several European languages (Dutch, Italian, Spanish, German, French, Czech and Estonian). Words are divided into nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs and sorted into groups representing concepts (called synsets). Each WordNet represents a unique language-internal system of lexicalizations linked on the Princeton WordNet used as Inter-Lingual index. This allows for the use of the database in multilingual information retrieval. Table 1 shows the synsets attached to unit cold.n of the FrameNet frame Medical_condictions:","","SYNSET","ID SYNSET IN ENGLISH SYNSET IN SPANISH 10174608n cold.n common_cold.n respiratory_desease resfriado resfriado_ común 04422784n cold.n coldness.n frialdad frío 03916773n  cold.n coldness.n low_temperature.n frío temperatura_ baja","Table 1: Lexical unit cold.n in EuroWordNet and","synset equivalences in Spanish","","From among them, 10174608n represents a concept depicted by the situation Medical_condictions. Assuming that every FrameNet trigger could be attached to a certain synset, equivalences could be used to obtain the triggers that support such a frame in a target language.","According to Yarowsky (1995), the meaning of words in a specific text is consistent and uniform, that is, polysemous word usually reflect only one sense in a certain document. Moreover, words semantically close to the general subject of the document have a significant distribution. Our approach takes advantage of this by selecting the frames and synsets that co-occur in a particular document and interconnecting them."]},{"title":"3. Data Set ","paragraphs":["The exploitation of a representative medical corpus allowed us to study the real use of language in this"]},{"title":"1470","paragraphs":["domain. A corpus of around 7 million tokens and 90.000 different lemmas was obtained from several on-line resources:","medlineplus.gov, a website on health information from the National Library of Medicine in the US, the world’s largest medical library","familydoctor.org, a web site about health information that is operated by the American Academy of Family Physicians, a US-based medical organization representing family physicians and medical students","www.umm.edu, the website of the University of Maryland Medical Center, including general information about diseases and treatments","All the XML and HTML tags were removed and the resulting text was analyzed with TreeTagger1",". Once the corpus was annotated with part-of-speech, lemma frequencies were counted, which provided us with information on the distribution of lexical triggers for FrameNet frames in the medical corpus."]},{"title":"4. Processing 4.1. Frame Selection ","paragraphs":["The selection of medical-oriented frames was conducted over t-test. It was tested for each set of frame triggers if the distribution that they have in our medical corpus was compatible with the distribution they have in the British National Corpus (Burnard, 2007). Only triggers occurring in the medical corpus were computed and frames with only one element like Studying: study.v or Try_defendant: try.v were taken out. Every frame group was checked at 99.5 percent significance level and the ones statistically significant were chosen. A set of 35 different frames was selected."]},{"title":"4.2. Lexical Trigger Disambiguation ","paragraphs":["There were 35 different frames and 881 triggers to be disambiguated. 79 of these triggers (8.9%) were not present in EuroWordNet. The process of disambiguation was similar to the selection of frames. Firstly, each trigger was attached to all synsets in which it shows up and subsequently every synset was tested over a Statistical Hypothesis Testing. The most appropriate synset must be statiscally significant (medical frames must be related with medical synsets). If the synset was composed of one term we used chi-square and if more than one, we used T-test, both at 99.5 percent significance level and by using the British National Corpus as reference corpus. Synsets attached to a trigger that were not statiscally significant over the Statistical Hypothesis Testing were detached from the trigger. If none of the synsets were statiscally significant, we keep all of them matched to the trigger. On the other hand, if all of them were statiscally significant, we kept all of them attached, too. A certain word had been completely disambiguated if we got an only synset attached to the trigger.","EuroWordNet lexical information was used to extend the number of terms in the synset tested and to improve results.

Conclusions and Future Work ","paragraphs":["EuroWordNet has been the key element in all of the","tasks in our approach: ","• In the frame selection by extending each frame group of triggers with new terms.","• In the matching of triggers with synsets by augmenting the range of concepts with new words.","• In the translation of the English FrameNet triggers into Spanish. It provides translational equivalences among languages.","","This approach not only provides us with a reliable way to transfer FrameNet triggers to other languages, but also with the match from FrameNet to (Euro)WordNet. WordNet provides a rich list of semantic relations (synonyms, hypernym, hyponym, roles, etc.) along with information about thematic roles that could be added to FrameNet. FrameNet frames coverage could be augmented by using the synonyms that WordNet provides.","We are planning to extend the translation to all FrameNet frames. Since our approach is corpus-based, the matching from triggers to WordNet synsets will be supported by texts with different topics. We hope this provide us with an accurate translation of all FrameNet English lexical triggers into other languages."]},{"title":"7.
