The success rate of 96.53% for the automatic import of the temporal annotation from English to Romanian shows that the automatic transfer is a worth doing enterprise if temporality is to be studied in another language than the one for which TimeML, the annotation standard used, was developed. A preliminary study identifies the main situations that occurred during the automatic transfer, as well as temporal elements not (yet) marked in the English corpus. "]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["Recently the focus on temporal information in NLP applications has increased (Mani et al., 2005), because this kind of information is useful in question-answering, information extraction or information retrieval, topic detection and tracking, machine translation, linguistic investigation, summarization, and discourse processing. The temporal elements explicitly present in NL are: − temporal expressions – references to a calendar or clock","system, expressed by NPs, PPs, or AdvPs − events – syntactically realized through sentences (their","syntactic head - the main verb), noun phrases, adjectives,","predicative clauses or prepositional phrases. Implicitly these temporal elements are linked so that the events can be positioned in time, either relatively with respect to other events or on an absolute time axis. The main objective of our study was to decide how well general temporal theories, developed mainly for English, can be applied to other languages – with emphasis on Romanian. Therefore we used the TimeBank 1.2. corpus (Pustejovsky et al., 2006), an English news corpus manually annotated and widely used in the temporal community together with TimeML the annotation standard (Sauri et al., 2006). These LRs are briefly described in section 2. Because the existing Romanian LRs do not support temporal annotation (Cristea & Forascu, 2006) and the manual temporal annotation is very time consuming, expensive (Pustejovsky et al., 2002) and error-prone, including for Romanian (Forascu & Solomon, 2004), we decided to translate the English TimeBank and then to use the help or back-up from the same annotation applied to a parallel text. The translation1",", preprocessing and alignment of the corpus are presented in section 3. In order to have linguistic evidence of how temporal information is really used in Romanian, as source of evidence to inform and substantiate the theory, we automatically imported the temporal annotation from  1 We thank to our reviewers for suggesting us to include more details and explanations on this subject. English to Romanian. Together with an evaluation of this import, we identified cases of English temporal elements not marked in the corpus, situation in line with the current status of the TimeBank corpus (Boguraev & Ando, 2006). These activities are described in section 4. The high success rate of the automatic import and the evaluation study shows that the import is a solution if the temporal information has to be studied based on linguistic evidence. The conclusions, as well as future work, are discussed in the last section."]},{"title":"2. Linguistic Resources used 2.1 The TimeML annotation standard","paragraphs":["The TimeML standard has been developed for the automatic extraction of information about the event-structure of narrative texts, and it has been applied mainly to English news data. The mark-up language consists of a collection of tags intended to explicitly outline the information about the events reported in a given text, as well as about their temporal relations. The TimeML metadata standard marks: • Events through the tags: − EVENT: for situations that happen or occur, states or","circumstances in which something obtains or holds true. − MAKEINSTANCE: for tracking the instances or","realizations of a given event; the tag also carries the","tense and aspect of the verb-denoted event. • Temporal anchoring of events through the tags: − TIMEX3: for times of a day, dates – calendar dates or","ranges, and durations. − SIGNAL: it marks function words that indicate how","temporal objects are to be related to each other. • Links between events and/or timexes through the tags: − TLINK – Temporal Link – indicates 13 types of","temporal relations between two temporal elements","(event-event, event-timex), similar to Allen’s relations. − ALINK – Aspectual Link to mark the relationship","between an aspectual event and its argument event. − SLINK – Subordination Link to mark contexts","introducing relations between two events."]},{"title":"3238 2.2 The TimeBank corpus","paragraphs":["The creation of the TimeBank corpus started in 2002 during the TERQAS 2","workshop, and it should be considered preliminary (Boguraev & Ando, 2006): the corpus still needs improvements and reviews. The dimension of the corpus (4715 sentences with 10586 unique lexical units, from a total of 61042 lexical units) might be too small for robust statistical learning and the annotation inconsistencies require corrections. The corpus consists of 183 news report documents, with XML markups for document format and structure information, sentence boundary information, and named entity recognition (ENAMEX, NUMEX, CARDINAL from MUC-7)."]},{"title":"3. Building the TimeBank parallel corpus 3.1 The Romanian version","paragraphs":["The TimeBank, corpus was distributed for translation to two CL Master students with strong background in English and Romanian philology and translation. As the next step is the alignment of the English and Romanian versions of the corpus, a minimal set of translation recommendations was elaborated, in order not only to ensure a literal translation, but also to permit a best-possible word-alignment process and, as much as possible, a natural and good-quality target text. The two translators worked separately, sharing the original English corpus; hence an inter-translator agreement could not be estimated. Some basic translation principles are the followings: • The sentences are translated in a 1:1 correspondence,","whenever the language permits it, so that the","sentence-alignment is directly obtained through","translation. • The translation equivalents have as much as possible the","same part-of-speech; when the English word has a","Romanian cognate, this is used in translation, and not its","Romanian paraphrase. • All words are translated and stylistic variations are","avoided, so as not to introduce words or expressions","without an English equivalent. • The tense of verbs is mapped onto its corresponding","Romanian one, the modifications being accepted only","on linguistic grounds, but not stylistic. • The format of the dates, moments of day and numbers","conforms to the norms of written Romanian. The sentence alignment of the corpus was obtained as a direct output of the translation. A first automatic import showed that the translation needed more improvements. Therefore a manual check performed on the parallel corpus allowed us to detect and correct also some other lacks and inconsistencies in the way the translators worked. In the 4715 sentences (translation units) of the current version of the Romanian corpus there are 65375 lexical tokens, including punctuation marks, representing 12640 lexical types.  2 http://www.timeml.org/site/terqas/index.html"]},{"title":"3.2 The parallel corpus","paragraphs":["The English and Romanian raw texts were preprocessed in order to obtain the corpus in the format required by the lexical aligner. Using the TTL3","module (Ion, 2007), the texts were tokenized – based on the MtSeg model, POS-tagged – using an adaptation of the TnT tagger, lemmatized – based on a lexicon, and chunked – using regular expressions. This module assembles the bitext in an XML format similar to the XCES one (Ide et al., 2000)."]},{"title":"3.3 Word-level alignment","paragraphs":["The four stage lexical aligner, YAWA, uses bilingual translation lexicons (Tufis & Barbu, 2002) and phrase boundaries detection to align words of a given bitext from Romanian to English. In each of the first three stages (content words alignment, inside-chunks alignment, and alignment in contiguous sequences of unaligned words), YAWA adds new links to those already created in the previous steps. Only in the last phase, correction, it deletes the wrong links (Tufis et al., 2005, 2006). The automatic alignment performed on 181 files (out of 183) in the TimeBank parallel corpus produced 91714 alignments out of which 25346 are NULL-alignments. Two files were not aligned because of a low translation quality. In order to obtain an optimal transfer of the temporal annotations from the English version onto the Romanian one, all the alignments in the 181 files were manually checked."]},{"title":"4. Automatic import and its evaluation","paragraphs":["Because of the way the translation was performed, the English corpus was parsed and for every sentence XML tag we could extract its content and replace it with the Romanian translation. We used the Romanian to English lexical alignment to transfer the XML markup from English to Romanian because, otherwise, we could obtain the Romanian translation in a shuffled form if the word order was not preserved. The transfer algorithm (Forascu et al., 2007) goes as follows: For every pair of sentences (Sro; Sen) from the TimeBank parallel corpus with the Ten English equivalent sentence (Ten is the same sentence – same raw text – as Sen, with the exception that Ten has the XML structure that we want to transfer) do: • construct a list E of pairs of English text fragments with","sequences of English indexes from Sen and Ten. Due to","the fact that the tokenization of Sen is different from that","of Ten, the list E is needed in order to map English text","fragments from Ten with sequences of indexes from Sen","so as to be able to use the Romanian lexical alignments","which exist relative to these indexes.. • add to every element of E the XML context in which","that text fragment appeared. For every tag, its attributes","– if present – are stored. • construct the list RW of Romanian words along with the","transferred XML contexts using E and the lexical","alignment between Sro and Sen.

For the offline temporal markups (MAKEINSTANCE and LINK tags) the transfer kept only those XML tags from the English version whose IDs belong to XML structures that have been transferred to Romanian. The success rate for the import of the temporal markups altogether is 96.53%. A more detailed statistic, on all tags, is illustrated in Table 1. The 3.47 % of non-transferred tags are due to missing translations (though the Romanian translation was a good and natural one), non-lexicalisations in Romanian, or missing alignments.   TimeML tags number % transferred EVENTs 7703 97.07 TIMEXes 1356 95.89 SIGNALs 668 97.09 INSTANCEs 7706 97.05 TLINKs 6122 95.38 ALINKs 249 93.96 SLINKs 2831 96.55 TOTAL 26635 96.53 ","Table 1: Tags transferred from the English into the Romanian TimeBank 1.2.  Using about 10% of the Romanian corpus, we performed a preliminary study to analyze the situations of perfect transfer and compare them with those situations in which: • the temporal annotation transfer has to be done with","some amendments when the temporal constructions in","the two languages are not similar but they can be","transferred using special developed rules;","(Amendment); • it has to deal with language specific phenomena, such as","the treatment of clitics or the PRO-drop phenomenon,","specific to Romanian but not to English; (Language","Specific); • the transfer can not be performed; (Impossible). For the statistics in table 2, summarizing the four situations encountered during the temporal annotation import, we will not refer to the offline markups, because they are automatically imported only if the elements they are linked to are present in the text. The situations encountered in our study for the EVENT tag are the followings: • The amendments needed to be done in the automatic","import are due mainly to the TimeML rule stating that in","cases of phrases, the EVENT tag should mark only the","head of the construction. This is the case for Romanian","reflexive verbs (the reflexive pronoun was marked","inside the tag), Romanian verbal collocations, and","compound verb phrases.","• The intercalation of an adverb/conjunction between the verbs forming a verb phrase was the only Language Specific phenomenon that occurred in the files we used in our study; these 0.36% cases, when the EVENT tags were automatically imported also on the auxiliary Romanian verb, were corrected for the EVENTs included in our study.","• The 0.48% Impossible transfers, due to missing translations, non-lexicalisations in Romanian, or missing alignments, were also corrected.   Tags  Transfer EVENT TIMEX3 SIGNAL Perfect 785 33 29 Amendment 37 3 - Language Specific 3 - - Impossible 4 - 4  Table 2: Types of temporal annotation transfer  The 8.33% situations when amendments were needed for the transfer of the TIMEX3 tag are due to missing alignments or the wrong markings of the Romanian prepositions as part of TIMEX3. The 12.12% situations of impossible transfer of a SIGNAL tag are due to non-lexicalisation in Romanian. Even if the main objective of our study was to detect the types and situations encountered during the automatic annotation import, the study permitted, as a side-effect, to identify and mark temporal elements not (yet) marked in the English TimeBank 1.2. We modified and marked only new tags of type EVENT, TIMEX3 and SIGNAL using the Callisto 4","annotation tool for both the Romanian and English parts of the parallel corpus, with the Tango TimeML Importer. In the snapshot illustrated in Figure 1, one can see that there were some problems with missing spaces between words and the Romanian diacritics. For the EVENTs we classified as such another 104 elements: 70 OCCURENCEs (nouns: missions, training, fight, (mediation) effort, demarcation, move, as well as verbs: supervising, leading, include), 5 of the REPORTING class (say, said), 21 belonging to the STATE class (belongs, look, ceiling, staying, war, policies), 1 event of type I_ACTION (include), and 7 from the I_STATE class (like, think, (have the) power). The rationale behind these modifications is that each sentence expresses an event, even if not so well temporally-anchored. We have marked two new temporal expressions (TIMEX3 tag) for which the value is PAST_REF – meaning that the expressions do not have a specific value, but they can be normalised according to the extended ISO 8601 standard used in TimeML: once, not that long ago. The 19 new SIGNALs are most probably due to inevitable manual annotation mistakes: several, when, meanwhile,  4 http://callisto.mitre.org/"]},{"title":"3240","paragraphs":["time and again, after, on. As we mentioned before, some of these signals are not lexicalized in Romanian, hence we marked them only in the English corpus. Moreover, the absence of some SIGNALs didn’t permit to identify multiple instantiations for some EVENTs. For example in US has tried to hasten it on several occasions the absence of the SIGNAL on several permits to mark only one instance for the tried EVENT. All the above observations are consistent with the conclusions of the TimeBank developers: the corpus still needs improvements and reviews (Boguraev & Ando, 2006) especially with respect to: event classes, incomplete temporal markup and linking, incomplete subordinated linking."]},{"title":"5. Conclusions","paragraphs":["The research proves that the automatic import of the temporal annotations from English to other language is a worth doing enterprise with a very high success rate. The most important conclusion is that, as the manual annotation of the temporal expressions, events and their links is very time-consuming and expensive, the automatic transfer of annotations represents a solution, provided a parallel corpus involving the target language exists, the source language displays temporal annotation, the target language has similar temporal conceptualizations 5",", and adequate processing tools are available. This study opens the possibility to decide, based on corpus-evidence, how well the temporal theories can be applied to other languages, here with emphasis on Romanian.  5 We acknowledge this suggestion from one of our reviewers. Future immediate activities include finishing the evaluation and the correction/improvement of the annotations in the parallel Romanian-English TimeBank, especially the temporal annotations. The corpus will be then used to create or adapt a temporal tagger – such as TARSQI (Verhagen et al., 2005) - for Romanian, or even a language independent one, in a combination of rules with statistical information derived from the corpus. The temporal annotated data together with time ontologies (Hobbs, 2002; Hobbs & Pustejovsky , 2003) will be used to represent the temporal structure of the discourse and its possible relations with other discourse structures, such as, for example, Rhetorical Structure (Mann & Thompson, 1987) or Veins Theory (Cristea et al., 1998), as we already showed there are strong interconnections between the Veins theory and temporal information in texts (Forascu et al., 2006)."]},{"title":"6.
