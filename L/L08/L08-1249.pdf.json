Introduction","paragraphs":["Despite the rapid growth of alternative information sources, newspaper articles continue to be the staple source most readily accessible. Accessibility is, indeed, a major preoccupation for newspaper editors, and most papers are available on-line with “breaking news” features. News aggregators are automatic systems that use on-line information from newsfeeds or on-line newspaper sources and collate overviews across newspapers, worldwide. For example, the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre’s NewsExplorer1","clusters news stories by type and country, but also provides additional indexes in form of names, related and associated people, related stories, etc. Names mentioned under Related People invoke a screen with links to stories, in which the person plays a role, as well as two special sections: Quotes from and Quotes about (Pouliquen et al., 2007). This reflects the importance of information attributed to a source. Newspaper articles typically report information collected from a single (or multiple) source(s). Especially in the North American tradition, this information is usually attributed to the source explicitly in form of quoted or indirect speech. We will refer to both forms here as reported speech.2 Reported speech is an important indicator of evidentiality (Bergler, 1992). The reliability of the information conveyed has to be assessed differently for different tasks (an expert on child care and an expert on nuclear physics may have the same high reliability associated when speaking on their respective domains of expertise, yet low reliability when speaking on the other’s). Reported speech is thus a form of valence shifter (Bergler, 2005), which marks the embedded information as not simply factual. Reported speech is of increasing importance outside newspaper articles in new media such as blogs and discussion groups, where citations and quotations form a major backbone for the structure of 1 EU EMM NewsExplorer, http://press.jrc.it/NewsExplorer/ 2 In contrast to Quirk (Quirk, 1985, page 1021), who considers","only indirect speech under the term “reported speech.” discussion. NewsExplorer only identifies material in direct quotes, which is mostly of importance for possibly contentious material or claims. But most reported speech is in form of indirect reported speech. We have developed a set of resources that identifies and tags thesource, reporting verb and content of reported speech sentences. These resources have been implemented as components for the GATE framework (Cunningham et al., 2002) and are distributed under an open source license.3","This is intended as a first module for more sophisticated representation and reasoning with attributed information, such as belief reasoning based on nested belief structures as suggested by (Ballim and Wilks, 1991) and recently illustrated for the reported speech context by the Fuzzy Believer System (Krestel et al., 2007a; Krestel et al., 2007b)."]},{"title":"2. Reported Speech","paragraphs":["The function of reported speech is to convey information in two steps: from a source to a reporter, and from the reporter to a reader. The utterance and its context will be interpreted by the reporter, encoded by the reporter for the reader, and decoded by the reader. The reporter can use the mechanism of reported speech to not only reproduce the content of the utterance, but to reproduce and clarify the whole speech act (Austin, 1962; Searle, 1969). From the reader’s point of view, reading a newspaper article is a multilevel process, as illustrated in Figure 2. The reader has to:","1. Understand the content of what is expressed in the article (the reported clause);","2. Evaluate the additional information given by the reporter to reconstruct not only the original utterance but the original speech act (the reporting clause); 3 See http://semanticsoftware.info"]},{"title":"2823","paragraphs":["circumstances z }| { Last October ,","source z }| { his brother Hubert","reporting verb z}|{ told","addressee z }| { the bankruptcy court","| {z }","reporting clause","that Paul was very ill | {z } reported clause . (1) Figure 1: Example for a reported speech construct and its constituents 3. Interpret the article as presented by the reporter; 4. Reconstruct the original situation; and 5. Interpret the assumed original situation. This encoding typically takes the form of reported speech. The function of direct and indirect speech is the same, with the distinction that in direct speech the reporter commits to a literal transcription of the original utterance, given in quotes, whereas he gives a summary interpretation when using indirect speech. Reported speech usually consists of the reporting clause and the reported clause (Quirk, 1985). The reporting clause contains information about the source of the utterance, the circumstances in which it was made, and possibly a characterization of the manner or force, with which it was made. Figure 1 shows an example from the Wall Street Journal 03.03.1988. The reported clause can consist of direct speech or indirect speech. The same example as in (1) now with direct speech as reported clause: Last October, his brother Hubert said: “Paul is very ill.” (2) There is also a form of free direct and indirect speech. It is used for example to express a stream of consciousness in fictional writing. The reporting clause is omitted in that kind of reported speech. Free form is more widely used in German newspapers, for instance, but is virtually absent in the North American newspaper tradition (Bergler, 1995) and here we will concentrate on direct and indirect speech only. Direct Speech. Quotation marks usually indicate direct speech. In the domain of newspaper articles, quotation marks are obligatory. An example (from the Wall Street Journal 09.14.1987) is: In a statement yesterday, Towle President Paul Dunphy said, “We look to a closing in the very near future.” (3) The position of the reporting clause can vary: at the beginning of a sentence, as in (3), in the middle, as in (4), or at the end of the sentence, as in (5). When the reporting clause is Context’’ Utterance Reader Context Utterance Context’ Utterance Reporter 2 1 5 4 3 Background Knowledge Background Knowledge Figure 2: Steps in reported speech analysis located within or after the reported clause, subject and verb may reverse positions, as in (4) (from Wall Street Journal 12.09.1986). “Other national advertising will be up 8.7%,”  Mr. Coen said, said Mr. Coen, ff “led largely by the strength of such sectors as direct mail.” (4) In this Wall Street Journal (12.17.1986) example, the reporting verb is at the end: “We think this is the bottom year,” a Nissan official said. (5) Direct speech can span over more then one sentence. In that case, the reporting clause is usually found within the first sentence. As a grammatical relation, the direct speech can function as a subordinate clause, for example in (3). But it can also be a subject complement, an apposition to a direct object, or an adverbial construct. A special case is the mixture of direct and indirect speech, where the direct speech forms only part of the reported clause. An example (from the Wall Street Journal 03.05.1987) is:","In a televised address, the president concluded that the initiative “was a mistake.” (6) A number of verbs that are frequently used within direct speech can be found in (Quirk, 1985, page 1024). Additionally, verbs indicating the manner of speaking like mumble, mutter, or sob can also be indicators of direct speech. Indirect Speech. In newspaper articles, indirect speech is ubiquitous. Like direct speech, it relates information from a source, but in a summary form, designed to convey the essence of a larger discourse. In addition, circumstantial information that indicates additional features of the context of the original utterance is usually conveyed. Consider this example from the Wall Street Journal (02.05.1987), where as a result puts the information of the reported clause in the necessary context:","As a result, the company said that it will restate its 1986 earnings.

Resource Description","paragraphs":["Our reported speech analysis resource consists of two interdependent NLP components that have been implemented for the GATE framework (Cunningham et al., 2002):","Reporting Verb Marker: Detects and tags verbs that trigger a reported speech interpretation.","Reported Speech Finder: Finds reported speech constructs and tags its constituents (source, reporting verb, circumstantial information)."]},{"title":"2824","paragraphs":["according accuse acknowledge add admit agree allege announce argue assert believe blame charge cite claim complain concede conclude confirm contend criticize declare decline deny describe disagree disclose estimate explain fear hope insist maintain mention note order predict promise recall recommend reply report say state stress suggest tell testify think urge warn worry write observe Table 1: Reporting verbs identified by the reporting verb marker These components can easily be embedded in more complex NLP pipelines, depending on the concrete application scenario. In turn, they rely on lower-level analysis components, such as a noun phrase chunker and verb grouper, which are distributed with the GATE system (see Section 6.). 3.1. Reporting Verb Marker The Reporting Verb Marker tags verbs used to express reported speech using a finite state transducer. This component was first developed and implemented by (Doandes, 2003) to extract information related to evidential analysis. Currently, we recognize only the most frequent reported speech verbs as listed in Table 1. The reporting verb marker is implemented using GATE’s Java Annotation Patterns Engine (JAPE) (Cunningham et al., 2000). It works with the chunker notion of verb groups, contiguous sequences of auxiliaries and verbs. When one of the listed verbs is detected as the head of a verb group, the reporting verb finder marks it as a reported speech verb by adding a corresponding annotation containing the lemma of the reported speech verb. 3.2. Reported Speech Finder To identify reported speech in newspaper articles, we extract six general patterns. They differ in the position of the reporting verb, the source, and the reporting clause. An overview of those six patterns is shown in Table 2. Source Verb Content Verb Source Content Content Source Verb Content Verb Source Content Source Verb Content Content Verb Source Content","Table 2: Six patterns for finding reported speech in newspa-","per articles Identifying reported speech sentences enables us to label the different elements for further analysis. Our components have been designed to allow extracting statements in form of declarative sentences. Currently, we exclude structures where the reported clause is not a grammatical sentence, since infinitival and other omitted constructs no longer report the speech of others, but interpret their actions or utterances, which requires a different treatment; e.g.: The President denied to sign the bill. (8) The six patterns are not exhaustive, for example, they will ignore the second source and reporting verb in (Wall Street Journal 12.09.1986): Mr. Coen predicted that a weak sector in 1987 will be national print – newspapers and magazines – which he said will see only a 4.8% increase in advertising expenditures. (9) Constructs that do not fit into our six basic patterns are rare,4 and additional patterns can be easily added in the future."]},{"title":"4. Implementation","paragraphs":["This section contains more details concerning our implementation, which is realized in form of processing resources in the GATE (Cunningham et al., 2002) framework. 4.1. Reporting Verb Marker A number of verbs used within the reporting verb marker can be found in Table 1. We use a gazetteer to detect these verbs within the original article by comparing the root forms of the verbs with our verb list. The reporting verb marker is implemented as a JAPE (Cunningham et al., 2000) grammar. Figure 3 shows a code snippet of the JAPE-rule for the verb “concede.” 5","After detecting these verbs within a document, the reporting verb marker marks them as reported speech verbs by adding an annotation containing the root of the main verb of the reported speech verb phrase. 4.2. Reported Speech Finder The reported speech finder is implemented as a regular grammar using the Montréal Transducer, which supports an enhanced version of the JAPE language.6","Our grammar consists of a set of rules to identify reported speech structures and to label the source, reporting verb, and the reported clause.

Evaluation","paragraphs":["For evaluation, we randomly picked 7 newspaper articles (∼6100 words) from the WSJ corpus and created a gold standard containing the reported speech elements: Source, Reporting Verb, and Reported Clause (that is, we did not evaluate the detection of circumstantial information). The articles contain about 400 sentences and among them 133 reported speech constructs. Apart from correct and incorrect identification of reported speech, we also measure partial correctness: If the system annotates a reported speech sentence nearly correct, but, for example, mixes up one or two terms of circumstantial information and reported clause, we speak of partially correct detection, if the meaning of the reported speech in general is maintained. 5.1. Results For the detection of reporting verb and source, i.e., partial correctness, our system achieved a recall value of 0.79 and a precision value of 1.00, thus an F-measure of 0.88. The results for the reported clause, together with a detailed overview of the results obtained for the different test documents, can be seen in Table 3. The results for the extraction of the reported clause (content) suffers mostly from the misinterpretation of parts of reported clauses as circumstantial information. 5.2. Error Analysis We also performed a detailed analysis of error cases introduced by our system and their root causes. In Table 4, a listing of sample errors that reduce our system’s performance is shown. The examples are taken from the WSJ corpus:","1. In the first example, the “max-NP transducer”,7","which the reported speech component uses, failed to identify the NP printed in bold. This leads to a missing match because the patterns of the reported speech finder expects a noun phrase.","2. Complex circumstantial information like in Example 2 can not be detected by the current patterns and the component fails to discover the reported speech.","3. Likewise, in the next example, the boundary of the circumstantial information can not be syntactically determined, because three occurrences of “that” are possible starting points of the reported clause after the reporting verb.","4.

Deployment and Application","paragraphs":["In this section, we describe how to deploy our reported speech components in practice. 6.1. Pipeline Configuration Our reported speech components are designed to be embedded within a complete GATE analysis pipeline. They rely on annotations added by a number of existing GATE processing resources, in particular tokenization, sentence splitting, part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase chunking, verb group-ing, and rudimentary morphological analysis. A complete example for a possible pipeline configuration, with the components needed for complete reported speech tagging, is shown in Figure 5. 6.2. Annotations Our components then add annotations for the detected reporting verbs and reported speech constructs (see Figure 6). Figure 5: GATE Pipeline All potential reporting verbs are annotated with their semantic dimensions and their main verb. This annotation is labeled reporting verb group (“RVG”) and is generated by the reporting verb marker. All detected reported speech occurrences receive a “Reported Speech” annotation generated by the reported speech finder.

Conclusion","paragraphs":["Reported Speech is an important linguistic phenomenon in newspaper articles, where it serves to provide evidential scope for second hand information. It serves this function also in many of the new, more argumentative media, such as blogs, where proper attribution is part of good style and carries with it subtle information about both content and social structure. Our system takes the first step in making this information explicit and accessible. We provide an open source GATE component to identify and functionally annotate reported speech sentences for both direct and indirect speech, extracting the reported clause, the source, the reporting verb, and circumstantial information.
