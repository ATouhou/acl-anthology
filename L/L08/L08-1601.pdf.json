Accordingly, combining methods from both initiatives, this paper presents the ongoing implementation of the WN.Br lexical database and the aforementioned automation procedure illustrated with a sample of the automatic encoding of the hyponymy and co-hyponymy relations.

Introduction","paragraphs":["Natural Language Processing (NLP) initiatives to devise methods for developing computational lexicons either manually from scratch or (semi-)automatically from machine-readable dictionaries have attested that coding lexicons for NLP applications is a time-consuming, prone to flaws task (Palmer et al., 2001; Hanks, 2003; Matsumoto, 2003). The core of the problem is the amount, the variety, and the complexity of specialized and interrelated information that lexicon developers have to cope with and to encode in the lexical database: graphemic, morphological, syntactic, semantic, and even illocutionary bits of information, among others (Handke, 1995).","But, on the one hand, there have been important initiatives to minimize the burden of the task and to develop strategies and standards for building robust and corpus-based lexicons (cf. Calzolari, McNaught & Zampolli, 1996; Zampolli, 1997, Lenci et al., 2000), acquiring lexical information from MRD and corpora (Matsumoto & Utsuro, 2000), and establishing the necessary “virtuous circle” model between lexicons and corpora (Calzolari, 2004, p. 102). On the other, a successful psycholinguistic experiment, the Princeton WordNet (WN.Pr) lexical database, a taxonomic thesaurus, has motivated efficient compilations of bulky relational lexicons since its inception in the 1980ś (Miller & Fellbaum, 1991; Fellbaum, 1998).","The EuroWordNet relational lexical database (Vossen, 1998) is the first multilingual initiative built upon WN.Pr and consists of a collection of individual wordnets interrelated by means of the so-called Inter-Lingual-Index (ILI), an unstructured list of the WN.Pr synsets1",".","Other initiative, relying on a slightly different method of building multilingual wordnets, is the MultiWordNet (MWN) project. Pianta, Bentivogli & Girardi (2001, p. 294) argue that the MWN model allows the implementation of automatic procedures to speed up both the construction of the synsets in the target language and the detection of divergences between WN.Pr and the wordnet being built. The key strategy is “building language specific wordnets keeping as much as possible of the semantic relations available” in the WN.Pr (Bentivogli, Pianta & Pianesi, 2000, p.663).","The additional advantage of using WN.Pr lexical database as a resource for building wordnets for other languages, and the one demonstrated in this paper, is to explore possibilities of implementing an automatic procedure to map the WN.Pr hierarchical relations (hyponymy, co-hyponymy, troponymy, meronymy, cause, and entailment) onto the lexical database of the wordnet under construction. It should be stressed that that is, in fact, a viable possibility, for those are language-independent relations that hold between lexicalized concepts. Accordingly, as those relations do not hold between word forms, in wordnets they are appropriately specified between synsets, which are formal entities that represent lexicalized concepts, which legitimately might be lexicalized across languages.","Thus, combining methods from both initiatives, this  1 An ILI-record consists of a WN.Pr (version 2.0) synset, its concept gloss and its ID number."]},{"title":"1535","paragraphs":["paper presents the ongoing implementation of the aforementioned automation procedure. In particular, it focuses on the specification of both the hyponymy and co-hyponymy relations between Brazilian Portuguese WordNet (WN.Br) synsets.","The paper is structured as follows: section 2 sketches out the WN.Br project and the underlying structure of the WN.Br lexical database under construction; section 3 discusses the project alignment issues; section 4 illustrates both the procedure of manual encoding of the <EQ SYNONYM> cross-lingual relations and the automatic specification of the hyponymy and co-hyponymy relations; section 5 concludes the paper with the current WN.Br verb database statistics and the ongoing work; sections 6 and 7 contain the Acknowledgements and the References, respectively."]},{"title":"2. The WN.Br Project","paragraphs":["Based on Expert Systems development, the WN.Br project launched in 2003 (Dias-da-Silva, 2003), applies a three-domain approach methodology to develop the WN.Br lexical database, and assumes a compromise between Human Language Technology and Linguistics (Dias-da-Silva, 1998). The linguistic-related information to be computationally modeled is likened to a rare metal. As such, it must be \"mined\", \"molded\", and \"assembled\" into a computer-tractable system (Durkin, 1994)."]},{"title":"2.1 The Three-Domain Philosophy","paragraphs":["Accordingly, the process of building the WN.Br lexical database is developed in the following three complementary domains: (a) the linguistic-related domain, in which the lexical resources (dictionaries and text corpora), the wordnet lexical-conceptual relations, and the \"Base Concepts\" and the \"Top Ontology\" (Vossen, 2003), i.e. the “natural language ontology” of concepts, are mined; (b) the representational domain, in which the overall information selected and organized in the preceding domain is molded into computer-tractable representations, e.g. the synset (Miller, 1986) – a set of words built on the basis of the notion of synonymy in context, i.e. word interchangeability in some context –, the lexical matrix (Miller & Fellbaum, 1991) – associations of sets of word forms and the concepts they lexicalize –, and the wordnet \"lexical database\" itself (Fellbaum, 1998); (c) the computational domain, in which the computer-tractable representations are assembled by means of the WN.Br Editor."]},{"title":"2.2 The WN.Br Underlying Structure","paragraphs":["The underlying structure of the WN.Br lexical database shown in Fig.1 is made up of two lists: the List of Entries (LE), i.e. the list of lexical units (arranged in alphabetical order) pertaining to one of the following four syntactic categories: verb, noun, adjective, or adverb; and the List of Synsets (LS), i.e. the collection of the synsets formed from those lexical units. Each lexical unit in a synset is necessarily an element of the LE and is specified for its particular Sense Description Vector (SDV). Each SDV has three pointers: the synonymy pointer, which identifies a particular synset in the LS; the antonymy pointer, which identifies a particular antonym synset in the LS; and the sense pointer, which identifies a particular sense number in the SDV. Each synset is also linked to its concept gloss via the concept gloss link, and each lexical unit is linked to its co-text sentence via the co-text sentence link.","By means of the WN.Br Editor the linguist (a) inserts, consults, modifies, and saves lexical unit types and synsets; (b) inserts co-text sentences, extracted from corpora, for each lexical unit; (c) writes a concept gloss for each synset, and (d) generates synsets lists by syntactic category, by number of elements, by their degree of homonymy and polysemy, and by co-text sentences."]},{"title":"3. Conceptual Alignment Issues","paragraphs":["The WN.Br work in progress is the linking of its verb synsets to the equivalent ones in the WN.Pr lexical database by the aforementioned <EQ RELATIONS>. Such a conceptual alignment permits not only the linguistic investigation of differences and similarities in the lexicalization processes between Brazilian Portuguese and American English but also two sorts of mismatches described by Peters et al. (1998): the linguistic mismatches (lexical gaps 2",", due largely to cultural gaps, pragmatic differences, and morphological mismatches; over-differentiation or under-differentiation of senses; and fuzzy-matching between synsets) and technical mismatches (mistakes in the choice of inter-lingual equivalence links or in the encoding of language-independent relations across wordnets)."]},{"title":"3.1 The WN.Br Lexical Database Structure","paragraphs":["The WN.Br Editor, a Windows®-based , besides aiding the linguist in the manual encoding of both the WN.Br synsets and the cross-lingual equivalence relations between synsets, the so called <EQ RELATIONS>3","(Vossen et al., 1998; Peters et al., 1998), makes it now possible to encode the WN.Br language-internal relations of hyponymy, co-hyponymy, troponymy, cause, and entailment automatically by inheriting them from the WN.Pr lexical database.","To cope with these tasks, the original WN.Br Editor (Dias-da-Silva, 2003) was enhanced to house the three interconnecting modules described in the next section. Accordingly, the original WN.Br lexical database underlying structure shown in Fig.1 was extended to encode the EQ-RELATIONS (see Fig.2).","Thus, each synset structure was augmented with an additional vector to identify both the wordnet standard language-independent conceptual relations (e.g. hyponymy and co-hyponymy) and the cross-lingual <EQ RELATIONS> between synsets of the two wordnets.

Conclusions","paragraphs":["Compared to the standard methodologies, which resorts to pre-existing MRDs (Rigau & Eneko, 2002), this paper presented procedures and an original editing tool for encoding both the language-internal wordnet bits of information (synsets, semantic types, glosses, and lexical-conceptual hierarchical relations) and the cross-lingual relations. The latter, the so called <EQ RELATIONS>, has made it possible to connect the two wordnets and to devise a procedure that allows for the automatic encoding of the WN.Br lexical internal hierarchical relations.","In these years of research, the WN.Br lexical database has circa 11,000 verbs (4,000 synsets), 17,000 nouns (8,000 synsets), 15,000 adjectives (6,000 synsets), and 1,000 adverbs (500 synsets) (Dias-da-Silva 2003). Its current 18,500 synsets (44.000 word types) were handcrafted by a team of three linguists, who reused, merged, and tuned synonym and antonym information registered in seven bulky dictionaries, and mined/filtered relevant lexical information from Brazilian Portuguese texts in corpora and in the web to further specify and check these and the other wordnet-related conceptual relations.","On the way, it is the manual encoding of (a) a co-text sentence for each verb, (b) a concept gloss for each synset of verbs; (c) the mapping of each WN.Br verb synset onto its equivalent ILI-record by means of one the aforementioned <EQ RELATIONS>, and (d) the automatic encoding of the aforementioned language-internal relations.
