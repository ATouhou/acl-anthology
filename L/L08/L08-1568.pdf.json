The system is rule-based and makes use of well-established frameworks for analysis and generation (LFG and HPSG). Minimal Recursion Semantics is the \"glue\" which performs transfer from source to target language and serves as the information vehicle between LFG and HPSG. The project-internal testing uses material from the training data sources. We report on two test methods in addition: 1) on test data from the same (narrow) domain as the project was designed for, and 2) on a syntactic test suite. The former turns out to give much worse results than the project-internal tests, while the latter obtains somewhat better results. These results are important for future evaluations of similar systems. "]},{"title":"1. Introduction 1.1 The LOGON MT system","paragraphs":["In this paper we report on the evaluation of the MT prototype system LOGON, developed for Norwegian–English translation. LOGON is a joint project involving three Norwegian universities, aiming at a “deep” approach: to deliver high-quality MT based on the combination of a symbolic, semantic-transfer-oriented backbone and stochastic processes for ambiguity management and robustness (Oepen et al. 2004).1","At the heart of the system is Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS; Copestake, Flickinger, Sag, & Pollard, 2006) together with formalized grammatical frameworks for analysis and generation (LFG and HPSG). The textual domain is “guidebooks for mountain hiking in the summer season in Southern Norway”."]},{"title":"1.2 Evaluation","paragraphs":["The paper describes and discusses evaluation of the specific “Fjell” release (of January 2007) of the LOGON system. The project decided that “official” testing should use the training material and held-out texts from the same sources. The original work plan anticipated a 95% success rate on the training material (500 sentences) and an 80% success rate on unknown texts (from known sources) at the end of the project period (LOGON Work plan for 2005 and 2006). A less ambitious goal was defined after the first two years, to provide translations for 50 % of the sentences in the test material taken from the same domain. There was no explicit accuracy goal, so we have had to interpret the goal w.r.t. our own evaluation scales (see section 2).   1 The present authors – the evaluation team – have not been part of the central developing team, although we have been part of the LOGON project team and have performed occasional tasks for the developers. In addition to the project-internal evaluation we also report on results from evaluations of the system on two other kinds of material: 1) novel test data from the same domain, and 2) a syntactic test suite. The results of 1) show that a linguistically based system achieves much worse results on test data from a different text source than the training material, even in the same narrow domain. The results of 2) show that the syntactic test (controlled for vocabulary), yields better results. Thus, future evaluations of similar systems should include both kinds of test material.  The motivation for test 1) is supported in the literature: Tessiore and Hahn (2000:615) report on Verbmobil, also a deep linguistics-based MT system: “In general, in any validation or evaluation procedure [...] the independence of the test from the development is a crucial feature. Only in very special algorithmic cases can a finite and closed number of system states be used for both, development and test. Linguistic processing, in contrast, is a completely different case, because every linguistic theory can even prove that the linguistic performance creates infinitely many surface structures from the limited structural material.”  We believe this is a very insightful remark. A hand-crafted linguistics-based system will be able to generalise over input given in the training process. For example, if a verb occurs in the infinitive in the training corpus, the developer will immediately add the other forms of that verb to the lexicon of the system. Generally, a word used in one meaning in the training corpus may inspire the developers to add similar words and their arguments and syntax into the system. Statistically trained systems are blind to these kinds of generalisations. Therefore, to test the generality of a linguistics-based, hand-crafted system, it is important to use a new text, written by other authors than those of the training material. "]},{"title":"396","paragraphs":["The motivation for a syntactic test (test 2) is that the LOGON system is linguistics-based. Much effort has been put into the grammatical qualities of the system. For this reason, it would be unfair not to test this quality separately. A systematic syntax test reveals what kinds of constructions the system can deal with and which it cannot. Since the system is sensitive to vocabulary issues, the syntactic test suite contains only words that have been tested repeatedly so that we know that whenever a syntactic construction is not given a translation, it is not the fault of any particular vocabulary item missing.  While automatic evaluation methods have become popular for statistical MT, e.g. BLEU (Papineni et al. 2001), we find it important that evaluation of a linguistics-based system must focus on fidelity and fluency (Hovy, King and Popescu-Belis 2002). For the project-internal testing we had an experimental set-up with eight external assessors. The assessors had native English competence, and had higher education, but were not linguists. We used three different LOGON “systems” differing thus: i) TOP: Translations selected as best by the LOGON system itself. The TOP system chooses the best candidate by means of statistical ranking for each module (analysis, transfer, generation), in a combination of n-grams and maxent including linguistic features. See Velldal et al. (2005), Velldal (2007) and Oepen et al. (2007). ii) ORACLE: Translations that are judged as best by a human oracle. The ORACLE was an American speaker with fluent knowledge of Norwegian, and was one of the development team. She was instructed to pick, from each set of translations, the one she liked best w.r.t. fidelity and fluency. iii) BLEU: Translations deemed best according to the BLEU metric (three reference translations were available for all test sentences)."]},{"title":"2. The evaluations 2.1 The “official” testing","paragraphs":["The internal test material (from three hiking guides) was divided between training material and held-out data from the same sources. The developers had access to a full vocabulary list of half of the held-out material. The amount of unknown words in the other half need not be high because the test sentences are collected from the same sources as the training material.  Out of 446 sentences in the test set, 254 sentences were translated by the system, i.e. 57 %. The numbers are broken down w.r.t. known-ness type in table 1.

Number and per cent of translated sentences in the three source books.  The 57 % translated sentences were put into a web-based evaluation system, in which the eight external assessors would judge the translation by grading fluency and fidelity, and writing comments. For a given translation, the full report of the eight translators looks like in figure 1. The grades go from 0 to 3, where 2 and 3 are good grades. We are aware that some researchers like to separate fluency and fidelity, so that they are not evaluated at the same time by the human assessors (see Hamon et al. 2007). However, we chose to present them together. Each assessor was given five translations of each sentence. Ideally, there would be one each of the TOP, ORACLE and BLEU systems, plus two simple n-gram trained, experimental reference systems, SMT and OA. OA (Oversettelsesassistenten (\"The translation assistant\"), developed at NTNU in Trondheim), was trained on general material, and SMT, a straightforward SMT implementation (GIZA ++, Pharaoh; Koehn 2004a, 2004b), was trained on the same training set as LOGON used plus a Norwegian-English parallel corpus available at the University of Oslo. However, since the three LOGON systems sometimes gave the same output, two human translations served as reserves to be put in. The translations were presented in random order, and the assessors had no idea which translation came from which source.

Below, we see the assessors’ grading of the 57 % that were translated by the LOGON “systems”, and the equivalent translations by the two statistical MT systems SMT and OA (which were only evaluated for the sake of comparison, and not in their own right). The grading scale is defined as follows:  FIDELITY FLUENCY 0 Useless No coherent English 1 Some Something is OK 2 Fair Still some mistakes 3 Perfect Perfect English  Fidelity ORACLE BLEU TOP SMT OA Train 2,27 2,11 2,03 2,12 1,16 Known 1,96 1,82 1,68 1,53 1,24 Unknown 2,16 2,08 2,01 1,65 1,33","","Table 2: Fidelity measures.

As expected, the ORACLE selects the best translations. Something that at first glance looks very surprising is the fact that for both fidelity and fluency, the scores for test material with possibly unknown vocabulary are higher than those for known vocabulary. However, the length of the sentences with possibly unknown vocabulary is on average shorter than that of the known vocabulary ones (7:9 words for the main test text). Also, it should be remembered that the numbers only include sentences that actually have been translated, so that there is in fact no unknown vocabulary in the translated sentences. Still, there is almost the same number of sentences that have been translated in the known and unknown vocabulary test set (60:55 sentences for the main text). Thus, when the difference is not higher between the two sets, our initial motivation for including a new test set with text by new author must be said to be justified (section 1.2). The similarity between them shows that there cannot be very much that is really unknown in the possibly unknown test set.  The BLEU metric is clearly better than LOGON's selection mechanism TOP (significantly better for most categories, see Johannessen, Nordgård and Nygaard, to appear), showing that the use of reference translations is indeed a powerful tool compared to the system's own selection metric. Both tables show that fidelity and fluency are good for the 57 % sentences that LOGON actually translated (i.e. the ORACLE, BLEU and TOP \"systems\"). The internal testing is presented in full in Johannessen, Nordgård and Nygaard (to appear). "]},{"title":"398","paragraphs":["An advantage of using human assessors in the evaluation process, is the possibility of getting comments to the translations, as exemplified in table 4. In retrospect we think it might have been better if the comments had been given via a strict questionnaire (see e.g. Elliott et al. 2004). Then their comments would have been possible to study automatically. Instead, we chose to let the actual grades be automated, while the comments could be written freely. However, a questionnaire with all the answer alternatives given would have required a lot of experience that we did not have at the time. The comments give us valuable knowledge about what assessors notice and how they deal with it, and this is something we can use later.

We have thus tested the LOGON system on data from another source, in the same narrow domain: Til fots i Jotunheimen (Hiking in Jotunheimen). Here, we have chosen a system of two grades: OK or Fail. In the first category, we accept any sentence that preserves the  meaning even if it is somewhat flawed grammatically (grade 2-3). The Fail category refers to sentences that have not been translated or have a wrong meaning. In practice it can be said to be a fidelity measure, although there was hardly any sentence in this test that was translated well w.r.t. meaning, but had low grammatical score.

Importantly, this shows how different authors use different words even in a narrow domain, and that the performance of a MT system (indeed any text-oriented language technology system) should be tested on textual sources different from those used in the training phase. "]},{"title":"2.3 Evaluating the syntax","paragraphs":["For a linguistics-based system, it is natural to test it purely grammatically, without vocabulary items destroying the output. We have compiled a syntactic test-suite on the basis of an introductory syntax book (Lie 2003). It contains sentences covering 154 constructions, with examples of topicalization (subjects, objects, finite or infinite verbs, clauses), extraposition, simple and complex clauses, formal subjects, clefting, long-distance dependencies, etc. The evaluation team carried out the test, collapsing fidelity and fluency into one accuracy measure, with two grades: OK (grade 2-3) and Fail (0-1).

In this light, 88 % is good. Out of these, 63 % were judged acceptable. The acceptable sentences were thus 55 % of the total number of sentences in the syntactic test suite, see table 8.

The syntactic test suite covers many constructions, most of which occur in normal written prose. There are seven sentences that could possibly be said to be less frequent in written texts, i.e., dislocation. There are seven examples of dislocation in the test suite, including both nominal and adverbial dislocations. The achievement of 55 % therefore may seem a bit low. Four translations are exemplified below, two OK and two Fail, respectively. The first one tests whether the system manages a subject realized as a finite clause, and the second one whether it handles double objects with a lexical direct object. Both are OK.

The main, “official”, evaluation was an experimental set-up based on text from the same sources as the training corpus. This test material consisted of a) training texts, b) test texts with known vocabulary and c) test texts with possibly unknown vocabulary. 446 sentences were tested, and 254 sentences were translated by the system, i.e. 57 %.  The experimental set-up consisted of eight human assessors who evaluated three translations of each of the 254 sentences using a web-based evaluation system. These sentences were given a scale from 0 to 3 for both fidelity and fluency. The best translation that the LOGON system chose from its many candidate translations, the TOP system, received an average of 1.83 for fidelity, and 1.62 for fluency. The system has potential for improvement, though: The translation candidate picked by a human oracle got an average of 2.05 and 1.79, respectively. Recall that the grade 2 for fidelity means that “Much of the meaning of the source sentence is transferred”. The TOP system is approaching that, while the ORACLE system has managed it. The grade 2 for fluency means: “The sentence has many good features, but something is still wrong.” Unfortunately, neither system has reached this goal.  Judging now whether the demonstrator has reached the project goal of translating more than half of the test material, the answer is positive, given the 57 % translated sentences. However, the quality numbers for fidelity and fluency for the translated sentences show that the quality can be discussed. The original goal of 80 % translations is far from having been reached.  We have also carried out two smaller evaluations; one with test material from the same domain (“guidebooks for mountain hiking in the summer season in Southern Norway”) but by a different author. In this test 28 % of the sentences were translated, and 22 % with acceptable results. Finally, we have carried out evaluations using a syntactic test suite that cover most syntactic Norwegian constructions, while using a simple vocabulary from the training vocabulary lists. Here 88 % of the sentences were translated, out of which 63 % had good quality. This means that 55 % of all the syntactic test sentences were translated with good results.  To conclude, the LOGON demonstrator has reached a high level of translation quality for individual grammatical constructions, shown by the 55 % acceptably translated syntactic test sentences. But new vocabulary, even from the same domain, presents a major obstacle for the system, shown by the fact that only 22 % of the test texts from the same domain, but with different author, were acceptably translated."]},{"title":"4.
