An evaluation of benefits of morphological analysis 2.1. Experimental setting","paragraphs":["The annual Cross-language Evaluation Forum (CLEF) conferences provide a stable test bench of document collections, queries (“topics”), and manually obtained relevance judgements which relate sets of documents to topics. Each topic thus has a set of relevance judgments to select which documents are judged topically relevant to it. Typically the 1 http://www.euroling.se/en/siteseeker 2 This work was partly supported by VINNOVA (the Swedish","Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems) through the","TvärSök project.","Label Query form Corpus oo original original so stemmed original mo manual analysis original om original morph analysis sm stemmed morph analysis mm manual analysis morph analysis Table 1: Evaluation cases number of topically relevant documents for a topic is on the order of a few dozen and the number of assessed documents around two hundred. The document databases used for this set of experiments were the CLEF collection of Finnish newsprint and the SDA section of German-language newswire reports for the years 1994 and 1995; the seventy-five Finnish-language and one hundred German-language topics for the 2002 and 2003 evaluation cycles (numbers 91-200; title fields only; of the 110 topics only 75 and 100 had retrieved any relevant documents, respectively), and the relevance judgements given for those topics. The document collection consists of some 45 000 assessed documents of news articles, most rather brief, with about 1 000 relevant Finnish-language documents, and about 2 000 relevant German-language documents. Most queries consist of two to four words (Peters et al., 2003; Peters et al., 2004). The text collections are processed morphologically, the Finnish corpus using the commercially available tools available from Connexor (Tapanainen and Järvinen, 1997); the German using a lemmatiser developed at CST (Jongejan and Haltrup, 2005). The hand crafted Euroling SiteSeeker stemmer has previously been compared with the CST lemmatizer that is developed using machine learning techniques, (Dalianis and Jongejan, 2006)."]},{"title":"1500","paragraphs":["The evaluations are run in parallel using the analysed and the non-analysed corpora. There are two experimental cases for the corpus: o (original), using the unanalysed corpus with original word forms and m (morphological analysis) using the morphologically analysed corpus with lemmatised word forms. The SiteSeeker search system has for Finnish and German a built-in morphological normalisation component for queries, based on the widely available, well-established, simple, and robust Snowball-Porter stemmer (Porter, 1980). In the evaluations we used three experimental settings with regard to query processing: o (original) with no morphological analysis and the Porter stemmer disabled; s (stemmed), with Porter stemmer switched on; m (manual morphological analysis) with every query word manually taken to its lexical base form. This gives us six experimental cases in all for the evaluation, given in Table 1. 2.2. Results from the evaluation A compilation of results from the evaluation are given in Table 2 and are given using standard precision and recall metrics as calculated by the trec eval package3",", such as map (mean average precision), bpref (an average precision measure which better models incomplete relevance judgements, (Buckley and Voorhees, 2004)), P 5, and P 20 (precision at rank 5 and rank 20, respectively). The results give us license to conclude that: 1. Careful – in this experiment, manual – normalisation of queries together with a morphologically analysed target corpus will by and large give the best results. Cases f i-mm and de-mm have best or near best results for most measures. 2. Even basic stemming improves results: so is better than oo and sm is better than om for both Finnish and German. The increase in precision at P5 for both Finnish and German is around 20 percent using the Snowball stemmer; recall shows a 133 percent increase for Finnish and a 94 percent increase for German, respectively. With morphological analysis of the target corpus the precision increase is over 40 percent. 3. If the documents are not morphologically analysed, inadvertent very careful morphological analysis of the queries may lower performance: in this experiment, case f i-mo has lower results than case f i-oo. But not necessarily: case de-mo is not bad at all. This reflects a typological difference between the languages: Finnish morphology is more expansive than is the German. This is presumably the explana-tion for case f i-mm not being better than case f i-sm. The manual morphological analysis has retrieved many further items, gaining considerably better recall, but losing precision. 4. The number of returned documents is a good indica-tion of the number of relevant returned documents, which is a convenient proxy measure for inexpensive future evaluations. These results conform with previous studies on expected and observed effects of using morphological analysis in information retrieval tasks. The results, especially the 3 Available from ftp://ftp.cs.cornell.edu/pub/smart. German-language ones, indicate that in spite of its simple construction and basic level of linguistic analysis, the Snowboll stemmer as used in SiteSeeker works better than expected. The Finnish results are less striking but still show an improvement in both recall and precision."]},{"title":"3. Generative vs reductive approaches to handling morphological variation","paragraphs":["The Finnish language still provides a challenge. In a recent series of publications, Kimmo Kettunen has experimentally shown how Finnish information retrieval tasks, hampered by the expansive morphology employed by the Finnish language, can be profitably performed by provid-ing analyses informed by occurrence statistics rather than aiming for maximum coverage (2007). He shows in a series of experiments how generative methods, built to enhance the query by generating morphological variants of query terms, are more economic and nearly as efficient as reductive methods, building on normalising the index and query terms to a common normal representation, through stemming or lemmatisation. 3.1. Frequent case generation For the Finnish language, where the expected gains of more informed morphological processing are likely to be great due to the expansive character of Finnish morphology4",", Kettunen finds that using the generally observed most frequent case forms for nouns – nominative, genitive, partitive in and the three inner locative cases5","instead of trying for complete coverage of all possible forms of the noun gives a practical rendition of the actual usage, useful for information retrieval purposes. His experiments were performed by replacing each noun in the query by nine terms or twelve terms, depending on whether plural inner locatives are used or not (2006). 3.2. Comparison with best-case baseline In Kettunen’s and his colleagues’ experiments, full, high-coverage, high-quality reductive index and query normalisation using TWOL, an established commercially available morphological tool based on two-level morphology (Koskenniemi, 1983), gives the consistently best results, as might be expected. However, their findings show that generative methods were often almost as useful as the best-case baseline and always better than doing no morphological analysis, raising recall noticeably. This was achieved at a much lower processing cost than doing full morphological processing.","4","Finnish nouns can theoretically assume close to two thousand forms if all possible suffixes are factored in.","5","Inner locative cases – inessive, illative, and elative – are cases to describe physical location with respect to something. They are prototypically used for expression of something being inside something, something entering or being inserted into something, or something exiting or being ejected from something else. They carry approximately the same meaning as English prepositional expressions with “inside”, “in”, “into”, “out of”: pinteessä “in trouble”, hississä “inside the elevator”, ojasta allikkoon “out of the frying pan into the fire”, Helsinkiin “to Helsinki”."]},{"title":"1501","paragraphs":["Kettunen and colleagues also found that in a strict relevance setting, where only the most relevant documents were targeted, the difference between the methods narrowed to less than in experiments where a more inclusive or liberal measure of relevance was used, indicating that in an interactive web service setting, where precision is the overriding concern, the savings occasioned by a generative method have less attendant cost than in a high-recall type scenario. In other experiments by the same team, similar results (although with somewhat lesser effect) are reported for Swedish and German (2007)."]},{"title":"4. Does morphology mean anything?","paragraphs":["Kettunen’s point of departure, as is the case of most morphological analyses in information access experiments, is that morphological variation is noise and that conflation techniques should be introduced to reduce this noise as much as possible with least possible effort. It is quite conceivable that morphology has as its sole func-tion to organise local structure in the linguistic signal, and that once an utterance is perceived and understood the morphological variation given by its terms can be discarded as being irrelevant for text-level semantics. This is the view of most efforts in morphological analysis for information retrieval applications – many studies have been made for various languages showing how morphological normalisation of surface variation has beneficial effects on retrieval results. However, it is also possible that the converse holds: the analysis of morphological variation may well yield semantic information on a level which can be utilised to better find relevant documents by its terms. This latter hypothesis, that of the text-level meaningfulness of morphological variation, has been tested in several experiments in the past, using information retrieval experimentation as a target, always with equivocal results for English or other languages with less elaborate morphologies. A generative query processing framework allows hypothesis testing on another level. Terms can be treated heterogenously. Place names can be expanded in local cases, person names in animate cases, neither should be pluralised indiscriminately. Kettunen explicitly states he will not experiment using semantic distinctions, to avoid reliance on knowledge rich sources such as lexica, domain specific word lists, gazetteers, and the like. This is a reasonable research strategy, but in practical application these distinctions could be mined from the text using entity recognition algorithms. Similarly, the case form distribution of terms in texts, irrespective of semantic qualities, could be mined to establish the topical poignancy of a term for a given topic. The topical qualities of a term in the target text could be expected to have influence on the morphological guise it is presented in. This should be easier to establish in languages with elaborate case marking, where e.g. some case forms typically indicate the head word is used as an adverbial rather than topical focus or centrality. 4.1. Query term frequencies in the target corpus In the experiment presented here we take the search terms in the brief topic title queries used in the evaluation referred to in Section 2. and examine what case forms they occur in throughout the assessed relevant and non-relevant documents. We use the nine-form paradigm established by Kettunen to be most efficient: nominative, genitive, partitive in singular and plural and the three inner locative cases in singular. For instance, for query 200 Saksan ja Hollannin tulvat (“Flooding in Holland and Germany”), we examine the case forms of saksa (“Germany”), hollanti (“Holland”), and tulva (“Flood”) in the target texts. In Table 3 we show some observations of case forms of search words in the CLEF corpus for Finnish."]},{"title":"5. Observations","paragraphs":["Our methodological goal in this given experiment is to build on hypotheses informed by some sense of textual reality, rather than computational expediency, and to evaluate the results by discriminatory potential of search terms. The alternative is to run an information retrieval task using some hypothesis as a basis for a new scheme to weight query and index terms: this a risky procedure if the goal is to understand the convergence of textual structure, terminological choice, and topical relevance since the effects may be completely overshadowed by noise or other, more powerful, topical factors. While the full set of experiments aims at information retrieval effect, we have here studied the basis of word-occurrence based retrieval: occurrence of search terms in target texts. Without significant difference in occurrences of search terms in relevant vs non-relevant documents no effects in document retrieval can be expected to emerge from the full extrinsic information retrieval evaluation. Our overriding hypothesis is that morphological variation carries some signal of topical variation for terms in text. The observation we make supports this hypothesis: the most frequent case forms of Finnish terms are distributed significantly differently for query terms in relevant and non-relevant texts. This skewness in distribution has potential to be used in several different ways. In a standard adhoc retrieval set-ting it has some potential for weighting query and index terms differently depending on their case and rôle in text of for the informed implementation of a generative approach such as is porposed by Kettunen. Alternatively, in future more semantically demanding applications, this distributional difference can be utilised to winnow out segments of text where informative terms e.g. occupy topical foreground or background, or where the narrative focus shifts with respect to some content bearing terminology."]},{"title":"6.
