We then compare our results with synsets of Japanese WordNet. From a viewpoint of Japanese WordNet, the degree of agreement of “Attribute” between our data and Japanese WordNet was 22%.

Introduction","paragraphs":["A thesaurus is a classification of semantically categorized words organized by concepts. Several kinds of thesauri exist, such as Princeton’s WordNet in English and the EDR concept dictionary in Japanese and English. However, Princeton’s WordNet and WordNets in various languages are particularly weak regarding the relations among adjectival concepts. If a thesaurus could be built from corpora, then lexical meaning could be observed objectively, and lexical semantics in a thesaurus could be described more fully. To construct a thesaurus from corpora, this paper addresses the following questions: 1) How to extract attribute concepts of adjectives like","[feeling], [temperature], and [color] from corpora;","and 2) How to automatically organize attribute concepts","obtained in question 1) by establishing similarity","relations and hierarchical relations among attribute","concepts. We focus mainly on question 1). The statistical extraction of semantic relations of words, such as hypernym-hyponym relations or part-whole relations, from corpora using syntactic patterns has been done in previous work (Hearst 1992, Caraballo 1999, Berland and Charniak 2000, Pantel and Ravichandran 2004, etc.). However, as for the detection of a hypernym concept (or a category) of an adjective, there has been relatively little research. We describe various syntactic and semantic conditions for detecting abstract nouns referring to the attribute concept of adjectives from text, and then try to compare our results with Japanese Wordnet, though it is not completed yet."]},{"title":"2. Concepts in Linguistic Ontology","paragraphs":["When organizing concepts in a thesaurus, all concepts are related to each other in a hierarchical relation. Below is an example of the hierarchical relation of superordinate concepts for the word “rabbit” from WordNet:        - [entity] - [physical entity] - [object, physical object] - [whole, unit] - [living thing, animate thing] - [organism, being] - [chordate] - [vertebrate, craniate] - [mammal, mammalian] - [placental, placental mammal, ...] - [lagomorph, gnawing mammal] - [leporid, leporid mammal] ","Each word list in [ ] is a concept node that categorizes words, and in each concept node synonyms are classified as instances. For example, in the [leporid, leporid mammal] node, the synonyms “rabbits” and “hares” are classified as instances. In the [lagomorph, gnawing mammal] node, synonyms referring to [lagomorph, gnawing mammal, etc.], such as “mice,” “rabbits” and “hares”, are classified as instances. The following figure shows part of the structure of hierarchical concepts and their instances. { } is a group of instances.  → [placental mammal] {monkeys, lions, mice, rabbits, hares, ...}","→ [lagomorph, gnawing mammal]","{mice, rabbits, hares, ...}","→ [leporid, leporid mammal]","{rabbits, hares, ...}  In our work, the abstract noun that we extracted is considered as a concept and an adjective is considered as an instance belonging to the concept."]},{"title":"3. Linguistic Analysis of Attribute Concepts and their Adjectives 3.1 Semantic functions of Japanese abstract nouns","paragraphs":["The types of semantic functions of abstract nouns are shown below.

However, we consider an example like “atmosphere” in example 2 of item 1, which encapsulates these complex pieces of information in a “lexical” nominal concept. Some abstract nouns can represent a small range of connotation and a wider range of denotation. Since this type of abstract noun is an expression of formalization, the meaning of an abstract noun is more transparent. An abstract noun sometimes refers to an upper-level concept (Takahashi 1975, Nemoto 1969). Some examples are given below. In the following example “jotai (condition)” can be omitted:  (5) kokkai wa fuanteina joutai da.","(national assembly) (unstable) (condition) (is an auxiliary indicating predication)","The national assembly is now in an unstable condition.  In this case, “jotai (condition)” can be omitted if the usage of the adjective “fuanteina” is changed from adnominal usage to predicative usage, that is, “fuanteina” (in adnominal usage) “fuanteida” (in predicative usage).  (5’) (kokkai wa) fuanteida. (be unstable)","(The national assembly is unstable.)  In this example, “jotai (condition)” is transparent and an upper-level concept of “fuanteina (unstable)” which implies the meaning of “jotai (condition).” We analyze linguistic conditions and rules for the extraction of “instance – its concept” relations between adjectives and nouns by using the linguistic clue of “omission” according to the syntactic usage of an adjective.

Collected examples First, we collected examples from 10 years of newspapers according to the syntactic pattern shown in section 3.2.1.

Rule 1) Omission of “X” Here is an example of being able to omit “X” without changing its meaning.

After choosing data, we check chosen examples by using some rules for excluding unsuitable examples. The rule for exclusion of unsuitable examples is as follows.  Rule 2) (For adnominal usage) In the “Adj X no N (N of Adj X)” pattern, if “X no N (N of X)” is completed without an adjective, the example is excluded, because, if X is a transparent word, “X no N (N of X)” is not completed without concrete expression.  Rule 3) Change “X” into “because of X” ","(13) The lens of my glasses is thick. X N Adj","(14) The depth of this hole is shallow. X N Adj  When we compare the semantic relations between “X” and an adjective in examples 14 and 15 (that is, the relation between “lens” and “thick”, and the relation between “depth” and “shallow”), the distance of the semantic relation between N and an adjective is different. The relation between “depth” and “deep” seems to be a “concept and its instance” relation, on the other hand, the relation of “lens” and “thick” seems to be related to each other via an intermediate concept like “thickness.” In our data, examples like the above example are not chosen. In this case, we can change “The lens of my glasses are thick” into “My glasses are thick because of the lens"]},{"title":".","paragraphs":["” N Adj X On other hand, we cannot change “The depth of this hole is shallow” into","“This hole is shallow because of the depth.” N is Adj X In the case of the above examples, we will choose “The depth of this hole is deep” instead of “The lens of my glasses is thick.”  In Japanese,  (15) Watashi no megane wa renzu ga buatsui.

We compare our extracted data with the domain of adjectives in Japanese WordNet First version of Japanese WordNet started from translating WordNet 3.0.Based on the translation of about 5000 core synsets created automatically using multiple existing thesauri, it has been modified and extended manually (Isahara et.al 2008; Bond et.al 2008). In the structure of WordNet, there are “synset (a group of synonyms)” and “pointer” indicating a relation with another synset. “Pointer” indicates “Derivationally related form,” “Also see,” “Antonym,” “Attribute,” and “similar to,” “Pertainym” and so on. Each pointer links words to related synonyms. In the adjective domain of Wordnet, the pointer “Attribute” is linking an adjective to synonyms representing the upper-level concept of adjectives. For example, “high” is related to “[degree][grade][level]” via the pointer “Attribute.” First of all we investigated how the extracted 267 abstract nouns are covered with synonyms of “Attribute” in WordNet. The number of “Attribute” of adjectives in WordNet is 639. Among them, 146 abstract nouns corresponding to ”Attribute” were obtained from our data. From a viewpoint of Japanese WordNet, the degree of agreement of “Attribute” between our data and Japanese WordNet was 22%.
