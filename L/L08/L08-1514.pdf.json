An efficient user interface benefits from a well-organized corpus that can be used for investigating the strategies people use in conversations in order to be efficient and to handle the spoken communication problems. For modeling the natural behaviour and testing the model we need a dialogue corpus where the roles of participants are close to the roles of the dialogue system and its user. For that reason, we collect and investigate the Corpus of the Spoken Estonian and the Estonian Dialogue Corpus as the sources for human-human interaction investigation. The transcription conventions and annotation typology of spoken human-human dialogues in Estonian are introduced. For creating a user interface the corpus of one institutional conversation type is insufficient, since we need to know what phenomena are inherent for the spoken language in general, what means are used only in certain types of the conversations and what are the differences. "]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["The most natural way of language use is spoken communication. As the technology is developing, intelligent user interfaces to different databases that enable spoken language input become more sophisticated and more popular. An efficient user interface benefits a lot from a well-organized corpus of spoken language that can be used for investigating the strategies people use in conversations in order to be efficient and to handle the spoken communication problems.  Thus the analysis and modeling of the spoken language requires a corpus. The corpora used for investigating human-human communication and for user interface creation are generally restricted to interaction in the framework of certain tasks which the user interface is designed for. For example, the COCONUT 1","corpus includes computer-mediated human-human dialogues in which two subjects cooperate on buying furniture for a house. The VERBMOBIL 2","corpus includes bilingual situational dialogues recorded with a role-playing manner (schedule arrangement, hotel, sight-seeing). The TRAINS 3","corpus includes problem solving dialogues where one participant plays the role of a user and has a certain task to accomplish, and the other plays the role of the system by acting as a planning assistant.  Our goal is to model natural dialogue on the computer, i.e. the computer as a dialogue participant must follow the norms and rules of human-human communication as much as possible. For modeling the natural behaviour and  1 http://www.pitt.edu/~coconut/ 2 http://verbmobil.dfki.de/ 3 http://www.cs.rochester.edu/research/trains/ testing the model we need a dialogue corpus where the roles of participants are close to the roles of the dialogue system and its user.  Studies of spoken language have shown that language usage is variable and some of the variants are rare, they appear only in large corpora. At the same time, the variants are used in certain domains. Therefore, such variants can not be excluded when implementing a user interface. Secondly, the grammar of spoken language is interactional which means that different grammatical constructions are connected with certain communicative functions.  We would like to show that both the interaction studies and interaction modeling could benefit from a large corpus. Such corpus comprises of different varieties of the spoken interaction, so that it is possible to distinguish between the traits inherent for the spoken language in general (comparing it to written language) and the specific traits of varieties on all language layers (lexis, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics). For that reason, we collect and investigate the Corpus of the Spoken Estonian and the Estonian Dialogue Corpus as the sources for human-human communication investigation. We analyse human-human dialogues in order to find out how Estonians communicate with each other, how they express their intentions and understand each other, how the language use depends on Estonian cultural space. A large national spoken language corpus makes it possible to provide such background studies.  We investigate the corpora using quantitative analysis and especially qualitative microanalysis in order to find out the conditions that supervise principles of language use."]},{"title":"2025 2. The Corpus of Spoken Estonian","paragraphs":["The corpus of spoken Estonian is planned as an open","corpus. Our corpus is divided by the five dimensions that","influence the language use (Hennoste, 2000):","• social and dialectical background of the","interactants","• dialogue vs monologue","• the degree of spontaneity of speech","• the closeness of contact between participants","(immediate, telephone or mass-media)","• the degree of casuality (institutionality) with","four sub-boundaries: relations between","participants (familiar vs unknown); roles of the","participants in the situation (private person vs","representative of an institution); physical setting","(private room vs official room); main purpose of","the interaction (participation vs information)."," The corpus includes mainly audio recordings. Currently the corpus comprises of 1777 transcribed texts, or 1,171,817 text units (words, vocal units, e.g. pause fillers or UM-s in our terminology, pauses) in total. Typical stretches of transcribed everyday conversation and longer institutional dialogues are about five to fifteen minutes long. Shorter institutional dialogues and phone conversations have been transcribed fully. The proportions of the corpus are as follows: ","• telephone conversations 63% (1116):","159 private calls","953 institutional calls: 466 directory inquiries, 93 travel agency information requests, 87 outpatients’ department, 66 services (post office, car workshops etc.), 45 telesales conversations, 32 colleagues dialogues, 24 shopping information, 23 taxi calls, 16 bus transport information, 109 other conversations (incl. 4 false connections)","","• face-to-face conversations 29% (521):","164 everyday conversations","357 institutional dialogues or monologues: 101 shop dialogues, 29 service dialogues (post office, library, shoemaker, hairdresser etc.), 20 conversations between strangers on the streets, 17 doctor-patient encounters, 24 interviews, 15 travel agency dialogues, 12 classroom interactions, 11 meetings, 25 conference presentations, 16 lectures, 10 sermons, 77 other conversations","","• media broadcasts (TV and radio) 8% (140): 42","TV, 98 radio."," The corpus is transcribed using a transcription system of the conversational analysis (CA, see Hutcby & Fooffitt, 1998: 77-92) so that the categories crucial from the interactional point of view are used in the transcription (Hennoste, 2000). The central categories are (transcription symbols see Appendix):  • turn-construction units (TCU, utterances in our terminology), which end in a potential transition relevance places. The main criterion for boundaries of the utterance is intonation (Hennoste & Rääbis 2004: 27-30; cf.

Dialogue Act Annotation 3.3.1. Basics of Dialogue Act Typology","paragraphs":["When communicating, people perform actions using language – they are asking, answering, etc. Such actions have been called communication acts, dialogue acts etc., and they have been determined as functions which are connected with a speaker’s intentions. Several researchers have considered practical problems of determining dialogue acts in the last decade – corpus linguists, discourse analysts, language technologists (e.g. Allwood et al., 2001; Stolcke et al., 2000; Jokinen et al., 2001).  In our corpus, dialogue acts are annotated by using a special annotation typology elaborated at the University of Tartu (Ex 3, Gerassimenko et al., 2004). Our typology is general, not domain- or problem-oriented and can be used for annotating both spoken human-human and human-machine dialogues. Still, the major part of our typology coincidences with well-known typologies (e.g. DAMSL, SWBD-DAMSL).  Our dialogue act typology is based on the principles of organization of conversation borrowed from CA. CA is based on an empirical, inductive microanalysis of conversation data (see e.g. Hutchby & Wooffitt, 1998). The main idea behind the analysis is that conversation is the collaboration of participants based on three mechanisms: turn taking organization (turn construction and turn distribution), repair organization, and sequence organization (preference organization and adjacency pairs). CA considers turns and does not consider dialogue acts or dialogue act typology. However, a turn can consist of different acts. For that reason, we prefer to consider dialogue acts. The principles of our dialogue act typology are as follows (Hennoste & Rääbis, 2004: 15-37).  1. We differentiate acceptable units (which can be analysed) from the non-acceptable units (as DAMSL does). Non-acceptable are only technically un-interpretable utterances in our typology (and not e.g. unfinished utterances). 2. The departing point of the CA is that a partner always must react to the previous turn regardless of his/her own plans and strategies. Therefore the analysis of relations between two turns is central. Some classes of dialogue acts conventionally form pairs where the first act makes the second act relevant. Such related act pairs are called adjacency pairs, AP (e.g. greeting – greeting, question – answer). The computer must be able to differentiate the first part of an AP (which is expecting a reaction) from the acts that do not expect any reaction as well as understand whether the following act is expected or not. In our typology, the acts are divided into AP acts and non-AP acts. Every AP act has the first pair part and second pair part (cf. forward-looking and backward-looking functions in DAMSL).  3. The acts used in dialogue are typically divided into two groups – information acts (questions etc.) and communication managing acts (rituals, feedback etc.). The studies have shown that human-human communication is never completely fluent. Therefore, a mechanism is needed to signal and solve different interactional, grammatical and semantic problems. All dialogue act typologies include problem solving acts but typically they belong to different dialogue management or feedback acts and do not form a whole sub-system (cf. Allwood et al., 1992; Bunt, 1999). For example, in DAMSL one repair act represents communication status (Abandoned) but most of the them belong to the group of backward-looking acts (Signal-non-understanding, Completion, Correct-misspeaking, Repeat-rephrase).  CA assumes that there exists a problem solving mechanism with its own rules, which is called repair organization. CA brings out four types of the repair mechanism (Schegloff, 1979): self-initiated self-repair, other-initiated other-repair, other-initiated self-repair, self-initiated other-repair. The first two are initiated and made by the same person, the others by different persons. It is important to note that in many cases similar means are used in making up of information acts as well as repair acts. For example, most of the other-initiated self-repairs are questions. The computer has to understand when the question is about information and when it initiates repair.  Therefore, we have divided the communication managing acts into two sub-groups: the acts managing fluent conversation, or dialogue managing acts, and the acts for solving communication problems, or repair acts. "]},{"title":"2028","paragraphs":["4. A turn can consist of several acts. Acts of the turn can be related with the acts in previous or the following turn but acts of one turn can be related one with another as well. We bring separately out such acts that are related with previous acts of the same speaker in the same turn.  5. Our typology is empirical and open. It is based on the presupposition that dialogue acts are empirical phenomena and it is impossible to predefine theoretically all the acts. For that reason, every act group includes a sub-group ‘other’. This sub-group includes the acts that are not determined in the current typology. If needed, a new act group will be defined on the basis of this sub-group.  Summing up, we can say that there are two main classification principles of dialogue acts in our typology. First, acts are divided into single acts and adjacency pair acts where the first pair part makes the second pair part relevant. Secondly, the acts are divided into three groups: information acts, the acts managing fluent conversation, and the acts for solving communication problems.  There are 12 groups of acts in our typology, the overall number of dialogue acts is 127.","3.3.2. Overview of Typology","I. AP acts","DIALOGUE MANAGING ACTS 1.

Responses (continuer, acknowledgement, etc.) – acts that traditionally are considered as narrow feedback. Using such acts, the hearer reacts voluntarily to the partner’s previous turn."," Names of the dialogue acts consist of two parts separated by a colon: the first two letters give abbreviation of the name of an act-group, e.g. QU – questions, VR – voluntary responses. The third letter is used only for AP acts – the first (F) or the second (S) part of an AP act; 2) full name of the act, e.g. QUF: WH-QUESTION, QUS: GIVING INFORMATION, VR: CONTINUER (Ex 3).  Dialogue acts have been annotated manually using software that simplifies the selection of texts from a corpus and dialogue acts from a list. Two linguists annotate the same text separately and then a third person disambiguates the annotations. For each utterance, a qualitative microanalysis is performed. The analysis is based on CA and interactional linguistics.  (3) C: mt=.hh tere, RIS: GREETING","Hello.","öelge=palun: p̀ensioniameti t̀elefoni","(.) .h ǹumber (.) T̀artus.

Some of dialogue act typologies consider them as a single group.

In our opinion, such approach is too general and does not differentiate the different uses of the dialogue acts. Sometimes directives and questions are differentiated on the basis whether the user does need some information (question) or (s)he wants to influence the hearer’s future non-communicative actions (directive). We claim that it is not important for dialogue continuation whether the hearer must to do something outside of current dialogue or not. (S)he must react both to a question and a directive because both are the first pair parts of APs.  We differentiate directives and questions on the basis of their form. Questions are the info-requests which have specific formal features (interrogatives, specific word order etc.). Questions can be further classified on the basis of the expected reaction: 1) wh-questions, 2) alternative questions, 3) closed yes/no questions, 4) open yes/no questions, 5) yes/no questions offering answer.  Closed yes/no question expects an answer yes or no. Open yes/no question is expressed in Estonian using the same means as closed yes/no but the expected answer is giving information like in case of wh-questions (kas te saaksite mulle öelda X telefoni?/ could you give me the phone of X?). Yes/no question offering answer, includes a presumption of a true answer (pluss maksud, jah?/ taxes added, yes?). Therefore, both directives and questions are the first parts of APs but they have different linguistic forms (Hennoste et al., 2005; Hennoste et al., 2006)."]},{"title":"4.2.

Three situation types are represented in selected sub-corpus: directory inquiries, calls to outpatients’ offices and taxi requests (Table 1).  In our data, requests are formulated in four possible linguistic ways: directive (almost exclusively with verb in conditional), wh-question, open yes/no question and closed yes/no question. Closed yes/no questions expect an answer yes or no. The other utterances expect giving information or an action of a service provider.  Table 1 shows that most of requests are directives and that directives and questions are used with different frequency in different situations. The qualitative microanalysis demonstrates that directives and questions are used in different preconditions. Let us compare the use of directives (DIF: REQUEST) and open yes/no questions (QUF: OPEN YES/NO).  The taxi requests (ordering a taxi) are formulated mainly as directives (Ex 4).

Still, callers use mainly a directive as they claim their entitlement to make the request. Contrary to that, questions are used when a caller"]},{"title":"2030","paragraphs":["is not sure whether his request can be granted (e.g. because of the limits of chargeless care funded by sick fund may be already reached the end, Ex 7).

Therefore, if a caller doubts the receptionist’s ability to grant the request then (s)he chooses the format of a question and does not use a directive.  The calls to the directory inquiries are different in two ways both from taxi calls and calls to outpatients’ offices. First, the caller wants to get information, not to elicit an action of an official. Secondly, there are different types of information to inquire of. In our data, we have inquiries mostly of phone numbers, which are asked in 45 cases (75%), there are fewer inquiries of addresses, opening hours of institutions, fields of activity of firms, etc.  Almost all the inquiries of phone numbers are clearly formulated, an institution is specified exactly. The linguistic format is a directive (Ex 8). Only in few cases the caller was uncertain about the exact address of the company or was not sure about some other facts.  (8) palun 'Tallinna 'Tõnismäe 'hambapolikliinik. DIF: REQUEST Tõnismäe dentist office in Tallinn please.  The second group of inquiries is formed as open yes/no questions. Here we find both requests of phone numbers and of other data. First, there are inquiries of general data (do you have any data about, are there any hours when they answer to the phone calls, where to call if someone has lost his job, etc.). A caller is not sure whether there is any information available, or whether an answer can be given because of request is too vague. Secondly, there are requests for certain special information.  General data and the special information are requested also in a form of a directive. Why a caller uses questions instead of directives? The choice has been typically explained as an act of politeness. However, there are examples to show that there may be other reasons either additionally to politeness influencing the choice or there may be rather different reasons to use a question instead of directive. In the example 9 the caller does not know whether such a number is included in the data base at all.  (9) palun kas teil 'on: 'Vesseli kaupluse 'numbrit 'Elvas. QUF: OPEN YES/NO Please do you have the number of the Vessel shop in Elva.  Or the caller may admit that (s)he does not know what exactly (s)he is about to make inquiry. Or (s)he may lack of the personal experience and expertise in calling to directory inquiries.  Summing up, our analysis demonstrates that there exists no difference between formulating the requests which expect filling a gap in knowledge (e.g. with a phone number) and the requests that expect an action of a receptionist or an operator (e.g. sending a taxi). The analysis has shown that almost all of usages of open yes/no questions can be explained with the uncertainty of a caller about the possibility of having the request granted (the data base may not contain the data; background information given by the caller is too general to perform the search; the inquiry is formulated too vaguely).  There is another significant feature to point at. In all cases, a directive is used for frequent and typical requests (ordering a usual taxi, booking an appointment with a doctor, making inquiry of a phone number).  As mentioned before, a decision in favour of a question sometimes has been explained with politeness. There are different means for expressing politeness in languages, and using a question is only one of them. Our analysis does not confirm the claim that a question form is used for a polite request. There are other means used in our data, e.g. conditional mood, some polite words (e.g. palun ‘please’). Only 7 requests (5 directory inquiries, 2 taxi calls) do not have these markers.  We claim therefore that a speaker is certain in requesting frequent and typical things and more hesitant in rare cases. Being certain in granting his/her request the caller chooses a directive, and contrary being uncertain the caller chooses the format of a question."]},{"title":"5. Conclusion","paragraphs":["We argue for the necessity of studying human-human spoken conversations of various kinds in order to create different user interfaces to databases. We have collected a corpus of spoken Estonian and an Estonian dialogue corpus. We are investigating and comparing various human-human conversations with the aim to create intelligent user interfaces which can respond to a user in a way a human official does.  For creating a user interface the corpus of one institutional conversation type is insufficient, since we need to know what phenomena are inherent for the spoken language in general, what means are used only in certain types of the conversations and what are the differences. One needs to analyse large corpora for different registers in order to explain how and why people use different language means in different situations and for different purposes. We certainly need restricted (sub-)corpora for certain tasks or research areas and they can be easily created from a large corpus."]},{"title":"2031 6.
