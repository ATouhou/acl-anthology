Since corpus users are usually linguists with little interest in technical matters, we have developed a system where the user need not have any prior knowledge of the search system. Furthermore, no previous knowledge of abbreviations for metavariables such as part of speech and source text is needed. All searches are done using checkboxes, pull-down menus, or writing simple letters to make words or other strings. Querying for more than one word is simply done by adding an additional query box, and for parts of words by choosing a feature such as \"start of word\". The Glossa system also allows a wide range of viewing and post-processing options. Collocations can be viewed and counted in a number of ways, and be viewed as different kinds of graphical charts. Further annotation and deletion of single results for further processing is also easy. The Glossa system is already in use for a number of corpora. Corpus administrators can easily adapt the system to a wide range of corpora, including multilingual corpora and corpora with audio and video content.  "]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["This paper describes the corpus search interface system Glossa, a system that combines high user-friendliness with advanced search, viewing and post-processing facilities. With Glossa, a corpus administrator can make a wide range of corpora available for querying with little effort. The system is available as described in section 2. The reason for developing Glossa was the realization that if the full potential of corpus-based linguistics studies is to be achieved, corpora have to be made available for all students and researchers in language studies, not just computer experts, specialized computer linguists and corpus linguists. It is essential to create high-quality corpus interfaces. There are several corpus interfaces available, see e.g. Johannessen et al. (2000), Bick (2004), Hoffmann and Evert (2006). However, they have limitations:  • some are not network-enabled (i.e. each user has to download and manage corpora) • some lack flexibility with regard to queries, results display and post-processing • many are tied to a specific corpus • few are completely GUI-driven  Typically, applications require queries to be formed as regular expressions in some formal language, such as the one defined by CWB (Corpus Workbench), see Christ (1994), Evert (2005). However, many corpus users find it difficult to learn such query languages, with their requirements for accurate use of parentheses, asterisks, percentage signs etc. Furthermore, applications often require the users to know the full tag set before querying the corpus. That is, knowledge of both tag inventory and tag names and abbreviations is necessary, as well as abbreviations of source texts, etc. Again, corpus users are often unwilling to invest the time necessary to learn such basics, before using a corpus. For many potential users, these issues act as a threshold, preventing them from making easy or efficient use of corpora tools. We believe that an easy-to-use, flexible graphic user interface is important for maximizing the potential of corpora in research, development and teaching. Furthermore, the interface should not presuppose full-text access to the corpora, as licence conditions may prohibit free redistribution, even if they often do allow web-based querying. Glossa satisfies these criteria. Finally, corpus applications do not usually have advanced results management as part of their standard user-interface. Glossa comes with a comprehensive array of result processing options."]},{"title":"2. The Glossa search interface system","paragraphs":["The Glossa search interface system uses the IMS Corpus Workbench (Christ 1994) and the relational database MySQL as a back-ends, and has a web interface that allows users to create complex queries in very simple ways, and browse, process and download result sets. Glossa supports all types of corpora, both multilingual and multimodal, with various amounts of annotation. For parsed corpora (treebanks), the similar SearchTree (Nygaard and Johannessen 2004) system can be included. All programming code is available under an open source licence. The Glossa system is already being used with several corpora, including the following written language corpora: the Oslo Multilingual Corpus, a parallel corpus for Norwegian, English, German, French, Dutch and Portuguese (Johansson and Hofland, 1994), corpora for North Sámi and Lule Sámi, and Danish, French and Macedonian corpora, as well as several other monolingual Norwegian corpora that are either in place, or in the process of being included under the Glossa umbrella. The system is also being used with spoken language corpora, with multimodal, transcribed audio"]},{"title":"617","paragraphs":["and video options: the UPUS corpus of multicultural Norwegian, the NoTa corpus of modern Oslo dialect, and the Taus corpus of Oslo dialects from 1970s (for the latter two, see Johannessen et al. 2006, 2007 and Johannessen and Hagen, 2007). These corpora can be accessed via the Text Laboratory’s website (see references). However, it should be noted that while access to most of them will be granted on request, several of them require special permission from their owners."]},{"title":"2.1 Queries","paragraphs":["The corpus user can specify any given token by attributes, such as:  • word • lemma • affix or part of word • part of speech • morphological features • syntactic functions • sentence position  Notice that these search attributes are independent of each other. Importantly, it is possible to search for part of speech without specifying a search string. All searches are done using checkboxes, pull-down menus, or writing simple letters to make words or other strings. Querying for more than one word is simply done by adding an additional query box. No regular expressions are needed to perform queries. As an example, consider how a query for a word beginning with the sequence “jump”, specified to be a noun and plural, would look like with a regular expression:  (word=\"jump.*\"%c&(number=\"pl\")&(pos=\"n\")) Figure 1. A regular expression in the language defined by CWB, for a plural noun starting with the letter","sequence jump.  With the Glossa system, the user instead writes the word jump into a box, and chooses any appropriate additional constraints by pulling down menus, removing the need to memorize complex tag-sets. Attributes can be negated and arbitrarily combined. Two or more tokens can be combined to form a phrasal search, where the number of unspecified positions between the tokens can be specified.         Figure 2. Query for a specific word (jump) limited to the","noun occurrences of this word. In multilingual corpora, one or more search phrases can be created for the aligned corpus. The graphical interface makes it easy to create queries. See figure 3.               Figure 3: A simple query for a bilingual search."]},{"title":"2.2 Results","paragraphs":["The results of queries in the Glossa system are presented as traditional KWIC lists. If available, the results can also be presented as audio/video, aligned text and annotation of tokens.             ","Figure 4: Part of the results window. Notice the action option on top and the clickable bibliographical","information link on the left of each result.  The attributes associated with the hit, but not displayed in the results, can be viewed by passing the mouse over the words, as seen in figure 5.               ","Figure 5: Results window, demonstrating the mouse roll-over effect."]},{"title":"618","paragraphs":["A transparent, modular set-up has been created to allow integration of further post-processing and browsing options (collocation analysis etc.). The results can be post-processed in a number of ways, including:  • sorting on matching phrases, bibliographic","information or arbitrary points in the context • counting matched phrases • downloading result set in various formats, e.g.","tab separated values and Excel spreadsheets • collocation analysis • co-occurrence analysis • user-defined annotation • singling out individual hits or whole results file","for saving or deletion • viewing with regards to metadata distribution  Figure 6 shows a collocation table selected in the action menu on the results page. The collocations option comes with several sub-options, as provided by the Ngram Statistics Package (Pedersen 2008). The user can choose between bigrams and trigrams, and between measures such as Dice Coefficient and Log Likelihood-ration.             Figure 6: Collocations of nouns beginning with jump-. Collocation is one of the choices in the action menu on","top of the results page (figure 3).  Bilingual query results are shown in figure 7. They are presented in the same way and have the same options as monolingual results.             Figure 7: Results from a bilingual query.  Figure 8 shows how the results page is enriched with a checkbox for each result, after the user has chosen the delete option in the action menu. This enables the user to remove individual hits. The results can be saved for further processing and refinement.              Figure 8. Results enriched with a box for ticking off hits","that should be deleted.  In addition to the option of deleting unwanted results, Glossa also offers the option of annotating results. These results can likewise be saved and further processed at a later stage. This can be seen in figure 9.              Figure 9: Annotated results.  Finally, results can be counted in a number of ways. Our final examples illustrate results from the query \"all occurrences of the Norwegian lemma bil 'car'\" in the corpus. The action Count was then chosen for the resulting hits, giving as a result the number of occurrences of each inflected form of the word. (For nouns there are four inflections: singular indefinite, singular definite, plural indefinite and plural definite – bil, bilen, biler, bilene.) The results are shown as two charts in figure 10 and 11.      Figure 10: Count results shown as histogram.            Figure 11: Count results shown as pie chart.

This enables queries to be limited according to criteria such as register, geography, time, and author. Often, only a particular section of a corpus is of interest to a user. For instance, we have seen how users of speech corpora are often interested in specific segments of society, defined by age, sex, social background, etc. Before the inclusion of sub-corpus constraint in Glossa, such users had to specify constraints manually each time they used the interface. With varying target groups, this process was both tedious and a source of error."]},{"title":"2.5 Speech corpora","paragraphs":["Glossa has been used extensively with speech corpora of transcribed audio and video material. The time codes generated during transcription allow accurate video streaming of the segments matching query hits. Figure 12 shows how the video corresponding to the query hits is viewed along with the results. Video context can be altered in the same way as the context of the hits themselves. We have chosen the QuickTime file format for streaming video content, though altering the scripts to allow for other formats would be simple. The time codes for each segment of transcribed video are stored in a database table and are accessed using the CWB indices.          Figure 12: Audio/video panel, used with speech corpus."]},{"title":"3. Conclusion","paragraphs":["The corpus query interface system Glossa is a user-friendly interface to corpora that gives the flexibility of a regular language, yet is still easy to use. The system provides advanced yet easy-to-use options both for search and for results management. The interface is also flexible with regards to annotation and licensing of corpora."]},{"title":"4.
