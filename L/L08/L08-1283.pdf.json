"]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["In the last seven years the IXA research group has been working on the Basque WordNet (Agirre et al., 2006). The focus have been on the representation of common vocabulary (we have incorporated around 27,000 words), but now, we have turned our attention to specialized language. Due to the unstoppable development of specialized language and terminology, it is becoming increasingly difficult to capture and organize terminological information. Domain ontologies are helpful to handle this kind of information, and have been shown to be useful in knowledge representation, management and exchange. For instance, there are several representative ontologies in the domains of e-commerce (UNSPSC1",", NAICS2","), medicine (GALEN3",", UMLS), engineering – EngMath (Gruber & Olsen, 1994), PhysSys (Borst, 1997)–, enterprise –Enterprise Ontology (Uschold et al., 1998)–, and knowledge management –KA (Decker et al. 1999). Moreover, in the NLP community domain ontologies are being used to develop and evaluate different computational systems and applications (Navigli et al. 2003; Sagri et al., 2003; Stamou et al., 2002; Roventini & Marinelli, 2003). The aim of WNTERM is to create a light-weight ontology belonging to the science and technology domains for Basque and English. WNTERM (i) stores the domain terminology, (ii) fixes relations among all the domain terms, and (iii) is connected to the Basque and English wordnets through the Multilingual Central Repository (MCR) (Atserias et al., 2004). In order to have WNTERM linked to the wordnets currently available, we decided to structure it following  1 http://www.unspsc.org 2 http://www.naics.com 3 http://opengalen.org the MCR framework, which we also used to build the Basque WordNet). The MCR model provides English-Basque equivalence links across the English and Basque wordnets, and it also offers the possibility of enriching both the Basque WordNet and WNTERM simultaneously. Domain ontology terms are imported into WNTERM from the MCR itself (more precisely, from the Basque and English wordnets) and the in-house Basic Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Science and Technology (BDST) data-base4",". Taking this sources into account, there are additional objectives which we want to address with WNTERM: (i) to extend the Basque WordNet with terminology, (ii) to organize hierarchically all the terms of the BDST according to the MCR architecture, in order to provide to lexicographers more specific information about a term in their navigation through the data-base, and (iii) to link all the sources in the project: the MCR, the BDST and the domain ontology (WNTERM). The final result of this project will be a domain ontology on science and technology, which will show the taxonomic and semantic relations among all its domain concepts, and which is also linked to the MCR and the BDST. In this paper we focus on the overall methodology for the construction of WNTERM, which will be illustrated on the ecology domain, a subset of science and technology. This paper is organized as follows. The resources used in this project are introduced in Section 2 (MCR and the Basque WordNet) and Section 3 (BDST). In Section 4, we present the methodology followed to create a domain ontology, illustrated on the ecology domain. Finally, future work is presented in Section 5.  4 http://www.zientzia.net/hiztegia/index.asp"]},{"title":"1778 2. The Multilingual Central Repository","paragraphs":["The Multilingual Central Repository (MCR)5","follows the model proposed by the EuroWordNet project6",". EuroWordNet (Vossen, 1998) is a multilingual semantic lexicon with wordnets for several European languages, which are structured as the Princeton WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998). It groups each languages' words into sets of synonyms called synsets, and records various semantic relations (such as hypernymy, hyponymy, meronymy, holonymy) between these synonym sets forming a hierarchy. Each of these synsets corresponds to a lexical concept and many have a textual gloss which often provides an explanation of what this concept represents. The MCR (Atserias et al., 2004) is a result of the 5th Framework Meaning project7","(Rigau et al., 2003). The MCR integrates in the same EuroWordNet framework wordnets from five different languages, including Spanish, Italian, Catalan and Basque (together with six English WordNet versions). The wordnets are currently linked via an Inter-Lingual-Index (ILI) allowing the connection from words in one language to translation equivalent words in any of the other languages. In that way, the MCR constitutes a natural multilingual large-scale linguistic resource for a number of semantic processes that need large amount of multilingual knowledge to be effective tools. For instance, the English synset {party, political_party} is linked through the ILI to the Basque synset {partidu, partidu_politiko, alderdi_politiko, alderdi}. The MCR also integrates the latest version of the WordNet Domains (Magnini & Cavaglià, 2000), new versions of the Base Concepts and the Top Concept Ontology (Álvez et al., 2008), and the SUMO ontology (Niles & Pease, 2001). The current version of the MCR contains 934,771 semantic relations between synsets, most of them acquired by automatic means. This represents almost four times larger than the Princeton WordNet (235,402 unique semantic relations in WordNet 3.0). Although these resources have been derived using different WordNet versions, using the technology for the automatic alignment of wordnets (Daudé et al., 2001), most of these resources have been integrated in the MCR maintaining the compatibility among all the knowledge resources which use a particular WordNet version as a sense repository. MCR was developed based on WordNet 1.6 version. However, for this project we have moved the MCR to the latest WordNet version (3.0), because WordNet 3.0 has a higher amount of terminology (than the 1.6 version). The result of the automatic mapping was manually corrected. We will now present WordNet domains and the Basque WordNet.  5 http://adimen.si.ehu.es/cgibin/wei5/public/wei.consult.perl 6 http://www.illc.uva.nl/EuroWordNet/ 7 http://www.lsi.upc.edu/~nlp/meaning"]},{"title":"2.1 WordNet Domains","paragraphs":["WordNet Domains8","(Magnini & Cavaglià, 2000) is a lexical resource where the synsets have been annotated semi automatically with one or more domain labels.

These labels group meanings in terms of topics or scripts, e.g. Transport, Sports, Medicine, Gastronomy. which were partially derived from the Dewey Decimal Classification. The version we used in these experiments is a hierarchy of 171 Domain Labels associated to WordNet 1.6. Information brought by Domain Labels is complementary to what is already in WordNet. First of all Domain Labels may include synsets of different syntactic categories: for instance Medicine groups together senses from nouns, such as doctor and hospital, and from verbs such as to operate. Second, a Domain Label may also contain senses from different WordNet subhierarchies. For example, Sport contains senses such as athlete deriving from person, game equipment from artifact, sport from act, and playing field from location."]},{"title":"2.2 The Basque WordNet","paragraphs":["The Basque WordNet9","was developed by the IXA research group10","developed within the framework of WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998)11",", as well as on its multilingual counterparts EuroWordNet and the MCR.

Besides, we also incorporate new synsets that exist for Basque but not for English. Due to EuroWordNet and the MCR frameworks, the Basque WordNet is already linked to the Spanish, Catalan, English and Italian wordnets, and it can also be linked to any other wordnet tightly linked to the English WordNet. Up to now, the Basque WordNet has been focused on general vocabulary leaving aside specialized language and terminology, and one of the goals of WNTERM is to enrich the Basque WordNet with terminological information.

In the following steps we select the concepts to be added to WNTERM and, the terms to be added. We finally structure the concepts in a hierarchical structure. We will illustrate the steps with data from the ecology domain."]},{"title":"4.1 Comparison of both sources","paragraphs":["The first step has been the comparison between both sources (the MCR and the BDST) in order to measure  13 www.ztcorpusa.net the amount of terms in each resource (and their overlap) taking into account the domain information across both resources. For this comparison an automatic procedure has been used, and the result have been qualitatively analyzed. In order to carry out this comparison, the first step has been the manual mapping of the domain labels of both resources. 4.1.1 Manual mapping of domain labels As we have mentioned in Sections 2 and 3, concepts of the MCR and the BDST have a domain label. However, each of these sources has a different domain classification. In the MCR there are 171 domains labels which are organized hierarchically (for instance, cinema, radio, post, tv, telegraphy and telephony are subdomains of telecommunications). BDST has 34 flat domain labels. As domain information is required to measure the overlap of concepts between both resources, we have manually mapped the 171 domain labels of the MCR to the 34 domain labels of the BDST. From the BDST domains 18 have been mapped to a single MCR domain, and 16 have been related to one or more domain labels of the MCR (e.g. telecommunications to cinema, radio, post, tv, telegraphy, telephony). Regarding MCR domains, 64 have been mapped to a single BDST domain, but 20 have been mapped to more than one (e.g. topography to geography, geology and town planning to architecture, building). 87 of the MCR domains have not been mapped to any BDST domain because of their high degree of specification (fencing, paranormal, numismatics), or because the BDST have not been enriched with these fields yet (religion, sport, gastronomy). 4.1.2 Automatic comparison and the resulting casuistry We performed an automatic analysis of the relation between the MCR and the BDST. We checked for overlaps of terms in each resource (both in English and Basque). If the term is found in both resources, we analyze whether the domain labels can be mapped (according to the domain mapping we described in the previous sections).

There are 51,469 terms overlapped in English and 26,379 in Basque. Therefore, as we expected, the overlap between the Basque WordNet and the BDST is smaller.

These terms must be previously checked by hand because some of them may not refer to the same concept. For instance, the term horn has been marked in the automatic comparison as 1-2, that is, this term is both in the MCR and in the BDST, but they have different domains. In the MCR the term horn can belong to the domain of anatomy and in the BDST belongs to zoology, both referring to the same concept (one of the bony outgrowths on the heads of certain ungulates). On the other hand, there is another horn in the MCR belonging to the transport domain (a device on an automobile for making a warning noise) which has nothing to do with the BDST term from zoology. Therefore, once more, these numbers are an underestimation of the real overlap between the MCR and the BDST.

This is not surprising, as the BDST focuses on just science and technology related terms. In any case, besides the construction of WNTERM itself, the cross-enrichment of both resources is significant, as both of them benefit from the information contained in the other. In the next subsections we will illustrate the methodology to build WNTERM on the terms from a single domain. Table 4 shows that it's in the medicine domain where the BDST could benefit the MCR most.

We focus on English (because the Basque WordNet is a subset of the English WordNet, and the Basque and English BDST are equivalent), and on the ecology domain. The idea is to take as basis the concepts (synsets) already in the MCR, and add all of them to WNTERM. If new concepts exist in the BDST, they are also added to WNTERM and manually linked to their corresponding superclass (hypernym). All the concepts in the MCR tagged with the ecology domain label, irrespective of their presence in the BDST, have been copied to WNTERM. In other words, those terms of the MCR tagged with the codes 1-0, 1-1, 1-3 and 3-1 have been directly added to WNTERM. Note that terms tagged with 1-2 and 1-4 have been ignored for the time being, because, as we said in section 4.1.3, these terms, having different domain labels from those in the BDST, must be previously checked by hand to confirm whether they refer to the same concept. We then have turned our attention to those concepts in the BDST not present in the MCR (those marked as 0-1). We first have examined term matching problems (see examples in section 4.1.3). If we think two terms are the same, and if the concept behind the term was not already in WNTERM, the relevant concept is copied to WNTERM. If the term corresponds to a concept which was not in the MCR, this has been copied to WNTERM, and a link to its hypernym in the Interlingual Index of the MCR added.

Adjectives have been also added (40) but due to the fact they can also function as nouns (e.g. mutant(s), perennial(s)), we have given special attention to their inclusion in WNTERM. For the time being, we have focused on the Elhuyar Basque Dictionary to decide their category. However, we would like to study the possibility of introducing these concepts twice (both as nominal and as adjectival) and relating them with the MCR XPOS_EQ_near_synonymy relation. This relation is used when a meaning matches multiple ILI-records simultaneously (in this case, a noun and an adjective), or when there is some doubt about the precise mapping."]},{"title":"4.3 Selection of terms","paragraphs":["The third step corresponds to the terms.

In the future, we would like to reorganize the hierarchy coming from the MCR, that is, to design the terminological hierarchical organization according to the criteria of domain experts (lexicographers working on the BDST).
