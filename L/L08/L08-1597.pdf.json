Introduction","paragraphs":["In this paper we present two large-scale verbal lexicons, AnCora-Verb-Ca for Catalan and AnCora-Verb-Es for Spanish, which are the basis for the semantic annotation with arguments and thematic roles of AnCora corpora. At present, AnCora (Martí et al., 2008; Taulé et al., 2008) is the largest multilevel annotated corpus of Spanish and Catalan consisting of 500,000 words each mostly from newspaper articles. AnCora is annotated with morphological (PoS), syntactic (constituents and functions) and semantic (argument structure and thematic roles, semantic class, named entities and WordNet senses) information. In AnCora-Verb lexicons, the mapping between syntactic functions, arguments and thematic roles of each verbal predicate it is established taking into account the verbal semantic class and the diatheses alternations in which the predicate can participate. Each verbal predicate is related to one or more semantic classes, depending on its senses. The main goal of this paper is to present the content of these lexicons and their resulting projection in the AnCora corpora (section 2). A quantitative analysis of the data it is also presented (section 3). Finally, main conclusions are drawn in section 4."]},{"title":"2. AnCora-Verb Lexicons","paragraphs":["AnCora-Verb lexicons were obtained by deriving, for each sense of each verb, all the syntactic schemata in which a verbal predicate appears in AnCora corpora (Taulé et al., 2008). From this information, the mapping from syntactic functions to thematic roles, and the corresponding argument position, was fully manually encoded in the lexicons. The semantic properties used in the characterization of predicates are based on the proposal of lexical decomposition of Rappaport-Hovav & Levin (1998) from which the concept of Lexical Semantic Structure (LSS) has been taken. For the characterization of the argument structure, we follow PropBank annotation system (Palmer et al., 2005)1",". In this direction, we follow the lines laid down by Kingsbury et al., (2002) in the construction of VerbNet. In AnCora-Verb lexicons, each predicate is related to one or more semantic classes (LSS), depending on its senses, basically differentiated according to the four event classes ─accomplishments (A), achievements (B), states (C) and activities (D)─, and on the diatheses alternations in which a verb can occur. Figure 1 shows the full information associated with the entry reforzar ‘to reinforce’: the lemma (reforzar), the different senses associated to their corresponding semantic classes (in this case LSS1.1 and LSS2.2), the mapping between syntactic function and thematic role (for instance, SUJ Arg0##CAU), and the diatheses alternations in which the verb occurs (in this case, ANTICAUSATIVA ‘inchoative’). As we can observe, the expression of the causative-inchoative alternation entails an argument crossing: the affected object, appears as direct object in the causative structure (CD Arg1##TEM) and as subject in the inchoative structure (SUJ Arg1##TEM). Furthermore, the expression of this alternation also involves an aspectual change, since the causative reading corresponds with an accomplishment (LSS1.1) and the inchoative reading with an achievement (LSS2.2). Finally, examples are also included.  1 The arguments selected by the verb are incrementally numbered –Arg0, Arg1, Arg2, Arg3, Arg4– expressing their degree of proximity in relation to its predicate. The adjuncts are labelled as ArgM. The list of thematic roles consists of 20 different thematic labels: AGT (Agent), AGI (Induced Agent), CAU (Cause), EXP (Experiencer), SCR (Source), PAT (Patient), TEM (Theme), ATR (Attribute), BEN (Beneficiary), EXT (Extension), INS (Instrument), LOC (Locative), TMP (Time), MNR (Manner), ORI (Origin), DES (Goal), FIN (Purpose), EIN (Initial State), EFI (Final State) and ADV (Adverbial)."]},{"title":"797","paragraphs":["reforzar - 01 LSS1.1 (A1) SUJ Arg0##CAU CD Arg1##TEM EX: “La subida en dos décimas de la tasa de paro","reforzó la tendencia al alza”2","  +ANTICAUSATIVA LSS2.2 (B2) SUJ Arg1##TEM EX: “Si dos neuronas se activan, sus conexiones se","refuerzan”3"," ","Figure 1: Lexical entry of reforzar ‘to reinforce’ in AnCora-Verb-Es  In order to guarantee the coherence and quality and to ensure the correct mapping between arguments, thematic roles, syntactic functions and LSS, inter-annotator agreement tests were carried out in the building process of the verbal lexicons. After a first proposal of verb classes and their corresponding arguments and theta-roles, a group of seven trained linguists elaborated a subset of 30 verbal entries. The resulting entries were compared, the disagreements discussed and the verb classes modified when necessary. This process was applied over several subsets of 30 verbs until no relevant disagreements arose. Disagreements were mainly due to differences in class assignment (LSS), and therefore also in the thematic role assignment. For example, in Spanish, a verb in a passive (‘pasiva refleja’) or inchoative (‘anticausativa) construction can appear with the pronoun se, and it is not always easy to decide which of them the correct interpretation is and, obviously, the consequences are also very different. If we opt for the passive reading, the Arg0 is an Agent, whereas if we choose the inchoative reading the Arg0 is a Causer. The identification of multiwords, for instance the treatment of light verbs, is also especially problematic, basically when it is necessary to decide if a given structure corresponds to a verb and its complements or to an idiom (tener + ganas vs. tener_ganas, ‘to need’ or ‘to want’).

Automatic Annotation","paragraphs":["AnCora-Verb lexicons were used for the semiautomatic","tagging of the AnCora corpora with arguments, thematic","roles and semantic classes. A set of manually written rules","automatically mapped part of the information declared in","these lexicons onto the syntactic structure (Martí et al.,","2007). We defined three different types of rules taking","into account the kind of information they were based on:","a) Rules based on a specific function or morphosyntactic property. For example, if the predicate has associated the verbal morpheme ‘PASS’ (passive voice), then its subject has the argument position Arg1 and the thematic role patient (SUJ-Arg1-PAT).","b) Rules based on the semantic properties of the predicates. For instance, when predicates are monosemic, the mapping between syntactic function and argument and thematic role as well as the assignment of the semantic class is directly realized. In the case of polysemic verbs, the mapping can be partial because it is only automatically assigned the unambiguous information.","c) Rules based on the type of adverb or prepositional multiword appearing in a specific constituent. For instance, if the prepositional multiword a_causa_de (‘because_of’) or the adverb aún (‘still’, ‘yet’) in Spanish, appears in an adverbial complement","(function = CC), then it is automatically assigned","the argument and thematic role ArgM-CAU (an","adjunct argument with the thematic role cause) as","well as ArgM-TMP (an adjunct argument with the","thematic role temporal) respectively. We applied these rules following a decreasing heuristic according to the degree of generality, that is, we applied first the more general rules of type a), secondly the type c) rules and, finally, the type b) rules. In the automatic annotation process we obtained either full annotations – containing information about the arguments and the thematic roles– or partial annotations with only arguments or thematic roles. This procedure permits to automatically annotate 60%4","of the expected arguments and thematic roles with a fairly low error (below 2%) (Martí et al., 2007). Given the high quality of the results obtained we claim that this methodology is very suited for the semiautomatic approach to corpus annotation and able to save a significant amount of manual effort. Afterwards we manually completed the thematic role annotation in order to guarantee the accuracy required to support the final resource. The Catalan corpus, AnCora-Ca, is already completed for the 500,000 words, while the semantic manual checking covers, up to now, the 100,000 words of the Spanish corpus, AnCora-Es. The Spanish corpus will be completed at the end of this year."]},{"title":"3.

In table 1, the distribution of these verbs’ senses in semantic classes it is shown for both languages. The average of senses per lemmata is 1,86 for Spanish and 2,09 for Catalan. Table 1 shows that the semantic class with the highest number of different verbs, in both languages, is by far the transitive-agentive class (A2) followed by the unaccusative-state class (B2) and the causative-transitive class (A1). It has to be noticed that in B2 class the passive or inchoative constructions coming from other classes (A1, A2 and A3) as result of a diatheses alternation are also included. For instance, the passive alternation of the verbal predicate verificar ‘to verify’ (from A2 semantic class) is annotated as B2 (See figure 2). The expression of most alternations entails an aspectual change, which necessarily implies a change of semantic class.  4 From which the 94% corresponds to full annotations and 6% to partial annotations."]},{"title":"799","paragraphs":["402 336 1917 1563 95 55","163 124 194","150 1185 867","207 190 106 108","14 7 35 43 179 211 9 6 7 11 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 2000 A1 A2 A31 A32 B1 B2 C1 C2 C3 C4 D1 D2 D3 Catalan Spanish ","Table 1: Verbs associated to each semantic class   verificar - 01 LSS1.2 (A2) SUJ Arg0##AGT CD Arg1##PAT EX: “(...)verificar la responsabilitat dels actuals directius”5","  +PASSIVA LSS2.2 (B2) SUJ Arg1##PAT EX: “(...) que es verifiqui l’honradesa dels càrrecs publics”6","","Figure 2: Lexical entry of verificar ‘to verify’ in","AnCora-Verb-Ca  Next we present the figures corresponding to the projection of AnCora-Verb-Es and AnCora-Verb-Ca lexicons in AnCora-Es and AnCora-Ca corpora respectively (See table 2 and table 3).

Notice that despite the difference in corpus size, the percentages overlap to a great extent. However, this overlapping does not take place in all verbs. Table 4 and 5 show that, for example, in the attributive-state class (C2) and the beneficiary-state class (C4), the 10 more frequent lemmata represent the 83,9% and the 75.89% of the total verbal tokens of these classes for Spanish, and for Catalan the 88,94% (C2) and the 92.8% (C4).
