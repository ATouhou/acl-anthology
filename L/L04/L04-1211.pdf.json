Results for translations from Spanish and Catalan into English are presented on the LC-STAR trilingual corpus which consists of spontaneously spoken dialogues in the domain of travelling and appointment scheduling. Results for translation from Serbian into English are presented on the Assimil language course, the bilingual corpus from unrestricted domain. We achieve up to 5% relative reduction of error rates for Spanish and Catalan and about 8% for Serbian."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["The goal of statistical machine translation (SMT) is to","translate an input word sequence  ","","in the source","language into a target language word sequence","","","",".","Given the source language sequence, we have to choose","the target language sequence that maximises the product of","the language model probability     ","and the translation model probability","","","","","","","","","",". Those two probabilities can be modelled independently of each other. The translation model describes the correspondence between the words in the source and the target sequence whereas the language model describes well-formedness of a produced target sequence. For descriptions of SMT systems see for example (Brown et al., 1993; Vogel et al., 2000).","In order to improve the translation process, it is possible to perform preprocessing steps in both source and target language sequence and, if necessary, the inverse transformations are applied to the generated output sequence. In the work presented here, we apply transformations only on the source language sequence which has the more inflective morphology. We investigate possibilities for improving the quality of translation from morphologically rich languages into English using word stems and suffixes and different types of language resources in the source language.","Source languages in our experiments are Spanish, Catalan and Serbian. Additional language resources used in the experiments are Spanish and Catalan part-of-speech (POS) tags and base forms whereas for Serbian no additional language resources were available."]},{"title":"2. Transformations in the Inflected Language","paragraphs":["One of the main problems when translating an inflected language into English is a low coverage of the probabilistic lexicon: since existing SMT systems usually regard only full forms of the words, translation of full forms which have not been seen in the training corpus is not possible even if the base form or stem of the word has been seen.","Another problem is that an English word might correspond to only a part of a word in the another language. For example, the Spanish word ”estamos” corresponds to the two English words ”we are” (the stem ”esta” corresponds","to the word ”are” and the suffix ”mos” to the word ”we”). We propose two methods to overcome these problems:"," making use of word stems and suffixes which are automatically determined"," using base forms and part-of-speech (POS) tags which are given as additional language resources 2.1. Related Work","There are many publications about discovering of word morphemes and splitting words (e.g. (Goldsmith, 2001), (Creutz and Lagus, 2002)), but the use of morphemes for statistical machine translation has been not investigated yet.","Most of the work about the use of morpho-syntactic information for SMT considers the translation from German into English. In (Nießen and Ney, 2001) hierarchical lexicon models containing base forms and POS tags are proposed. (Koehn and Knight, 2003) investigated different empirical methods for splitting German compounds.","In this work, we investigate separation of different information sources contained in one single source word using different language resources for the translation from Spanish, Catalan and Serbian into English. 2.2. Treatment of Spanish and Catalan Verbs","Spanish and Catalan have an especially rich morphology for verbs. Person and tense are expressed by the suffix so that many different full forms of one verb exist. Also, in both source languages the subject pronoun (e.g. I, we, it) is usually omitted, which often causes missing pronouns in the English translation.","We introduce two types of transformations to the verbs using two types of language resources provided by Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC) (Arranz et al., 2003) such that a verb form that is more convenient for translation into English is obtained, and the number of unseen word forms is reduced:"," Base-POS representation Additional language resources used for this method are POS tags and base forms. The full form of the verb is replaced with its base form and the sequence 1585 of relevant POS tags. POS tags corresponding to person and future or conditional tense are considered to be relevant for translation into English."," Stem-suffix representation","Additional language resources needed for this method","are POS tags. A list of suffixes which corresponds to","the set of relevant POS tags is defined and those suf-","fixes are split from the stem. The suffix list is obtained","by counting co-occurences of the POS tag","","of the","source word","and possible suffixes  :","","","","","","","","","  ","Æ","","","","","","","  Æ ","","","","","","","where","is total number of","running words. Too long and too short suffixes are","dropped using a simple heuristic: if suffix","","","is ex-","tension of the suffix","","(for example","","","","",", one","suffix is","","","","","and the other is","","","","), drop the","shorter one if","","   \\b  ","","","   \\b ","","","",", otherwise drop the longer","one. Threshold  is empirically set to","","",". Examples","of transformed Spanish verbs are shown in Table 1. original base-POS stem-suffix English estoy estar 1S est +oy Iam estaremos estar F 1P esta +remos we will be tendrı́an estar C 3P tend +rı́an they would have Table 1: Examples of transformed Spanish verbs 2.3. Treatment of Serbian Words","Serbian as a Slavic language has a very rich morphology","for all open word classes, whereby the information con-","tained in the suffix is usually not relevant for translation","into English. Therefore we reduce the words of this lan-","guage into stems. We split the word into stem and suffix and","then drop the suffix. Since no additional language resources","were available for this language, for each word (indepen-","dently of the word class) an optimal splitting point is found","automatically by iterative application of the slightly mod-","ified frequency method described in (Koehn and Knight,","2003). We use harmonic mean as a metric instead of geo-","metric mean because geometric mean always prefers splits","in which either the stem or (more often) the suffix con-","sists of a single letter. In the first iteration, counts of all","possible stems ","and suffixes","","are collected by taking","into account all possible splits","","","","","","","","for each word",".","Given these counts, for each word","we choose the split","","","","","\\b","","with the highest harmonic mean of its stem and","suffix count:","  ","\\b",""," \\b","\\t","","","","","\\b","","","","","","","","    ","\\b","","","","","","","","  ","","\\b","","","",". If the harmonic mean of this optimal split is larger than the count of the word itself","","","","the word is replaced with stem and suffix, otherwise the word is left unsplit. The new suffix and stem counts are collected from the split words, and the procedure is repeated until the possible splits do not change anymore.","Example of transformation of an adjective is presented in Table 2 (suffix depends on the gender and on the case). original stem English mali mal small (boy) mala mal small (girl) malim mal (with a) small (boy) malom mal (with a) small (girl) Table 2: Examples of reduced Serbian words"]},{"title":"3. Experiments and Results","paragraphs":["As already pointed out, transformations were applied in the source language, and then training and search were performed using the transformed source language data. The translation system we used is the Alignment Templates system with scaling factors (Och and Ney, 2002). Modifications of the training and search procedure were not necessary.","Evaluation metrics used in our experiments are WER (Word Error Rate), PER (Position-independent word Error Rate) and BLEU (BiLingual Evaluation Understudy) (Papineni et al., 2002). Since BLEU is an accuracy measure, we use 1-BLEU as error measure. 3.1. Translation Results for LC-STAR","The experiments are performed on the trilingual corpus which is successively built in the framework of the LC-STAR project. It contains Spanish, Catalan and English full form text, POS tags, as well as Spanish and Catalan base forms. At the time of our experiments it consisted of about 13k sentences and 120k running words.","As Table 3 shows, both preprocessing methods reduced the vocabulary size and the number of singletons in the Spanish and Catalan training corpus, as well as number of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words in the development and test corpus. Nevertheless, they are still larger than in English corpus.","Table 4 presents an assessment of translation quality for both language pairs Catalan-English and Spanish-English. We see that there is a small but consistent decrease in all error rates for both transformation methods and for all test sets except for Spanish test corpus. A reason for this exception might be the large number of sentences containing the expression “que te parece” which corresponds to “what do you think about” in the reference English sentences whereas for the transformed source corpus this expression tends to be translated as “how about”. Therefore we performed an additional control experiment on the Spanish test set, namely additional rescoring of the best hypotheses using both the baseline system and the new system (the details of the method are described in (Och and Ney, 2001)). The results presented in Table 5 show the decrease in word error rates for both preprocessing methods. For the other test sets, rescoring does not yield significant improvements.","From translation examples (Table 6, Table 7) it can be seen that for the transformed corpus the system is able to produce correct or approximatively correct translations even if the full form has not been seen in the training corpus (marked by ”UNKNOWN ” in the baseline result example). Furthermore, the improved system is better capable of producing the correct English pronouns. 1586","Spanish Catalan English","Original Transformed Original Transformed Original","Train Sentences 13352 Words+Punctuation 118534 135316 118137 135515 123454 Vocabulary 3933 2969 3572 2844 2154 Singletons 1844 1314 1658 1262 790","Dev Sentences 272 Words+Punctuation 2217 2531 2211 2541 2267 OOV 35 (1.2%) 27 (1.0%) 36 (1.6%) 26 (1.0%) 21 (0.9%)","Test Sentences 262 Words+Punctuation 2451 2800 2470 2819 2626 OOV 30 (1.2%) 23 (0.8%) 35 (1.4%) 25 (0.8%) 18 (0.7%) Table 3: Statistics of the training, develop and test set of the English-Spanish-Catalan LC-STAR corpus","Develop Test","WER PER 1-BLEU WER PER 1-BLEU","Catalan Baseline 28.3 24.1 50.1 25.4 22.3 44.5 Base+POS 27.7 23.0 48.9 24.9 21.4 42.8 Stem+Suffix 27.7 22.8 48.7 24.6 21.1 43.1","Spanish Baseline 27.4 23.5 49.4 24.0 20.8 42.5 Base+POS 27.0 22.9 48.5 25.8 21.6 44.3 Stem+Suffix 26.6 22.2 48.1 24.4 20.9 43.1 Table 4: Translation error rates [%] for Catalan–English and for Spanish–English","Test","WER PER 1-BLEU","Spanish Baseline 24.0 20.8 42.5 + Base+POS 23.8 20.5 41.8 + Stem+Suffix 23.5 20.2 41.8 Table 5: Translation error rates [%] for the rescored Spanish–English test set 3.2. Translation Results for Assimil","The experiments are performed on the small bilingual corpus containing about 3k sentences and 25k running words from unrestricted domain of the Assimil language course.","Table 8 shows the significant reduction of vocabulary size and number of singletons in the training corpus, as well as of the number of OOV words in develop and test corpus. As we can see in Table 9, there is a significant decrease in all error rates when reduction to the word stem is applied. Since the redundant information contained in the suffix is removed, the system can better capture the relevant information and is capable of producing correct translations for unseen word forms."]},{"title":"4.
