Introduction","paragraphs":["Especially for English, the number of hand-coded electronic resources available to the Natural Language Processing Community keeps growing: annotated corpora, treebanks, lexicons, wordnets, etc. Over the last decade, virtually every professional conference has had at least one talk describing a new -bank, a new -net or a new -lex. Unfortunately, initial funding for such projects is much easier to obtain than the additional funding needed to enlarge or improve upon such resources. Thus once one proves the usefulness of a resource, it is difficultto make that resource reach its full potential. This paper discusses techniques for combining dictionary resources and producing others by semi-automatic means. This makes it possible to enrich existing resources while building new ones efficiently. This paper describes several resources that we created and/or enriched by combining automatic and manual approaches. These resources have become an integral part of our work on NomBank, a project with the goal of annotating noun arguments in the Penn Treebank II corpus (PTB). NomBank is part of the larger effort to add logical and semantic levels of annotation to the Penn Treebank. The firstpart of that effort to be completed was PropBank (Kingsbury et al., 2002; Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002)."]},{"title":"2. Resources to Start With","paragraphs":["We began with the following hand built resources:"," COMLEX Syntax (Macleod et al., 1998a) – a syntactic dictionary of nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs."," NOMLEX (Macleod et al., 1998b) – a dictionary list-ing 1000 nominalizations, their related verbs, and correspondences between the verbal arguments and syntactic positions within the noun phrase."," PropBank’s Frame Dictionary (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002) — Lexical entries providing verbal argument structure for The University of Pennsylvania’s PropBank Project"," The Verb Index from (Levin, 1993) – a downloadable index of the verb classes described in the cited work."," CATVAR (Habash and Dorr, 2003) – A dictionary pairing up lexical items related by derivational morphology. The creators of CATVAR used both previous resources and automatic procedures."]},{"title":"3. Sketchy Dictionaries and Word Lists","paragraphs":["We also created several sketchy dictionaries initially by automatic means, but then hand edited them, deleting items and classifying others with simple labels. These sketchy wordlists were used as the basis of more structured entries. They included lists of:","1. Potential nominalizations and corresponding verbs from COMLEX","2. Morphologically related adjective/adverb pairs from COMLEX","3. Morphologically related adjective/noun pairs from COMLEX 4. Verbs that take atypical subjects","The nominalization/verb list (1) and adjective/adverb list (2) were created by checking for noun/verb and adjective/adverb pairs with large shared prefix strings, e.g., the pair destruction/destroy share the prefix destr-. Same strings were collected as well as prefixes with specified pairs of suffixes. For example, anesthetist/anesthetize share the prefix anesthet and match the suffix pair -ize/-ist and slow/slowly share the suffixpair NULL/-ly. Other morphological rules were also applied so that some near pairings would be allowed, e.g., a final “i” was assumed to match a final “y” in a pair of prefixes. This technique overgenerates somewhat producing odd pairs like secretary/secrete and we edited the results by hand to compensate for this. For the adjective/noun list (3), we used a different method. We classified a subset of the nouns in the PTB by hand and then extended the pairs by analogy: from each pairing 1095"]},{"title":"Verb/Noun Pairs NOMLEX Verb IndexLevin 1993 COMLEX FramesPropBank Verbs with Atypical Subjects CATVAR PairsAdverb/Adjective NOMLEX−PLUS NomBank Frames COMLEX−PLUS ADJADV PairsAdjective/Noun","paragraphs":["Figure 1: The Relation Between Dictionaries of an adjective and its related nominalization, we extracted the pair of endings that mark the differences between these two words; then we used all such pairings to derive additional adjective/nominalization pairs. For example, the pair of endings in -ability/-able can be extracted from the pair durability/durable and then used to identify the pair availability/available. The nominalization list was also extended by this same method.","We created a list of verbs that take atypical (e.g., themes/patients) subjects (4) in order to get accurate role assignment. As we already had a list of alternating verbs (the Levin classes), we focused on intransitive verbs. We started with the set of verbs from COMLEX Syntax that meet the following criteria: (a) the verb can occur with no complement (INTRANS); (b) the verb cannot take a simple NP complement (NP); and (c) there is some nominalization of that verb in our database. We then edited this list, keep-ing only verbs that took atypical subjects. This last limitation was artifact of our task – we were only concerned with arguments of nominalizations."]},{"title":"4. The New Resources","paragraphs":["We used the above word lists and previously constructed resources to create the new resources described in this section. Figure 1 shows the relationships among the dictionaries and word lists above and the new resources described below. Arrows indicate a “deri ved from” relation. 4.1. NOMLEX-PLUS","NOMLEX-PLUS is a 7050 entry extension of NOMLEX (it includes the original 1000 entries of NOMLEX). NOMLEX-PLUS has 4900 entries for nominalizations of verbs, 550 entries for nominalizations of adjectives and 1600 entries that fall into 16 classes for argument-taking nouns including PARTITIVE nouns (a VARIETY of books), RELATIONAL nouns (PRESIDENT of the company, Mary’s FATHER), ATTRIBUTE nouns (the VOL-UME of the sphere), among others.","Beginning with our semi-automatically classifiednominalizations of adjectives and verbs, we label the remaining common nouns in the PTB as either some type of nominalization, one of 16 other classes of argument-taking nouns (relational noun, partitive, etc.) or as nouns that do not take arguments, in which case they are excluded from the dictionary. Default noun argument to verb argument mappings were then used to create NOMLEX-style entries to record how syntactic positions within the NP are filledby particular argument types. Additional information was added to mark verb alternations (using the Levin verb index) and similar information was added by hand.","These 5450 nominalization entries include the original 1000 NOMLEX entries. The main differences between the additional 4450 NOMLEX-PLUS entries and the entries from its predecessor are:","1. The NOMLEX entries were created by hand, whereas the NOMLEX-PLUS entries were created as described above. This means that the mappings in the NOMLEX entries tend to be more accurate. In contrast, the NOMLEX-PLUS entries reflect a set of defaults associated with the complement classes in the COMLEX entry of the related verb and various other factors, e.g., some of the classes in (Levin, 1993) are taken into account. For example, by default, simple transitive (NOM-NP) complements allows: (a) both the verbal subject and object to occur in possessive or prenominal modifierposition; (b) allows the verbal subject to occur as the object of the preposition by; and (c) allows the verbal object to occur as the object of the preposition of.","2. NOMLEX only lists nouns that are related morphologically to verbs, whereas NOMLEX-PLUS includes nouns that take arguments like nominalizations, but are not morphologically related to any verbs. These “cousins” of nominalizations were manually associated with verbs with similar argument taking properties. For example, the entries for ado and anniversary were based on the entries for fuss and commemorate.","3. NOMLEX-PLUS includes nominalizations of adjectives. As with the nominalization of verb entries, argument assignment was created by a system of defaults based on the COMLEX Syntax entry for the adjective.","Similarly, a NOMLEX-like entry was provided for each of the 16 noun classes. These entries were based on nominalizations that belonged to a particular class. For example, the entries for partitives were based on the entries of the 1096 (NOM :ORTH “abduction” :VERB “abduct” :NOM-TYPE ((VERB-NOM)) :VERB-SUBC ((NOM-NP :SUBJECT","((DET-POSS)(N-N-MOD)(PP :PVAL (”by”)))",":OBJECT","((DET-POSS)(N-N-MOD)(PP :PVAL (”of”))))))) Figure 2: SimplifiedNOMLEX-PLUS entry for abduction nominalizations variety and cascade and entries for RELATIONAL nouns were based on entries for teacher, leader and director. This means that our entries for relational nouns are like entries for subject nominalizations. Further-more, it means that to the extent possible, if a nominalization belongs to one of the 16 classes, the nominalization entry and the noun class entry will make mostly the same predictions about argument structure. This redundancy is desirable because it means that the dictionary will handle nouns with similar argument in similar ways, even if one noun is a nominalization, e.g., variety and another is a partitive noun, e.g., multitude. In a sense, the classes may be thought of as standardized sets of “cousins” of nominalizations.","A simplifiedNOMLEX-PLUS entry is provided for abduction in figure2. This is based on the fact that the verb abduct takes an NP complement in COMLEX Syntax and our defaults for that complement class. 4.2. ADJADV","ADJADV is a dictionary definingadverbial uses of adjectives. For example, possible in possible abduction has a meaning similar to the epistemic adverb possibly. Similarly, the word finehas the same evaluative meaning regardless of whether it is used adjectivally (finebehavior) or adverbially He behaved fine. We began with all the adjectives in the Penn Treebank Corpus (regularized for -er and -est inflection) and we pulled out every adjective that was associated with an adverb either by the list we created at NYU (this accounted for the -ly inflection and adjective/adverb pairs that had the same orthography, e.g., fine) or was associated with some adverb by CATVAR. In some cases, manual inspection showed that a different adverb should be associated with the adjective than predicted by these word lists. For example, we recognize the adjective awesome in his awesome performance has a similar meaning to the adverb amazingly in He performed amazingly, but has little in common with the adverb awful as predicted by the more automatic means. Thus we derive an adverb-like entry for awesome based on COMLEX’s entry for amazingly. A sample ADJADV entry is provided as figure3. Possible values for :FEATURES are a subset of the ones for adverbs in COMLEX Syntax. 4.3. COMLEX-PLUS","COMLEX Syntax dictionary has over 100 complement classes for verbs, but much fewer for nouns. In particular, it lacks PP complements for nouns. Fortunately, many of (ADJADV :ORTH “possible” :ADV “possibly” :FEATURES ((META-ADV :EPISTEMIC T))) Figure 3: Sample ADJADV entry for possible","(NOUN :ORTH “abduction” :SUBC ((PP :PVAL (“of ” “by”)))) Figure 4: COMLEX-PLUS entry for abduction the nouns that take PP and other complements are found in NOMLEX-PLUS. We can therefore apply some simple rules for adding PP complements to the nouns in COMLEX. Similarly, we can add any missing clausal arguments for nouns. Our procedures used the postnominal noun argument positions referenced in each NOMLEX-PLUS entry to augment the corresponding noun in COMLEX. For example, the NOMLEX-PLUS entry for abduction in figure 2 would cause our procedures to add PP complements headed by of and by to form the COMLEX-PLUS entry in figure4. 4.4. NomBank Frame Dictionary","NOMLEX-PLUS, the University of Pennsylvania’s verb frames and other information such as our list of verbs with atypical subjects were used to automatically generate lexical entries for all argument-taking nouns in the PTB. These entries provide an inventory of the role labels (ARG0, ARG1,",") which occur for particular nouns (in simple cases these correspond to subject, object, indirect object, etc). These are now being used as our initial lexical entries for NomBank, although annotators modify them as needed. Figure 5 is a simplifiedNomBank lexical entry for abduction.1","In this case, the frame is a mirror of the verb frame for abduct."]},{"title":"5. Using These Resources: Present and Future","paragraphs":["The NomBank Frame Dictionary is a necessary part of the NomBank annotation project. By automatically creating initial versions of these lexical entries, we are greatly 1","This figure uses lisp-like format for compatibility with the other lexical entries presented here. However, there is an equivalent XML format for use with NomBank.","(PBNOUN :ORTH “abduction” :ROLE-SETS ((ROLE-SET1 :ID “abduction.01” :SOURCE “v erb-abduct.01” :NAME “T O CARRY SOMEONE OFF BY FORCE” :ROLES","((ROLE :DESCR “AGENT” :N “0”)","(ROLE :DESCR “PATIENT” :N “1”))))) Figure 5: Sample NomBank Lexical Entry for abduction 1097 increasing the speed at which these entries can be created. In fact, we err on the side of overgenerating choices of role-sets rather than undergenerating. The annotators can then delete some of the choices when they see what actually occurs (it is much easier to delete text than to create new text). As discussed above, many of the previous resources were involved in creating this resource. Sometimes, annotator feedback is used to improve the mapping procedure. In addition, annotators can help edit the resulting resources. For example, as a side-effect of the NomBank project, annotators have contributed to improving both accuracy and coverage of ADJADV and NOMLEX-PLUS. This is in addition to their work on the NOMBANK frame dictionary, which is an integral part of the NOMBANK project.","In some related work, we intend to use all of these resources as part of an effort to automatically produce predicate argument structure from Penn Treebank II format text (either the Penn Treebank itself or Penn Treebank-based parser output). This research will surface as both: (a) part of GLARF (Meyers et al., 2001a; Meyers et al., 2001b; Meyers et al., 2002), a formalism and set of mapping procedures for producing a typed feature structure representation of predicate argument structure; and (b) automatic NomBank annotation. For example, given the NP, her possible abduction to derive the proposition:","REL = abduction, ARG1 = her, ARGM-MNR = possible which could be paraphrased as “Possibly , somebody abductor her”. The above dictionary entries provide sufficient information to automatically identify her as the object or ARG1 of abduction. The DET-POSS or possessive position is an option for both object and subject position in figure2. Furthermore, both slots can be filledby a human (her) on selectional grounds as indicated by the “AGENT” and “PERSON KIDNAPPED” :DESCR features in the ARG0/ARG1 slots in figure5. Nevertheless, barring selection restrictions, this sort of ambiguity is usually resolved in favor of the object position, barring other considerations, e.g., in the original NOMLEX, additional features can be stated that override this tendency. Note that other information can force a subject reading, e.g., in her abduction of the puppy, the of phrase can only be interpreted as an object. Thus only the subject role can be reasonably assigned to her.","We will use GLARF output to automatically produce NomBank annotation. We will use this automatically produced annotation as both a preprocessor for human annotation and as a tool for finding errors in human annotation. The human annotator will have a chance to survey the quality of the automatically produced annotation before using it. If the annotator decides that the quality is high enough, he/she will edit the automatically produced annotation rather than starting from scratch. If the automatic annotation contains too many errors, we may compare it with the human annotator output as an aid for error detection."]},{"title":"6.
