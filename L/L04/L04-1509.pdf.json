A key problem is the large amount of ambiguity in automatically extracted data. In the paper, I argue for a conservative approach that treats ambiguous instances as counter-evidence. It is nonetheless possible to obtain detailed morphosyntactic information from the corpus data with the help of partial disambiguation and by exploiting systematic ambiguity classes."]},{"title":"1. Introduction 1.1. Morphosyntactic preferences","paragraphs":["Text corpora are a valuable source of raw material for lexical resources in the fields of lexicography (e.g. paper dictionaries), terminology (e.g. terminological databases), and natural-language processing (machine-readable dictionaries etc.). So far, most tools for the extraction of candidate data are based on frequency counts for individual (lemmatised) words and word combinations (collocations). These are combined with a statistical analysis in terms of a random sample model to correct for the effects of chance: only significantresults can be generalised beyond the particular source corpus from which they were extracted.","For all three kinds of applications, it is also quite often important to obtain information about the distribution of morphosyntactic features such as number (Sg, Pl), case (Nom, Gen, Dat, Acc in German), definiteness of noun phrases (Def, Ind, Nil = no determiner), etc. Such frequency distributions provide cues for usage preferences both at the level of individual lexemes and at the level of collocations (where they are often even more conspicuous). The arguments in this paper are illustrated on the example of German nouns, but the results apply equally well to other parts of speech, to collocations, and to other languages with a sufficientlyrich inflectional morphology (though not necessarily to English, where e.g. most plural nouns can easily be identifiedby their -s suffix).","In German, the surface forms of nouns provide some information about their morphosyntactic features. However, because of syncretism in the inflectional paradigm, the values of features such as number and case often cannot be uniquely determined from the word form.1","The amount of ambiguity can be reduced when the syntactic context is taken into account, but some uncertainty will always remain, as is shown by the quantitative data in Section 1.2.. In general, there are three approaches for dealing with such incomplete information: (i) discard the ambiguous data altogether; (ii) apply statistical methods, e.g. a probabilistic","1","This problem is exacerbated by homographs, where different forms of two different lexemes share the same surface string. An example is the German noun form Zwecke, which can either be the singular of Zwecke “tack” or the plural of Zweck “purpose”. Such ambiguities are comparatively rare and difficult to resolve by fully automatic means, so I will ignore them in this paper. parser, to guess the true feature values; or (iii) the principle of maximum entropy, which assumes the most uni-form distribution compatible with the observed data. In Section 2.1., I argue that all three methods are liable to produce entirely misleading results under certain circumstances. Therefore, ambiguities have to be fully represented in the base data extracted from a corpus. Following well-established statistical methodology, they are always interpreted as counter-evidence in the quantitative analysis.","The main goal of the statistical analysis described in Section 2. is to detect the tendency of a word type (or a word combination) to occur with a specific value v for a morphosyntactic feature F. I use the notation [F = v] for this condition, e.g. [number = Pl] for plural number and [case = Gen] for genitive case. The resulting measure of morphosyntactic preference is a conservative estimate for the average proportion p","[F = v] of tokens with the specifiedfeature-value combination. It is also possible to measure negative preference, i.e. a tendency towards the condition [F 6= v]. For instance, some words or word combinations may prefer not to occur in genitive case, which is indicated by a high proportion p","[case 6= Gen]. 1.2. Syncretism and ambiguity","In this section, we will take a closer look at the amount of morphosyntactic ambiguity in corpus data, using the case feature of German nouns as an example. The source of this ambiguity is syncretism, where different feature-value combinations are expressed by the same surface form in an inflectional paradigm. For instance, the noun form Spiel “game” can have nominative, dative, or accusative case, but not genitive. Quantitative data for this phenomenon was obtained from the Negra corpus (Skut et al., 1998), which consists of 355,096 tokens of German newspaper text with manually corrected part-of-speech tagging, morphosyntactic annotation, and parse trees. For the research presented here, only the tokenisaton and part-of-speech tagging were used, while the annotation of morphosyntactic features (as well as lemmatisation) was performed by the IMSLex morphological analyser (Lezius et al., 2000).","Table 1 shows how many of the word form types of common nouns in Negra fall into each ambiguity pattern for the case feature. More than half of all different surface forms provide no information about the case of the noun at all. For the statistical analysis, however, the amount of cor-1539 types prop.

This table shows how much information different word form types provide about the case feature. pus evidence as measured by the number of tokens is a more important indicator than the number of different types. Table 2 shows that the ambiguity problem is even a little worse on this scale: a unique case value can be determined for less than 7% of all noun tokens. tokens prop.

This table shows the amount of corpus evidence (= number of tokens) for each case pattern.","From the noun forms alone, little can be said about case preferences, except for the condition [case 6= Gen] (i.e. a tendency to avoid the genitive). Fortunately, further disambiguation is possible when the (syntactic) context is taken into account, especially the agreement of determiner, adjectives, and the head noun in a noun phrase (with respect to case, number, gender, and definiteness). To this end, the YAC chunk parser (Kermes, 2003) was used to identify noun phrases (including center embedding but without adjuncts) in the Negra corpus, which are automatically annotated with partially disambiguated morphosyntactic information. YAC reaches excellent precision when applied to a corpus with “perfect” part-of-speech tagging, especially for the detection of prenominal adjectives and determiners that are relevant for the disambiguation step (Kermes, 2003, 141ff). Table 3 shows the remaining ambiguity after partial disambiguation using the automatically annotated noun phrases. Now more than 20% of the tokens identify case uniquely, another 40% are ambiguous between two case values, and only 21.4% still provide no information at all.","So far, we have only looked at ambiguity patterns for a single feature, and the statistical analysis in Section 2. will also be applied to each feature independently. Syncretism cuts across different morphosyntactic features, though, as in the case of the German noun form Hunde “dog”, which tokens prop.

This form is fully ambiguous with respect to both number and case taken individually, so that the partial morphosyntactic information it provides is entirely lost. Table 4 shows the combined case+number ambiguity patterns and their relative frequencies in the Negra corpus after partial disambiguation (based on agreement within noun phrases).2","The ambiguity pattern of Hunde (D1jN2jG2jA2) accounts for 1.64% of the corpus data only. Most patterns decompose orthogonally into separate ambiguity patterns for case and number, without loss of information (marked / in the table).3","These patterns account for 57,500 out of the 64,105 tokens found in the corpus (88.9%). The remaining 7,105 tokens (marked –) correspond to little more than 10% of the full data. Therefore, the loss of information entailed by the independent analysis of individual features is relatively modest and does not outweigh its advantages (such as the reduced amount of data that has to be stored and processed, as well as an easier interpretation of the results)."]},{"title":"2. Statistical analysis 2.1. The benefitof doubt","paragraphs":["In this section, I argue for a conservative approach to incomplete information.

This decomposition is orthogonal because any combination of the feature values appears in the original pattern. The pattern N1|G2, on the other hand, is not orthogonal: the individual ambiguities Nom|Gen and Sg|Pl can be combined into G1 and N2, which are not part of the original pattern.

These three numbers add up to the total frequency: fSg + f + fPl = f (schematised in Figure 1 with f = 100, fSg = 10 and fPl = 30). Ideally, the statistical analysis should be based on the true number of singulars in the corpus f","Sg (indicated by a vertical line in the diagram, where there is a slight preference for singulars with f Sg = 60).

Other approaches to incomplete information would also distort the results in an uncontrolled way (in fact, the predicted value of f","Sg might fall anywhere within the possible range). This can only be avoided when the ambiguity is fully represented and the analysis is based on the whole range of possible values for f","Sg.","For the binary feature number (which assumes only two values, Sg and Pl), the entire morphosyntactic frequency information is represented by the tripartite division shown in Figure 1.4","For the case feature with four different values, much more complex ambiguity patterns exist. In order to simplify the statistical analysis, I reduce these patterns to positive and negative evidence for each of the “simple” conditions [F = v]. Again, the set of instances of a type X is divided into f+ unambiguous positives, f unambiguous negatives, and the remaining f ambiguous tokens, with f+ + f + f = f . For example, positive evidence ( f+) for [case = Gen] is provided only by unambiguous genitives, while negative evidence ( f ) comes from all ambiguity patterns that do not include Gen (Nom, Dat, Acc, NomjDat, NomjAcc, DatjAcc, and NomjDatjAcc in Table 3). All other patterns contribute to the number of ambiguous tokens ( f ). The true number f","of instances with [F = v] must be somewhere in the range f+ : : : f f . The lower bound of this range ( f+) represents the amount of evidence supporting a positive preference [F = v], while the upper bound ( f+ + f = f f ) represents the evidence supporting a negative preference [F 6= v].","2.2. Confidenceintervals We cannot use the proportion of tokens with [F = v] (i.e. f f , which must fall into the range f+","f : : : f f","f ) directly as a quantitative measure for the strength of morphosyntactic preferences. For example, when there are f+ = 8 unambiguous positives out of f = 10 tokens, the corresponding proportion of 80% suggests a strong preference for [F = v], but it may equally well be a mere coincidence. In the standard random sample model for corpus frequency data, the","4","The true number f","Pl of plurals is given by f f","Sg, so that the","range of its possible values is a mirror image of the range for f","Sg. 1541 (true) observed frequency f",", conditioned on the total frequency f of the type X, has a binomial distribution whose success probability p","can be interpreted as the average proportion of occurrences of X with [F = v] in the language (or sub-language) from which the corpus was sampled.5","The maximum-likelihood estimate p","f","f is subject to considerable sampling variation, especially when f is small.

Binomial confidence intervals can easily be computed with a software package for statistical analysis such as R (R Development Core Team, 2003).6","In the example above, the confidenceinterval for f+ = 8 out of f = 10 tokens is p","2 [44:4%; 97:5%], so there is no significantevidence for a tendency towards [F = v].","In the presence of ambiguous data, binomial confidence intervals have to be computed for every possible value of f",".

Note that it is sufficient to compute two intervals: p+ is the lower bound pl for f","= f +, and p is","the upper bound pu for f = f f",". The extended confidence interval provides a conservative quantitative measure for the strength of morphosyntactic preferences. A large value of p+ indicates a tendency towards [F = v], while a small value of p indicates a tendency towards [F 6= v].","An implementation of the extended confidence interval in the R language is shown below.7","This code segment defines an R function bcf() which is in-voked with bcf( f+, f , f )$plus to compute p+, and bcf( f+, f , f )$minus to compute p .

There is a price to pay, though, in the form of a considerable loss of information. For instance, the pattern NomjAcc, which accounts for 31% of all tokens in Table 3, does not provide unambiguous evidence either for or against any of the two case values. The ambiguity inherent in this pattern may be due to our inability to extract complete information from the corpus, but it may also reflect a genuine “underspecified”tendency towards a set of feature values. The fact that the occurrences of type X often have Nom or Acc case (rather than Gen or Dat) does not necessarily imply that there is a single preference for [case = Nom] or [case = Acc].","In order to account for such underspecifiedtendencies, I definean ambiguity class A as a set of feature values, e.g. A1 := fNom; Accg for a tendency to occur in the nominative or accusative. The instances of a type X are divided into three subsets, yielding f+ tokens that satisfy the condition [F 2 A] unambiguously, f tokens that satisfy [F =2 A] unambiguously, and the remaining f ambiguous tokens. An extended confidenceinterval for the ambiguity class A can then be computed as described in Section 2.2.. In the example above, f+ is obtained from the patterns Nom, Acc, and NomjAcc, while f is obtained from the patterns Gen, Dat, and GenjDat, which rule out any of the values in A1."]},{"title":"3.
