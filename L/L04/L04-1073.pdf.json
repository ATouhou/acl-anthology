Introduction","paragraphs":["The increasing interest in NLP has pointed out the growing needs for linguistically precise broad-coverage language resources. In this context, LabEL has been developing large-scale lexicons and grammars for Portuguese. These language data are formalized and applied to texts using finite-state techniques. Automata and finite-state transducers (FST) are particularly suitable for easy and compact representation of different types of linguistic data. They reduce space and time overhead in text processing operations. Finite state technology is used to: (i) Build electronic dictionaries, by formalizing and","generating precise linguistic information related to","simple and multi-word lexical units: e.g. linguística,","linguistics; linguística computacional, computational","linguistics. (ii) Develop grammars for lexical disambiguation (POS,","lemma, inflectional information, etc.): e.g. ama,","nurse (N) and loves (V); forte, fort (N) and strong","(A); cobre, cooper (N), covers (V) and collects (V). (iii) Develop local grammars for identification and","tagging of linguistic expressions with strong lexical-","syntactic constraints (such as: adverbials of time and","space, units of measure, etc.): e.g. há cerca de dez","anos, about ten years ago; estão 37,5oC à sombra, it’s","37,5oC in the shade. (iv) Develop grammars to parse different syntactic","constructions, such as noun phrases, and complex","predicates. The Portuguese resources are integrated in two public FST based corpus processors, INTEX and UNITEX."]},{"title":"2. Electronic Dictionaries","paragraphs":["The lexicon is the foundation of any sound NLP application. LabEL’s dictionary system consists of a set of modules, each organized according to the formal complexity of the lexical units it represents. 2.1. Simple Word Dictionaries The core module of the dictionary system contains about 120,000 simple words (lemmas), each having its own systematically encoded morphological attributes. Codes specify information about the particular entry POS and inflectional information, such as gender, number, person, case, tense, mood, diminutives, augmentatives, and superlatives, that can change according to the POS involved. Sample 1 illustrates a few entries of the simple word dictionary.","simples,A116+Det","simples,A116.ss024.sr001+Pd","sobreviver,V102x","sol,N213.dh247.dt247","[simple]","[simple]","[survive]","[sun]","Sample 1: Simple word lemmas Syntactic and semantic information is being encoded incrementally. For instance, adjectives are being refined with information about their syntactic sub-classification. Such refinement allows the separation of homograph adjectival entries on a formal basis. For instance, simples, represented above, is described in two different entries, which correspond to both predicative (Pd) and determinative (Det) adjective analyses, as in examples (1) and (2) below. (1) This is a very simple question (2) He did not find a simple reason to come The inflected simple forms (about 1,250,000) are system generated from the inflectional FSTs referenced in lemmas. For instance, FST A116.ss024.sr001 allows the generation of inflected forms for the predicative adjective simples, as well as for other adjectives with similar morphological behavior (invariable adjectives which can inflect by means of the superlative morphemes –íssimo and -érrimo). FSTs also assign linguistic information corresponding to each generated form, as in Sample 2.","simples,simples.A+Pd:ms:fs:mp:fp","simplérrima,simples.A+Pd:Sfs","simplérrimas,simples.A+Pd:Sfp","simplérrimo,simples.A+Pd:Sms","simplérrimos,simples.A+Pd:Smp","simplicíssima,simples.A+Pd:Sfs","simplicíssimas,simples.A+Pd:Sfp","simplicíssimo,simples.A+Pd:Sms","simplicíssimos,simples.A+Pd:Smp","Sample 2: Inflection of simples 2.2 Multi-Word Dictionaries It is impossible to envisage automatic text analysis without adequate identification and treatment of multi-word lexical 1755 units. The meaning of a text is mostly supplied by frequent occurrence of multi-word units, especially compound nouns. Therefore, most NLP applications (Information Extraction and Retrieval, Machine Translation, Text Summarization, etc.) can not succeed if such expressions are not processed properly. LabEL has given priority to the gathering and formalization of common usage compound nouns (e.g. hora de ponta, rush hour) and adverbs (e.g. de cor e salteado, by heart), but it has also been developing mechanisms to recognize and classify multi-word expressions commonly known as named entities (e.g. ACL – Association for Computational Linguistics). 2.2.1. Dictionaries of General Multi-Word Expressions The dictionary of general multi-word expressions, still under development, contains about 79,000 entries. Multi-word expressions are sequences of simple words, but their meaning is not always compositional. They present morphological, combinatorial, and other linguistic constraints. Some of them are completely invariable (most adverbs, conjunctions, prepositions, determiners), while others (most nouns and adjectives) generally inflect in gender and number, as in Sample 3. caixa(N301)-forte(A301),N+NA+Conc lua(N301) de mel,N+NDN+Abst pele(N101) vermelha(A101),N+NA+Hum novo(A001.dh012.ss001) em folha,A+APN+Pd [safe] [honey moon] [redskin] [brand-new]","Sample 3: Compound words","The elements that can inflect are specified with","inflectional codes similar to those used to inflect simple","words. However, these codes may not be always the same.","This is the case of pele vermelha above. The code for pele","in the simple word dictionary is N301 (feminine noun); in","the multi-word dictionary, the same form is codified as","N101 (both masculine and feminine noun). On the other","hand, in the simple word dictionary, the feminine form","vermelha is obtained from the adjectival lemma vermelho","by means of the code A001; in the multi-word dictionary,","vermelha is coded as A101, a feminine or masculine","adjective, corresponding to feminine or masculine pele.","Thus, from the compound entries presented in Sample 3,","the following inflected forms are generated as can be seen","in Sample 4. caixa-forte,caixa forte.N+NA+Conc:fs caixas-fortes,caixa forte.N+NA+Conc:fp lua de mel,lua de mel.N+NDN+Abst:fs luas de mel,lua de mel.N+NDN+Abst:fp pele vermelha,pele vermelha.N+NDN+Hum:ms:fs peles vermelhas,pele vermelha.N+NDN+Hum:mp:fp nova em folha,novo em folha.A+APN+Pd:fs novas em folha,novo em folha.A+APN+Pd:fp novo em folha,novo em folha.A+APN+Pd:ms novos em folha,novo em folha.A+APN+Pd:mp novinha em folha,novo em folha.A+APN+Pd:Dfs novinhas em folha,novo em folha.A+APN+Pd:Dfp novinho em folha,novo em folha.A+APN+Pd:Dms novinhos em folha,novo em folha.A+APN+Pd:Dmp novíssima em folha,novo em folha.A+APN+Pd:Sfs novíssimas em folha,novo em folha.A+APN+Pd:Sfp novíssimo em folha,novo em folha.A+APN+Pd:Sms novíssimos em folha,novo em folha.A+APN+Pd:Smp","Sample 4: Inflected compound words Semantic and syntactic attributes have been added to compound nouns and adjectives. Simple lexical units are often ambiguous, and in most cases it is only possible to determine their meaning in context. Multi-word units are much less ambiguous. Therefore, it is straightforward to assign them precise semantic information. For instance, simple words such as caixa (box; cashier; etc.) and forte (fort; strong; etc.) are ambiguous at different levels; however, when combined in the multi-word noun caixa-forte (safe), they lose their ambiguity, and the entry can be sub-classified as a concrete noun. 2.2.2. Specific Lexicons – Named Entity Expressions Named-entity is a term usually used to name specific entities, such as persons, organizations, and locations. Most times, they correspond to capitalized multi-word expressions. Such expressions are classified and extracted semi-automatically from corpora by means of finite-state transducers, and are manually verified by linguists. According to their semantic nature, named entities are organized in different specific lexicons, which need to be expanded. Such lexicons are briefly presented below. - Collective proper nouns The collective proper nouns module presently contains about 7,500 multi-word lexical units, which handles educational institutions, non-profit organizations and corporate entities (e.g. Instituto Superior Técnico, Fundo Monetário Internacional). - Toponyms The toponym module includes around 3,300 entries, which correspond to Portuguese or Brazilian places (e.g. Castelo Branco, Rio de Janeiro) and other foreign country places, spelled either in Portuguese (e.g. Grã-Bretanha, Great Britain; Nova Zelândia, New Zealand) or in their original language, whenever there is no equivalent term in Portuguese (e.g. Buenos Aires, Manhattan). - Acronyms Named entities often appear in texts either as acronyms or next to them. Acronyms create problems concerning formalization because of their linguistic specificity (sequences of letters corresponding to sequences of words). Acronyms, like UE (EU), are formally simple words. However, they stand for multi-word expressions: União Europeia (European Union). Different interconnected modules, formally similar to simple and multi-word dictionaries, were created in order to recognize and relate both types of linguistic objects. At present, 5,100 pairs of acronyms and their multi-word correspondents have been collected and formalized. Samples 5 and 6 show both types of representation.","BA,ba.N+SigE+HumCol:fs","EUA,eua.N+Sig+Top:mp","CML,cml.N+Sig+HumCol:fs","Sample 5: Acronyms","British Airways,ba.N+DSigE+HumCol:fs","Estados Unidos da América,eua.N+DSig+Top:mp","Câmara Municipal de Lisboa,cml.N+DSig+HumCol:fs","Sample 6: Acronym multi-word correspondents Both dictionary modules are simultaneously applied to corpora by a specific FST, so that both acronyms and their full word correspondents are extracted from corpora whenever they co-ocurr, as illustrated in Concordance 1. 1756 s» que o Banco Comercial Português (BCP) encont mbros do Comité Olímpico Internacional (COI) te do com o Fundo Monetário Internacional (FMI).

Numerical Expressions Numerical expressions such as cardinals, ordinals and Roman numerals are represented not in dictionaries but in lexical FSTs. Since elements of each class can combine dynamically with one another to form new lexical units, it would not be adequate to list them exhaustively. Transducers allow, on the one hand, the easy and compact encoding of the different combinatorial sequences, and, on the other hand, the mapping from (lexical) numerals to their corresponding numbers and vice-versa."]},{"title":"3. Grammars","paragraphs":["Parallel to the development and improvement of electronic dictionaries, LabEL has been building grammars for sentence identification, lexical disambiguation, recognition and tagging of different linguistic constructions. Grammars are applied to texts in combination with dictionaries, and they are corpora independent. 3.1. Disambiguation Grammars In Portuguese, noun and adjective homographs are a significant source of POS ambiguity. In order to decrease or eliminate this kind of ambiguity, a set of about 100 disambiguation grammars have already been built. Disambiguation grammars are represented by FSTs, and they describe linguistic constraints (morphological, syntactic, distributional) that should be observed between noun phrase constituents, namely between nouns and adjectives. These grammars make use of the linguistic information formalized in the dictionaries, in particular of adjectival sub-classification attributes. Some constructions with predicative adjectives are expressed in the FST presented in Figure 1. ","Figure 1: Disambiguation grammar The FST analyzes ambiguous nominal constructions containing: a determiner or a combination of determiners, formalized in the sub-graph DET_ms, a noun, which can be preceded by a sub-type of predicative adjective (Pde), and a predicative adjectival phrase, represented in the sub-graph Adj_Pred_d_ms. There is morphological agreement among all categories of the noun phrase (masculine singular). Concordance 2 shows some nominal constructions resulting from the application of the disambiguation grammar presented before to a journalistic corpus, which will be referred further ahead. saber se este novo meio de transporte permite d .

Curio ambém de um poder político federal forte, como","Concordance 2: NP identification In order to estimate the disambiguation grammars performance, they were applied to a test corpus, a journalistic non-annotated text with about 163,000 words. As the result of the application, a set of 3,657 syntactic structures were matched, and 94,1% of the words analyzed by the grammars were disambiguated and tagged. The remaining 5,9% were not tagged because the ambiguity could not be completely eliminated. Only 0,7% of the tagged words were incorrect, which means that the precision rate is 99.3%. The recall was not calculated. 3.2. Local Grammars Local grammars are used to represent constructions exhibiting strong lexical-syntactic constraints. Dates (e.g. Sexta-feira, 31 de Outubro de 2003, Friday, October 31st 2003), temporal expressions (e.g. há duas semanas atrás, two weeks ago) and percentages (e.g. entre os 3 e os 6%, from 3 to 6 %), among other constructions belonging to a particular semantic domain, are examples of linguistic data formalized in local grammars (FSTs). 3.3. Grammars to Parse Complex Predicates Grammars to parse complex predicates were also built. A complex predicate corresponds to a constrained sequence of auxiliary verbs preceding a main verb or a predicative adjective, which are the syntactic and semantic nucleus of a sentence structure. In Portuguese, these strings may contain adverbs, clitics and other inserts that do not belong to the predicate. Enhanced FSTs (i.e. transducers that allow the reordering of the FSTs outputs) were used to formalize such combinations, and to move the inserts from inside the predicate to their canonical positions. The incomplete FST represented in Figure 2 corresponds to a grammar fragment describing possible combinations of temporal and aspectual auxiliaries, preceding a main verb in the infinitive. Aspectual auxiliaries are lexically specified in the main graph; temporal auxiliaries are represented in the embedded FST TempK. Sub-graphs ClitH and Adv describe some of the constituents that can be inserted either between auxiliaries or between auxiliaries and main verb. Concordance 3 illustrates complex predicates recognized by such grammar. como tem estado a decorrer o ciclo de debates alho tem vindo assim a tornar-se cada vez mais lvez tenha começado a perder a conta em 1959, q essa ter estado quase a desistir durante a leit ora.

Final Remarks","paragraphs":["In last years, some believed that statistical NLP had rendered linguistic analysis unnecessary. In fact, this is not the case. It is now widely recognized that linguistically precise broad-coverage language resources are the basis for ongoing product development in a number of application areas. Within the scope of this paper, the main characteristics of a set of Portuguese large-scale language resources were summarized. We believe that (i) these formalized language data are a requirement for language engineering but also for theoretical linguistics and education; (ii) the availability of such broad-coverage linguistic-based resources should offer valuable opportunities to train statistical models on the output of linguistic-based processed corpora."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This work was partially supported by Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia, grant POSI/39806/ PLP/2001."]},{"title":"References ","paragraphs":["Baptista, Jorge (1995).
