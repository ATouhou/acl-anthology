Since the main goal of our project is the development of an index system of broadcast news in the Basque Country, it is essential to create resources for all the languages used in the mass media. The analysis of the specific linguistic problematic indicates that both Basque and Spanish are official in the Basque Autonomous Community and they are used in the Basque Public Radio and Television EITB (EITB) and in most of the mass media of the Basque Country (radios and newspapers). Thus it is clear that both languages have to be taken into account to develop an efficient index system. Therefore, all of the tools (ASR system, NLP system, index system) and resources (digital library, Lexicon) to be developed will be oriented to create a bilingual system in Basque and Spanish. 1 Spanish has been briefly studied for development of these kind of systems but the use of Basque language (a very odd minority language) introduces a new difficulty to the development of the system, since it needs specific tools and the resources available are fewer. 1 This work is part of the European action COST278 Basque is a Pre-Indo-European language of unknown origin and it has about 1.000.000 speakers in the Basque Country. It presents a wide dialectal distribution, including six the main dialects, and this dialectal variety entails phonetic, phonologic, and morphologic differences. Moreover, since 1968 the Royal Academy of the Basque Language, Euskaltzaindia (Euskaltzaindia) has been involved in a standardisation process of Basque. At present, morphology, which is very rich in Basque, is completely standardised in the unified standard Basque, but the lexical standardization process is still going on. The standard Basque, called “Batua”, has nowadays a great importance in the Basque community, since the public institutions and most of the mass media use it. Furthermore, people who have studied Basque as a second language use \"Batua\" as well. Hence, we have made use of the standard version of Basque as well as the standard Spanish in the development of the resources presented in this work. The following section describes the main morphological features of the language and details the statistical analysis of morphemes using three different textual samples. Section 3 presents the resources developed. Section 4 describes the processing of the data. Finally, conclusions are summarised in section 5. 881"]},{"title":"Table 1.","paragraphs":["Main characteristics of the textual databases for morphologic analysis","STDBASQUE NEWSPAPER BCNEWS Text amount 1,6M 1,3M 2,5M Number of words 197,589 166,972 210,221 Number of pseudo-morphemes 346,232 304,767 372,126 Number of sentences 15,384 13,572 19,230 Vocabulary size in words 50,121 38,696 58,085 Vocabulary size in pseudo-morphemes 20,117 15,302 23,983"]},{"title":"Morphological features of Basque","paragraphs":["Basque is an agglutinative language with a special morpho-syntactic structure inside the words (Alegria et al., 1996) that may lead to intractable vocabularies of words for a CSR when the size of task is large. A first approach to the problem is to use morphemes instead of words in the system in order to define the system vocabulary (Peñagarikano et al., 1999). This approach has been evaluated over three textual samples analysing both the coverage and the Out of Vocabulary rate, when we use words and pseudo-morphemes obtained by the automatic morphological segmentation tool AHOZATI (Lopez de Ipina et al., 2002). Table 1 shows the main features of the three textual samples relating to size, number of words and pseudo-morphemes and vocabulary size, both in words and pseudo-morphemes for each database (Lopez de Ipina et al., 2003). The first important outcome of our analysis is that the vocabulary size of pseudo-morphemes is reduced about 60% (Fig. 1, a) in all cases relative to the vocabulary size of words. Regarding the unit size, Fig. 1 (b) shows the plot of Relative Frequency of Occurrence (RFO) of the pseudo-morphemes and words versus their length in characters over the textual sample STDBASQUE. Although only 10% of the pseudo-morphemes in the vocabulary have fewer than four characters, such small morphemes have an Accumulated Frequency of about 40% in the databases (the Accumulated Frequency is calculated as the sum of the individual pseudo-morphemes RFO) (Lopez de Ipina et al., 2002). To check the validity of the unit inventory, units having less than 4 characters and having plosives at their boundaries were selected from the texts. They represent some 25% of the total. This high number of small and acoustically difficult recognition units could lead to an increase of the acoustic confusion, and could also generate a high number of insertions (Fig. 2 over the textual sample EGUNKARIA). Finally, Fig. 3 shows the analysis of coverage and Out of Vocabulary rate over the textual sample BCNEWS. When pseudo-morphemes are used, the coverage in texts is better and complete coverage is easily achieved. OOV rate is higher in this sample. 010000200003000040000500006000070000","Vocabulary of words Vocabulary of pseudo-morphemes EUSEST EGUNKARIA IRRATEL"]},{"title":"(a) 0 5 10 15 20 25 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 Length in characters RFO Pseudomorphe mes Words (b) Fig. 1.","paragraphs":["(a) Vocabulary size of the words and pseudo-morphemes in the three tex\\tual samples and (b) Relative Frequency of Occurrence (RFO) of the words and pseudo-morphemes in relation to their length in c\\haracters (STDBASQUE sample) 882 00,511,522,533,544,5 RFO a ak ko tu da bat ek du ta tze i z tik k ba go te bi tzat ok gu"]},{"title":"Fig. 2.

The XML files include information of distinct speakers, noises, and paragraphs of the broadcast news. The files also contain phonetic and orthographic information of each of the words. As Basque is an agglutinative language with very rich inflection variety (Alegria et al., 1996), Basque XML files include morphologic information such as each word’s lemma and Part-Of-Speech tag. Using this transcribed information, a Lexicon for each language has been extracted. The Lexicon stores information of each different word that appears in the transcription.

Hence, this work deals with the development of appropriated resources for a bilingual automatic index system of broadcast news in Basque and Spanish. Since Basque is an agglutinative language, analysis of coverage and words OOV has been carried out in order to develop an appropriate Lexicon. Finally, lexicons are created for both languages using morphologic and phonetic information, not just extracting a word list."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["We thank also all the people and entities that have collaborated in the development of this work: EITB (EITB), Gara (GARA), UZEI and Euskaldunon Egunkaria (Egunkaria)."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Informedia, digital video understanding research, http://www.informedia.cs.cmu.edu/","EITB Basque Public Radio and Television, http://www.eitb.com/","Euskaltzaindia, http://www.euskaltzaindia.net/","Peñagarikano M., Bordel G., Varona A., Lopez de Ipina: \"Using non-word Lexical Units in Automatic Speech Understanding\", Proceedings of IEEE, ICASSP99, Phoenix, Arizona.","Lopez de Ipiña K., Graña M., Ezeiza N., Hernández M., Zulueta E., Ezeiza A., Tovar C.: \" Selection of Lexical Units for Continuous Speech Recognition of Basque\", Progress in Pattern Recognition, pp 244-250.
