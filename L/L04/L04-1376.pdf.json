The current version of the MCR integrates five local wordnets plus four versions of Princeton’s English WordNet, three ontologies and hundreds of thousands of new semantic relations and properties automatically acquired from corpora. In order to maintain compatibility among all these heterogeneous knowledge resources, it is fundamental to have a robust and advanced ontological support. This paper studies the mapping of main Sources of Ontological Meaning onto the wordnets and, in particular, the current work in mapping the EuroWordNet Top Concept Ontology."]},{"title":"1. Introduction: the M","paragraphs":["EANING"]},{"title":"Project","paragraphs":["MEANING1","(Rigau et al., 2002) is a UE-funded project (IST-2001-34460) which has as one of its major goals the integration of several large-scale knowledge resources. MEANING has designed a Multilingual Central Repository (MCR) to act as a multilingual interface for integrating and distributing all the knowledge acquired in the project (Atserias et al., 2004). The MCR follows the model proposed by the EuroWordNet project (EWN): a multilingual lexical database with wordnets for several languages.","The EWN architecture includes the Inter-Lingual-Index (ILI), a preliminary Domain Ontology (DO) and a Top Concept Ontology (TCO) (Vossen, 1998). The ILI consists of a flat list of records that interconnect synsets across wordnets. During the EWN Project around 1000 ILI-Records were selected as Base Concepts (BC) and connected to the TCO.","Using the ILI, wordnets in the MCR are interconnected so that it is possible to go from word meanings in one language or particular wordnet to their equivalents in other languages or wordnets.","In EWN, the ILI was enhanced, enriched and structured by two separate ontologies:","the Top Concept ontology (TCO), which is a hierarchy of language-independent concepts, reflecting important semantic distinctions, e.g. Object, Substance, Location, Dynamic;","the Domain ontology (DO), which is a hierarchy of domain labels, which are knowledge structures grouping meanings in terms of topics or scripts, e.g. Transport, Sports, Medicine, Gastronomy; 1 http://www.lsi.upc.es/ñlp/meaning","The main purpose of the TCO is to provide a common framework for all the wordnets. It consists of 63 basic semantic distinctions that classify a set of ILI-records connected to EWN BC which represents the most important concepts in the different wordnets.","The current version of the MCR uses the set of Princeton WordNet (WN) 1.6 synsets as ILI. Initially most of the knowledge to be uploaded into the MCR has been derived from WN (automatic selec-tional preferences acquired from SemCor and BNC) and the Italian wordnet and the MultiWordNet Domains, both developed at IRST are using WordNet 1.6 as ILI (Bentivogli et al., 2002; Magnini and Cavagli, 2000). This option also minimises side effects with other European initiatives (Balkanet, EuroTerm, etc.) and wordnet developments around Global WordNet Association. However, the ILI for Spanish, Catalan and Basque wordnets, the EWN TCO and the associated BC were based on WordNet 1.5 (Atserias et al., 1997; Benı́tez et al., 1998).","After this short introduction, section 2. describes the main ontological resources used in MEANING. Section 3. presents the inheritance mechanism used to expand the TCO properties. In section 4. we present the semi–automatic approach we plan to follow to per-form consistency checking of the TCO related to the diverse conceptual information used in MEANING. Finally, section 5. provides some concluding remarks."]},{"title":"2. M","paragraphs":["EANING"]},{"title":"’s Ontological Meaning","paragraphs":["Although wordnets and ontologies are both graphs connecting concepts, they are different in nature: while wordnets build concepts upon lexical units of a particular language, nodes in ontologies are claimed to be language- independent concepts. Wordnets can be 11 straightforwardly used for NLP tasks. On the contrary, ontologies, although being meaningful constructs, can not be straightforwardly used for NLP unless they are associated to linguistic units and structures.","Moreover, different ontologies usually are designed using different theoretical grounds; e.g. while SUMO incorporates previous ontologies and insights by Sowa, Pierce, Russell and Norvig and others, the TCO is based on more linguistic grounds: Lyons, Vendler, Verkuyl and Pustejovsky. Therefore, although different ontologies can be comparable, it would take a great theoretical effort to merge all of them in a unique standard and comprehensive construct to be consistently associated to WN.","For this reason, in MEANING we intend to adopt a hybrid and simple approach: to build the MEANING TO, different Sources of Ontological Meaning (SOM) are assigned to language-independent ILI–records so that they can be mapped to WN concepts and expanded throughout them using its internal semantic relations. The different SOM do not need to be equivalent nor even compatible as they will stand as independent information. Besides, no claim of completion will be made. Currently, MCR integrates through ILI different SOM:","1. An upgraded version of the EWN Base Concepts (BC)","2. An upgraded version of the EWN Top Concept Ontology (TCO)","3. The WordNet Domains Ontology (DO) (Magnini and Cavagli, 2000), a hierarchy of 165 domain labels","4. The Suggested Upper Merged Ontology, SUMO (Niles and Pease, 2001)","5. WN Semantic Files (SF), corresponding to lexicographical files from wordnet, e.g. noun.animal, verb.possession, etc.","The integration of all these SOM into a single platform both demands and allows for cross-checking. For instance, we can improve SUMO labels and WordNet Domains mappings by merging and comparing them.","To illustrate how we can detect errors and inconsistences between different types of SOM, we can see in the example in table 1 that the nouns corresponding to the SUMO process Breathing has been labeled with ANATOMY domain, some verbs with MEDICINE and some adjectives with FACTOTUM, when in fact, all these senses correspond to different Part-of-Speech of the same concept. Synset Word SUMO Domain 00003142v exhale Breathing medicine 00899001a exhaled Breathing factotum 00263355a exhaling Breathing factotum 00536039n expiration Breathing anatomy 02849508a expiratory Breathing anatomy 00003142v expire Breathing medicine Table 1: SUMO vs. Domain labels","In MEANING the TCO has been uploaded in four steps (see (Atserias et al., 2003) for further details): 1. Upgrading the WN1.5 BC to WN1.6","2. TCO properties have been assigned to WN1.6 synsets through the WN 1.5 to 1.6 mapping (Daudé et al., 2001).","3. For those WN1.6 Tops (synsets without any parent) that do not have any assigned property through the mapping, we assigned to them the TCO properties via a table of equivalence between TCO and SF.","4. The resulting properties were propagated top– down through the WN hierarchy","The original set of BC from EWN based on WN1.5 totalized 1,030 ILI–records. Now, the BC from WN1.5 have been mapped to WN1.6. After a manual revision and expansion to all WN1.6 top beginners, the resulting BC for WN1.6 totalized 1,601 ILI-records. In that way, the new version of BC covers the complete hierarchy of ILI-records."]},{"title":"3. Expanding T","paragraphs":["CO"]},{"title":"properties","paragraphs":["The EWN project only performed a complete validation of the consistency of the TCO at the BC level.","Assuming (as the builders of SUMO and DO have done) that the ontological properties have been correctly assigned to particular synsets and that WN de-fines coherent subsumption chains, an automatic process can consistently inherit all the properties through the whole hierarchy of WN - no matter the ontology they come from.","MEANING have performed an automatic expansion of the TCO properties assigned to the BC. That is, we enriched the complete ILI structure with features coming from the BC by inheriting the Top Concept features following the hyponymy relationship.","This way, once ontological properties are exported to the ILI and inherited through the whole WN Hierarchy, all concepts in a WN will result to be assigned 12 with a set of semantic features as in the following example.","lentil 1 WD gastronomy SF food SUMO FruitOrVegetable TCO Comestible ; Plant","In order to provide consistency to the inheritance process we used the following basic incompatibilities among TCO properties which were defined inside the EWN project: substance - object plant - animal - human - creature natural - artifact solid - liquid - gas","As the classification of WN is not always consistent with the TCO, these incompatibilities impeded the full automatic top–down propagation of the TCO properties. That semi-automatic process resulted in a number of synsets showing non–compatible information. Specifically:","Sticking to TCO and according to the set of incompatibilities, some TCO properties assigned by hand appeared to be incompatible with either (a) inherited information, (b) information assigned via equivalence to SF or/and even (c) other TCO properties assigned by hand.","TCO properties, either original or inherited, are suspicious to be incompatible with other SOM.","By examining a subset of synsets, we realised that there are at least the following main sources of errors: Erroneous hand-made TCO mappings","Erroneous statements of equivalence between TCO properties and SFs","Erroneous ISA links in WN -which causes erroneous inheritance (Guarino and Welty, 2000)","Multiple inheritance within WN can cause incompatibilities in inheritance of properties The following example has incompatible information. 3rdOrderEntity can not coexist with properties only attributable to Events:","00660718 process 1 MWD factotum WN16SF act SUMO IntentionalProcess EWNTO 3rdOrderEntity;Cause;Mental;Purpose"]},{"title":"4. Consistency checking","paragraphs":["The procedure we will apply to solve the TCO incompatibilities is the following:","1. Hand-fixing TCO mappings where appearing incompatible properties","2. Setting inheritance–blocking–points and handfixing TCO mappings around these points (i.e. all involved hypernyms and hyponyms)","3. Recalculating the inheritance according to the information obtained in (1) and (2)","4. Reexamining the involved subtrees to check whether re–calculation of the inheritance produce new incompatibilities","5. Exporting the mappings and blocking–point information to the ILI.","It should be noticed that it is important to export also blocking–point information to the ILI in order to ease future correct exportation of SOM’s information to other wordnets, i.e. to prevent incorrect expansion of properties by inheritance. Inside a particular wordnet, when reaching a blocking point, a subsumption link can be considered as broken for ontological purposes –therefore, it will be assumed that the conceptual chain only proceeds upwards consistently to the SOM (not to the hypernym synsets), via the ILI– records.","This process can be applied iteratively looking for suspicious synsets in WN. In the first round we will check the list of 38 synsets which show incompatibility between hand-assigned TCO properties. In the second one we will check the set of WN top be-ginners which only bear information mapped via the TCO–SF table of equivalence. Third, we will check synsets showing incompatibility between information directly mapped via TCO and information mapped via the TCO–SF table of equivalence. Last, we will check the remaining cases of incompatibility between TCO manual and inherited information.","Being more precise, for each synset in any of the subsets we will proceed as follows:","1. Fixing the properties of those synsets having contradictory TCO properties: TCO assignments are fixed in the synset and its immediate relatives (mainly hypernym and hyponyms). All these synsets will be marked as ”hand–checked”. The result will be correct TCO information assigned to several synsets as in the following example where, originally, non-agentive and non-13 intentional 00661612 stiffening 1 was inheriting all of the 00660718 process 1 properties:","00660718 process 1","EWNTO Dynamic;Agentive;Purpose","00661612 stiffening 1","EWNTO Dynamic;Cause","2. For those synsets having false WN subsumptions, we will introduce a blocking point between a pair of synsets. The result will be a list of blocking points, e.g.: between 00661612n and 00660718n.","3. We keep record of TCO–SF erroneous equivalences, since they will be useful in the future to detect more synsets with erroneous mappings. The result will be a list of suspicious TCO–SF equivalences, e.g.: [TCO:Agentive–SF:ACT]","4. To study TCO–SUMO equivalences in such synsets. As in the previous step, they can be useful in the future to detect more synsets with mistaken mappings. The result will be a list of incompatible TCO–SUMO concepts, e.g.: [TCO:3rdOrderEntity–SUMO:Physical]","5. To inspect as well WN Domain assignments. The result will be a list of doubtful WN Domain assignments, e.g. 00364173n#play 3:ENTERPRISE","Following an iterative and incremental approach, the inheritance will be re-calculated, the resulting data will be re–examined, and the eventual correct information will be again uploaded into the MCR thus overwriting the pre-existent one","Although such hand–checking is extremely complex and delicate, therefore slow and needing of sound semantic expertise to carry it on, we expect the task is affordable since critical conflicts seem to concentrate in a workable layer of synsets close to the higher part of the WN hierarchy."]},{"title":"5.
