The Spanish taxonomy is composed by Spanish senses, while Spanish Wordnet is composed by synsets, mostly linked to English WordNet. A set of weighted associations between Spanish words and Wordnet synsets is used for inferring associations between both taxonomies."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["In previous work, a way to extract a large volume of weighted associations between Spanish words and Word-Net (WN) synsets was obtained (Farreres et al., 2002). Its results derive from the entries of a Spanish-English bilingual dictionary and are thus limited by the coverage of the dictionary. In order to extend the associations to words not covered by the bilingual dictionary a taxonomy alignment was considered. This work is centered in the nominal part1",".","Main problems in ontology merging arise when 1) the units of the ontologies to be merged are of different granularity, and 2) the mapping between those units cannot be stated directly but through another intermediate level of representation. This is the case of lexico-conceptual taxonomy merging where the mapping between conceptual units is performed through intermediate lexical units. An even more complicated case occurs when the mapping between conceptual units is performed through two levels of intermediate lexical units. This latter case reflects the approach that was taken to create the Spanish Wordnet (SpWN) in the first stages of development within the EuroWordNet (EWN) project (Atserias et al., 1997). See figure1. Figure 1: Alignment framework","Our aim in this paper is to use a Spanish sense-level taxonomy (SpTax), automatically extracted from a monolingual dictionary following (Rigau, 1998) for enriching the SpWN. In order to achieve it we use the English WN1.5, and the partially filled SpWN. There is room for enriching SpWN simply attaching Spanish Words to the yet un-1 This research has been partially funded by Aliado (TIC2002-","04447-c02-01).","WN1.5 SpTax WtS StS Words 87642 62433 12073 9509 Variants 107424 Senses 111512 35566 Synsets 60557 18650 17443","Associations 65304 326368 Table 1: Taxonomy volume comparison covered English synsets.

The problem is that the correspondence between conceptual units (synsets in WN, senses in SpTax) results in a many-to-many case."]},{"title":"2. Terminology","paragraphs":["We firstintroduce some concepts that will be used along the text. A Spanish word is a word covered by a monolingual dictionary. A Spanish sense is a sense of a word as defined by the monolingual dictionary, thus depending of the source. Two kinds of associations are considered. A WtS is a weighted association between a Spanish word and a WN synset; the weight of each association is the probability of correct assignment under the logistic model obtained in (Farreres et al., 2002), named in this paper as the logistic probability of the link. An StS is an association between a Spanish sense and a WN synset. See table 1 columns WtS, StS for a comparison of the volumes involved. The branch starting at some sense is the sequence of ancestors of that sense, including the sense. A gap in a Spanish branch is a sub-branch without associations (often reduced to a single node) separating two sub-branches with associations. The PRB Given a StS a, PRB(a) (pair of related branches) is formed by the Spanish branch developed up to 5th ancestor, following the results in (Farreres et al., 2003), the WN branch developed up to the topmost level, and all the associations relating both branches. The level of an association in the PRB is the level of the Spanish ancestor from which the association starts. A PRB is said to be connected when some Spanish ancestor is associated with the WN branch. Connected PRBs have a level, which is the 145 Figure 2: Diagram of a PRB level of the firstSpanish ancestor with an association in the PRB, the ancestor which is closest to the link originating the PRB","PRB is the concept managed in this work that allows studying the relationship between SpTax and WN."]},{"title":"3. Problem Definition","paragraphs":["This work addresses the transformation of a set of WtS into a set of StS.","Given a WtS, the information the association provides is that the Spanish word is, probably, a translation of some variant occurring in the synset. But a word has not a unique meaning; meanings are in the senses of the words. Although knowing that a Spanish word may correspond to a WN synset is an useful information, the aim should be to assign the adequate sense of the Spanish word. As a side effect, this would also help detecting several wrong WtS, when for them no adequate Spanish sense were found.","Due to the complexity of the problem, a cautious approach has been preferred. A step by step analysis has been performed, starting from the analysis of simple cases, in order to firstunderstand the kind of problems occurring in this type of taxonomy merging. A further step will consist on applying this knowledge to more complex cases."]},{"title":"4. Analysis of Monosemic Spanish Words","paragraphs":["Following this incremental approach, from simple to complex, in a previous work (Farreres et al., 2003) we proposed a comparison between two taxonomies as a way to transform a set of WtS into a set of StS. The study was centered in the most simple case, monosemic Spanish words with only one WtS, converting it to an StS assigned to the single sense straightforwardly. 1263 StS where induced from WtS this way with a percentage of 96.7% of correctness. After building the whole branches of ancestors of both the Spanish sense and the synset of the association, it was firstobserved from the data that SpTax chains should be limited to five ancestors, as only few cases had their first","Group Quantity Percentage No PRB connected 39 26% One PRB connected 49 33% Both PRB connected 62(*) 41%","Total 150","(*)Two of them are tops in SpTax and are thus not taken","into account in this work. Table 2: Pairs of PRB for the same Spanish word association after this limit, and the correctness of an association this far was dubious. When the confidencescores of the associations calculated using the logistic regression model obtained in (Farreres et al., 2002) were studied, it was observed that the mean probability of the associations was related to the cardinality of the relation between the branches, the presence of gaps in the Spanish branch, and the number of Spanish ancestors with an association. 4.1. Monosemic Spanish Words with Two","Associations","After analyzing the behavior of monosemic Spanish words with one WtS, the next step forward is to study what happens when a monosemic Spanish word has two or more WtS. In this case possibilities increase, as it can be the case that some WtS are incorrect and some are correct; the problem stands in the separation of the correct and incorrect WtS and the ulterior transformation into StS. In a first step the case where only two WtS are present is studied. At the end results are projected to the set of monosemic Spanish words with a larger number of associations.","Having the evidence that some factors are related to the probability of the base StS of PRBs, a study has been carried out on 150 monosemic Spanish words with two WtS, taking into account the sense and the two links. The factors studied for each link that seem to be relevant are: the existence of an ancestor with an association together with its level, the cardinality of the relation between the Spanish and the English branches, the presence of gaps in the Spanish branch, the number of Spanish senses with an association, the manual evaluation of the association, and the probability of the link.","The firstdistinction has been done in terms of whether the PRBs are connected. Table 2 summarizes the set volumes. When a PRB is connected, there is added evidence as to the correctness of the base StS. 4.1.1. No PRB Connected","When no PRB is connected, it makes no sense calculating the factors, as no upper association can be found in the PRB, and no level nor number of associations can be extracted as new evidences to be studied. Upon a detailed inspection, there were 4 cases where both StS were correct, 7 cases where both StS were incorrect, and 29 cases where one StS was correct. The only factor that can be contrasted is the logistic probability of the association, but no relation was detected between the logistic probability and the fact of an association of being correct.","In a more detailed study, 7 correct cases could be detected where the firstancestor of both branches shared ho-146","Equivalent senses","Estimated","Real yes no","yes 41 (42%) 13 (13%) 54 (55%)","no 8 (8%) 36 (37%) 44 (45%)","49 (50%) 49 (50%) 98 Table 3: One PRB connected","Equivalent senses","Estimated","Real yes no","yes 12 (46%) 2 (8%) 14 (54%)","no 1 (4%) 11 (42%) 12 (46%)","13 (50%) 13 (50%) 26 Table 4: Both PRB connected and one PRB with greater n or lower level mographs. As the current work only studies existing associations, this will not be taken into account right now. But in a future line of enrichment of SpWN, the generation of associations by means of homographs will be studied, with the caution of the danger of false friends. 4.1.2. One PRB Connected","When only one of the PRB is connected, in most of the cases the connected link has proven to be correct, while the disconnected PRB is in mostly incorrect. The 49 cases generate 98 PRB: the 49 connected PRB have been accepted, the other 49 PRB have been rejected. Table 3 shows that the detection has a recall of 76% and a precision of 84%. The number of correct solutions discarded is quite high (13) but no evidence of any factor was detected that could help recovering any of them. 4.1.3. Both PRB Connected","When both PRB are connected, there is the possibility that both are correct (16 cases), that just one of them is correct (43 cases), or that both are incorrect (2 cases). The factors (level of upper closest association, cardinality of the relation between the branches, presence of gaps, number n of associations, evaluation, logistic probability) have been studied for each of the cases.","It was observed that the behavior of factors level and n is quite different when one or both PRB are correct. Upon studying them, it is observed that for the case that one PRB is incorrect, it is almost always the case that the correct PRB has higher level or higher n than the incorrect PRB. Applying this result, table 4 shows the results of separating correct and incorrect cases when the above condition takes place. The detection of correct and incorrect cases when one PRB has greater n or level than the other is quite precise,with a recall of 85.7% and a precision of 92%.","When both PRB have the same level and n, the structure of the association with the WN branch of the PRB has been studied. Six structures have been distinguished. Figure 3 shows the structures together with the number of cases of each of the structures; case b) is the most frequent totaling a 42%, and the second most frequent is case a) with a 19%.

The rest has been left out of further study, and will be accepted as correct globally, mainly due to the lack of coverage.","In case a) the decision is between a synset and its immediate ancestor. In 3 cases both are correct, in 5 cases the lower one is the correct one, and in 3 cases the upper one is the correct one. No way to distinguish them automatically has been found, and evaluation will be left out for the manual validation process, accepting both as correct, giving 22 StS with a 64% precision.","In case b) a pattern has been detected that tends to distinguish the correct links from the incorrect ones in a small number of cases. A distance is definedcounting the number of nodes between each of the base links generating the PRB and the lowest upper association common to both PRB, see figure3 b). Given two PRB A and B, when |d(A)-d(B)|>2, the PRB with lower distance is usually correct and the other one incorrect. Table 5 shows the results, giving a recall of 83.3% and a precision of 83.3%.","Table 6 shows the results of the successful part of the study for monosemic words with two associations, with a recall of 78% and a precision of 85%. If the rest of unresolved PRB were to be accepted as correct globally, the results would return a 75% recall and 75% precision, being the main source of incorrect values accepted as correct the number of unresolved PRB where both are connected. 147","Equivalent senses","Estimated","Real yes no","yes 58 (43%) 16 (12%) 74 (54%)","no 10 (7%) 52 (38%) 62 (46%)","68 (50%) 68 (50%) 136 Table 6: Global results","Equivalent senses","Estimated","Real yes no","yes 85 (15%) 40 (7%) 125 (22%)","no 179 (31%) 270 (47%) 449 (78%)","264 (46%) 310 (54%) 574 Table 7: General case considering PRB connectness This subgroup will need to be studied more deeply in future work. 4.2. Generalization to the Case of Many Associations","In the set of monosemic Spanish words there are 554 with 2 WtS and 865 with more StS. A sample of 48 monosemic Spanish words with more than one WtS has been extracted. The 48 Spanish words have 604 WtS, with a mean of 13 WtS per Spanish word, with the minimum being 4 WtS, and the maximum being 31 WtS. One of the words is in fact a top in SpTax, and thus its 30 associations are discarded. The resulting 574 WtShave been transformed into StS and their corresponding PRB have been constructed. The manual validation gives 125 correct, a 22%, and 449 incorrect. A large quantity of the incorrect PRB is the result of the polysemy of the English translations, originating erroneous associations. Another big set of incorrect PRB are correct WtS that deem incorrect when compared with the Spanish senses. In this case, the usual problem is that the bilingual Spanish-English dictionary gives a translation for a sense that is not represented in the monolingual Spanish dictionary.","Table 7 shows the results of the study. The detection of incorrect PRB has 87% precision and 60% recall. But the detection of correct PRB has a 32% precision and 68% recall. It seems from these results that the detection of incorrect cases works much better than the detection of correct results. This is identificative of semidecidible problems.","When adding the comparison of number of ancestors with association together with the comparison of distances of case b, the precision increases to 37% but the recall de-creases to 47% (see table 8). In this case, whenever some PRB are related via structure a), they have been taken as one node in order to calculate distances; all have been assigned the same distance when compared with other PRB via structure b) in figure3 ."]},{"title":"5.
