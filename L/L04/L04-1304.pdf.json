We propose a method that extracts pairs of related Japanese words from a text corpus, without the use of language knowledge, such as a dictionary, in any of the steps. This is difficult with a Japanese text because there are no spaces between words. The pairs are related words with similar usages and can be useful for understanding texts including unknown words. These related word pairs are extracted based on judgments of whether two words are used in a similar way. We report the precisions of pair lists extracted from various kinds of corpora and analyze the tendencies of each list."]},{"title":"Introduction","paragraphs":["A thesaurus is a commonly used lexical semantic resource; examples include WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) and the EDR Electronic Dictionary (EDR, 1995). We have taken on the challenge of building a thesaurus automatically from text corpora with the goal of using it to help understand texts including unknown words. A good way to get an understanding of an unknown word is to find a synonym or near-synonym of the word. We extract related word pairs based on the assumption that synonyms may always not occur together but simply be two words with similar usages. This approach is similar to that used by Rapp (Rapp, 2002). The most resources used for synonym extraction are text corpora (Grefenstette, 1994; Cho & Kakehi, 2002; Curran, 2002; Wu & Zhou, 2003). These works use a certain dictionary for word segmentation, word selection, and/or addition of part-of-speech information. Other resources, such as sets of definition statements extracted from dictionaries, are also used for synonym extraction (Fujita & Inui, 2001; Blondel & Sennelart, 2002; Okamoto et al., 2003). The synonyms extracted by these methods depend on the definitions of the words. In contrast, given a text corpus, our method outputs related word pairs using only information about the frequency of strings in the text for each step, from word segmentation to related word pair judgment. Therefore, our system can consider not only known words but also unknown words. In this paper, we describe the extraction from various corpora lists of related word pairs as a special thesaurus for the corpus. We report the precisions and analyze the tendencies for each list of pairs."]},{"title":"Method","paragraphs":["The first step of our method is word segmentation. Words in a Japanese text are usually segmented using a Japanese morphological-analysis system as “ChaSen” (Matsumoto et al., 1997), which uses many dictionaries. In contrast, we use a keyword extraction system that does not need a dictionary; it segments words merely by using information about the frequency of strings in the text (Takeda & Umemura, 2002). This system mainly uses Adaptation (Church, 2000). Using this system, we can get a list of keywords from texts. The second step is related word pair judgment. To extract related word pairs from candidate pairs, the method judges whether two words are used in a similar way. In particular, the method investigates whether the two words have the same forward and backward strings. For example, the Japanese sentences “Watashi wa nengajo wo insatsu sita” and “Boku wa nengajo wo purinto sita” both mean “I printed New Year’s cards.” In this case, the verb “insatsu sita (printed)” can be replaced with “purinto sita (printed),” because “insatu” and “purinto” are synonyms in Japanese. Antonyms and hyponyms can also be used in a similar way. Knowing these kinds of words related to unknown words will help clarify the meanings of the unknown words. Using this concept, we extract special pairs of words for the text corpus including unknown words, and the pairs are used in a similar way. We assume that if two words appear with the same forward and backward string, they are basically synonyms, and we judge them to be related words. In this paper, we define a set of related word-pairs Relevants as follows. Related Word-Pair Set x and y are strings. a and b are words. xay and xby are strings that join x before a or b and y after a or b. score(a,b) is a score function for a and b based on frequency information.  We define score function score(a,b) using cfIDF, which represents the characteristic of a word and is quantityevaluated in terms of how often the word appears (Aizawa, 2000). Many of the measures used in existing search systems are based on this measure. We define the score function as follows. Score Function cf(z) is the total frequency of string z in a text corpus. df”(z) is the document frequency predicted by the Poisson distribution for string z. N is the number of documents in a text corpus. score(z) is the score for string z.   where for each string,  "]},{"title":"{ }","paragraphs":["α>= ),(|),(Relevants bascoreba )./)(\"log()(\")),/)(;0(1()(\" NzdfzIDFNzcfpNzdf −=−="]},{"title":"∑","paragraphs":["⋅= yx xbyscorexayscorebascore , )()(),( ),log(/)(\")()( NzIDFzcfzscore ⋅= 1309 This score function sums up the products of cfIDF” for word xay and cfIDF” for word xby, where cf(xay)>1 and cf(xby)>1. We use this estimation because document frequency is harder to calculate than corpus frequency."]},{"title":"Evaluation Corpora","paragraphs":["We tested our method experimentally by using a collec-tion of summaries of conference papers (NTCIR, 2000) written in Japanese and articles published in the Mainichi Newspaper also written in Japanese. All the documents in each corpus have an ID number, title or heading, and summary or content. A) NTCIR We used three NTCIR corpora: NTCIR1, NTCIR2g, and NTCIR2k. NTCIR1 is NACSIS Test Collection 1, which contains documents selected from the Academic Conference Papers Database. The other two, NTCIR2g and NTCIR2k, are included in NII Test Collection 2. NTCIR2g comprises documents selected from the NACSIS Academic Conference Papers Database. NTCIR2k comprises documents selected from the NACSIS Grant-in-Aid Scientific Research Database; they are about three times as long as those in NTCIR2g. We thus divided NTCIR2k into the three corpora: NTCIR2k1, NTCIR2k2, and NTCIR2k3. Table 1 shows the number of documents in each corpus and its size. Corpus Number (Mbytes) NTCIR1 333,921 (125) NTCIR2g 116,177 (98) NTCIR2k1 100,000 (138) NTCIR2k2 100,000 (135) NTCIR2k3 87,071 (117) Table 1: Japanese NTCIR Corpora"]},{"title":"B) Mainichi Newspaper","paragraphs":["The articles from the Mainichi Newspaper were published between 1991 and 1994 and are comprised of four corpora: MAI1991, MAI1992, MAI1993, and MAI1994.

Accordingly, we made our evaluations using the following method. First, we randomly chose 500 pairs from each related word list, under the condition that the minimum string length to be investigated is 2, and had five people judge these pairs using four criteria, deciding whether they felt each pair was valid. Next, we totaled the results of the five judges to obtain the precision for each text corpus as a tool for evaluation. The four decision criteria were as follows.","1. The pair is a word pair having a relationship such","that the two words can be used in the same way.","2. The pair is a word pair in which there is some re-","lationship between the two words.","3. The pair is a word pair in which there is no rela-","tionship between the two words.","4. The pair is not a word pair because one or both of","the elements constituting the pair is not a word. These criteria were given score values of 2, 1, -1, and -2, respectively. In addition, we defined two rules.","A) If the total score of the five judges is more than 4 points, then the pair is a related word pair.","B) If the total score of the five judges is less than -6 points, then the elements constituting the pair are not words. The first rule means that if three of the five judges judged the pair to be a related word pair and the other two did not, then the overall judgment was that the pair was a related word pair. The second rule means that if one judge judged the pair to be a related word pair and the others did not, then the total judgment was that it is not a word pair. We defined the overall judgments so as to set a very high threshold for the decision “The pair is not a word pair.”"]},{"title":"Experimental Results","paragraphs":["Table 3 shows the number of related word pairs extracted from each text corpus for investigated string lengths of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

For lengths of 5 or more, high precision was obtained, but not many pairs. Therefore, we determined that a length of 4 is suitable if both the number of extracted pairs and the precision are taken into consideration. If we give priority to a precision, a length of 5 is suitable because the precision may be much higher at this length than at the other lengths. Table 4 shows for each case the rate of pairs judged to be valid and the rate of pairs judged to be a word pair. We represented these rates as a percentage. The former is precision, and the latter is the word pair rate. For example, for the NTCIR1 corpus with a string length of 3, the precision was 74.7% (127/170*100). This is because in this case the number of pairs obtained was 170 out of 500 judged pairs, and the number of pairs judged to be valid was 127 out of 170. In this case, the word pair rate was 92.9% (158/170*100) because the number of pairs judged to be word pairs was 158 out of 170. 1310 Corpus Rate [%] 2 3 4 5 6 NTCIR1 Precision","Word 66.6 88.6 74.7 92.9 77.0 91.8 80.0 86.7 70.0 80.0","NTCIR2g Precision Word 52.4 84.8 60.3 87.0 65.3 89.8 73.0 89.2 40.0 80.0","NTCIR2k1 Precision Word 52.4 85.6 56.8 89.9 60.4 94.3 77.8 100.0 66.7 100.0","NTCIR2k2 Precision Word 46.4 84.4 52.7 84.0 46.2 75.0 61.5 76.9 57.1 57.1","NTCIR2k3 Precision Word 39.2 86.8 49.0 86.7 42.9 78.6 50.0 75.0 33.3 66.7","MAI1991 Precision Word 35.4 79.4 22.6 75.8 24.0 78.8 24.0 64.0 23.9 63.0","MAI1992 Precision Word 20.1 67.6 20.5 56.8 25.4 63.4 18.8 62.5 16.7 55.6","MAI1993 Precision Word 16.0 68.0 8.5 64.8 11.1 67.5 6.1 63.3 7.1 64.3","MAI1994 Precision Word 19.4 54.8 27.3 58.8 28.7 61.1 40.0 66.0 30.8 61.5 Table 4: Precision and Word Pair Rate by String Length The rate of pairs judged to be word pairs for a length of 4 was very high (75.0-94.3% in the NTCIR corpora and 61.1-78.8% in the Mainichi corpora). The corresponding precisions were 42.9-77.0% and 11.1-28.7%. Therefore, the rates of pairs judged to be word pairs and related word pairs were 54.6-83.9% in the NTCIR corpora and 16.4-47.0% in the Mainichi corpora. We can thus see that the precision for the Mainichi corpora was lower than that for the other corpora. To clarify the reason for this, we analyzed the obtained related word lists."]},{"title":"Analysis","paragraphs":["We analyzed the pairs judged to be related word pairs to determine the relationship between them. Table 5 shows some of the related word pairs obtained from NTCIR1. First, even though Nos. 1-11 are clearly not pairs of words that represent the same thing, they are word pairs that are used in the same way. In particular, Nos. 5 and 11 are related word pairs typical of a specialized field. In our method, pairs of such related words are extracted more than pairs of related words that are simply synonyms. Nos. 12-17 are pairs of related words that are synonym pairs or pairs of a word and the word's abbreviation. Nos. 18-24 are pairs of words that have the same meaning but whose notations differ slightly, i.e., whether the Japanese hiragana syllabary or the katakana one is used to write the word and whether there are notations to which some characters are added. We call such differences “variation of notation.” Such related word pairs are known empirically. Nos. 25-28 are related word pairs whose character codes differ. These also fall in the “variation of notation” category. Nos. 29-33 are related word pairs that are antonym pairs or have the same upper word. Most of the related word pairs obtained from the NTCIR1 and NTCIR corpora can be classified under one of these five relationships. This is because the NTCIR corpus is comprised of documents of academic conference papers, and such documents tend to contain key words. And because the key words appear frequently, they can be extracted with relative ease. From this viewpoint, we consider our system to be a useful means of generating a special list of related words for a text corpus like NTCIR. Table 6 shows some of the related word pairs obtained from the Mainichi Newspaper. From this corpus, we obtained many related word pairs like personal names, company names, place names, and group names. We also obtained a number of related word pairs, e.g., general words. Moreover, there were many pairs that were judged to be word pairs although the words were not related. Most of such pairs were word pairs containing numerals. For example, the pair of “61.2 kiro (61.2 kg)” and “50.8 kiro (50.8 kg)” were judged to be a related word pair by two judges, but judged to be not a word pair by the other three judges. Overall, therefore, such pairs were judged to be unrelated pairs on a point basis. We found that such pairs resulted in low precision in these corpora."]},{"title":"Discussion","paragraphs":["Since our method, including the steps for word segmentation and extraction, does not use dictionaries of any type, it can be used for any language whose word boundaries are not explicit, good examples of which are Chinese and Korean. Our method also makes it possible to extract airs of words with similar usages in the English language."]},{"title":"Conclusion","paragraphs":["We have described a method for generating a list of related word pairs that facilitates understanding of the words from a text corpus through a statistical word-extraction method, even if the words are new to the method. It efficiently creates word pairs and judges whether the two words are used in the same way. Furthermore, it extracts related word pairs without using any dictionaries. Using our proposed word definition method makes it possible to generate a list of related words that users have judged to be useful. Experimental results showed that a string length of 4 is suitable for a Japanese text corpus. Even though many of the parameters in the system depend on the corpus, and there remains a trade-off problem between the number of related word pairs and the obtainable precision, the system actually works. It is thus an important step in the development of a useful thesaurus."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["This research is the result of the IPA unexplored software project conducted in fiscal year 2001.
