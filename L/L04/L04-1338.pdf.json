For this","purpose, the project pursued the following aims:","","• Integrated and effective combination of different","approaches and heterogeneous resources for cross-","lingual information access and management,","including performance and user evaluation for","realistic information access tasks.","• Automated acquisition of domain-specific linguistic","resources and effective use of multilingual concept","hierarchies.","• Demonstration of a cross-lingual information access","prototype system for the medical domain, that","provides access to multilingual information on the","basis of a combined use of corpus analysis and","(domain-specific) ontologies and thesauri."]},{"title":"The MuchMore Prototype","paragraphs":["The MuchMore project developed a prototype cross-lingual document retrieval system that enables users to retrieve documents (in English and/or German) that are relevant to a given query document (in English or German), see e.g. (Sacaleanu et al., 2003). In the current 1 http://muchmore.dfki.de version of the system2",", query documents are assumed to be German electronic patient records and documents to be retrieved are medical scientific abstracts in both German and English. The cross-lingual information retrieval task has been approached with a combination of concept-based and corpus-based methods: semantic annotation, similarity thesaurus, example-based translation, pseudo-relevance feedback and concept-space model3","."]},{"title":"Evaluation Efforts and Constructed Evaluation Resources","paragraphs":["One of the primary goals of the MuchMore project has been to develop and evaluate methods for the effective use of multilingual ontologies and thesauri in the semantic annotation of English and German medical texts and subsequently to evaluate and compare the impact of such semantic information on the CLIR task. In particular, work on semantic annotation with domain-specific (medical) and general semantic resources has been central in this approach.","In order to evaluate performance gain in the CLIR task, several experiments were carried out with a query set and relevance assessments defined by medical experts for a document collection that was gathered and prepared specifically for the MuchMore project goals.","Overall results of the evaluation effort with this document collection and query test set show that best performance may be obtained by a combination of corpus-  2 http://muchmore.dfki.de/demo1.htm 3 For a more detailed overview see the MuchMore final report: http://muchmore.dfki.de/pubs/D0.6.final.pdf 821 based and concept-based information, i.e. using a combination of manually constructed and automatically extracted (semantic) resources. Adding manually constructed knowledge (through semantic annotation or classification) improves performance, although disambiguation has not been shown to further improve performance significantly. For more information on the evaluation results, see e.g. (Volk et al., 2002). In this paper we rather concentrate on the structure and content of the evaluation resources used in these experiments."]},{"title":"Evaluation Resources for Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval in the Medical Domain MuchMore Document Collection","paragraphs":["The MuchMore document collection is a parallel corpus of English and German scientific medical abstracts obtained from the Springer LINK web site4",". The corpus consists of approximately 9000 documents with a total of one million tokens for each language. Abstracts are taken from 41 medical journals, e.g. “ Der Nervenarzt” , “ Der Radiologe” , etc., each of which constitutes a homogeneous medical sub-domain, e.g. Neurology, Radiology, etc. The corpus of downloaded HTML documents has been normalized in various ways, in order to produce a clean, plain text version. Additionally, the corpus has been aligned on the sentence level. An example abstract document is given in Figure 1., below:  Balint syndrome and associated disorders. Anamnesis, diagnostic and treatment approaches  Balint syndrome is a combination of symptoms including simultanagnosia, a disorder of spatial and object-based attention, disturbed spatial perception and representation, and optic ataxia resulting from bilateral parieto-occipital lesions. Fixation and ocular exploration of space are severely impaired, as are reading, writing, drawing and orientation as well as movement in space. Low-level visual impairments may be associated and difficult to evaluate but are not a necessary element of Balint syndrome. This review summarizes the relevant facts of the etiology, localization of lesions, and the core features as well as frequently associated disorders of the syndrome. Instructions for the examination of patients are given and approaches for the management and treatment outlined. Models of attention and space representation are described for the explanation of this multifaceted and exciting syndrome. Finally the key features of the syndrome are summarized in a table at the end of the paper.  Balint syndrome - Optic ataxia - Space representation - Parietal lesion - Attention - Reading Figure 1: Example abstract document from the MuchMore corpus  4 http://link.springer.de Each abstract document consists of a Title (if available), the Abstract itself and (if available) one or more Keywords. English abstracts are translations of the German originals, which influences their quality as most translations seem to have been done by the authors themselves. Automatic Annotation The corpus is automatically annotated using “ ShProT” , a shallow processing tool that consists of three integrated components: “ TnT” (Brants, 2000) for part-of-speech tagging, “ Mmorph” (based on Petitpierre and Russell, 1995) for morphological analysis and “ Chunkie” (Skut and Brants, 1998) for phrase recognition. Both TnT and Mmorph were adapted to the medical domain by updating the lexicon with information from English and German medical dictionaries.","Semantic annotation is performed on the basis of UMLS5","(Unified Medical Language System), a publicly available semantic resource in the medical domain that consists of an English medical lexicon (Specialist Lexicon), a multilingual terminology database (MetaThesaurus) that links several standard medical thesauri and a Semantic Network of relations between concepts in the MetaThesaurus. MeSH (Medical Subject Headings), which is one of the medical thesauri that are contained in UMLS, is used also separately in semantic annotation. Finally, also EuroWordNet6",", as a general language semantic resource, is used in the semantic annotation of the MuchMore parallel corpus.","Automatically annotated and plain versions of the corpus are available from the project web site7",". An example section of an annotated abstract document is given in Figure 2., below."," ... spatial and object-based attention, disturbed spatial perception and representation ... .  <text> ... <token id=\"w20\" pos=\"JJ\" lemma=\"spatial\"> spatial </token> <token id=\"w21\" pos=\"NN\" lemma=\"perception\"> perception </token> ... </text>  <umlsterm id=\"t7\" from=\"w20\" to=\"w21\"> <concept id=\"t7.1\" cui=\"C0037744\" tui=\"T041\"> <msh code=\"F2.463.593.778\"/> <msh code=\"F2.463.593.932.869\"/> </concept> </umlsterm>  <semrel id=\"r7\" term1=\"t7.1\" term2=\"t8.1\" reltype=\"issue_in\"/> Figure 2: Example section of an annotated abstract document from the MuchMore corpus  5 http://umls.nlm.nih.gov 6 http://www.hum.uva.nl/~ewn/ 7 http://muchmore.dfki.de/resources1.htm 822 Annotation Format and Viewer The annotation format (as illustrated in Figure 2.) has been developed specifically for the purposes of the MuchMore project. It combines multiple levels of linguistic and semantic information that are interrelated in various ways. Our aim was to design an annotation format that would encompass all of these layers and adequately represent the relationships between them, while at the same time remaining logical and readable, efficient for parsing and indexing as well as flexible for future additions and adjustments. For more information on the annotation format see (Vintar at al., 2002), (Buitelaar et al., 2003).","An online demo is available that allows for automatic annotation of small documents with PoS, morphology, chunks and semantic annotation as discussed above. Documents that are annotated in this format can be displayed by use of the “ MuchMore Viewer” , which allows also for interactive correction of annotated documents. The annotation demo and viewer are both available from the MuchMore web site8","."]},{"title":"MuchMore Query Set and Relevance Assessments","paragraphs":["In our CLIR experiments, we used relevance assessments based on 25 queries provided by medical experts. We obtained relevance assessments for the German documents as well as for the English documents from two teams of experts.","Unfortunately however there was a large discrepancy in their assessments. The German language team judged 959 documents to be relevant, the English language team 500 documents. The main reason for this discrepancy was the different types of experts doing the assessments (professionals vs. students). The overlap was 382 documents while 118 were only deemed relevant by the English language judges and 577 were only relevant for the German language judges.","Because the document collection is parallel, we decided to use only the German relevance assessments for our experiments in order to get comparable data. In these assessments the number of relevant documents per query varies between 7 and 104.","Queries are short and usually consist of a complex noun phrase extended by attributes (including prepositional phrases) and coordination. Figure 3. gives some examples."," arthroscopic treatment of cruciate ligament injuries  Arthroskopische Behandlung bei Kreuzbandverletzungen indication for implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)  Indikation für einen implantierbaren Kardioverter-Defibrillator (ICD) Therapy in chronic lower back pain  Therapie beim chronischen Kreuzschmerz Figure 3: Example Queries 8 http://muchmore.dfki.de/demo2.htm Queries (in German and English) and relevance assessments (from the German and the English language teams) are available from the MuchMore web site9","."]},{"title":"Evaluation Resources for Sense Disambiguation in the Medical Domain","paragraphs":["One of the research areas that the MuchMore project focused on was sense disambiguation, which is an enabling task in concept-based, cross-lingual information access. Unfortunately, there is a lack of test sets for sense disambiguation evaluation, specifically for languages other than English and even more so for specific domains like medicine. Given that MuchMore had a focus on English as well as German in the medical domain, the project developed its own evaluation sets in order to test different disambiguation methods (Raileanu et al., 2002). The sets consist of disambiguated instances that were selected from the German part of the MuchMore corpus annotated with GermaNet (Hamp and Feldweg, 1997) and UMLS (German). Both sets are available from the project web site10",". For more information on some of the sense disambiguation evaluation results see (Widdows et al., 2003). Inter-Annotator Agreement In order to assess the difficulty of the disambiguation task, inter-annotator agreement scores were computed. Here, “ annotators” are the domain experts who manually disambiguated selected ambiguous word occurrences.","The agreement scores for the GermaNet evaluation corpus have been discussed in (Raileanu et al., 2002). The agreement scores for UMLS vary from very low to very high, with an average of 65%. In some cases, the UMLS definitions were insufficient to give a clear distinction between concepts, especially when the concepts came from different original thesauri. This allowed the decision of whether a particular definition made “ sense” to be more or less subjective.","Approximately half of the disagreements between annotators occurred with terms where inter-annotator agreement was less than 10%, which is evidence that a significant amount of the disagreement between annotators was on the type level rather than the token level. In other cases, it is possible that there was insufficient contextual information provided for annotators to agree. If one of the annotators was unable to choose any of the senses and declared an instance to be ‘unspecified’, this also counted against inter-annotator agreement."]},{"title":"Evaluation Resource for Morphological Analysis in the Medical Domain","paragraphs":["In many languages other than English the morphological system is very rich and enables the construction of semantically complex compound words. For instance the German word Kreuzbandverletzung corresponds in English with three words: cruciate ligament injury. In a task like CLIR it is therefore important to know the morphological structure of (domain-specific) words, in order to allow for an appropriate cross-lingual match. 9 http://muchmore.dfki.de/resources2.htm 10 http://muchmore.dfki.de/resources3.htm 823","Therefore, to evaluate the performance of the annotation system on morphological decomposition of German medical terms, evaluation lists were developed of manually decomposed terms. Two lists are available11",", compiled for different sub-corpora of the MuchMore corpus.
