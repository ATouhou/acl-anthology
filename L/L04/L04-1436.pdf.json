Introduction","paragraphs":["From a practical TTS (text-to-speech) system or a expressive spoken dialogue system, a speech synthesizer that can generate speech with various kinds of prosody is requested. Many already developed TTS systems have implemented global prosodic control, fundamentally they’re designed to output speech with standard pitch and speech rate.","In this decade, a unit selection synthesis method using large speech corpus (corpus-based speech synthesis) has been attracted for naturalness of output speech (Black et al.,1995). Because its output speech quality depends on its corpus size and corpus character, some unit selection approaches introduce prosody or/and spectrum modification process. We also employ a unit selection-concatenation method and analysis-synthesis process to give precise target prosody a user want, to output speech.","However, many research has reported that speech quality get worse in proportion to an amount of prosody modification by analysis-synthesis or PSOLA (Pitch Synchronous OverLap Add). Following the reports, we take an approach that aims to reduce prosody modification of a speech segment. We discuss synthesis method for high quality speech with extreme prosody (very high, low, fast and slow) by constructing Japanese speech databases with various kinds of prosody.","In section 2, database designing and recording process and their prosodic characteristics are described. After we confirm relationship between speech quality and prosody modification, using synthetic speech with various kinds of prosody in section 3, we also investigate relationship between a speech deterioration tendency and a speech database. And we conclude this paper."]},{"title":"2. Speech Database 2.1. Database designing","paragraphs":["Speech quality deterioration is occurred in proportion to prosody modification by analysis-synthesis or PSOLA method. Our approach is not to modify spectral parameters according to prosody modification but to prepare speech database to reduce prosody modification.","Based on the idea, we record nine phonetically-balanced Japanese speech databases. Each set has same texts and different prosody (Masuda et al.,2004, Kawanami et al.,2002). Target values have three variations of F0: F0 in natural reading speech for a speaker (normal), 0.4 [octave] higher (high) and 0.4 [octave] lower (low). In the same way, three target values for duration: normal duration (normal), 0.5 [octave] shorter (fast), 0.5 [octave] longer (slow). Combination of these 2-dimensional feature, we records nine databases. Each database consists of 525 Japanese sentences, which are based on the phonetically-balanced 503 sentence set designed by ATR. 2.2. Database recording","Two female professional narrators (speaker FME, FOR) are asked to speak the sentences in nine prosodic variations. Recording procedure is as follows.","1. 525 sentences are recorded. Speakers are asked to speak in their natural reading style.","2. Using STRAIGHT method (Kawahara, 1997), analysis-synthesized speech is generated in nine kinds of target prosody, from the original speech database.","3. Nine databases are recorded. Synthesized speech with target prosody are presented before each utterance.

Detail Analysis","paragraphs":["From the result of the perceptual evaluation in 3.3, it is supposed that quality deterioration owing to prosody modification relates to original prosodic features. Kawai et al. (2000) report permissible range of prosodic modification by PSOLA, using word utterances. The define that a “permissible range” is a 2-dimensional space that can obtain more than score four by MOS score for naturalness in average. Their report says the permissible range is −0.2+0.2 octave in F0 and −0.5+0.1 octave in duration.","Following the report, we expand the research area using our five databases. Although they reports a permissible range around normal reading speech, we investigate relationship between a permissible range and original prosodic characters. Another difference is a modification method: we use STRAIGHT analysis- synthesis method. 4.1. Speech stimuli","Speech stimuli are not generated from output of a unit selection TTS system but four original speech from each database. Prosody modification is done by STRAIGHT using natural speech by −0.5+0.5 octave both in F0 and duration, in 0.1 octave step each. In this report, F0 modification and duration modification is not executed simultaneously. To evaluate quality degradation through STRAIGHT analysis-synthesis process, natural speech that is not executed signal processing is add to speech stimuli, 4.2. Perceptual evaluation","Perceptual tests are conducted using MOS(Mean Opinion Score). 8 adult examinees are asked to listened to speech stimuli from headphones and evaluate naturalness 0 1 2 3 4 5 normal high low fast slow MOS","Original-MOS STRAIGHT-MOS Figure 3: STRAIGHT-MOS from 1(Bad) to 5(Excellent). Speech stimuli are listed randomly and they’re allowed to listen to stimuli any number of times. Every stimuli is appeard twice in a test.","Experimental results are shown in Fig.3 and 4. Fig.3 illustrates speech quality degradation owing to only analysis-synthesis process. Comparison of MOS’s of natural speech (Original-MOS) and STRAIGHT analysis-synthesized speech (STRAIGHT-MOS) can be seen. The upper number sequence of the horizontal axis in Fig.4 denotes modification rate from original speech and the lower line denotes difference from normal prosody. 4.3. Discussion for perceptual test result","We discuss relationship between speech quality and prosody modification using STRAIGHT-MOS(analysis-synthesized speech by STRAIGHT without prosody modification) as a standard. We define modification permissible range provisionally from the perceptual results.","(1) exclude those are more than 0.5 score inferiour to STRAIGHT-MOS.","(2) exclude those have significant difference between STRAIGHT-MOS, by t-test(significance level 5 %). Table 3 shows prosody modification permissible range decided by the above difinition.","On stimuli from normal db, quality deterioration is observed in proportion to F0 modification generally. On durational feature, a permissible range is more wider for shortening. The same durational tendencies are also observed in high db and low db. Comparing these results to those of Kawai et al.(2000), on F0 is almost same and is slightly sensitive on duration.","On high db, heightening F0 remarkably lose quality. Original high db speech itself is recorded considerably unnatural speech both on F0 generation and vocal tract control, it is supposed that it is cause not only by miscorrespondence between spectral feature and prosodic feature but by unnaturalness as human pitch range, and so on. Same tendency is observed on the result of low db.","On fast db and slow db, they’re characterize deterioration tendencies with durational modification. As a general tendency, it is observed that speech lengthening is sensitive for deterioration than shortening. Based on this tendency, we can see fast db have wider range for lengthening and slow db have much wider for shortening. They are also 2161 Table 3: Permissible Range in Each Database normal F0 −0.2+0.2 Duration −0.3+0.2 high F0 −0.2 0.0 Duration −0.3+0.2 low F0 −0.1+0.4 Duration −0.3+0.2 fast F0 −0.2+0.3 Duration −0.2+0.4 slow F0 −0.1+0.3 Duration −0.5+0.3","(octave) supposed to be influenced by unnnaturalness of speech rate as human speech.","If we integrated that of five databases, the permissible range can be expanded within −0.4+0.4 octave in F0, and −0.6+0.7 octave in duration but more detailed analysis (e.g. glottal source quality) should be done for database integration."]},{"title":"5. Conclusion","paragraphs":["In this paper, we discuss improvement of synthesis speech which have extreme prosodic features. Our approach is to reduce prosody modification in analysis-synthesis process by preparing speech databases with various kinds of prosody. We focused on five speech databases (high, low, fast, slow and normal (conventional)) and confirm average modification ratio is reduced in each database’s correponfing prosodic area. Perceptual results also indicate their effect except the fast speech database.","We also investigate relationship between perceptual quality and modification ratio using speech from each database. Using its MOS score results, we define a permissible modification range for each database. The permissible range can be expanded within −0.4+0.4 octave in F0, and −0.6+0.7 octave in duration if we integrated that of five databases, but more detailed analysis (e.g. glottal source waveform) is required for database integration.
