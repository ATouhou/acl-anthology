Our approach relies strongly on the semantic generalizations allowed by already existing resources (e.g. Domain labels, Named Entity categories, concepts in the SUMO ontology, etc). Several experiments have been carried out using comparable corpora in four languages (Italian, Spanish, Basque and English) and two domains (FINANCE and SPORT) showing that the semantic patterns acquired can be general enough to be ported from one language to the other language."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["Being a multidimensional problem, predicate knowledge is one of the most complex types of information to acquire. Predicates (verbs and their corresponding nominalizations) are essential for the development of robust and accurate parsing technology capable of recovering predicate-argument relations and logical forms. Without it, resolving most structural ambiguities of sentences is difficult, and understanding language impossible.","Full account of predicate information requires specify-ing the number and type of arguments, predicate sense under consideration, semantic representation of the particular predicate-argument structure, mapping between the syntactic and semantic levels of representation, semantic selectional restrictions/preferences on participants, control of the omitted participants and possible diathesis alternations. Unfortunately, all these kinds of knowledge are interdependent.","However, (Korhonen, 2002) showed that in terms of SCF distributions, individual verbs correlate more closely with syntactically similar verbs and clearly more closely with semantically similar verbs, than with all verbs in general. Moreover, her results show that verb semantic generalisations can successfully be used to guide and structure the acquisition of SCFs from corpus data.","Thus, it is possible to devise alternative acquisition schemes going top-down from semantics to syntax. If we identify specific associations between participants and predicates (selectional preferences), we can also gather information from corpus data about their particular syntactic behaviour in relation to a predicate, helping the acquisition of SCFs, diathesis alternations, etc. However, this new approach requires to work directly at a sense level, having predicates and associations to participants semantically disambiguated.","Furthermore, in a multilingual semantic scenario, it seems possible to devise ways to acquire from a particular language and using a bottom-up approach some predicate-argument knowledge, and then, following a top-down fashion, to acquire or validate some knowledge in another language.","Two different and complementary dimensions can help to minimise the WSD problem: multilingualism and domains. Although, working in parallel with comparable corpora in several languages will increase the complexity of the process, we believe that language translation discrepancies among word forms can help the selection of the correct word senses (Habash and Dorr, 2002). Moreover, further reduction of the search space among sense candidates can be obtained by processing domain corpora (Gale et al., 1992).","A set of empirical tests have been designed to evaluate the feasibility of the semantic-driven approach. These experiments have been carried out in the framework of the MEANING project (Developing Multilingual Web-scale Language Technologies1","). Inside MEANING several wordnets from different European Languages have been aligned and integrated into a common semantic knowledge base: the Multilingual Central Repository (MCR (Atserias et al., 2004)). In MEANING the MCR acts as a multilingual in-terface for integrating and distributing all the knowledge acquired in the project. The resulting MCR has been also enriched with new semantic information coming from different sources and methods including an updated version of the EuroWordNet Top Concept Ontology (Vossen, 1998), the Suggested Upper Merged Ontology (SUMO) (Niles and Pease, 2001), a general ontology, WordNet Domains (Magnini and Cavagli, 2000), etc.","This paper presents the first steps towards testing the validity of this new approach for the acquisition of predicate knowledge (SCFs, Selectional Restrictions, diathesis alternations, etc). The work here presented explores some basic issues in the acquisition of semantic models. First, how the current technology and the knowledge available can help large-scale acquisition tasks, mainly subcategorization 1 http://www.lsi.upc.es/ñlp/meaning 33 frames (SCFs) and selectional restrictions or preferences (SPs) for Spanish, Italian, Basque and English. Second, the impact in the acquisition process when using several languages at the same time and third, when using domain corpus instead of a general corpus.","After this introduction, section 2. presents the resources used in this exploration. Section 3. describes the methodology used to acquire large–scale monolingual Semantic Models for predicates. Section 4. provides some qualitative views with about the domain and multilingual exploration and finally, in Section 5. we conclude with some prospects for future work."]},{"title":"2. Experimental Setting","paragraphs":["Summarising, this paper presents new ways for restrict-ing the search space when performing acquisition tasks, in order to obtain more accurate knowledge for some languages and balancing the coverage of such knowledge across languages.","Thus, this experiment can be also seen as a common framework to study productive paths to exploit appropriately:","available semantic knowledge (wordnets, Semantic Files, MultiWordNet Domains, EuroWordNet Top Ontology, SUMO, etc. already present into the MCR (Atserias et al., 2004))","cross language discrepancies/agreements through the EuroWordNet Interlingual Index","available comparable domain corpora in several languages","large-scale selectional preferences already acquired from this multilingual corpora (Atserias et al., 2003; Agirre et al., 2003)"]},{"title":"3. The multilingual Adquisition","paragraphs":["We carried out the experiment for particular verbal synsets which have common senses in the considered languages. For instance, the following verbal synsets belongs to the same ILI–record: English verbal synset 01564908–v <gain,clear,make,earn,realize>, Italian <reallizare,guadagnare>, Spanish <ganar> and Basque <irabazi>.","First, we collect sentences containing those verbs in comparable corpora for both domains FINANCE and SPORT. For each sentence, depending of the current capabilities of the Linguistic Processors used, we obtained the heads of the verb–slots acting possibly as subjects and objects. Only the English linguistic processor RASP (Bricoe and Carroll, 2002) performs high accurate dependency analysis.","For the rest of languages, in the pre-processing phase the sentences are PoS tagged and parsed into non-recursive phrasal units. The quality of parsing, especially with respect of NP chunks, is a crucial factor in the success of analysis. For Basque, we used a chuncker based on an unification grammar. For Italian and Spanish, in order to extract subject/object groups, three simple heuristics are applied:","lemma Sport Finance Spanish empatar 1580 2 Italian pareggiare 4551 80 Basque berlindu 6 - English draw 120 60","tie 500 48 Table 1: Verb occurrences for synset 00756166-v in both Sport and Finance corpora first, consider NP groups directly at the left hand side and at the right hand of the VP, second, identify passives and the postponed subject, and, finally, the VP NP NP case. As Italian and Spanish are subject-drop languages, we also use simple heuristics, based on barriers phrases, to detect the subject/object-drop cases.","Finally, once the subject/object pairs are extracted we associated a Named Entity category (or Semantic File from WN) and a Domain label to each head of the nominal groups. We also implemented a very simple generalization procedure associating to each verb one or more semantic patterns of type Name Entity+WN Domain on the base of their frequency.","In order to work with compatible representations across languages, we obtained for each verb–slot filler all their synsets. We also mapped the Named Entities types (PERSON, ORGANIZATION, AMOUNT, PERCENT-AGE, DATE, etc.) to a common semantic representation. In the next tables, NONE stands for words that doesn’t appear in the local wordnets and NO SUBJECT/NO OBJECT represents sentences where the subject/object was not detected."]},{"title":"4. Preliminary Results","paragraphs":["Being this a preliminary and exploratory study (with many, hard and biased simplifications) we have performed only a preliminary qualitative evaluation. We have compared several semantic patterns coming from translation equivalent verbs selected from different languages and domains. The analysis of these results provide an initial characterization of the different cross–lingual behaviours. 4.1. Monosemous verbs","First, we analyze a very simple case. The word empatar is monosemous in Spanish while its English translations tie and draw are highly ambiguous (9 and 33 senses respectively). Table 1 shows some frecuency figures for the verbal synset 00756166-v. This sense belongs to the SPORT WN domain, but we obtain verb sentences in both domain corpora. Obviously, the number of verbal occurrences is different due to the different origin, domain, language and nature of the corpus processed.","Now, we can merge all these pairs in comparable representacions. Table 2 shows the first subject+object pairs of an ordered list resulting from merging Spanish and English, when performing some simple sense frequency counting.","To show the potentiality of this approach, we can also perform some basic generalizations, choosing the combination of Wordnet Semantic Field and MultiWordNet Domains as the semantic representation for each synset. Table 3 shows the initial part of an ordered list of subject+object generalized pairs resulting from Spanish and English, when 34 Subject Object NONE NOOBJECT PERSON NOOBJECT NONE NONE ORGANIZATION NONE PERSON NONE ORGANIZATION NOOBJECT ORGANIZATION ORGANIZATION ORGANIZATION PERSON <team 1> NOOBJECT LOCATION NOOBJECT <club 2> NOOBJECT PERSON <match 2> Table 2: Merging the Spanish/English Subject+Object pairs of 00756166-v from Sport corpora Subject Object person-factotum act-sport person-factotum quantity-sport group-factotum event-sport person-factotum event-sport group-sport NOOBJECT person-factotum act-sport person-factotum quantity-sport group-factotum event-sport person-factotum event-sport Table 3: Merging the Spanish/English Subject+Object generalized pairs of 00756166-v from Sport corpora performing some simple sense frequency counting and filtering out pairs not belonging to the SPORT WN domain.","Although some of the verbs are monosemous in the sports domain, an in-depth analysis of the data obtained, provides two different but related (by a causality relation) semantic patterns for <tie 2> that applies in all the languages:","<team 1><tie 2><score 3>","<team 1><tie 2><match 2>","Recall that, initially, all this data has been obtained without any kind of WSD preprocess. The existing combinations of cross–lingual correspondences in a restricted domain helps to corpus produce the final semantic patterns. 4.2. Multilingualy restricted polysemous verbs","Table 4 shows some volume figures for the verbs connected to the ILI–record 00756166-v. This ILI–record belongs also to SPORT WN domain. Although in this case, none of the verbs is monosemous, they are mutually restrictive.","Table 5 shows an ordered list of generalized patterns when processing this data and combining Spanish, English","lemma Sport Finance Spanish entrenar 2880 18 Italian allenare 7243 16 Basque entrenatu 23 - English train 114 12","coach 346 - Table 4: Verb occurrences for synset 00565367-v in both Sport and Finance corpora Subject Object group-factotum person-factotum person-factotum person-factotum group-factotum time-time period person-factotum group-factotum Table 5: Merging the Spanish/English/Italian Subject+Object generalized pairs of 00565367-v from Sport corpora lemma Sport Finance","Spanish ganar 24268 1618","Italian realizare 5421 5615 guadagnare 3701 1618","Basque irabazi 132 14","English earn 117 143 realize 17 8 clear 22 23 gain 35 794 make 789 1695 Table 6: Verb occurrences for synset 01564908-v in both Sport and Finance corpora and Italian languages.","In general, however, we will obtain all kinds of polysemous combinations of verbal senses.","Table 6 shows some frecuency figures of the verbal synset 01564908-v in both Sport and Finance corpora.

Conclusions","paragraphs":["Automatic acquisition of semantic patterns for predicate structures (verbs and their corresponding nominalizations) is one of the most complex task for lexical acquisition. Verbs show multidimensional and interdependent features (selectional preferences, diathesis alternations, subcategorization frames) and their behavior may vary not only across languages, but also across corpus domains and genre. These facts are problematic for any syntax-driven approach (Atserias et al., 2001).","We proposed a cross-language methodology of acquir-ing semantic patterns for predicates. The pilot study we have conducted shows that it is possible to obtain promising results using this framework, if we consier the high level of polysemy degree we are dealing with. We used very simple criteria together with large collections of comparable corpora and already existing semantic resources to acquire Subject Object person-factotum act-factotum person-factotum event-sport group-factotum event-sport group-factotum act-factotum person-factotum group-factotum person-factotum time-time period Table 10: Merging the Spanish/English/Italian Subject+Object generalized pairs of 01564238-v from Sport corpus large amounts of semantic patterns that can be very useful for a number of applications based on shallow semantics. Obviously, the whole process can be widely improved in several steps, in particular the semantic generalization process.","Finally, we also plan to evaluate the application of the acquired cross-lingual models in particular NLP tasks, such as PP–attachment (Agirre et al., 2004), detection of subject/objects or WSD."]},{"title":"6.
