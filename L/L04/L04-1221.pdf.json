This paper characterizes and motivates the networks of frame-to-frame relations that are being built on FrameNet’s frames, and introduces additional representational mechanisms needed for showing similarities among LUs that are independent of frame membership. LU-to-LU relationships are shown by shared membership in a single frame, by membership in frames that are themselves related to each other, and by shared semantic type information."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["FrameNet (FN) is a corpus-based1","lexicon-building project that documents the links between lexical items and the semantic frame(s) they evoke; it accomplishes this by annotating sets of sentences that exemplify the items being described, and performing various operations on the result-ing annotations. The basic units in FN descriptions are the frame and the lexical unit (LU), the latter understood as the pairing of a “w ord” with just one of its meanings;2","thus, a word with four meanings is treated as four lexical units. In most cases, for a word to have more than one meaning implies that it belongs to more than one frame.3","The main components of the FrameNet database are (1) the frame ontology, (2) the set of annotated sentences, and (3) the set of lexical entries. The basis of the ontology is the set of frames, each of which consists of an informal characterization of a situation type (the frame definition), together with a collection of frame elements (FEs). The FEs are the semantic roles of the entities involved in each frame. FE names are used as labels for the the words or phrases that are in grammatical construction with the LUs that evoke that particular frame. For example, the frame that includes the English verb inform has as its core FEs SPEAKER, ADDRESSEE and MESSAGE.","The example sentences are selected by FrameNet annotators as representing the typical uses of the LUs belonging to individual frames. Each set of annotations is centered around a particular LU; the sentence’s constituents are labeled (with FE names) according to the ways in which they fillin information about the frame. For example, sentences","1","Our corpus is the British National Corpus, used with permission of Oxford University Press, and, more recently, newswire text from the Linguistic Data Consortium.","2","The term is from Cruse, 1986).","3","Effectively this does not distinguish between polysemy and homonymy; FrameNet researchers are interested in the semantic links connecting the senses of a polysemous word (metaphor, metonymy, generalizing, narrowing, etc.—see Fill-more and Atkins, 2000) on the polysemy of crawl), but currently lack the means of identifying and displaying such relations. (1) and (2) have SPEAKER appearing as subject, and ADDRESSEE as object; the MESSAGE FE appears as a that-clause in sentence (1), and as an event-naming nominalization introduced by of in sentence (2).","(1) [SPEAKER We] informed [ADDRESSEE the press] [MESSAGE that the prime minister has resigned]","(2) [SPEAKER We] informed [ADDRESSEE the press] [MESSAGE of the prime minister’s resignation]","The lexical entry for each LU is a summary of what has been recorded in its annotations, presented as valence descriptions, showing all the ways in which its frame elements can be realized, such as the alternative syntactic realizations of the MESSAGE just shown for the verb inform. The collection of annotated sentences is made available in the database as evidence for the analysis.","To date not much attention has been paid to the second syllable in the name “FrameNet”—the part that suggests a network of relations. The first and most obvious way in which LUs are related to each other is through membership in the same frame. Thus inform shares a frame with the verbs notify and announce, and also with the nouns no-tification and announcement, and the verb resign shares frame membership with its nominal partner resignation, and with verbal expressions like abdicate, step down and stand down.4","But LUs can also be related to each other in other ways, either because their frames are related to other frames, or through semantic properties (called semantic types in the FN database) assigned to LUs individually rather than through their frames.","4","Membership in a single frame is not equivalent to belonging to the same WordNet synset. Frame members do not need to belong to a single part of speech, and they can include words that express different values on a single scale, hence even antonymous words. Thus, such obviously non-synonymous pairs as old and young share frame membership, as do heavy and light, or tall and short. 1091"]},{"title":"2. Representation Mechanisms","paragraphs":["We begin with a discussion of semantic types, and continue with three frame-to-frame relations, inheritance, using and subframe. 2.1. Semantic types","The FrameNet database allows the assignment of semantic types to LUs, FEs and frames. The perception verbs hear vs. listen are distinguished as passive versus active perception verbs, and so, respectively, are see vs. look. Hearing and seeing are things that happen to you, listen-ing and looking are things that you do, and this difference is considered important enough to merit entry into separate frames.","In the FN database, hear and see and the passive-perception uses of other sensory words, such as feel, taste and smell, belong to the Perception experience frame; the verbs look and listen belong to the Perception active frame, along with the corresponding active uses of feel, taste and smell.5","A cross-cutting grouping of these verbs according to their sensory modality is handled indirectly, through markers of semantic type for Vision, Hearing, Smell, Taste and Touch.6 2.2. Inheritance","We define frame inheritance as an IS-A relation between a parent frame and a child frame which includes full inheritance of FEs and their semantic types. This means that if the parent frame has a semantic type, the child frame must have the same semantic type or a subtype (elaboration) of it. Also, for each FE in the parent frame there must be an FE in the child frame of the same semantic type or a subtype thereof. The FEs of the child may or may not have the same names as the FEs of the parent, and there may be additional FEs in the child for which there is no corresponding FE in the parent. Furthermore, if the parent frame has subframes (basically subevents, discussed below), its subframe structure is also inherited (and possibly elaborated) by the child frame. This is complete, monotonic inheritance. 2.3. Using","Because we found a number of relations among frames which do not quite fit the criteria for full inheritance, we have defined a second type of relation, similar to inheritance, not requiring full mapping of FEs from parent to child, or complete inheritance of the parents’ subframe","5","Examples of the passive vs. active uses of the polysemous verbs are I just felt something touch me vs. Feel his leg to see if it’s broken; Do you smell something? vs. Take time to smell the roses; I think I can taste rum in this mixture vs. Would somebody taste the soup to see if it’s got enough salt?","6","The modality features are used to account for certain distributional properties of the perception verbs that are related to the difference between distant senses (Vision and Smell), contact senses (Taste and Touch), and chemical senses (Smell and Taste). Not all verbs in the Perception experience frame bear a modality-specifying semantic type: perceive and notice, for example, are neutral in this respect. structure. Like inheritance, there can be multiple using relations, so that a child may inherit and/or use multiple parents.","Defining such inheritance relations creates a lattice of frames, a directed acyclic graph. Working out the full details of multiple inheritance through several levels of the lattice can be complex and time-consuming, and we have not created all the links which we would like, but there are currently roughly 130 inheritance links and 160 using links in the FN database. 2.4. Subframes","Subframes are used for representing subevents; frames that represent complex processes have subframes representing their subparts.7","To take a simple example, the Motion scenario frame has three subframes, Departing, Motion, and Arriving. In this case, the subframes are temporally ordered, but in general, subframes need not be a completely ordered with respect to each other. For example, the Commercial transaction frame has two subframes Commerce goods-transfer and Commerce money-transfer, but these are not ordered with respect to each other. In some commercial transactions, you pay in advance, in others, only after receiving the goods or services. 2.5. The Implementation of Frame-to-Frame","Relations in the Database","The conceptual relations described above are implemented as a relational database, using MySQL. So far as possible, the tables of the database and the links between them directly mirror the conceptual structure. For example, there is a table for frames and another for FEs, with a one-to-many relation between them. The lemma table is linked to the frame table via the lexical unit table, each entry of which has a pointer to a lemma and a pointer to a frame; this is a many-to-many relation—frames typically include many lemmas and the same lemma can appear in several frames, representing polysemy or homonymy. The higherorder relations are handled similarly. For a full discussion of the database structure, see Baker et al., 2003."]},{"title":"3. Using the Relations","paragraphs":["There are two broad uses of the relations we have been discussing: (1) capturing linguistic generalizations, and (2) projecting inferences from frame-annotated sentences. 3.1. Capturing Generalizations","Capturing linguistic generalizations requires defining the features or structures with respect to which the generalizations can be stated. If LUs across frames are assigned the same semantic types, there should be something that these LUs have in common, where the generalization is expressed with reference to the shared semantic type. If some frames are seen as subtypes of another frame, then statements about the more general frame will be applicable to the more specificframes. 7","Note that subtypes of frames are represented by inheritance and using relations, which are quite distinct from the subframe relation. 1092 Figure 1: Examples of Frame Relations","In Figure 1 we see Judgment communication as using both Judgment and Statement, which in turn uses Communication (shown by the dashed arrows). We also see Judgment direct address inheriting from (i.e. a subtype of, shown by the solid arrow) Judgment communication. Not shown in the figure is the information that the FEs of the mother, in each case, are bound to particular FEs in the daughter.","For example, the subtypes of the Communication frame (with LUs like communicate, signal) all presuppose a situation in which someone is conveying wishes or information to someone else. The subtypes of the Judgment frame (LUs admire, critical, contempt) involve situations in which someone is evaluating something or someone else. Communicating such judgments is a combination of these two situations, where the Communication.COMMUNICATOR is linked to the Telling.SPEAKER, and thence to the Judgment.COGNIZER, captured in the Judgment communication frame (LUs condemn, extol, scathing). This is in turn used by a frame called Judgment direct address (LUs chastise, compliment, scold) in which the EVALUEE is also identified with the ADDRESSEE. The frame-to-frame relations are shown in Figure 1","Note that the LUs in the Judgment frame and its descendants are also further differentiated by semantic types for Positive judgment and Negative judgment. (In Judgment, value vs. condemn; in Judgment communication, praise vs. criticize; in Judgment direct address, flatter vs. scold.) The main motivation behind the assignment of semantic types to LUs is the assumption that in some part of the grammar of the language, the LUs bearing the type participate in some generalization. For example, we say that words designating colors have a color feature, meaning that they participate in the Color qualification frame whose members are adjectives like light, pale, dark, deep, etc. This allows us to recognize that color adjectives in English are regularly modifiableby adjectives, and we need a way of stating this.","In a number of frames indicating scalar or gradable concepts there is a distinction between plain and end-of-scale gradables. Examples of the contrast are shown in Dimension Plain End of Scale SIZE large, big enormous, immense SIZE small minuscule, tiny BEAUTY attractive, pretty gorgeous, ravishing TASTE tasty delicious INTEREST interesting fascinating, enchanting Table 1: Semantic Features for Scalar Adjectives Table 1; the elements on the right are of semantic type end-of-scale. Although these word groups belong to different frames, they have something in common that is independent of their frame membership. They participate as arguments in modificationstructures expressing the Extreme value frame whose LUs include absolutely, utterly, perfectly and a few others.","Polar evaluative semantic types, which could be called simply Negative and Positive, are needed for describing various contexts that preferentially select expressions of desirable or undesirable phenomena. The verb cause is famously8","the creator of contexts favoring negatively evaluated concepts like disaster, infection, death, injury.9","As we have seen with Communication and Judgment, multiple inheritance can show how the general properties of two independently-needed frame can apply to a single daughter frame. Multiple inheritance also covers situations in which one frame provides information about what is happening in the world, and the other presents a particular point of view on the event and determines certain aspects of the structuring of the clause, such as which frame elements are realized in the nucleus of a clause (as subject or direct object) and which are expressed obliquely or left unexpressed. For example, sentences about buying and selling can give the same information about a particular exchange event, but the buying frame is simultaneously an acquiring frame and the selling frame is simultaneously a giving frame. Buy-ing something from somebody is getting something from somebody; selling something to somebody is giving something to somebody, both in terms of syntax and of semantic profiling.Thus, in sentences about buying, selling, paying, spending, charging, etc., inferences about who has what be-fore and after the transaction are more dependent on who is identifiedas the buyer or seller, what the goods and the payment are, than on who is seen as the agent and what is seen as the theme. 3.2. Projecting Inferences","The more “situational” frames in such relationships can shade into the kinds of cognitive structures that have been treated in a number of fieldsunder such names as schema (Bartlett, 1932; Piaget, 1952), frame (Minsky, 1975; Goffman, 1974; Tannen, 1985), script (Schank and Abelson, 1977), idealized cognitive models (Lakoff, 1987, 68-76 & ff.) and memes (Dawkins, 1976). Some frames identify events or states of affairs that are seen as part of larger situation types, and evoke in the mind of the language user an 8 cf. Stubbs, 1995a; Stubbs, 1995b; Sinclair, 1991 9 This is a case where a needed sortal property cannot believ-","ably correspond to a node in any of the existing ontologies. 1093 understanding of that larger situation that shapes the coherence of the ongoing discourse. Recording such relationships will provide information usable in tracking events, detecting situational backgrounds, making predictions, etc. These can be referred to as cognitive frames, though this is not a term of art recognized in the FN database.","It would be impossible to describe all of the cognitive frames, or even all of those that the lexicon clearly impinges on, in a purely lexicographic project. But for a research project that is reaching toward language understanding and full text semantic parsing within such domains, it would be important to work through a small number of such frames characteristic of a particular class of domain types, if only to pave the way for others wishing to adapt FrameNet methods to specialist language.","The relation between linguistic frames and background frames are of the types we refer to as sub-frame and using, typically both. Tipping, for example, is interpreted as one temporal part of a general service script, and is capable of invoking a variety of service contexts—restaurants, taxi rides, hotel services, etc., where the relationship could be spoken of as of the using type.","There are many nouns in English that designate a “gift” or a “gi ving” act in some close-up event where one person gives (usually) money to another person within a particular cultural setting, but the individual nouns trigger or evoke very different experiential or institutional settings: among them are tip, bribe, ransom, honorarium, fine, and tax, each of which can be used in a support construction (with pay or give, for example) to profilethe moment of money transfer, while separately evoking very different schematic histories and outcomes. At play here is not merely the cultural fact that money payments are expected or demanded under particular conditions, but that certain lexical units simultaneously identify10","the payment event and evoke the setting.","The FrameNet team has undertaken a fine-grainedanalysis of a number of concepts in Criminal process, though still more or less restricted to the level of newspaper reports of crimes and the law. One of our goals in this work has been to be able to make predictive and postdictive inferences based on lexically tagged events. Arraignment is a temporal portion of a full script of criminal justice procedure, presupposing arrest and expecting trial and adjudication, but also presupposing the general cultural expectations associated with wrong-doing and rewards-and-punishment. Someone who knows the meaning of the word will conclude from a report that X has been arraigned (1) that X is engaged in a criminal procedure (an “outw ard” inference), (2) that X was suspected of committing a crime and has been arrested (a “backw ard” inference), (3) that a report of the event should mention a criminal charge, the setting of bail, the setting of a trial date, the plea (“inw ard” inferences), and (4) that X can be expected to participate in fu-","10","Here we might use the Langacker term profile (Langacker, 1987), a term he introduces with the word hypotenuse.
