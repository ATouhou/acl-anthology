These LRs have been extracted from or developed based on the Reference Corpus of Contemporary Portuguese (CRPC1","), a monitor corpus containing, at the present, more than 300 million words, taken by sampling from several types of written text (literary, newspaper, technical, didactic, juridical, parlamentary, etc.) and spoken text (informal and formal), pertaining to national and regional varieties of Portuguese (including European, Brazilian, African and Asian Portuguese). The LRs available for on-line queries include: a) several subcorpora (written and spoken, tagged and untagged) compiled and extracted from CRPC for specific CLUL’s projects and now available for on-line queries; b) a published sample of “Português Fundamental”, a spoken CRPC subcorpus, available for texts download; c) a frequency lexicon extracted from a CRPC subcorpus available for both on-line queries and download. Other RLs available for Portuguese are also referred: C-ORAL-ROM - Integrated Reference Corpora for Spoken Romance Languages, a CD-ROM edition of a spoken corpus with text-to-sound alignment; the LE-PAROLE corpus; the LE-PAROLE Lexicon and the SIMPLE Lexicon.  1 Institutions that have been giving finantial support to the CRPC: Fundação Calouste Gulbenkian, Junta Nacional de Investigação Científica e Tecnológica (JNICT) - Programme Estímulo em Ciências Sociais e Humanas, Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT) - Fundos Programáticos, Instituto Camões, União Latina, Caixa Geral de Depósitos, Comissão das Comunidades Europeias - LE-PAROLE Project.

The objective was to achieve a large annotation, with the basic morphosyntactic categories, and to reduce ambiguities in order to arrive at the minimum possible error rate, when using the automatic tagger (http://www.clul.ul.pt/sectores/manual_anotacao.pdf).

The materials - published in four CD-ROM's (sponsored by Instituto Camões) with text-to-sound alignement - contribute to the observation and analysis of spoken Portuguese in its geographical varieties. This corpus consists of informal conversations between acquaintances, friends or relatives as well as 1826 formal acts as, for instance, radio programs or conferences. In a total of 86 recordings, the texts exemplify the Portuguese spoken in Portugal (30), in Brazil (20), in the African countries with Portuguese as its official language: Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique and Sao Tome and Principe (5 each), in Macao (5), in Goa (3) and in East-Timor (3), corresponding to 8h44m of recordings and to 91.966 tokens (Figure 1). The recordings cover a period that goes from 1970 to 2001, and approximately 70% of them fall upon the last decade. Finally, 94 speakers appear in the recordings; their characterizations (origin, sex, age, professional status, level of education) are visible on the header of each transcription, together with information about the place, date and situation in which the recording was made and other relevant type of information. The orthographic transcriptions and the alignment between sound and the corresponding graphical representation were performed from the recordings. The materials are presented in a way that favors the use of self-learning processes. Aiming at the user to be able to hear the recording and to read simultaneously the respective transcription in the computer screen, a coloured light runs over the transcription of the sequence which is being listened. The user can control what he is listening, can repeat sequences or jump parts of the text (Gonçalves & Veloso, 2000). The 4 CD_ROM's are available at CLUL (fbacelar.nascimento@clul.ul.pt) or at the Instituto Camões (ded@instituto-camoes.pt). It is still worth mentioning that, since this corpus was not collected having in mind a specific user profile, it will be useful not only for students and teachers but also for researchers, translators and interpreters, among others, which will be able to select and analyze the materials according to their own particular aims.

Considering that spoken language is not adequately represented in the currently existent LRs, specially when compared with the written language, the C-ORAL-ROM project intends to increase the LRs in that area, by establishing, building and making available a comparable corpus of spoken language of four romance languages, Spanish, Portuguese, French and Italian (with 300.000 words each language, covering both formal and informal speech). This multilingual corpus will soon be available in a multimedia edition on DVD, with text-to-sound alignment and prosodic segmentation, with standard tools for concordances extraction and acoustic signal analysis. Simultaneously, a book will be published with studies on specific phenomena of these spoken corpora. Besides the quantitative and qualitative analysis and the several linguistic research studies that the publication of these materials provide for, it is worth mentioning its usefulness in the creation of a representative multilingual resource designed for validation of HLT (Human Language Technologies)."]},{"title":"LE-PAROLE CORPUS and LEXICON","paragraphs":["(Programme Telematics Applications of Common Interest) • The LE-PAROLE corpus is a 3 million word corpus, with the following constitution: newspapers (65%), books (20%), magazines (5%) and miscellaneous (10%).
