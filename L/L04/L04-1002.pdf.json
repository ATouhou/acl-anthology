Especially in the area of language resources and language technology evaluation, much of the existing infrastructure can be attributed to dedicated funding efforts. On this panel representatives of national and international funding agencies will report on their programs and outline their strategic priorities as well as concrete plans for the years to come. Additional topics will be opportunities for international collaboration and the envisaged division of labour between publicly financed and industrial research.       III"]}]}
