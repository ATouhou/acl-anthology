The analyzer uses off-line components for generating sub-regular and irregular word forms based on the verb inflector described in Trommer (1997) and simple morphological rules for main inflectional patterns. Part of the analyzer are a complete tagset for Albanian and full form lexica for pronouns and irregular open-class elements."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["Due to the political situation, there has been few re-search on Albanian in contemporary linguistic frameworks and virtually no work in corpus linguistics. In this paper, we present a morphological analyzer which is intended as a main component of a complete part-of-speech tagger to become part of an large annotated text corpus for standard Albanian. Under a theoretical point of view, tagging Albanian is especially challenging since it has extremely rich inflectional paradigms. Thus, a verb might have up to 100 different forms. A further complication are different inflectional patterns for lexemes of the same syntactic category: Verbs fall in 53 different conjugational classes (Buchholz et al., 1992), while assignment of plural affixes to noun stems does not follow from any known principle.","We assume that a morphological analyzer assigns to all word tokens in a text a set of morphological tags which encode the morphological features of specific word forms such as part of speech, case tense, etc. In a full-fletched part-of-speech tagger, this is supposed to be complemented by a morphological disambiguator which chooses from each such tagset a unique tag for each token given its context.","Here is an overview of the rest of the paper: In section 2., we give a short survey of Albanian inflection. Section 3. describes the tagset we use in our system. The morphological analyzer is explained in section 4. and the architecture of the lexicon in section 5.. Section 6. contains some remarks on the implementation, and in section 7., we present preliminary results on the accuracy of the analyzer."]},{"title":"2. Albanian Inflection","paragraphs":["We discuss here only the inflection of open-class elements which are implemented by rules in our system. Pronominal elements show also interesting inflectional patterns, but these are captured by listing in a full-form lexicon. 2.1. Adjectives","Apart from few irregular lexemes, adjectives fall into five different inflectional classes which use the affixes -e (feminine gender), -a (feminine plural), -ë (masculine plural) or zero marking in different partially overlapping distributions. As shown in Trommer (2001), this complex allomorphy can be derived by rules from the phonological shape and morphological constituency of adjectival stems. 2.2. Nouns","Nouns are inflected for number (singular, plural), case (nominative, dative, accusative, ablative)1","and definiteness such as in shtëpi-a-ve-t, houses-PL-ABL-DEF, ‘from the houses’. While definitenessand case marking is quite regular, i.e. predictable on the basis of phonology, stem gender and number, the choice of the plural suffix(-ë, -Ø, -e, or -a) is largely unpredictable. 2.3. Verbs","Verbs are the most complex area of Albanian inflection. Apart from three different tenses (present tense, aorist, imperfect)2","and two different voices (active and non-active), there are five different moods (indicative, subjunctive, optative, imperative and admirative). Allomorphy in verbal inflection is partly phonologically governed. Thus verbs ending in vowels form the 1st person aorist with -va (e.g. puno-va, ‘I worked’) while stems ending in consonants take -a (e.g. hap-a, ‘I opened’). More complex is the division of verbs in different inflectional classes which results partly in different allomorphs of affixes (e.g. for 1sg -j in mëso-j, ‘I learn’ and -m in the-m, ‘I say’), partly in modificationof the finalvowels and/or consonants of the verb stems (e.g. vret, ‘he kills’ vs. vris-ni, ‘you (pl.) kill’). A detailed analysis of Albanian verb inflection can be found in Trommer (1997)"]},{"title":"3. The Tagset","paragraphs":["Since to our knowledge there is no published tagset for Albanian, we had to develop a complete tagset for the lan-1","Traditional Albanian grammars also assume a genitive case which however falls together in all forms with the dative. 2","In addition to these synthetic tenses, there are two analytic tenses: future (formed with the present subjunctive and the particle do and the perfect formed with the participle form and finite forms of the auxiliaries kam, ‘have’, and jam, ‘be’. 1271 guage.3","As in the EAGLE guidelines standard (Leech and Wilson, 1999), tags consist of sets of attribute-value pairs. However, attributes and values are designed to fitoptimally the description of Albanian and to allow a perspicuous abbreviatory notation (see below). (1a) shows a representative tag for a feminine definite(i.e., bearing an article suffix)singular common noun. To enhance legibility, we use for most practical purposes the abbreviatory notation exemplified in (1b), where all binary-valued attribute-value pairs are written by prefixing“+” or “-” to the attribute (e.g. “+def ” instead of “def:+”) and attributes are omitted for all other pairs (e.g. “n” instead of “cat:n”). This is possible since each (non-binary) value in our tag set corresponds to a single attribute. (1) Short Notation for Tags a. [ cat:n case:nom num:sg def:+ gen:fem] b. [ n nom sg +def fem] In addition to standard part-of-speech categories, we use “pa” for preposed articles, grammatical morphemes unique to Albanian occurring with most adjectives and possessor phrases and “ptl” for a specificclass of verb-adjacent particles (e.g. future do). The implementation uses intermediate representations to collapse different tags for syncretic forms of the same lexeme. Thus, the indefinite nominative and singular of all nouns is identical to the corresponding accusative form. In-stead of writing the two tags (2a,b) we use the tag (2c): (2) Collapsed Tags a. [ n nom sg -def fem] b. [ n acc sg -def fem] c. [ n fnom,accg sg -def fem]"]},{"title":"4. The Analyzer","paragraphs":["The morphological analyzer consists of three components, an operative lexicon stored in a database, a set of morphological rules and a rule interpreter (figure4.). The operative lexicon itself is partially precompiled by rules, but this happens off-line (see section 5. for discussion). Here, we will focus on the format of morphological rules and their application. 4.1. Morphological Rules","Following a long tradition in descriptive grammar and generative rule-based approaches to morphology (e.g. Anderson, 1992), the morphological rules we use denote relations between input (lexicon) and output (derived) forms, where forms are ordered pairs of strings (e.g. “punoj’) and tags (e.g. “[v]”). (3) shows as an example the lexeme punoj, ‘work’ and its 2nd/3rd person singular form punon: (3) Input-Output Pair Input: <punoj, [v] > Output: <punon, [v f2 3g sg ind pres] > 3 See http://sol.cl-ki.uni-osnabrueck.de/ãtag/for a complete","list of the tagset. Rules are quintuples of the form <lef t context, remove, add; lexicon category; tag >, where lef t context and remove are regular expressions and all other components strings. lexicon category specifiesthe category tag of the entry in the operative lexicon and tag the resulting tag. add is the suffix which is added to the stem after removing an expression corresponding to (stem-final)remove to get the word form. The rule can only be applied if the suffix of the input stem corresponding to remove is preceded by a string matched by lef t context.","Figure 3 contains a slightly simplified example of a morphological rule. This rule deletes a final j (remove) from an item which has the lexicon category ”[v]” if j is preceded by a vowel (lef t context), and adds n instead which gets the tag ”[v 2 3 sg ind pres]”. Figure 4 shows how the rule applies to the example pair from (3).","The morphological rules we use do not differentiate between phonology and morphology. Thus the fact that the 1st person singular aorist suffixfor verb stems ending in a consonant is -a (e.g. hap-a ‘I opened’, while it is -va after vowels (e.g pi-va, ‘I drank’ is not captured by a separate phonological rule, but simply by two different morphological rules: (4) Morphological Rules for 1sg aorist a. [:vok:] 0 va [v] [v 1 sg aor] b. [:kons:] 0 a [v] [v 1 sg aor] In approaches to morphological analysis such as two-level morphology (see Karttunen and Beesley, 2001 and references cited there) which separate phonology and morphology, an alternative to assuming two different affixal items for 1sg aorist would be to assume just one (say -va) and derive the other form by a phonological rule (here: delete v after a consonant). We think that these approaches are wellmotivated in languages with rich sandhi phenomena such as Finnish, but lead to unnecessary complexity in a language like Albanian which shows – at least at the orthographic level – few such processes. 4.2. The Rule Interpreter","Recall that morphological rules, although we have discussed them as devices to derive word forms, are declarative statements on relations between lexicon entries and word forms. In fact, our rule interpreter uses these rules to infer possible lexical entries for a given word form. It transforms the lef t context and add parts of each rule into one regular expression. For each word form which matches this expression for a rule R with suffixes S, it combines the remaining prefixes P of the word form with the remove parts compatible by R with S to get a set of potential lexicon forms which are then checked against the lexicon data base. Since there is usually at most one analysis a rule assigns to a word form and few rules matching a given suffix of a word form, search space is small."]},{"title":"5. Lexicon Construction","paragraphs":["Morphological analysis in our system is especially simple since each corresponding pair of lexical entries and word forms is related by exactly one rule. In other words, 1272 Input Tokens","InterpreterMorphological Rules Operative Lexicon Output Tags Figure 1: Structure of the morphological analyzer [:vok:] j n [v] [v f2 3g sg ind pres]","j j j j j","(lef t context) (remove) (add) (lexicon category) (tag) Figure 2: Example for a morphological rule there is no iterative rule application. This is possible since the operative lexicon which serves as the basis for rule application is itself constructed by rules from different source lexica to derive e.g. singular and plural stems for nouns.","There are three source lexica for the operative lexicon: 1) the full-form lexicon 2) the stem lexicon and 3) the regular lexicon. The regular lexicon contains stems formed by redundancy rules from the base lexicon (see subsection 5.2.), the stem lexicon irregular stems which however form the basis of additional morphological rules (e.g. for the irregular noun plural duar, ‘hands’ to which still case and definitenessaffixes can be attached) and the full-form lexicon complete word forms with tags which are accessed by a default morphological rule also responsible for treating uninflected lexicon entries.","Since entries for a given lexeme are all together in one of these lexica, there is a simple algorithm to construct the operating lexicon from the three source lexica (5). A A0 denotes here the relation of two lexicon entries which refer to the same lexeme. (5) Lexicon Formation Algorithm","for all lexemes l in reg lex: if 9 entries l1 : : : ln l in full form lex:","add l1 : : : ln to operating lex else if 9 entries l1 : : : ln l in stem lex:","add l1 : : : ln to operating lex else:","add l to operating lex 5.1. Exception Lexica","While the exception lexica (i.e., the stem lexicon and the full-form lexicon) are for the most part static lists of stems and full forms, irregular verb forms in the full-form lexicon are created by the generation tool for Albanian verb forms described in Trommer (1997) based on mo lex. 5.2. Redundancy Rules Redundancy Rules apply to the items of the base lexicon which contains a list of all basic stems with part-of-speech tags to derive the full list of regularly formed stems in the regular lexicon on the basis of phonological and morphological properties of the base stems. For example Albanian nouns ending in -im, regularly take the plural affix-e. Thus, a redundancy rule creates for each noun stem in the base lexicon which ends in -im a plural stem with the suffix-e in the regular lexicon. Redundancy rules are directly implemented as Python scripts."]},{"title":"6. Implementation","paragraphs":["The morphological analyzer is implemented under SuSe Linux 8.0. using Python 2.1 and MySQL 11.18. There are currently 340 morphological rules. The operative lexicon contains 53054 entries. The base lexicon for open-class element is mainly based on the Albanian word list from the ECI/MCI multilingual corpus CD4",". There is a web interface to the morphological analyzer under http://sol.cl-ki.uni-osnabrueck.de/ãtag/."]},{"title":"7. Evaluation","paragraphs":["Work on the analyzer is still in progress. The rules by now follow mainly the descriptions in Buchholz and Fiedler (1987) and Buchholz et al. (1992) which give the most detailed description of Albanian morphology. It remains necessary to optimize the analyzer with respect to running text from corpora. To test the accuracy of the analyzer in its current state, we tagged two texts representing different text sorts containing each 500 word tokens (an initial part of a novel (Kadaré, 1990) from the ECI/MCI multilingual corpus CD and part of a news article from Albanews5",") by hand and compared the results to the tags produced by the analyzer.
