Introduction 1.1. Collocations in Computational Lexicography","paragraphs":["In the fieldsof computational lexicography and natural-language processing, a large amount of work has been done, over the past decade, on the development of computational tools for the identificationof collocations. Such tools are usually based on a statistical analysis of cooccurrence data from text corpora, as described in (Manning and Schütze, 1999, Ch. 5) and (Evert and Krenn, 2003).","Especially for a language with a richer inflectional morphology than English, lemmatised cooccurrence data are not sufficientas a basis for the description of collocations in a dictionary, whether it is intended for human users or for computational tools. Instead, morphosyntactic preferences need to be taken into account. A simple English example is the adjective+noun combination open book, which appears only as a singular in the British National Corpus in its collocational sense.1","In German, the collocation sich Hoffnung machen “to have hopes” is much more often found with a plural noun form (sich Hoffnungen machen) than with a singular. In addition, the noun does not take an article here, while other collocations prefer a definiteor indefinitearticle and singular number (e.g. die Hoffnung tr ügt “there is false hope”, ein Ende finden“come to an end”). Similarly, there are case preferences (e.g. guter Hoffnung sein “be pregnant”, where the noun always has genitive case). Such morphosyntactic preferences often go hand in hand with semantic differences in the collocational base and with the degree of idiomaticity. Many lexicographers would see two different readings of the noun Grenze in seine (eigenen) Grenzen kennen “kno w one’s (own) limits” and die untere/obere Grenze “the lower/upper bound”. Very rigid combinations are often idiomatic (guter Hoffnung sein “be pregnant”) or are best classifiedas multi-word lexemes (einige Zeit “some time” as a multi-word adverb)","More sophisticated tools in computational lexicography should thus provide information about the distribution of collocations with respect to morphosyntactic features such as number, case, and definiteness(and possibly other properties as well). The present paper describes procedures to identify such morphosyntactic preferences, using frequency data from text corpora. In this case study, we look at the features number (Sg, Pl) and case (Nom, Gen, Dat, 1 There are three instances of open books, all of which are are","compositional. Acc) for German adjective+noun combinations. The methods and tools can equally well be applied to other features and other types of collocations, though. 1.2. Approaches to morpho-syntactic preferences","English collocations sometimes show a preference for singular or plural number (as in the open book example). To take such phenomena into account, some tools simply obtain frequency counts for word forms rather than lemmatised data. In the British National Corpus, open book shows a preference for singular (25 open book, 3 open books), while red rose does not (60 red rose, 75 red roses). For a language with a more morphological variation, this approach leads to two problems: (i) Unless the morphosyntactic distribution of a collocation is highly restricted, its “frequenc y mass” will be spread over several different combinations of word forms. For instance, we find5 offenes Buch, 1 offene Buch, 3 offenen Buch, and 1 offenen Buchs in the Frankfurter Rundschau corpus,2","even though all instances of this collocation are in singular. The smaller cooccurrence frequencies (compared to 10 the lemmatised combination offen + Buch) may no longer provide significantevidence for a statistical association, so that the word form combinations are not indentifiedas collocation candidates. (ii) There is no one-to-one mapping between surface forms and (the values of) morphosyntactic features (! syncretism). For instance, the noun form Rose provides no evidence at all about the case feature. (Evert, 2004) reports that only 10.2% of the noun forms (types) found in the Negra treebank corpus (Skut et al., 1998) uniquely identify case (and Acc is never unique), while 57.80% of the types provide no case information at all.","For these reasons, we conclude that both the statistical association and the morphosyntactic preferences of word combinations need to be analysed at the level of lemmas rather than word forms, and the two analyses are independent from each other.3","By separating the lexical and the morphosyntactic distribution, we can also draw on additional sources of knowledge, such as agreement (of case, 2","The Frankfurter Rundschau corpus is a German newspaper corpus of ca. 40 million words. It is part of the ECI Multilingual Corpus 1 distributed by ELSNET. 3","This does not imply that morphosyntactic rigidity is not useful as an indicator of collocativity. A collocation extraction tool can draw on results from both analyses to make its suggestions. 907 gender, and number) within noun phrases, to reduce the amount of ambiguity in the morphosyntactic analyses. For instance, the noun phrase der roten Rosen is uniquely identifiedas a genitive plural, which cannot be seen by looking only at the noun and the adjective. Table 1 shows ambiguity patterns of the case feature for German noun phrases in the Negra corpus. More than 20% of all occurrences of common nouns can now unambiguously be classified,and almost 60% of the remainder provide at least partial information (Evert, 2004). tokens prop.

Implementation 2.1. Data extraction","paragraphs":["The adjective+noun pairs for our case study were extracted from German newspaper corpora comprising a total of approx. 300 million words. The corpora are to-kenised, part-of-speech tagged, lemmatised and chunkparsed. For tokenisation and PoS-tagging we used the Tree-Tagger (Schmid, 1994). For the partial syntactic analysis, we used YAC (Kermes, 2003), a fully automatic recursive chunker for unrestricted German text. YAC is based on a symbolic regular expression grammar written in the CQP query language which is part of the IMS Corpus Workbench.4","The German grammar additionally requires morphosyntactic information at the token level, which is annotated using the IMSLex morphology (Lezius et al., 2000). The chunker annotates noun phrases (NP), adverbial, adjectival, and prepositional phrases (PP), as well as verbal complexes. In addition, the chunks also carry partially disambiguated morphosyntactic information.","We extracted cooccurrences of prenominal adjectives and nouns using the annotated chunk boundaries and partially disambiguated morphosyntactic information at the chunk level. In this case study, we looked at the nouns Tag, Zeit, Schritt, and Kraft. As a heuristic filtering rule, we excluded NPs that are part of a PP, since a number of adjective+noun pairs occur primarily in adverbial PPs (e.g. mit letzter Kraft “with ultimate force”). 4 For more information, see http://www.ims.","uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/CorpusWorkbench/.","For each pair of lexemes we extracted the total cooccurrence frequency as well as unique positive and negative evidence (Evert, 2004) for each value of the features number (Sg, Pl) and case (Nom, Gen, Dat, Acc). 2.2. Statistical analysis","Our goal in this section is to develop a quantitative measure of morphosyntactic preference that is statistically sound, takes the available amount of corpus evidence into account, and has a meaningful interpretation when it is presented to lexicographers. For the binary feature number, which assumes only two different values (Sg and Pl), the procedure is fairly straightforward. Ignoring the issue of ambiguity for the moment, a useful criterion is provided by the proportion of singular (or plural) instances of a given word combination. For example, there are f = 11 instances of wunderschöner Tag “beautiful day” in our data, fSg = 9 of which are in the singular. The corresponding proportion of 81.8% seems to indicate a strong preference for singular number, but it may just as well be a coincidence (considering the low overall frequency of the combination). Therefore, we apply a statistical hypothesis test in order to obtain an estimate for the average proportion of singular occurrences in the language (or sub-language) from which our source corpus is taken. Under the standard random sample assumption, the appropriate estimate is a binomial confidence interval (Lehmann, 1986, 89ff), which can easily be computed with a software package for statistical analysis such as R (R Development Core Team, 2003). In the example above, the R command binom.test(9,11) (9 Sg out of 11 instances) yields a range of 48.2% – 97.7% for the true average proportion of singulars (at a confidencelevel of 95%). The lower bound of this interval represents a conservative estimate, which is shown as “prop. of Sg” in the presentation of the results (cf. Table 2). Hence, we cannot even be sure that, on average, there are more singular than plural occurrences of wundersch öner Tag.","When some of the occurrences are ambiguous with respect to number,5","f","Sg is definedas the number of instances that are uniquely identifiedas Sg and is thus a lower bound for the true number of singulars in our corpus.6","Since we are interested in a conservative estimate, we can still use the binomial confidenceinterval (for fSg out of f instances) to obtain a lower bound on the true average proportion of singulars. As a concrete example, the combination sonniger Tag “sunn y day” occurs f = 38 times in our corpus. Out of these, fSg = 22 are uniquely identifiedas Sg, fPl = 13 are uniquely identified as Pl, and the remaining f fSg fPl = 3 instances are ambiguous. The (unknown)","5","Ambiguity is to be understood here with respect to the information provided by our extraction tools, of course. A human reader will usually be able to classify the ambiguous instances as Sg or Pl, using additional syntactic, semantic, or pragmatic cues from their context.","6","As (Schönenberger and Evert, 2002) and (Evert, 2004) argue, we cannot simply discard ambiguous data and base our estimate on the proportion of singulars among the unambiguous instances. Therefore, we still have to compare fSg against the total frequency f (including the ambiguous instances) rather than against fSg + fPl (where fPl is the number of unambiguous plurals). 908 true number of singulars in the corpus must be somewhere between 22 and 25, and the estimated range for the average proportion of singulars is 40.8% – 80.4% (at the 95% confidencelevel). The lower bound of this range, which is our conservative estimate, is calculated from fSg and f , so it does not depend on the number of ambiguous instances.","We can use the same procedure for the case feature, applying it independently to each of the possible values. Thus, comparing the number fNom of unambiguous nominatives with the total frequency f of a given word combination, we obtain an indicator of its preference for nominative case; from fGen we obtain an indicator of its preference for genitive case; etc. It is also possible to extend these conservative estimates to full ranges for the true average proportion (as in the second example above) by making use of unambiguous negative evidence (see (Evert, 2004) for details).","Unfortunately, this simple approach only makes use of some 20% of the corpus data that provide unambiguous evidence for a unqiue case value (cf. Table 1). Systematic ambiguities between two values (NomjAcc, GenjDat, and DatjAcc) account for another 40% of the data, from which we can obtain at least partial information about morphosyntactic preferences. To this end, we defineambiguity classes as sets of feature values, e.g. A = NomjAcc. The corresponding frequency fA includes all instances that are either uniquely identifiedas Nom or Acc, or ambiguous between the two (but all other case values can be excluded). The conservative estimate calculated from fA and f is a lower boundary for the average proportion of occurrences with nominative or accusative case.","In our case study, the extracted word combinations were sorted according to the estimated proportion and then manually inspected. This was done separately for each feature value (Sg and Pl for number; Nom, Gen, Dat, Acc for case) and each ambiguity class (NomjAcc, GenjDat, and NomjDatjAcc). Some results of this case study are presented in the following section."]},{"title":"3. Results and applications","paragraphs":["Tables 2 and 3 contain examples for number preferences of adjective+noun combinations. For each adjective+noun pair, the total corpus frequency is shown together with the number of unambiguous singulars and plurals. A conservative estimate for the average proportion of singulars or plurals, obtained according to the procedure described in Section 2.2., is shown in the fifth column (labelled “prop. of x”), followed by an English translation. The mode of presentation is similar to that used in the case study for manual inspection.","The data for number preferences often point to collocations that show a tendency towards idiomatisation. The following combinations are examples: (eine) reife Leistung “good work” 85.41% Sg (die) treibende Kraft “dri ving force” 85.23% Sg (ein) gangbarer Weg “practicable plan” 85.12% Sg","Similar cases can be observed with combinations that prefer a specificcase, in particular genitive: gemessenen Schritts “measured” 83.53% Gen strammen Schritts “briskly” 65.18% Gen","Not only do certain nouns have specific collocations along with their different senses, but these collocations in turn have morphosyntactic preferences. The reading of Schritt in the juridic sense (rechtliche Schritte “measures”, cf. Table 3) is only available with collocations in the plural. Similarly, Hilfe has a reading that prefers singular, as in ärztliche Hilfe “medical assistance”, medizinische Hilfe (97.76% and 96.47% Sg, respectively).","In certain cases, the readings tend towards specialised or terminological use: finanzielle Leistungen (“benefits”, 89.43% Pl) and vermögenswirksame Leistungen (“capitalforming payment”, 95.28% Pl) are cases in point. The term installierte Leistung (“po wer output of a (number of) power station(s)”, 91.80% Sg) illustrates the same phenomenon.","As the data produced by our tools are relevant for lexicography (regarding both paper and NLP dictionaries), we envisage the use of a lexicographic viewing tool for manual selection of lexicographically relevant candidates (Heid et al., 2004). Furthermore, as collocations with strong morphosyntactic preferences tend towards idiomatisation, the tools could also serve as an element of an idiom finderfor corpus technology."]},{"title":"4. Further developments","paragraphs":["The procedures described in this paper were used to identify adjective+noun combinations with morphosyntactic preferences in a case study, regardless of their collocational status. They can now be combined with standard methods for the identification of collocations (Evert and Krenn, 2003) in one of two ways: (i) Collocation candidates could be identified in a separate first step, based on lemmatised cooccurrence data. Within the set of candidates produced by such a tool, those which seem to have morphosyntactic preferences could be marked. (ii) Alternatively, morphosyntactic preferences could be identified firstand used as an additional criterion for the identification of collocations (e.g. by increasing the association scores of morphosyntactically restricted candidates).","In either case, it is necessary to translate the proportion estimate introduced as a quantitative measure in Section 2.2., which was used in our case study to sort the result tables, into a categorical annotation. A possible classifica-tion uses the categories strong, weak, or no association and is applied to each feature and each value (or ambiguity set) individually.","Currently, the procedures have only been applied to number and case preferences. In a similar way, other morphosyntactic features can be accounted for, in particular the definitenessof noun phrases. Preferences for the definite or the indefinite article often go hand in hand with number preferences: treibend + Kraft typically occurs in the singular with the definitearticle (die treibende Kraft, “the driving force”). Similarly der rechte/richtige/falsche Weg “the right/wrong way”, but ein gangbarer Weg “a possible way”. The extraction of such data is relatively easy on the basis of chunked-parsed text corpora as described in Section 2.1.. In a next version of our tools, we will explore the multi-parametric approach suggested by (Spranger, 2004) for this purpose. 909 adjective + noun frequency #Sg #Pl prop. of Sg translation kurz + Zeit 2050 2042 8 99.29% a short time geraum + Zeit 278 278 0 98.92% considerable time kostbar + Zeit 48 48 0 93.94% precious time heutig + Zeit 89 87 2 93.09% (in) our day unbegrenzt + Zeit 7 7 0 65.18% unlimited time . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . neu + Tag 64 64 0 95.42% new day historisch + Tag 98 95 3 92.27% historic day schwarz + Tag 134 120 13 84.14% black day schön + Tag 215 153 60 65.64% beautiful day . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
