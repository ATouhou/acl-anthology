The state of the art on written corpora don’t provide us with a satisfactory level of analysis regarding spontaneous spoken language (Uchimoto et al., 2002; Moreno & Guirao, 2003). The spontaneous speech corpus Italian C-ORAL-ROM has been tagged with Part of Speech (Pos) and morpho-syntactic information, using and adapting an already existing tool trained on Italian written resources (PiTagger, developed by Eugenio Picchi, ILC-CNR Pisa). The incidence of spoken domain on the performance is within a 10% of errors detected in the manual evaluation procedure. Some issues concerning spoken language emerged. The definition of significant contexts for PoS statistics is to be provided by utterance boundaries; moreover, the relevance of a series of phenomena related to the prosodic parsing has been highlighted: fragmentation phenomena, a relative lack of information for all word adjacent to utterance boundaries; under-specification of PoS for words in connection to secondary prosodic breaks and one word utterances.

Corpus and Tool","paragraphs":["C-ORAL-ROM (IST 2000-26228) is a multilingual corpus of spontaneous speech for the main romance languages, French, Italian, Portoguese and Spanish (300,000 words for each language; see Cresti et al., 2002; Cresti & Moneglia, forthcoming).","The Italian resource has been tagged using PiSystem, an integrated procedure for textual and lexical analysis, which consists in: (i) DBT text encoding and analysis modules; (ii) a morpho-syntactic analyzer (PiMorpho); (iii) a Part of Speech tagger and lemmatizer (PiTagger).","To achieve automatic analysis and tagging, the PiMorpho and PiTagger components use a set of resources built on coherent bases:","- an electonic dictionary1","","- a training corpus of 50,000 words of written language, manually tagged;","- the BDR, a database extracted from the training corpus.","The disambiguation of word-forms is processed by statistic measurements (on trigrams) extracted from the training corpus; the main program extimates the maximum likelihood pattern among the possible alternatives given by the morphological component, with a transitional probabilistic method (Picchi, 1994).","The tag-set used by these tools and resources is, for the greater part, in agreement with the EAGLES recommendations for morpho-syntactic annotation of Italian language (Monachini, 1996)."]},{"title":"2.

NS tag set ","Although these forms are not widely present in the corpus, their treatment is important when the quality level of the tagging results is taken into consideration. The main feature which marks the distinction between these forms is the syntactic value of these elements within the linguistic structures: while foreign and new forms are compositional elements (which follows the syntactic criterion), onomatopoeia and language acquisition forms are non-compositional. The following examples show the different behavior of compositional and non-compositional non-standard elements in speech contexts. The foreign word in the example (a) and the new formation in the example (b) produce complex Noun Phrases (bracketed in the text) and preserve the agreement features. On the contrary, the onomatopoeic element in example (c) is not compositional; i.e. it lacks both syntactic and argumental relationships with respect to the other linguistic elements of the utterance:"," (a) le raccomandazioni del gruppo per la prevenzione / [gruppo spread\\AZ] / [recommendations for the prevention group / spread group /]  (b) con [quelli babbussi\\SZ brutti] che arrivavono ...

Non-compositional elements (which include interjections as standard elements) are always isolated by primary or secondary prosodic boundaries and are frequently the only element of the utterance."]},{"title":"2.2.

Definition of the relevant context","paragraphs":["Lemmatization and PoS tagging need a detailed and coherent definition of the relevant context within which the statistics on disambiguation have to operate. Therefore resources must include annotations regarding context boundaries. As for written language, this is defined by period boundaries, which are given by punctuation signs; on the contrary, the minimal relevant unit for spoken language is defined by the utterance, which must be detected and identified within the speech flow. Although the utterance boundaries have been defined, in previous experiences (Uchimoto et alii, 2002), by the automatic detection of pauses (longer than 200 ms), in the C-ORAL-ROM corpora such boundaries are provided by the marking of terminal prosodic breaks (“ //” , “ ?” , “ ... ” ), manually detected in the whole resource by expert operators. PiTagger is sensible to these boundaries.","In the following examples, two possible transcripts of the same dialogic turn are presented: the first one without prosodic boundaries (followed by a second row bearing the possible PoS tags related to ambiguoous word), the second one according to the Italian C-ORAL-ROM corpus (words in italic are ambiguous )."," sì dice che taglia porta io lì per lì un' elle penso Conj/Rel Noun/V Noun/V  sì // dice / che taglia porta ? io / lì per lì / un' elle / penso // [yes // he says / which size do you take? There and then / I (say) / an L / I think]","","The PoS of ambiguous elements can be decided only in connection with the context boundaries (represented by utterance boundaries). If the disambiguation process worked on the simple nude transcripts, it would also operate on a non-coherent word pattern.","Without prosodic boundaries, the disambiguation of the PoS tags belonging to the words in the dialogic turns would be arbitrary. The presence of significant boundaries annotation is therefore necessary to give the automatic lemmatizer the information on the relevant linguistic units."]},{"title":"4.2. Disambiguation and prosodic boundaries ","paragraphs":["A second level of evaluation provides us with an estimate of the incidence of these phenomena on the number of errors. As a result, it becomes possible to identify the contexts in which the system encounters problems and to select which of them are caused by specific features of spoken language.","In detail, in spontaneous speech, the automatic PoS tagging procedure is made complex at three levels, in connection with: (a) words adjacent to utterance boundaries; (b) fragmentation phenomena (retracting, interruptions); (c) secondary prosodic boundaries."," 4.2.1. Words adjacent to utterance boundaries","a. One word utterances","On the set of total errors in PoS tag (296), 26% are one word utterances where an ambiguous word occurs. In this case, which is typical of spontaneous speech, the algorithms of the disambiguation system, that are based on PoS order statistics, are radically under-determined.","The following is an example of one word utterance. The automatic PoS tagging cannot find contextual evidence to provide a disambiguation."," (d) esatto\\Adj?Adv? //6"," [exactly] ","b. Words in peripheral position","Apart from the words that constitute an utterance, from the collected data it can be observed that around 22% of the tagged tokens with a PoS error occur in the first position of the utterance, and that roughly 13% occur in the last position. The following examples show two real error evaluated in the :"," (e) che\\Conj* devo dire / sono nelle mani del mio compagno // [what can I say, I’m in my partner’s hands]  (f) e vai sempre diritto\\Noun* //","[and keep going straight on]","","These data, summed to single word utterances, tell us that in 61% of cases the errors in PoS tagging occur with a peripheral position of the ambiguous words.","Indeed in such position, immediately before and immediately after the end of an utterance, the system is faced with little contextual information. Given the low average utterance length which characterizes spontaneous speech, the percentage of such contexts appears to be quite relevant (roughly 30% of words). To improve the results, the tagging system should be able to take into account the main prosodic breaks as relevant positions for the disambiguation procedure, and to be trained on a training corpus comprising such information.."," 4.2.2. Fragmentation phenomena","On the total number of utterances within which the selected word was wrongly tagged (296), interruptions and retracting appear in around 10% of cases.","","a. Interruptions","Interruptions constitute a peculiar trait of spoken language. An interruption involves the ending of the utterance, and it may create both an anomalous syntactic configuration (which is impossible to find in the written language) and a lack of information necessary to make a decision for disambiguation:"," (g) eh / e beh / lui pensa che\\? + Conj/Rel?","[hm/well/he thinks that] ","The lemmatizers do not have either rules or statistics about these kinds of endings which, by definition, are not regular. As disambiguation techniques cannot be applied, in the Italian C-ORAL-ROM annotated output, these contexts do not receive any particular treatment: the choice made was merely that of the automatic tagger."," 6 In the reported examples, an interrogative point (?) after the Pos tag means that there is a doubt on categorization, while an asterisk (*) marks an error in categorizing done by the tagger. 565","b. Retracting","The retracting phenomenon is often considered under the generic label of the “ disfluency phenomena” which occurs in the speech flow. Retracting phenomena are relevant with respect to the morphosyntactic disambiguation process, because they produce an irregular PoS sequence. Taking the utterance as the relevant context in which to apply the disambiguation rules, the retracting phenomenon (marked with “ [/]” in the transcripts) gives us unpredictable linear patterns, as:"," (h) che volevano l'\\Art [/] l'\\Personal* [/] l'\\Art esclusività / più che tutto / ecco //","[well, that they wanted (the) exclusivity above all]","","In this utterance an ungrammatical pattern made up of a linear sequence of 3 articles is produced. The tagger made an error in tagging the second token, labeling it as a personal pronoun. For a statistic-based lemmatizer, this irregular sequence upsets the n-grams that are the objects of the application of statistics we assumed for disambiguation. For a rule-based lemmatizer, the presence of such an ungrammatical pattern makes the text impossible to analyze by grammatical rules.","In any case, as the retracting patterns are non grammatical ones, the lemmatization and tagging procedure would not treat them within the statistical patterns to disambiguate. The information on retracting, since its idiosyncratic occurrence within the speech flow, would not constitute a relevant information for statistics. In principle the expression(s) which are the object of retracting are redundant from the point of view of a correct PoS chain."," 4.2.3. Secondary prosodic boundaries.","The data collected in the evaluation phase of the automatic tagging show that 13,2% of the errors are represented by words in a single tone unit (i.e. isolated by secondary prosodic breaks), mostly standard words with uncertain classification. Indeed, in connection to secondary prosodic boundaries, the statistics extracted from the written training corpus may be hardly recognized and properly applied. In such positions a word-form may have a value that doesn’t match with its typical PoS, even if it is not ambiguous. E.g. (contexts in which the tagger has made errors):","","a) Standard forms with LEMMA and PoS assignment problems (fix verb-forms used as Discourse Markers, isolated in the speech flow within non-terminal prosodic breaks):"," (i) scusa\\Noun* / cinquantatré / costì è +","[excuse me\\ fifty-three\\ there\\ is]  (l) ascolta\\Noun* / ci si sente dopo //","[listen\\I’ll call you\\ later]","","b) Standard forms with PoS assignment problems (mostly conjunctions and adverbs that appear both in the first and in the last position of utterances, with special functional values)"," (m) dopo_di_che / appunto\\Noun* +","[after that\\exactly]  (n) di ricaricare le pile / ecco\\Interj* //","[well\\to recharge the batteries]","","A tagging system that is able to assume the information about both the primary and the secondary prosodic boundaries as contextual inputs is needed to achieve an adequate treatment of these forms in the relevant contexts specified by prosodic cues. The training of tools on corpora that comprehend such an annotation level will be highly relevant for the improvement of the results on the automatic tagging for spoken corpora, as the PoS tagging experience of the Dutch Corpus shows (see the tag set in Van Eynde, Zavrel & Daelemans, 2000).","However, the focus on the context information must be correlated to the detection of the relevant boundaries that play a role in the spoken structures.","Spoken language shows peculiar characters that are necessary to be evaluated and adequately treated. All the phenomena highlighted in the paper point out to a correlation between the information provided by the prosodic breaks and the PoS assignment."]},{"title":"5.
