The pre-conditions and the usable data and additionally available instruments are described. The main goals of this task of CLEF are to allow the evaluation of Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) systems in the context of structured data and in a domain-specific area (not in the more general context of floating, journalistic texts), and with the additional possibility to make use of thesauri which had been used for intellectual indexing of the documents and are provided with the data. The parallel German-English GIRT4 corpus is described and some of the results of the CLEF 2004 campaign are discussed.

The main goals of this task of CLEF are to allow the evaluation of CLIR systems in the context of structured data and in a domain-specific area (not in the more general context of floating, journalistic texts), and with the additional possibility to make use of thesauri which had been used for intellectual indexing of the documents and are provided together with the data. The general purpose of the work on GIRT within CLEF is discussed in Kluck/Gey (2001). The data provided for this task have been GIRT (= German Indexing and Retrieval Testdatabase)2","and Amaryllis3",". The GIRT corpus has been used in several versions for a number of retrieval tests in Germany, in TREC4","and CLEF. The first pre-test with GIRT data has been carried out in 1997 (see Kluck, 1998)5",". Amaryllis has also been part of other tests in France and French speaking countries."]},{"title":"GIRT and Amaryllis Tasks in CLEF 2000-2002","paragraphs":["In 2000, 2001 and 2002 the special task of CLEF on “Domain-Specific Mono- and Cross-Language Information Retrieval” used the GIRT3 corpus consisting of a data collection from a vertical domain (social sciences); this collection contained more than 76,000  1 See www.clef-campaign.org and Peters et al., (2004, 2003, 2002), Peters (2001), Kluck (2002) 2 For an extended overview on the GIRT versions and the tests carried out with these see Kluck (2003, 2004). 3 Now available via ELDA. 4 See Vorhees/Harman (2000). 5 The German-English Thesaurus for the Social Sciences and the German-Russian wordlist are provided by the IZ (German Social Science Information Centre) as machine readable files. These files have been extracted from the following printed thesauri: Schott (1999) and Basarnova et al. (1997) documents in a structured database. This special task offered 25 queries (topics) each year6",", created in German, but also translated into English and Russian. Participating groups could run these topics: 1. either as monolingual task (German topics) against","the 76,000 German documents of this database","(GIRT3); 2. or as multilingual task using the translated topics. In addition a German-English thesaurus and a German-Russian wordlist as well as English translations of the document titles have been available. In 2002, there was an additional distinct tasks with the Amaryllis corpus to test system performance in searching a multi-disciplinary scientific database of approximately 150,000 French bibliographic documents. As additional tool a controlled vocabulary in English and French was provided that could be used in the retrieval task. Topics have been provided in English and French."]},{"title":"GIRT Task in CLEF 2003","paragraphs":["In the CLEF campaign 2003 the GIRT track used a new much larger collection: GIRT4. This collection of German social science data contains 151,319 documents and is available as two pseudo-parallel corpora which contain the same documents:","* in German (GIRT4-DE) and","* in English (GIRT4-EN) Again the topics have been provided in German, English and Russian language. Thus, in the CLEF 2003 campaign it was possible to offer two monolingual tasks: 1. using German topics against German data, 2. using English topics against English data, and two bilingual tasks: 1. using English or Russian topics against German data, 2. using German or Russian topics against English data. The same controlled vocabularies in German-English and German-Russian as in the previous CLEF campaigns were available.   6 On the topic creation process see Kluck/Womser-Hacker (2002) 1343"]},{"title":"Structure of the Parallel GIRT4 Corpora","paragraphs":["As the GIRT4-DE and GIRT4-EN data are in parallel, most information elements are existing in both corpora. But due to the fact that the English corpus is a translation of the original German one, some information elements (data entry fields) are not available to the same extent.

The translation of the German title has been done by human translators. Each document carries a document number which is the information element that identifies them. We have randomly changed the document number in the English part to make it not too easy to identify corresponding documents9",". The documents have in most cases more than one author (on average 1.75). Each document has intellectually been indexed by about 10 key words. The indexing was done in German, the English equivalents have been taken form the German-English thesaurus (Schott 1998). The same has been done with classification texts which occur on average twice per document. About one or two methodological key words have been assigned per document with slight differences between the German and the English part which are caused by the reduced term list in the English part. Free terms and methodological texts are only offered in the German part, and are assigned to  7 The translation of German abstract has partly been done by human translators (HT) and partly by machine translation (MT). The MT was done by SYSTRAN. 8 The databases SOLIS (Social Science Literature Information System) and FORIS (Social Science Research Information System) are produced and provided by the IZ, Bonn. 9 A list of the corresponding document numbers of the German and the English part is available at the IZ, but was not forwarded to the participants of the CLEF campaign. 25% or 7% of the documents. For 96% of all German documents abstracts are provided, whereas only 15% are available for the English part. This is the main reason for the reduced size of the English corpus and why we call this a pseudo-parallel corpus."]},{"title":"Relevance Assessment of the Parallel Corpora","paragraphs":["The documents of the two parallel corpora have differently been numbered, thus, the participating groups could not automatically detect which of the documents have been the same (but only translated from German into English). For measuring the relative performance of the retrieval systems we applied the pooling method developed by the TREC initiative (Vorhees/Harman, 2000) The systems participating in this track delivered the top 60 results for each topic which they suspected to be the most relevant answers to the given query (topic). The results were grouped by topic. These topic related lists of documents were then judged by human assessors. The relevance assessment was done in a binary way: a document was either counted as relevant with respect to the topic in question or not. Then, we have reconstructed the concordance of the numbering in both corpora (and concatenated the identical documents). Thus, we could make an in depth comparison of the results (compare Figure 2). During the CLEF 2004 campaign a total of 17,031 documents from GIRT4-DE and GIRT4-EN was delivered as relevant hits by the participating groups. These formed the pool of documents to be intellectually assessed. As 25 topics have been used in this campaign, on average 681 documents had to be assessed per topic. In the end, out of these suspected relevant hits 3,449 or 20.25% have been judged as really relevant."]},{"title":"Differences in the Number of Result Hits","paragraphs":["A general observation is that the hits of relevant documents in the result sets from the both corpora are not fully identical (which would have been the optimal outcome). There have been 11,137 hits delivered from GIRT4-DE and 5,894 from GIRT4-EN. Within the German result hits 8,993 or 80.75% did not have the corresponding English document. And within the English results 3,756 or 63.7% did not have the corresponding German document. That means only 2.138 document have been included in both sets and therefore had to be judged twice. All in all this overlap in the results of the German and English part is quite low. But there is no evidence of any significant correlation to specific topical queries. And it must be considered that the majority of runs delivered by the participants has been aimed on the German collection. This fact obviously caused a predominance of German results which were not accompanied by respective results in the English part."]},{"title":"Differences in Assessments","paragraphs":["In few cases there was a different judgment done by the assessor for the same document with respect to the same topic in the German and English collection. This occurred in 171 cases or 1% of all judgments. There was no significant correlation to one specific topic, only two topics had not been touched by this problem. On average 7 1344 cases of unequal judgments occurred per topic with the highest value of 17 cases and the lowest of 1 case. The re-assessment of these 171 documents resulted in 57% of the cases in a change from irrelevant to relevant, and in 43% in a change from relevant to irrelevant which is nearly the same amount. Overall the re-assessment indicated 98 documents as relevant. But the changes have a little bit more been related to the English part of the corpus (60%). This observation and the fact that less results have been delivered from the English part (only 34,61% of all results) emphasizes the assumption that the reduced extent of text in the English part made judgments more difficult or vague (because of the lack of extended information which is mainly carried by the abstracts).

The University Amsterdam, which belongs to the leading groups in nearly all monolingual and multilingual tasks of CLEF, used a vector space model with 100-dimensional space (Kamps et al., 2003). Further they used a stemmer for the re-ranking (but without decomposition of complex words), and alternatively a 4-gramm-model. The n-gramm-method (here with n=4) searches character strings   10 ENEA = Ente per le Nuove tecnologie, l’Energia e l’Ambiente, S. Maria di Galeria (Roma); Università degli Studi di Roma La Sapienza which are n characters long and identifies identical character strings11",". By that, this method does not need any knowledge of the respective languages. Additional improvements could be made by using the indexing of the provided documents. The University of California at Berkeley (Petras/ Perelman/Gey 2003), which participate in all TREC and CLEF campaigns since the beginning and always has been belonging to the best performing groups in all tasks, has made use of all GIRT4 sub-tasks. They clearly showed, that the use of thesauri lead to a remarkable improvement of results, although the publicly available machine translation systems (MT) have reached a better quality meanwhile. The best results have been achieved by the combination of two MT systems with the usage of the thesaurus: “Documents that have controlled vocabulary terms added to the usual title and abstract information prove advantageous in retrieval because the thesaurus terms add valuable search terms to the index. An index containing titles, abstracts, and thesaurus terms will always outperform an index only containing title and abstract.”12"," ENEA/University Rome La Sapienza (Alderuccio/ Bordoni/Loreto 2003) have chosen a totally different approach than the usual CLIR systems, namely the data compression, which should them enable, to detect the syntactical and semantic distance of character strings, without having any knowledge of the respective languages and their peculiarities. The Distance University Hagen (Leveling 2003) introduced another approach into the CLIR evaluation in CLEF, which is based on a natural language interface. To analyze the texts of the topics and the documents, multiple lexical and morphological information and resource were used, especially those supporting the disambiguation of meanings of single character strings and the decomposition of compounds. For producing a searchable database of the GIRT data they used the Zebra software, which provides a Z39.50 interface and relevance operator and allows ranking of results. The Social Science Thesaurus has also been used and provided as a lexical resource in MultiNet manner."]},{"title":"Conclusion","paragraphs":["For now the GIRT4 data have been a valuable source for CLIR evaluation, although not yet all possible facets have been exploited. But these data also offer chances as a source for linguistic research as they give a lot of real parallel texts (titles and indexing terms, and as far as abstracts exist) in two languages. They may also be useful to determine co-occurrences of intellectually assigned indexing terms and terms in the free text. We hope to enlarge the domain-specific task of CLEF by adding other English, Russian, and French corpora. Then a complete multilingual sub-task would be possible and comparable corpora would by available to the scientific community."," 11 For instance the phrase „information retrieval“ will be cut into the following 4-gramms, if the word boundaries are respected and the words themselves are included: information info nfor form orma rmat mati atio tion, retrieval retr etri trie riev ieva eval. 12 Petras/Perelman/Gey 2003. p. 243 1345"]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["For the calculation of data on the assessment Marco Winter gave a lot of support.
