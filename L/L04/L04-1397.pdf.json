Madrid, Spain","asun@fi.upm.es mcsuarez@delicias.dia.fi.upm.es","Abstract Before using ontologies in Semantic Web applications, ontology content and ontology tools (parsers, platforms, etc.) should be evaluated. In this paper we evaluate ontology evaluation functionalities of RDF(S), DAML+OIL, and OWL parsers and import services for such languages within ontology platforms. In recent years, some RDF(S), DAML+OIL, and OWL parsers have been created and several ontology platforms are able to import ontologies implemented in such languages. In this paper we present two experiments. The first one reveals that most RDF(S), DAML+OIL, and OWL parsers studied do not detect taxonomic problems, from a knowledge representation point of view, in ontologies implemented in such languages. So, if such ontologies are imported by ontology platforms, the question is: are they able to detect such problems? The second experiment presented in this paper reveals that most ontology platforms analyzed only detect a few of problems in concept taxonomies during ontology import."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["Ontology content evaluation as well as evaluation of the software used to build ontologies are critical activities to take into account before integrating ontologies in the Semantic Web. Content evaluation should be performed during the whole ontology life-cycle, and ontology tools should support this evaluation during the whole process. Along with the increasing number of ontologies implemented in RDF(S) (1, 2), DAML+OIL (3), and OWL (4), specialized ontology parsers (Validating RDF Parser (5), RDF Validation Service (6), DAML Validator (7), DAML+OIL Ontology Checker (8), OWL Ontology Validator (9), and OWL Validator (10)) and import services within ontology platforms (OilEd (Bechhofer et al., 2001), OntoEdit (Sure et al., 2002), Protégé-2000 (Noy et al., 2000), and WebODE (Arpírez et al., 2003)) have been built. These ontology tools must be studied to analyze whether they detect taxonomic problems in ontologies from a knowledge representation point of view. In this paper we have performed our experiments with 41 ontologies (7 on RDF(S), 17 on DAML+OIL, and 17 on OWL), which are well built from a syntactic point of view, according to the languages specifications, but have inconsistencies and redundancies in their concept taxonomies. In summary, we have used the following evaluation process: 1) We have parsed our ontologies with the previous parsers and we have discovered that, in most  1 http://www.w3.org/TR/PR-rdf-schema 2 http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax/ 3 http://www.daml.org/2001/03/daml+oil-walkthru.html 4 http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/ 5 http://139.91.183.30:9090/RDF/VRP/ 6 http://www.w3.org/RDF/Validator/ 7 http://www.daml.org/validator/ 8 http://potato.cs.man.ac.uk/oil/Checker 9 http://phoebus.cs.man.ac.uk:9999/OWL/Validator 10 http://owl.bbn.com/validator/ cases, these parsers do not detect the taxonomic problems identified in (Gómez-Pérez, 1996). 2) We have imported our ontologies into the previous ontology platforms using their import services or backends. We have found out that, in most cases, these platforms do not detect problems in concept taxonomies in RDF(S), DAML+OIL, and OWL. This paper is organized as follows, section two presents possible anomalies that can appear in ontology taxonomies. Section three presents a brief description of the ontology parsers and platforms used. Section four includes the results of our two experiments. Finally, we conclude with further work on evaluation."]},{"title":"2. Taxonomic Knowledge in Ontologies","paragraphs":["The primitives rdfs:subClassOf is used in RDF(S), DAML+OIL, and OWL to build concept taxonomies. Besides, DAML+OIL and OWL allow adding disjoint and exhaustive knowledge to concept taxonomies, which is used to create disjoint decompositions of classes, exhaustive decompositions of classes, and partitions of classes (that is, decompositions that are both disjoint and exhaustive). The primitives daml:disjointUnionOf, daml:disjointWith, owl:disjointWith, and owl:unionOf can be used for this purpose. According to the different possibilities for defining concept taxonomies, Gómez-Pérez (1996) presents a set of potential problems that can appear when ontologists model taxonomic knowledge in ontologies. In this paper we focus only on the automatic detection of inconsistencies (circularity issue and partition errors) and grammatical redundancy problems. We postpone the analysis of the other types of problems for further works."]},{"title":"3. Ontology Tools: Parsers and Platforms The Validating RDF Parser (VRP)","paragraphs":["(11). This parser carries out a syntactic validation and a semantic validation for verifying constraints derived from RDFS.  11 http://139.91.183.30:9090/RDF/VRP/ 645 RDF Validation Service (12). This service does syntactic validation, but it does not offer any semantic validation. DAML Validator (13). The validator checks the ontology for namespace problems, for existence of RDF resources, and for global domain and range constraints of predicates. DAML+OIL Ontology Checker (14). This tool carries out syntactic validation for checking missing definitions. And it verifies class hierarchy loops. OWL Ontology Validator (15). This tool can be used to check if an ontology conforms to a specific OWL species, since it validates an OWL ontology. OWL Validator (16). This tool is not a simple parser in the sense that it checks OWL ontologies not only for simple syntax problems, but also for other errors. OilEd (17; Bechhofer et al., 2001) can import ontologies implemented in RDF(S), OIL, DAML+OIL, OWL, and the SHIQ XML format. OntoEdit (18; Sure et al., 2002) Free can import ontologies from FLogic, RDF(S), DAML+OIL, and from directory structures and from Excel files. Protégé-2000 (19; Noy et al., 2000) can import ontologies implemented in RDF(S), DAML+OIL, OWL, XML, XML Schema, and XMI. WebODE (20; Arpírez et al., 2003) can import ontologies from XML, RDF(S), DAML+OIL, and OWL."]},{"title":"4. Comparative Study of Ontology Tools","paragraphs":["As we can see in table 1, circularity problems are the only ones detected by some of the parsers studied. The VRP is able to detect circularity problems at any distance in RDF(S) ontologies. This parser indicates that there is a semantic error with the message ‘loop detected’. The DAML+OIL Ontology Checker discovers circularity problems at any distance in RDF(S) and DAML+OIL ontologies. This checker generates the warning ‘cycles in class hierarchy’ for indicating the problem. None of the OWL parsers is able to detect circularity problems in concept taxonomies. Regarding partition errors, they have only been studied for DAML+OIL and for OWL, since they cannot be represented in RDF(S). None of the parsers studied have recognized partition errors in our ten ontologies. The same occurs with the grammatical redundancy problems, which are not detected by any of the parsers studied. As table 2 shows, circularity problems at any distance are the only ones detected by most of the ontology platforms analyzed. However, OntoEdit Free does not discover, but it simply ignores circularity problems at distance zero in RDF(S) and DAML+OIL ontologies. WebODE is the only one that detects these anomalies in OWL ontologies, on account of this platform uses the ODEval (21) service. Regarding partition errors, only DAML+OIL and OWL ontologies have been studied  12 http://www.w3.org/RDF/Validator/ 13 http://www.daml.org/validator/ 14 http://potato.cs.man.ac.uk/oil/Checker 15 http://phoebus.cs.man.ac.uk:9999/OWL/Validator 16 http://owl.bbn.com/validator/ 17 http://oiled.man.ac.uk 18 http://www.ontoprise.de/com/start_downlo.htm 19 http://protege.stanford.edu/plugins.html 20 http://webode.dia.fi.upm.es/ 21 http://minsky.dia.fi.upm.es/odeval because this type of knowledge cannot be represented in RDF(S). Most ontology platforms used do not recognize partition errors in DAML+OIL and OWL ontologies. OilEd and Protégé-2000 allow the insertion of common classes in disjoint decompositions and partitions in OWL ontologies, but these platforms identifies these types of error when the ontology is verified. Only WebODE, using ODEval, detects some partition errors in DAML+OIL and OWL ontologies. Grammatical problems are not discovered either by most ontology platforms used. However, most of ontology platforms ignore direct redundancies of ‘subclass-of’ or ‘instance-of’ relations. Similar to the previous case, only WebODE recognizes, using ODEval, indirect redundancies of ‘subclass-of’ relations in RDF(S), DAML+OIL, and OWL ontologies."]},{"title":"5. Conclusions and Further Work","paragraphs":["Taking into account the results of our experiments, we consider that it is necessary to check possible anomalies that can be made during ontology development. Therefore, it is important that ontology tools help the ontologist build ontologies without knowledge representation problems. We consider that we need tools for giving support to the evaluation activity during the whole life-cycle of ontologies (conceptualization, implementation, import, export, etc.). These ontology tools should not only evaluate concept taxonomies, but also other ontology components, such as relations, axioms, instances, etc."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["This work has been supported by the Esperonto project (IST-2001-34373), the ContentWeb project (TIC-2001-2745), and a research grant from UPM (“ Beca asociada a proyectos modalidad B” ).
