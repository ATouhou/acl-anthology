The TEIRESIAS algorithm, which is widely used in bioinformatics domain, is adopted. The experimental results based on MET2 test bed show that the approach of regarding the morpheme of a keyword as a cluster is the best, the approach of regarding all the keywords as the same cluster is the next, and the approach of regarding each keyword as a cluster is the worse. The performance using morpheme-based approach is a little better than that of hand-crafted approach. The methodology can be easily extended to other types of named entities.","",""]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["Named organizations denote enterprises, companies, schools, hospitals, institutes, government offices, etc. This special kind of named entities is an open set. New organizations are set up continuously, and old organizations may be renamed or even dismissed. A lexicon cannot capture all the organization names, and that becomes an important research issue in human language processing (Chen and Lee, 1996). Because organization names are usually composed of more than two content words, the boundary identification is challenging.","Compared with the gazetteer approach, the rule-based approach employs the formulation rules to recognize named organization. The formulation rules may be hand-crafted or learned automatically (Chen, Yang, and Lin, 2003). The major drawback of the hand-crafted approach is the coverage problem. This paper adopts TEIRESIAS algorithm (Rigoutsos and Floratos, 1998) used in pattern discovery in biological sequence to mine the formulation rules from a named organization corpus.","This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 shows hand-crafted rules to recognize organization names. Section 3 introduces the TEIRESIAS algorithm and shows how to extract the rules. Section 4 employs MET2 (1998) data to evaluate the performance of pattern discovery. Section 5 concludes the remarks."]},{"title":"2. Hand-Crafted Rules","paragraphs":["The structure of organization names is more complex","than that of person names. Basically, a complete","organization name can be divided into two parts, i.e.,","name and keyword. The following specifies the rules we","adopted to formulate its structure (Chen, Ding, Tsai, and","Bian, 1998). D is any content words.","OrganizationName ̆ (1) OrganizationName OrganizationNameKeyword e.g., 聯合國 部隊 lian he guo bu dui United Nations Force (2) CountryName OrganizationNameKeyword e.g., 美國 大使館 mei guo da shi guan United States Embassy (3) PersonName OrganizationNameKeyword e.g., 羅慧夫 基金會 luo hui fu ji jin hui Foundation (4) CountryName {D|DD} OrganizationNameKeyword e.g., 中國 國際 廣播電台 zhong guo guo ji guang bo dian tai China International Broadcasting Stations (5) PersonName {D|D} OrganizationNameKeyword e.g., 羅慧夫 文教 基金會 luo hui fu wen jiao ji jin hui Culture and Education Foundation (6) LocationName {D|D} OrganizationNameKeyword e.g., 台北 國際 廣播電台 tai bei guo ji guang bo dian tai Taipei International Broadcasting Stations (7) CountryName OrganizationName e.g., 美國 國防部 mei guo guo fang bu United States Department of Defense (8) LocationName OrgnizationName e.g., 伊利諾州 州府 yi li nuo zhou zhou fu Illinois State Government","In this version, we collect 776 organization names and","1,059 organization name keywords.","In MET2 (1998) evaluation, the system (Chen, Ding,","Tsai, and Bian, 1998) achieved the recall rate 77.72%, the","precision rate 85.17% and the F-measure 80.78% for the","extraction of organization names using the above rules."]},{"title":"3. Pattern Discovery with TEIRESIAS","paragraphs":["TEIRESIAS Algorithm (Rigoutsos and Floratos, 1998) developed by IBM bioinformatics group is available on the web site (http://cbcsrv.watson.ibm.com/Tspd.html) and has been employed to a large number of computational biology applications. The following shows how to use it in organization name extraction. 301","Here, each Chinese word is in both Han character and","Pinyin.","Assume we have two organization names:","“台北金融中心”","(“tai bei jin rong zhong xin”, Taipei Financial Center)","and","“台北商業中心”","(“tai bei shang ye zhong xin”, Taipei Business Center).","TEIRESIAS Algorithm will derive a rule shown as","follows.","“台北 * 中心”","(“tai bei * zhong xin”, Taipei * Center),","where * denotes a wild-card.","When an unknown string “台北新聞中心” (“tai bei xin","wen zhong xin”, Taipei News Center) is input, it will be","recognized as a named organization according to this rule.","Three parameters, including the minimum number of","non-wild-card literals, the maximum extent spanned by","any consecutive non-wild-card literals, and the desired","minimum support, are considered in TEIRESIAS","Algorithm. The pattern discovery procedure for","organization names is proposed as follows.","(1) Collect keywords An organization is usually composed of name part and keyword part. The variation of name part is quite large. It may be a combination of a person name, an organization name, or common content words. Comparatively, the keyword part is fixed. We input training organization names into TEIRESIAS Algorithm, and set the number of pattern support to be 5. In other words, the resulting rule must support at least 5 organization names. The rules that ends with wild-card, i.e., not a keyword, are removed. The last strings in the remaining rules are considered as keywords. In the following examples, “公司” (“gong si”, company), “陣 線” (“zhen xian”, front) and “協會” (“xie hui”, association) are regarded as keywords","(* * 公司) (* * Company),","(* * 陣線) (* * Front), and","(* 協會) (* Association).","(2) Cluster organization names The organization names of different keywords may have different formulation rules. Besides, the occurrences of some types of organization names may be only a few in a training corpus. Grouping increases the possibility to discover a pattern. We cluster organization names with the following three alternatives. (a) Each keyword denotes a cluster: the","finest (b) All the keywords denote a cluster: the","coarsest (c) The morpheme of a keyword denotes a","cluster: in-between. Table 1 shows","some examples.","(3) Assign features A word in name part is assigned a feature. The feature set includes person, location, date, country, number, direction, and a word itself.","(4) Employ TEIRESIAS Algorithm TEIRESIAS Algorithm extracts formulation rules for named organizations under the parameter settings."]},{"title":"Table 1. Morpheme as a Cluster","paragraphs":["Morpheme Examples","刊 月刊 (yue kan, monthly), 週刊 (zhou kan, weekly), 季刊 (ji kan, quarterly), 雙 週刊 (shuang zhou kan, biweekly)","台 天文台 (tian wen tai, astronomical observatory), 氣象台 (qi xiang tai, meteorological observatory), 無線電台 (wu xian dian tai, radio station), 電視台 (dian shi tai, TV station)","行 花旗銀行 (hua qi yin xing, Citibank), 銀 行 (yin xing, bank), 洋行 (yang xing, foreign firm), 商業銀行 (shang ye yin xing, commercial bank)"]},{"title":"4.

If a keyword of a test data is not seen in the training corpus, this approach fails to recognize this string. The rarest approach can capture all the keywords, so that the recall increases at expense of precision. The in-between approach has the best performance. We postulate that the keywords with the same morpheme have the same formulation rules. In this way, we employ the corresponding morpheme rule when the keyword is not seen before.","The patterns discovered by the second approaches are similar to the hand-crafted rules. All the rules except","OrganizationName ̆","CountryName OrganizationName |","LocationName OrgnizationName are learned by our algorithm. Although the patterns mined by third approach are not exactly the same as the hand-crafted rules, they cover most organization names and recognize more organization names that hand-crafted rules could not. Some of them are shown as follows. The patterns matched are enclosed by parentheses.

It shows that the automatic learning approach competes with the hand-crafted approach."]},{"title":"5. Concluding Remarks","paragraphs":["The TEIRESIAS Algorithm, which is widely applied to biological domain, is used to extract the formulation rules of organization names. This methodology can be extended easily to other types of keyword-based named entities. The mined rules for organization names have F-measure 81.50% in MET2 test set, where documents are selected from newspapers in China. In contrast, the named organization corpus which is used for training is developed in Taiwan. The formulation of organization names is something different between China and Taiwan. In the future, we will try to find a training corpus coming from the same area with test set, and investigate the effects on recognition. Besides, the incomplete organization names still cannot be recognized by using the mined rules. Contextual information, which is indispensable for boundary identification, should also be investigated further."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Chen, Hsin-Hsi; Ding, Yung-Wei; Tsai, Shih-Chung and Bian, Guo-Wei (1998). “Description of the NTU System Used for MET2.” Proceedings of 7th","Message Understanding Conference, Fairfax, VA, 29 April - 1 May, 1998, http://www.itl.nist.gov/iaui/894.02/related_projects/m uc/index.html.","Chen, Hsin-Hsi and Lee, Jen-Chang (1996) “Identification and Classification of Proper Nouns in Chinese Texts.” Proceedings of 16th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, Copenhagen, Denmark, August 5-9, 1996, 222-229.","Chen, Hsin-Hsi; Yang, Changhua and Lin, Ying (2003) “Learning Formulation and Transformation Rules for Multilingual Named Entities.” Proceedings of ACL 2003 Workshop on Multilingual and Mixed-language Named Entity Recognition: Combining Statistical and Symbolic Models, July 12, Sapporo, Japan, 2003, 1-8.","MET2 (1998) Proceedings of 7th","Message Understanding Conference, 1998, http://www.itl.nist.gov/iaui/894.02/related_projects/m uc/index.html.","Rigoutsos, I. and Floratos, A.
