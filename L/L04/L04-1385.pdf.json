By comparing the Semantic Map and a manual thesaurus, we found that the word that the abstract noun belongs to, whether a person, thing or event, is introduced as the standard of classification in the manual thesaurus. On the other hand, in the Semantic Map, we found that abstract nouns belonging to people or events are distributed together.

Introduction","paragraphs":["Constructing a thesaurus automatically and accurately from real data is a crucial issue in compiling a lexical database. For our purposes, we need to not only find the similarity between words but also the hierarchical relationship between words. In this research, we extract hierarchical abstract adjective concepts automatically from large corpora using the Neural Network Model (Kohonen 1995, Ma 2000). We define abstract nouns co-occurring with adjectives as our determinant of abstract adjective semantics. We show the hierarchies of abstract adjective semantics within the Semantic Map, and compare hierarchies in the Semantic map with those in a manually prepared thesaurus."]},{"title":"2. Abstract Concepts of adjectives","paragraphs":["In order to automatically extract adjective hypernyms, we use syntactic and semantic relations between words. There is a good deal of linguistic research focused on the syntactic and semantic functions of abstract nouns, including Nemoto (1969), Takahashi (1975), and Schmid (2000). Takahashi (1975) illustrated the sentential function of abstract nouns with the following examples:  a. Yagi wa seishitsu ga otonashii.","(goat) topic (nature) subject (gentle) The nature of goats is gentle b. Zou wa hana ga nagai. (elephant) topic (a nose) subject (long) The nose of an elephant is long  He examined the differences in semantic function between “seishitsu (nature)” in (a) and “hana (nose)” in (b), and explained that “seishitsu (nature)” in (a) indicates an aspect of something, i.e., the goat, and “hana (nose)” in (b) indicates part of something, i.e., the elephant. He recognized abstract nouns in (a) as a hypernym of the attribute that the predicative adjectives express. Nemoto (1969) identified expressions such as “iro ga akai (the color is red)” and “hayasa ga hayai (the speed is fast)” as a kind of meaning repetition, or tautology.","In this paper we define such abstract nouns that co-occur with adjectives as adjective hypernyms. We extracted these co-occurrence relations between abstract nouns and adjectives from corpus data automatically, and used them as input data to SOM.","We extracted abstract nouns from two year's worth of articles from the Mainichi Shinbun newspaper, and extracted adjectives co-occurring with abstract nouns in the manner of (a) above from 100 novels, 100 essays and 42 year's worth of newspaper articles, including 11 year's worth of Mainichi Shinbun articles, 10 year's worth of Nihon Keizai Shinbun (Japanese economic newspaper) articles, 7 year's worth of Sangyoukinyuuryuutusu shinbun (an economic newspaper) articles, and 14 year's worth of Yomiuri Shinbun articles. The total number of abstract noun types is 365, the number of adjective types is 10,525, and the total number of adjective tokens is 35,173. The maximum number of co-occurring adjectives for a given abstract noun is 1,594."]},{"title":"3. the Self-Organizing Semantic Map 3.1. Input data","paragraphs":["Abstract nouns are located in the semantic map based on the similarity of co-occurring adjectives after iteratively learning over input data. In this research, we focus on abstract nouns co-occurring with adjectives. In the semantic map, there are 365 abstract nouns co-occurring with adjectives. The similarities between the 365 abstract nouns are determined according to the number of common co-occurring adjectives. We made a list such as the following. ","OMOI (feeling): ureshii (glad), kanashii (sad), shiawasena (happy), ...","KIMOCHI (though) : ureshii (glad), tanoshii (pleased), hokorashii (proud), ...","KANTEN (viewpoint): igakutekina (medical), rekishitekina (historical), ...

The Semantic Map by using CSM ","paragraphs":["Ma (2000) classified co-occurring words using a selforganizing semantic map (SOM). We made a semantic map of the above-mentioned 365 abstract nouns using SOM. However, we could not precisely identify the relations between words in the map. The distribution of the words on the map gives us a clue as to the semantic distribution of the words. To solve this problem, we introduced the complementary similarity measure (CSM). This similarity measure estimates a one-to-many relation, such as superordinate– subordinate relations (Hagita and Sawaki 1995, Yamamoto and Umemura 2002). We can find the hierarchical distribution of words in the semantic map according to the value of CSM. This similarity measure was developed for the recognition of degraded machine-printed text (Hagita and Sawaki, 1995). Hierarchical relations can be extracted accurately when the CSM value is high. When the CSM value is low, however, the result is unreliable. To compensate for this weakness of CSM, we use Yates’ correction. Yates’ correction is often used in order to increase the accuracy of approximation. Yates’ correction can extract different relations from high CSM values. According to Yamamoto and Umemura (2002), who adopted CSM to classify words, CSM is calculated as follows."]},{"title":"))(( dbca bcad CSM ++ −=","paragraphs":["Yates’ correction is calculated as follows.

In our research, each “label” is an abstract noun, a indicates the number of adjectives co-occurring with both abstract nouns, b and c indicate the number of adjectives co-occurring with either abstract noun (“label 1” and “label 2”, respectively), and d indicates the number of adjectives co-occurring with neither abstract noun.","We calculated hierarchical relations between word pairs using these similarity measures."]},{"title":"4. How to obtain hierarchical relations","paragraphs":["The hierarchy construction process is as follows:  1) Based on the results of CSM, “koto (matter)” is the hypernym of all abstract nouns. We therefore choose words which have a high CSM value with “koto (matter)” and connect them to it. Here, “koto (matter)” is a hyperonym of these words. Next, we choose words which have a high CSM value with these new words, and so on iteratively.  2) When the normalized value of CSM is less than 0.4, the number of extracted word pairs becomes increasingly overwhelming, and the reliability of CSM diminishes. Word pairs with a normalized CSM value of less than 0.4 are located far from the common hypernym “koto (matter)” on the semantic map. If we construct a hierarchy using CSM value only, a long hierarchy containing irrelevant words emerges. In this case, the word pairs calculated by Yates' correction are more accurate than those from CSM. We combine words using Yates’ correction, when the value of CSM is less than 0.4. When we connect word pairs with a high Yates’ value, we find the hyperonym of the superordinate noun in the pair and connect the pair to the hyperonym. If a word pair appears only in the Yates' correction data, that is, we cannot connect the pair with a high Yates’ value to the hyperonym with a high CSM value, they are combined with “koto (matter)”.  3) Finally, if a short hierarchy is contained in a longer hierarchy, it is merged with the longer hierarchy."]},{"title":"5.

The comparison between thesaurus by SOM + CSM and by human","paragraphs":["We compare the semantic map with two manual thesauri, i.e., BUNRUIGOIHYOU (WORD LIST BY SEMANTIC PRINCIPLE) and the EDR lexicon.

SEISHIN OYOBI KOUI (mentality/action)","Personality, attitude, mental state, sense, evaluation of","human action, circumstances, association et al. SHIZENGENSHOU (nature)","Light, color, taste, smell, sound, material, body et al.  These categories, i.e. abstract adjective concepts, are determined based on whether the abstract nouns refer to a person or not.","The EDR lexicon is one of the largest Japanese electronic lexicons. This lexicon has a manual thesaurus. It has hierarchical relations for “concept”, “concepts related to information processing”, “phenomena”, “matter”, “time”, “position”, “an agent such as a person and a creature behaving like a person”, and “attributes, values and units in the domain of information processing” and their subordinate concepts. They are divided into hyponymic concepts based on whether a reference of an abstract noun belongs to a person or to a thing.","With a Semantic Map, the distribution of abstract nouns on the map is not based on what the reference of an abstract noun belongs to. For example, as “takai (tall/high)” co-occurrs with “setake (the height of human)” and with “kingaku (an amount of money)”, they are separated in the manual thesaurus but they are closely located in the automatically-constructed Semantic Map. They are included in the hierarchy of “joutai (situation) and teido (degree)”. In our data, from the root node “koto (matter)”, abstract nouns are divided into five hierarchies; mental expressions, impression of something or someone, states similar to situations, states like degrees, and a meaning/viewpoint."]},{"title":"8. Conclusion ","paragraphs":["In this research, we distributed abstract concepts on a Semantic Map by using CSM, and derived a hierarchy of abstract concepts by using CSM and Yates. On the map we recognized five types of distributions. When we compared the Semantic Map with a manual thesaurus, we found that what the type of the abstract noun referent, i.e., a person, thing or event, is used as the primary classification criterion in manual thesauri. On the other hand, in the Semantic Map, we found that abstract nouns that refer to both people and events are distributed together. A criterion for the classification of abstract concepts is a mental state or impression of something, someone or a state, or a viewpoint of something. When considering adjectives, these seem to be used flexibly without regard to a person or event.","The hierarchy of “sokumen (a side), imi (meaning) and kanten (viewpoint)” is necessary for categorizing adjectives, because co-occurring adjectives are a peculiarity. For example, “rekishitekin (historical)”, “igakutekina (medical)”, “seijitekina (political)” and so on occur. In future work, we will attempt to compare hierarchies by using CSM with other methods."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Kohonen, T. 1995.
