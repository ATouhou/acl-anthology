Mostly, three prosody components are modeled: segmental duration, pitch contour and intensity. In this study, we present our work on modeling segmental duration in Turkish by using machine-learning algorithms. The models predict phone durations based on attributes such as phone identity, neighboring phone identities, lexical stress, position of syllable in word, part-of-speech information, word length in number of syllables and position of word in utterance. Obtained models predict segment durations better than mean duration approximations. "]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["A fundamental issue in Text-to-Speech (TTS) conversion is naturalness of the synthesized speech. In order to obtain natural sounding synthetic speech, prosodic attributes of speech such as pitch frequency, duration and intensity should be modeled appropriately (Santen, 1997). In natural speech, segment durations are highly correlated to context. Similar/same phones differ in their energy, duration and fundamental frequency depending on their context (Möbius, 1996; Santen, 1997; Venditti, 1998). This process could be viewed as a mixed classification problem (Lee, 1999). The aim of this study has been set as the determination of phone durations in Turkish according to a set of qualities including those like phonetic, syllabic, word-internal and sentence-internal contexts. Over the years, there have been emphases on two approaches for duration modeling: rule-based systems such as Klatt’s duration model (Klatt, 1987) and corpus-based statistical systems such as decision trees and Sum-of-Products (SOP) model (Batusek, 2002; Dusterhoff, Black, Taylor, 1999; Febrer, Padrell, Bonafonte, 1998; Lee, 1999; Möbius, Santen, 1996; Santen, 1997; Venditti, Santen, 1998). In this work, two corpus-based methods – Linear regression and J48, a modified version of C4.5 decision tree algorithm – have been employed in modeling segment durations in Turkish (Witten, Frank, 1999). Both subjective and objective comparisons reveal that duration models obtained via decision tree learning provide better results and both models are superior to mean duration modeling in all aspects. In this study, we present our work on modeling segmental duration in Turkish by using machine-learning algorithms. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the prepared speech database. Section 3 summarizes the developed feature set. In Section 4, contextual attributes are described. Section 5 describes the duration analysis and modeling studies. Section 6 reports the performance of the models. Conclusions and future projects are discussed in the last section. "]},{"title":"2. Speech Database","paragraphs":["As a reference for duration calculations, recordings of 190 sentences form a 27-year old, non-professional native female speaker have been used. Recordings have been aligned in a former study, (Salor, Pellom, Çiloğlu, 2002), using the University of Colorado’s speech recognition system, Sonic. This speech corpus consists of a total of 8005 METU-bet1","phones (419 silence, 3246 vowels and 4340 consonants). It has to be mentioned that the size of this database is not truely sufficient for the purpose; the formation of a richer corpus is an ongoing work."]},{"title":"3. Feature Set","paragraphs":["Contextual attributes of a phone have been represented as a feature vector; the elements of a vector is a subset of the items listed below: • Phn: METU-bet representation for the current phone. • Left_Content: Left content feature. It might have the value plosive (1283), nasal (796), fricative (1112), lateral (531), rolled (618), and high/low vowel (1823/1423). • Right_Content: Right content feature. • Left_Id: Left content identity in orthographic form. The levels might be a, b, c, C, d, e, f, g, h, I, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, O, p, r, s, S, t, u, U, v, y, z, SIL. • Right_Id: Right content identity in orthographic form. • Stress: Lexical stress of the current phone. The syllable containing the phone may either be Accented (2393) or Not-Accented (5193). • Posin_Syl: Location of the phone in the syllable. It may take values such as Onset (2920), Nucleus (3665), or Coda (1420). • Syl_Pos: Location of the syllable in the word. The syllable carrying the syllable may be the Initial (2599), Middle (2542), or Final (2445) syllable of a word.  1 METU-bet is the phonetic alphabet (containing 39 units including SILence.) developed in the course of the work presented in (Salor, Pellom, Çiloğlu, 2002). 2087 • Word_POS: Part-of-Speech information of the word. It could be VERB (1522), NOUN (3944), PROPer noun (7), ADJective (1085), ADVerb (482), INFinitive (130), CONJunction (64), QUEStion (23), CompoundNOUN (44), PRONoun (147), POSTPosition (114), SIL (419). • Word_Len: Length of the word in number of syllables. • Duration: Segment duration in ms. • Duration: Segment duration in discrete levels (due to the limitations resulting from statistical analysis package)."]},{"title":"4. Identification of Contextual Attributes","paragraphs":["Contextual attributes of the phones have been extracted from the text of the speech corpus. Some of the attributes such as neighboring phone identities, syllable position, position of phone in syllable, and word length could be retrieved directly from text by means of phonetic categorization and syllabification algorithm. However, because of the agglutinative nature of Turkish, the Part-Of-Speech (POS) tags and lexical stress could not be obtained utilizing already developed text analysis tools such as phonetization and syllabification. To overcome these drawbacks, morphological analysis (MA) has been employed. MA has been done by PC-Kimmo, a freely available software developed by Karttunen (Antworth, 1990). The rules and the lexicon developed by Oflazer (1994) have been integrated with PC-Kimmo and the lexicon has been enlarged to increase its coverage. MA outputs and syllable information are then used to obtain the lexical stress of the words. Stress, in general, is on the last syllable of the word and migrates to the right with successive suffixation in Turkish. However, there are exceptions to this rule. The rule does not apply to place names and borrowings. Furthermore, there exist stress-blocking morphemes that prevent stress migration to the right (Barker, 1989). The stress assignment algorithm used in this study identifies these exceptions using morphemic information provided by MA. Figures 1-5 demonstrate the duration pattern for several contextual attributes derived from the dataset. It can be deduced that silence has a wide range of duration values, which might cause a deficiency in the performance of the machine-learning (ML) algorithms. For future studies, a short-pause would be employed for better performance.  Figure 1 Position in syllable versus duration.

Duration Analysis and Modeling","paragraphs":["The duration analysis and modeling have been performed using a publicly available statistical analysis package, WEKA, developed at the University of Waikato, New Zeland (Witten, Frank, 1999). The package bears a collection of algorithms for solving real-world data mining problems. The software has a uniform interface to a number of standard ML techniques (Ross, 2000). Two of the ML algorithms offered by WEKA have been utilized: Linear Regression and J48, a modified version of c4.5. J48 performs a categorical decision thus the duration of each segment has to be quantized prior to the processing. To this aim, the discretizer embedded in the WEKA package has been used. Experiments with J48 were conducted over equally spaced 100-levels for duration values. Experimentation has been carried out for investigating the performance of different feature subsets. The feature combinations used for training are as follows:  • Factor Set1: Phn, LeftContent, RightContent, Stress, Posinsyl, SylPos, Duration (ms) • Factor Set2: Phn, LeftContent, RightContent, Stress, Posinsyl, SylPos, Duration (100 linearly spaced duration levels) • Factor Set3: Phn, LeftId, RightId, Stress, Posinsyl, SylPos, Duration (ms) • Factor Set4: Phn, LeftId, RightId, Stress, Posinsyl, SylPos, Duration (100 linearly spaced duration levels) • Factor Set5: Phn, LeftContent, RightContent, Stress, Posinsyl, SylPos, WorPOS, Duration (ms) • Factor Set6: Phn, LeftContent, RightContent, Stress, Posinsyl, SylPos, WorPOS, Duration (100 linearly spaced duration levels) • Factor Set7: Phn, LeftId, RightId, Stress, Posinsyl, SylPos, WorPOS, Duration (ms) • Factor Set8: Phn, LeftId, RightId, Stress, Posinsyl, SylPos, WorPOS, Duration (100 linearly spaced duration levels) • Factor Set9: Phn, LeftContent, RightContent, Stress, Posinsyl, SylPos, WorPOS, WordLen, Duration (ms) • Factor Set10: Phn, LeftContent, RightContent, Stress, Posinsyl, SylPos, WorPOS, WordLen, Duration (100 linearly spaced duration levels) • Factor Set11: Phn, LeftId, RightId, Stress, Posinsyl, SylPos, WorPOS, WordLen, Duration (ms) • Factor Set12: Phn, LeftId, RightId, Stress, Posinsyl, SylPos, WorPOS, WordLen, Duration (100 linearly spaced duration levels) The results were then directed to Festival speech synthesis system. Modules required by the synthesizer were written in Scheme, (Dybvig, 1996), a Festival specific language. In our baseline system, mean phoneme durations are provided in the duration module. The mean durations are obtained from the aligned speech database of METU (Salor, Pellom, Çiloğlu, 2002), using 120 speakers with 40 sentences each. The mean durations are given in Table 1.

Evaluations","paragraphs":["The performance of the system is evaluated both objectively and subjectively. The overall data set has been used both for training and testing for quantitative evaluation. Table 2 shows numerical results obtained from the duration modeling procedure. It can be deduced that each model’s performance increases with the addition of new attributes to the training set. For example, adding WordPOS and WordLen to the training feature set improves the performance of J48 considerably: the correlation 2089 coefficient increases from 0.889 to 0.9107 while RMSE decreases from 0.0555 to 0.0513. However, we still think that the desired level has not been reached yet. Current research is towards expanding the data set to improve the modeling quality.

The pairs are determined from several groups of words. These groups include the words that could be confused by human ear due to voicing, nasality, sustention, sibilation, graveness and compactness affects. 10 pairs are selected for each listener from this list. One word from each pair is synthesized by our TTS system. The listener listens to the synthetic waveform and decides which one from the word pair is synthesized. The overall intelligibility of the system from 20 listeners has been found as 86.5%. Then this test has been repeated with the same words but the duration model is replaced by the proposed duration model. The intelligibility of the words increased to 87.3%. It should be mentioned that mean durations used previously were obtained from a larger speech corpus (Salor, Pellom, Çiloğlu, 2002)."]},{"title":"7.
