Introduction","paragraphs":["The purpose of this paper is to describe the TüBa-D/Z treebank (Telljohann et al., 2003) of written German and to compare it to the independently developed TIGER treebank (Brants et al., 2002). Both treebanks use as their data source German newspaper material: the Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper corpus for TIGER and the ’die tageszeitung’ (taz) newspaper corpus for TüBa-D/Z. While TIGER provides 40.000 annotated sentences, the TüBa-D/Z treebank comprises at present appr. 15.000 trees. While smaller in size, the TüBa-D/Z treebank has reached a size that has proven feasible as training material for a variety of tasks in data-driven NLP: morphological disambiguation (Hinrichs and Trushkina, 2002), partial parsing (Müller and Ule, 2002), and topological field parsing (Liepert, 2003; Ule, 2003; Veenstra et al., 2002).","Both treebanks, TIGER and TüBa-D/Z, use an annotation framework that is based on phrase structure grammar and that is enhanced by a level of predicate-argument structure. Annotation is performed semi-automatically by the graphical tool Annotate (Plaehn, 1998)."]},{"title":"2. The T üBa-D/Z Annotation Scheme","paragraphs":["The TüBa-D/Z treebank was made available for research and development purposes in December 20031","along with a detailed stylebook (Telljohann et al., 2003). It there-fore seems timely to provide a detailed comparison of the TüBa-D/Z and TIGER annotation schemes so as to provide potential users of the data with an overview of the similarities and differences between these language resources.","The TüBa-D/Z annotation scheme is derived from the Verbmobil treebank of spoken German (Hinrichs et al., 2000), but has been extended along various dimensions to accommodate the characteristics of written texts.","The Verbmobil treebank annotation scheme distinguishes four levels of syntactic constituency: the lexical level, the phrasal level, the level of topological fields, 1","For further information, please visit the TüBa-D/Z website at http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/en_tuebadz. shtml. and the clausal level. The primary ordering principle of a clause is the inventory of topological fields, which characterize the word order regularities among different clause types of German, and which are widely accepted among descriptive linguists of German (cf. e.g. (Drach, 1937; Höhle, 1986)). In addition to constituent structure, annotated trees contain edge labels between nodes. These edge labels encode grammatical functions (as relations between phrases) and the distinction between heads (HD) and non-heads (-) (as phrase-internal relations). The tree in Figure 1 descibes the sentence Wir müssen uns aber davor hüten, daß sich jeder Politiker einen eigenen Tempel baut. (“But we have to prevent that every politician builds his own temple.”) 2",". The sentence (SIMPX) is grouped into the following topological fields: initial field (VF), left sentence bracket (LK), middle field (MF), verb complex (VC), and final field(NF). The finiteverb constitutes the head (HD) of the clause. The grammatical relations annotated in the tree are: subject (ON), accusative object (OA), dative object (OD), verbal object (OV), prepositional object (OPP), modifierof the prepositional object (OPP-MOD) (cf. section 3.1.), and modifier(MOD). The parts of speech are given below the lexical level. For POS tagging, the STTS (Schiller et al., 1995) is used.","Syntactic and semantic ambiguity is treated in terms of underspecification,which relies on the principle of high attachment and utilizes underspecified node labels. Whenever disambiguation is possible, a non-ambiguous label is chosen, such as for the modifierof the prepositional object (OPP-MOD) in the sentence in Figure 1. If the ambiguity cannot be resolved, the ambiguous modifierreceives the underspecified label MOD and is attached to the highest possible node. The sentence in Figure 1 shows an example of such an ambiguous modifier(MOD), which modifies more than one constituent.","2","All trees in this paper follow the data format for trees defined by the NEGRA project of the Sonderforschungsbereich 378 at the University of the Saarland, Saarbrücken.

Differences in Annotation between T üBa-D/Z and TIGER 3.1. Context-free Backbone vs. Crossing Branches","paragraphs":["There are two main differences in the annotation schemes of TüBa-D/Z and TIGER: the treatment of the relatively free word order in German and the treatment of discontinuous constituents.","For both phenomena, the TüBa-D/Z annotation relies on a context-free backbone (i.e. proper trees without crossing branches) of phrase structure combined with edge labels that specify the grammatical function of the phrase in question. By contrast, TIGER assumes a less constrained notion of tree, which includes the possibility of crossing branches. This allows for a purely tree structural account of word order variation without the need of dedicated function labels. In the sentence in Figure 2 taken from the TIGER treebank, Bei den Gesprächen in London wurden zudem Hilfen für Osteuropa und die Sowjetunion behandelt. (“During the discussions in London, support for Eastern Europe and the Sowjet Union were also addressed.”), the extraposed prepositional phrase is attached directly to the VP whose head is the main verb at the end of the sentence, thus leading to a crossing branch.","At the sentence level, the differences in annotation strategy between TIGER and TüBa-D/Z manifest themselves most clearly in the treatment of subjects and of rightward extraposition. In TIGER, subjects and finite verbs are always treated as immediate daughters of the clause, regardless of their linear positions while non-finite verbs, their complements, and (prepositional) adjuncts are grouped to-gether into single VP constituents (cf. Figure 2). This means that crossing dependencies arise in TIGER whenever the subject and/or the finiteverb is surrounded by VP material. By contrast, in TüBa-D/Z, subjects and finiteverbs do not occupy structurally invariant positions in the clause. In-stead, they are grouped inside the relevant topological fields depending on the clause type in which they occur. Their syntactic function is indicated exclusively by grammatical function edge labels, thus obviating the need for crossing branches or additional mechanisms.","One characteristic of free word order is the frequent occurrence of discontinuous constituents, such as extraposed phrases or clauses. In TIGER, dependent constituents are always directly attached to their governing node. Thus, the annotation of discontinuous constituents results in crossing branches. In TüBa-D/Z, the annotation of such phenomena is restricted to pure tree structures, strictly within the bounds of the topological fields. Thus, discontinuous constituents are marked via specific edge labels, e.g. OA-MOD for a discontinuous modifier of an accusative object. In the sentence in Figure 3, Für diese Behauptung hat Beckmeyer bisher keinen Nachweis geliefert. (“F or this claim, Beckmeyer has not provided evidence yet.”), the extraposed constituent Für diese Behauptung modifies the accusative object in the middle field, keinen Nachweis. The relationship between these constituents is marked by the label OA-MOD. The sentence in Figure 1 contains a discontinuous modifierof a prepositional object, labeled OPP-MOD. 3.2. Label Sets and Phrase Internal Structure","Further differences concern the set of node and edge labels and the internal structure of phrases: TüBa-D/Z defines 25 node labels for syntactic categories and 36 edge labels for grammatical functions covering head and non-head information, as well as subcategorization for complements and modifiers. TIGER utilizes 25 node labels and 50 edge labels. Apart from commonly accepted grammatical functions, such as SB (subject) or OA (accusative object), the TIGER edge labels also comprise an extended notion of grammatical functions, e.g. RE (repeated element) or RS (reported speech). Within phrases, TIGER adopts flat structures due to direct attachment of premodifiersand postmodifiersto the phrase node. Additionally, the flat structure is achieved by the notion of noun kernel elements: pronominal, nominal, and adjectival elements. Thus, there is a tendency to describe phrase internal structures via functional label-ing.

Ökonomenzunft an Perot entzündet sich vor allem an dessen vagen Äußerungen zur Wirtschaftspolitik. (“The criticism of the guild of economists towards Perot is mainly kindled by his vage comments concerning economic policies.”), the prepositional phrase contains the preposition as well as the premodifier (MO) of the PP and the elements of the included noun phrase on the same level. The latter elements are marked as belonging to the noun kernel (NK) or modifying it (OP), which replaces an explicitly marked noun phrase constituent.","By contrast, phrases in TüBa-D/Z are more hierarchically structured, thus representing this type of information structurally. The noun phrase in the sentence in Figure 5, Allein die nicht mehr benötigte Anzuchtgärtnerei am Rande des Parks solle bebaut werden. (“Only the seedling nursery, which is no longer in use, on the border of the park is supposed to be developed.”), is structured so that the postmodifying prepositional phrase (PX) is attached high while the premodifiers, such as the adjectival phrase (ADJX), are attached low.","Despite the above mentioned differences, there is a multitude of similarities in the annotation schemes of the two treebanks: both use the STTS (Schiller et al., 1995) for POS-tagging, both make a distinction between pre- and postmodifiersin phrases, and both annotate named entities and elliptical structures.","In fact, it is precisely the similarities and differences between the two treebanks that make them a valuable resource for one and the same language. Depending on the intended application and depending on the available NLP tools, one treebank may be more feasible than the other. For example, due to its context-free backbone, TüBa-D/Z trees can be directly used for the training of PCFG-grammars while TIGER trees need to be converted first to pure tree structures by eliminating all crossing branches, which occur in approximately 30% of all trees."]},{"title":"4.
