In the firststage, the sentence is segmented into better parsable units according to the Topological Field Model. In the second stage, minimal phrases of NPs, DPs and PPs as well as nominal multiword units are identified in each of the recognized fields. In this paper, we discuss the results of the second stage. We evaluated 500 parsed sentences of a newspaper corpus. The achieved recall and precision rates are better than the ones of comparable systems as reported in literature so far."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["Because ambiguity is still one of the central problems for full parsing, partial parsing is used for many NLP tasks. For the task of infomation extraction, it is easier to extract domain and scenario specificinformation with a partial parser instead of determining the correct syntactic analysis from a huge set of ambiguous analyses.","Furthermore, partial parses are of great value for corpus-based computational lexicography. For the extraction of subcategorization frames of content words (e.g. verbs) and the identificationof light verb constructions, corpora annotated with partial parses are very fruitful. Partial parses are also helpful for syntactic grammar refinement, for disambiguation tasks like PP-attachment (Hindle and Rooth, 1993), semantic clustering (Riloff and Shepherd, 1997) as well as an input source for building fully parsed treebanks (Skut et al., 1998).","In (Klatt, 1997), we suggested a strategy for parsing German sentences consisting of three stages. The partial parser described here is a slight modificationof the firsttwo stages. In the first stage, a sentence is segmented according to the Topological Field Model for German (cf. (Drach, 1937), (Höhle, 1986)), shortly TFM. In the second stage, so-called minimal phrases are recognized in each recognized topological field. In the third stage, a fully parsed structure is assigned – first on the field level, then on the sentence level. But here, we’re confronted with the problem of ambiguity – one of the major problems in parsing – where disambiguation strategies using treebank information seems to be the best solution. Unfortunately, the size of the existing treebanks for German (e.g. the TIGER project (Brants et al., 2002)) is too small to be applicable for such a task.","This problem is one motivation (beneath the other applications mentioned before) for the construction of our partial parser, that is based on the analysis technique Pattern-Matching Easy-First Planning, shortly PEP (Klatt, 1997). In opposite to mainstream techniques a sentence is not strictly processed from left to right. Instead we prefer an easy-first strategy, doing the easier decisions before the harder ones, as described in (Abney, 1996).","In the next two chapters, we introduce the structures we want to recognize and illustrate how this could be done with PEP. In the fourth chapter, we describe the recognition process for findingminimal phrases in the so-far received segmented fieldsof the firstparsing stage1",". In the fifthchapter, we present the evaluation of the identifiedstructures, before we show in the sixth chapter some worthwile applications and extensions."]},{"title":"2. Structures to be recognized 2.1. Topological Fields","paragraphs":["For the segmentation of a sentence into its topological fields, we make use of an extension of the TFM by Rehbein (cf. (Rehbein, 1992)). The extended TFM splits up a sentence into seven fields. A so-called sentence bracket (SK) consisting of a left (LK) and a right part (RK) segments a sentence into a top, middle and bottom field (in German ’Vorfeld’ (VF), ’Mittelfeld’ (MF) and ’Nachfeld’ (NF)). Giving coordinations and punctuations a home, Rehbein extends this model by the fields’Satzanfangsrahmen’ (SAR) and ’Satzenderahmen’ (SER).","(1) Sie hoffen zutiefst, dass sie gewinnen werden. They deeply hope that they will win. (2)","SAR VF LK MF RK SER NF Sie hoffen zutiefst , (3) (3)","SAR VF LK MF RK SER dass sie gewinnen werden .","Because we have to process real-life sentences, we extend the TFM by some more fields. E.g. SKEL marks a sentence bracket, where all verbs were elided. Further-more, we use different SK-annotations with respect to their clausal subtype: SKI marks a verb-first-or a part of a verb-second-clause (cf. (4)2",").","(4) [VF Portugal] [SKI [LK wird] [MF im Finale Spanien] [RK schlagen]] und [SKEL [MF Frankreich davor]]. Portugal will beat Spain in the finaland France before. (5) SAR VF LK MF RK SER und Frankreich davor . 1 A detailed description and evaluation of this parsing stage is","beyond the scope of this paper and will be given in a own publi-","cation. 2 Note that empty fieldsare omitted in some of the examples. 851 2.2. Intra-clausal minimal phrases","In the second parsing stage, we determine so-called minimal phrases of selected categorial heads (nouns, determiners, prepositions) of each recognized VF, MF and NF as well as phrases with an adjectival head modifiedby special adverbials. A minimal phrase could be considered as a structured chunk comparable to the chunk definition in (Kermes, 2003). The traditional notion of a chunk is that of a flat, non-recursive structure (Abney, 1991) (cf. (6)). Kermes extends this definitionby two aspects (i) recursive embedding and (ii) post-head embedding (cf. (7)).","(6) [NP das erste Tor] [NP des Turniers]","the first goal of the tournament","(7) [NP [NP das [AP erste] Tor] [NP des Turniers]] the first goal of the tournament","In (8), we see the minimal phrases, we assign to this text. First, we consider a determiner as a governor of a NP according to the DP hypothesis (Abney, 1987)3",". Second, we make no post-head embedding, since such a decision is dependent from the lexical verb (cf. (9) and (10)).

For complex constructions like the one in (11), we assign a so-called closure, a not fully and also – strictly speaking – ill-formed structure. But this can be easily corrected later (e.g. if this structure is recognized as the only part of a VF) by two tree operations (cf. (12)). (11) das in Portugal stattfindende Turnier PP NP DP The tournament taking place in Portugal (12) das in Portugal stattfindende Turnier PP AP NP DP","We define a minimal phrase as a parse tree reaching from the head of a phrase to its governed element that (i) leaves out post-head embedding and (ii) models recursive embedding of the same categorial head by a closure. These are the structures, we want to annotate in the second parser stage – as well as nominal multiword units (N-MWUs) as shown in (13).

The Analysis Technique PEP","paragraphs":["Pattern-Matching Easy-First Planning (Klatt, 1997), shortly PEP, is an analysis technique that can be used for several analyis tasks. We built a tokenizer (Klatt and Bohnet, 2004), a POS-tagger (Klatt, 2002) and this partial parser for German which all outperform existing systems. The analysis process of PEP is driven by traversing a transition network deterministically. A transition network is defined by several states that are linked by directed arcs. Every arc is associated with a so-called network function (NWF). PEP has a lot of NWFs, the most important ones are one corresponding pattern for findingadjacent elements (the NWF nb, cf. (14)) and one corresponding pattern for finding non-adjacent patterns with a left and right border element (the NWF seq, cf. (15)).","(14) Lisbon is a nb NB =ADJA nice NB","=NN town . (15) Lisbon is seq LB=DET a nice RB=NN town .","PEP allows a bi-directional search for patterns from every token position inside the input text. There exist three different ways for searching a pattern: a categorial-driven search, a positional-driven search and a token-driven search. (17) is an example of a categorial-driven search pattern. Here, all adjacent determiners and nouns in (16) are detected and merged to a NP constituent (see (18)). (19) is an example of a positional-driven search pattern. Assuming that the word position pointer *s-top* is positioned at the beginning of the firstword in (16), only the firstdeterminer-noun-pair is detected (see (20)). In (19) the left context, which is associated with *s-top* (:LC *s-top*), is chosen as the anchor point of the pattern (:AP LC). For the token-driven search as well as additonal features of PEP see (Klatt, 1997). (16) The ball hit the bar.

Minimal phrase recognition","paragraphs":["In this chapter, we describe the recognition of minimal phrases in the second parsing stage in more detail. Usually every NP, DP and most PPs consist of a right-peripheral noun in German. We make use of this property by choosing each noun inside a VF, MF or NF as the starting point for the recognition of the minimal phrases. We process a field from left to right, go to the next noun (with a seq-pattern) and apply the following stages to it. 4.1. Recognizing fully parsed subtrees Determining the left adjacent element of the noun (with a nb-pattern), we build a binary branching tree4",", if the left 4 The merged structures are printed in boldface. 852 neighbour is a proper determiner, preposition or attributive adjective (cf. (21)). If the left neighbour is an uppercase written word, but no known firstname, we apply a corpus-based test to recognize N-MWUs in the surrounding context. This test identifiesAung San Suu Kyi in (22) as a N-MWU. After that, we iterate the process for the newly built structure and its left neighbour (cf. (23) and (24)).

(25)) that will be continued in the next substage. (25) mit der [PP in Birma] [NP lebenden Frau]","with the woman living in Birma 4.2. Recognizing closures of subtrees","In this substage, we process all topological fields in a second run by identifying the first motherless NP with a left adjacent attributive adjective (ADJA-N-pair) from left to right. Next, we identify the nearest proper non-adjacent possible governor (determiner or preposition) to its left. If the governor is motherless, we mark these two elements as the border elements and continue with the strategy of the substage described before to merge left adjacent elements with the closure (cf. (26)). (26) [PP mit [DP der [PP in Birma] [NP lebenden Frau]]]","After that, we start an iteration of this process with the next right ADJA-N-pair. If the governor stands in a non-motherless relation (cf. (27-(29)), we build a closure, too. But in this case, we assign a lower confidence factor to it preferring the alternative analysis. Sometimes, the higher ranked analysis is correctly eliminated by the ongoing analysis process, e.g. by identifying the closure in a VF-position (cf. (29)) or in respect to the subcat frame constraints of the lexical verb.

Picking up the rest","At last, we’re picking up the rest, e.g. pronouns with left-peripheral prepositons (cf. (30)), NPs with a prenominal genitiv (cf. (31)), firstnames that followed by an uppercase written word. In the latter case, we don’t prefer one of the two assigned analyses, since both could be correct (cf. (32) and (33)).

Possible Applications and Extensions","paragraphs":["In principle, our parser can be used for any NLP task where partial parsing is involved. It could help building fully parsed treebanks in a semi-automatically way. To make our tree format compatible to existings formats, a simple post-processing strategy is necessary. Especially the TFM-segmentation allows further worthwile applications. For instance, our parser is very suitable for the acquisition of light verb constructions (LVCs) at the end of MF and RK. For the case that RK is empty, we take the verb in LK. We can use it also for the task of subcat frame recognition of content words (incl. LVCs). Furthermore, it supports syntactic and semantic grammar refinement. If there are two constituents in a VF-position and our grammar rules don’t allow us to merge them, the One-consituent-in-VF-constraint tells us that the two constituents must be-long together.
