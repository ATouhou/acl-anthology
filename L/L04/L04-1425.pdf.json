We built a large de\\pendency database for English based on an automatic parse of the BNC, and Reuters (sports and finances section\\s). The Basque attachment decisions are taken based on the occurrence frequency of the translations of the Basque (verb-noun) pairs in the English syntactic database. The results show that wi\\th this simple technique it is possible to transfer syntactic information f\\rom a language like English in order to make PP attachment decisions in another language, in this case Basque.   1 Authors listed in alphabetical order."]},{"title":"Introduction & Motivation","paragraphs":["This work is comprised in a broader endeavor in the context of the MEANING project (Rigau et al., 2002), with the goal of exploring the possibility of porting linguistic knowledge acquired in one language to another. This portability issue could be especially relevant for minority languages with few resources like Basque. Hence the main motivation underlying this experiment is to explore ways to overcome the limitations originated by the lack of resources. If we were able to transfer some of the linguistic knowledge available for English to other languages we would effectively reduce some of the restrictions in these languages (small corpora, lack of hand annotated corpora, etc.).","Cross-language information transfer is not something new, however most of the work done relies on the usage of parallel corpora (Hwa et al 2002), which are difficult to find, specially for lesser studied languages. This is one of the reasons that lead us to consider the usage of comparable corpora, since it is easier to obtain.","Another noteworthy aspect is the pair of languages selected for the experiment: English and Basque. Hypothetically, these two languages are linguistically distant enough to make this work extensible to any other language pair. The following could be a short characterization of the most relevant differences between the two languages:","","??English is a head initial language with an SVO word order, while Basque is a head final free word order language.","??English does not show strong morphology, while Basque does.","??English is not a pro-drop language, and Basque is a three-way pro-drop language.","??English and Basque do not belong to the same typological family.  We chose the PP attachment problem in order to","explore the portability issue. This problem is especially","hard for free word order languages like Basque. Our current partial parser makes attachment decisions based on certain rules and heuristics.","Our experiment has been devised to transfer attachment information coming from English parsed data making the attachment decisions for Basque based on this transferred information. The basic idea behind the system presented here is that verbs show certain preferences on the nouns they appear with. Therefore, if we have a sentence with two verbs, and some noun phrases, one of the verbs will show higher preference for some of the noun phrases while the other verb will show higher preference for the others. We will make one assumption beyond this basic idea, the assumption being that these preferences happen and to some extent can be transferred cross-linguistically (Agirre et al. 2003). Note that this is a preliminary work so at this point we aim to keep the system as simple as possible. Thus, higher co-occurrence of the verb and a noun will be taken to be higher preference of that verb over that noun.","The results obtained suggest that cross language transferring of knowledge acquired from comparable corpora, is worth pursuing. Even employing a very simple machinery, results seem very promising."]},{"title":"Outline of the method","paragraphs":["Our starting point was the Basque parser described in (Aldezabal et al 2000). This parser uses a unification grammar to build syntactic structures. Having a sentence it chunks it into phrases, finds the head of each phrase and then applying certain rules and heuristics tries to link those heads to the different verbs belonging to the sentence.","To test our attachment system, we selected sentences with two verbs, and used the Basque parser to obtain information about the chunks in the sentences. The attachment information provided by the parser is discarded, maintaining only the chunking information. The heads of the noun groups are extracted, and a set of all possible syntactically dependent (verb-noun) pairs are constructed. The goal was to select for each noun which verb should it be attached to from the two possibilities. 47","The method works as follows. We first obtain from the Basque sentence the verbs and surrounding heads. We translate them into English using a bilingual dictionary, and for each (verb-noun) Basque pair we search all possible translation combinations in the dependency database built from an automatically parsed English corpus. Take for example this Basque sentence,  Lendakariak hautezkundeak irabazi zituen botoen %60 lortuz inbersoreen artean. The president won the election obtaining 60% of the votes among the investors. ","The verbs and heads obtained by the Basque parser/chunker are the following: NP-ergative(lendakaria) NP-absolutive(elections) PPabsolutive(boto) PP-distributive(Inbertsore) V1(irabazi) V2(lortu) ","We translate all the nouns and verbs."," NP-ergative(lendakaria): President, chairman (ncsubj) NP-absolutive(elections): poll, election Ppabsolutive(boto): vote,vow PP-distributive(Inbertsore): investor, shareholder V1(irabazi): to win, to earn, to gain V2(lortu): to get, to obtain, to attain","","All possible English noun-verb pairs are created with the corresponding English relation or preposition for each Basque case, for example for lendakari-irabazi vs. lendakari lortu:"," win-President-ncsubj get-President-ncsubj earn-President-ncsubj obtain-President-ncsubj gain-President-ncsubj"]},{"title":"vs.","paragraphs":["attain-President-ncsubj win-President-ncsubj get-President-ncsubj earn-President-ncsubj obtain-President-ncsubj gain-President-ncsubj attain-President-ncsubj ","Note that we only search for the English verb and noun translations occurring in a direct syntactic dependency (moreover, we search for an English syntactic dependency equivalent to the Basque one). We collect and add the frequencies of all translated English pairs for each (verb-noun) Basque pair. In order to select the correct attachment for each noun, the mutual information of the two (verb-noun) pairs are compared. This way we normalize over the amount of translations, and also over the occurrences of the English translations in the target corpus.","","P(any-EVT, any-ENT) MI(BV,BN)= log P(any-EVT)*P(any-ENT)  P(any-EVT, any-ENT) corresponds to the probability of finding any translation of the Basque verb with any translation of the Basque noun in the English corpus. P(any-EVT) corresponds to the probability of finding any translation of the Basque verb in the English corpus, and P(any-ENT) corresponds to the probability of finding any translation of the Basque noun in the English corpus.","A higher Mutual information value (maintaining the same syntactic relation in both languages) is taken as an indicative of a stronger preference between the head and one of the verbs, the one that will be selected.","As mentioned above, we intended to keep the same syntactic relation across both languages when searching. For that, we employed the information provided by the Basque morphological case attached to each noun as an indicative of this relation. There is an equivalence between Basque morphological cases and English prepositions. This equivalence is not one-to-one, thus each Basque case will have several English prepositions as possible translations, and the opposite. Bilingual dictionaries do not contain such information, so we used the equivalence table described in (Lersundi et al 2002). In this equivalence table all possibilities are listed, even low frequency and rare ones.","The RASP parser does not incorporate exhaustive information about multiwords, and therefore we included a heuristic method to search for them. So for example, the Basque verb bilatu is translated as “look up” in English. In “look up in the dictionary”, we would like to have a dependency between “look up” and dictionary. The parser will find that dictionary is a dependent of look, through the preposition in, and up will appear as a particle of look in another relation. The heuristic applied consists of searching for the pair look-dictionary related through the preposition in, and checking that up also appears as a particle of look in the same sentence. Still, certain multiwords need more complex processing. For instance the Basque verb garestitu is a result of an incorporation process and it is translated as “to make more expensive”. At this point we are not treating such multiword translations, and they would return a 0 frequency on the search."]},{"title":"The corpora","paragraphs":["The English corpora are conformed by the BNC (http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk) and the Reuters newswire finances and sports corpus. The English parser used is the RASP dependency parser developed by Carroll and Briscoe (2001). Notice that a dependency parser links the head of the phrases to the verbs in contrast to what constituency parsers do, linking whole phrases to the verbs. This is a relevant feature because it will facilitate the searches.","The information we obtain from the English RASP parser for the following sentence is displayed in Figure1 a); 1 in 500 Londoners are believed to be infected","The first dependency in Figure 1 a) represents the subject syntactic relation between the head believe and the dependent Londoner (ncsubj). Being this a passive sentence RASP also provides information about the internal relation between believe and Londoner, where Londoner is not the subject but the object2","of believe (obj). The second dependency corresponds to the clausal relation between believe as a head and infected, that is, what we believe is that [there is somebody to be infected].The third  2 One believes Londoners (obj) to be infected. 48 provided dependency expresses the subject relation between infected as a head and Londoner as a dependent. The obj value inside that dependency reveals Londoner as the internal object of infected. The fourth dependency represents information about a modification relation. According to the parser 500 is a modifier (ncmod) of Londoners, and this relation materializes through the preposition in.","In order to make efficient searches in the English parsed corpora we created a database for each corpus (BNC, Reuters_sports, Reuters_finances), where each tuple represents a dependency syntactic relation between a verb and a dependent (head of a noun or prepositional phrase). Figure 1b) illustrates the encoding of the example above in our database. For instance take the first dependency in Figures 1 a) and b). The specific syntactic relation between the head and the dependent (ncsubj in this case) is stored in the twelfth field of the tuple. The second and sixth fields maintain information about the head and the dependent respectively (believe and Londoner). The database also stores information relative to the PoS of each words (fifth and tenth fields respectively, V for believe and N for Londoner). This way we can select from all the relations, just those where the first lemma is a verb. Sentential index information (the last three fields, 22, 01#22,A00##22) is encoded in order to relate the parsed sentences to the original text sentences. The fourth and ninth fields store the positional information of the words in the sentence (sixth position in the sentence for believe and fourth for Londoners). This information is currently being used to check that two words conform a multiword or not (as in the “look up” example in the previous section).","All in all, the database contains 47,145,584 syntactic relations from BNC, 1,439,445 from Reuters Sports and 9,858,633 from Reuters Finances. From these relations, 10,447,129 relations are verb-noun dependencies in BNC, 366,805 in Reuters Sports, and 2,547,843 in Reuters Finances."]},{"title":"Design of the experiment","paragraphs":["The Basque corpus used comes from a newspaper and it refers to news from several months of the year 2000 (33.669 sentences) in different domains (culture, sports, finances, politics, etc.). From this corpus we chose sentences having two verbs, where one of the verbs belonged to a list of 12 verbs, which are roughly equivalent to the following: win, loose, increase, decrease, tie, train, play, sign up, run, injure, reduce, classify.","The criteria to select these verbs was their high relation either to sports or to both sports and finances domains. This correlation was estimated by looking at the target sections of the Basque news paper where these verbs appear more frequently. The selection of 7 of these verbs was done in coordination to the other partners in the MEANING project, as described in (Magnini et al. 2004) to be used in several experiments which included Basque, Italian, English, Spanish and Catalan. The domain-related frequencies mentioned where calculated for each of these languages and the selection of 7 verbs corresponds to the top 7 verbs after merging the top lists of these languages. The other 5 verbs belong to the top Basque list for verbs with high relation to the sports domain (to sign up, to run, to injure, to reduce, to classify)3",".","The number of sentences obtained containing two verbs including one of these 12 verbs is 386, where we found 1,278 syntactic relations. Over these 1,278 relations, 400 were manually tagged, which constituted the gold-standard for this task. From these relations 91 occurred within the finances section of the Basque news paper, 190 within the sports section. That is, from 400, 281 belong to either sports or finances sections."]},{"title":"The results","paragraphs":["Table 1 presents the results obtained in terms of precision and coverage.

For the same reason, we would also like to include frequency information in the preposition-postposition equivalence tables. Besides we plan to combine this multilingual system with the heuristics already coded in the Basque parser.","We also plan to extend this work to the acquisition of selectional preferences in the target language, and use it in the source language. Finally, we would like to take the attachment decisions of all the phrases in the sentence at the same time, in order to take the best decision overall."]},{"title":"Acknowlegments","paragraphs":["The authors would like to thank Philip Resnik for his comments and ideas.
