The corpus is one of the results of LUNA project. The description is concentrated on the semantic annotation on the levels of concepts (attribute-value) and predicates (frame sets)."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["In spite of the large interest in semantic role labelling (e.g. (Màrquez et al., 2008)), semantically annotated corpora are still not very frequent. The most well known resource is PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) – a corpus of text annotated with information about basic semantic roles in which predicate-argument relations were added to the syntactic trees of the Penn Treebank. Another example of a corpus annotated with verb frames is FATE (Burchard and Pennacchiott, 2008) consisting of 800 entailment pairs from the RTE-2 (Recognizing Textual Entailment) Challenge test set, annotated with frame and semantic role labels. Another group of resources contain data annotated with specially designed domain specific labels. For example, MEDIA corpus is a domain specific resource containing hotel reservation dialogues (Bonneau-Maynard et al., 2005) (this corpus was used by French LUNA project members) while GENIA corpus (http://www-tsujii.is.s. u-tokyo.ac.jp/GENIA/, (Kim et al., 2008)) contains about 2000 Medline abstracts annotated by term names (biological physical entities and some other important terms included in a specially designed ontology, (Kim et al., 2006)). For a less explored language like Polish such data does not yet exist. The resource we present in this paper is the first semantically annotated corpus of Polish spontaneous speech. The LUNA.PL corpus of dialogues was collected at the Warsaw Transport Authority call centre – the telephone service which provides information on tram and bus connections, schedules, routes, fares etc. The resource was constructed in order to provide data needed for building a dialogue system which would replace call centre staff in answering a subset of customers queries. The corpus was constructed using a combination of rule based programmes and computer-aided manual work carried out in the following steps: • data recording and selection, • manual transcription, • automatic annotation of speakers’ turns,","• automatic morphological analysis followed by manual disambiguation, • automatic annotation of syntactic chunks, • automatic annotation at the level of domain attributes, • manual verification of the attribute-value annotation, • automatic annotation at the predicate level, • manual verification of predicate annotation, • final manual verification on all annotation levels. The corpus consists of 500 directories. Each of them contains seven files: one with the recorded audio signal, one with its transcription and five XML files with annotations on subsequent levels. The collection procedure took place in the spring of 2007, (Marasek and Gubrynowicz, 2008). For the purpose of the project 500 dialogues were selected, converted into texts and annotated with speech related facts using Transcriber, (Barras et al., 1998). In the transcribed speech there are markers representing foreign words, spelling, syllabification, truncation, mispronunciation, non human noises and human noises in the background, pauses, hesitations, and articulatory noises such as breath, laugh, cough, etc. Proper names and acronyms were capitalized. In general, the transcription did not in-clude punctuation marks, with the exception of the question mark which represented rising question intonation. After transcription, the set of dialogues was annotated with morphosyntactic tags. For this task we used the already existing analyzer (Rabiega-Wiśniewska and Rudolf, 2003) and manually disambiguated the results. The most important change in morphological description process was the introduction of special “proper names” POS classes, and the enrichment of the lexicon with a large set of proper names. Morphologically annotated texts of dialogues were segmented into elementary syntactic chunks. The main word groups annotated were: verbal phrases, numeral phrases and several subtypes of nominal phrases. For noun and verb groups the main word was indicated. In the rest of this paper we describe the domain related semantic annotation of the corpus. It consists of two levels – concept level at which around 200 attributes and their values are annotated and predicate level at which 47 frame types are recognized. We describe the domain model accepted, and the statistics over the entire annotated set of dialogues. At the end, the procedure of verification and evaluation of the annotation is presented. One dialogue consists on average of 128 words in 26 turns. Statistics over all levels of annotation are summarized in Table 1 (the annotation schema is presented in more detail in (Rodriguez et al., 2007) and (Mykowiecka et al. 2009))."]},{"title":"2097","paragraphs":["number of types occurrences turns - 13185 word forms 5146 82977 lemmas 2759 - chunks 20 71779 concepts 206 32783 frames 47 5346 Table 1: Corpus annotation statistics (500 dialogues)"]},{"title":"2. Concept level annotation 2.1. Domain model","paragraphs":["The transport domain ontology was defined on the basis of data inspection. Although transport itself is a rather popular and relatively well known area, the types of questions which are asked by call centre customers and their information needs can be best learnt from real life dialogues. The process of domain model creation was incremental. The main part of the concept set was created on the basis of an analysis of 150 dialogues which were already annotated on the morphosyntactic levels. Then, after analyzing more dialogues, the appropriate changes in the model were introduced (Mykowiecka et al., 2008). The resulting ontology consists of 3 main root classes which describe: urban public transport domain, information seeking dialogues and time descriptions. A small fourth class contains some general features important to the domain. Although reusing an existing ontology would be very desirable, no resource appropriate for the task has been found. Unfortunately, this is typical in areas which lay on the borders of many domains – in this case public transport organization, town topology and interpersonal communication. Domain specific resources are too big for the purpose and hard to use, while general ones (like SUMO Upper Ontology, (Pease et al., 2002)) are not precise enough. Thus a new dedicated ontology was built. It is data and applica-tion driven, i.e. concepts were introduced on the basis of real phrases and their possible role in typical information seeking calls was taken into account. The most important decisions that had to be made during the building of the annotation schema, concerned the level of detail represented and concept limits. Level of detail The defined ontology contains about two hundred concepts. It consists of the topology of classes and properties of class instances. As in LUNA project the annotation schema was flat, i.e. only one attribute-value pair can be assigned to any word sequence, we introduced concepts which represent both the objects themselves and their role within the dialogue. Thus, concepts included in the ontology were not limited to simple ones, but some complex concepts were also defined. For example, the Transport part of the ontology contains concepts representing places in town and locations in relation to these places. The concepts defined in the PLACE hierarchy are assigned only to those phrases representing places for which their specific role in the context cannot be given. In the case where places are a location of something, they are marked as LOCATION_xxx (xxx stands for all subvariants), when they are the beginning or ending of some trip or route, they are represented as SOURCE_xxx or GOAL_xxx. In the ontology, the property isSource which characterizes objects of type TRIP can take objects of type LOCATION as its value (to keep our ontology close to the concept set, we preserved SOURCE_xxx types in the ontology). Annotation scope One of the main problems which we encountered at the concept annotation stage, was the selection of concept limits, i.e. deciding which words should be labelled with a particular concept name. Very often it seems appropriate for a concept to be attributed to the entire phrase expressing the idea. In our initial solution many concepts, especially questions, were assigned to several words, sometimes entire utterances. This type of annotation turned out to be incompatible with frame level annotation, so we divided concepts that included verbs into smaller parts. The most important (frequent) classes of the ontology are enumerated in Table 2. Figure 1 presents an annotation example as it is included within the corpus. 2.2. Annotation process Labels with concept names were assigned automatically through the use of a specially designed rule-based program, (Mykowiecka et al., 2008). Restrictions included within the rules helped to assign concepts to phrases unambiguously. For example, morphological information was used to differentiate two usages of the phrase like na Banacha (Banacha could be either genitive or locative form in this context) as meaning either ‘on Banacha (locative) street’ (LOCA-TION_STR) or ‘to Banacha (genitive) street’ (GOAL_STR). The sequence około siedemnastej ‘around 5 pm’ was annotated as AROUND_HOUR – the alternative meaning ‘around 17th minute’ is highly unlikely. Cases which were not disambiguated properly by rules were corrected manually. For example, numbers be-tween 1 and 36 could be recognized as: tram number (TRAM), part of a tram/bus number (NUM_BUS_PART, NUM_TRAM_PART), stop number1","(STOP_NUMB), street number (STREET_NUMB), minutes in time description (AT_HOUR_MINPART) as well as duration of the ride on public transport (RIDE_DURATION) and other time span (TIME_SPAN). Another example of regular polysemy are street/stop names. As most of the stop names come from street names, concepts assigned automatically are not always appropriate. These became the subjects of manual correction. Analysing spoken language we encountered many typical irregularities, e.g.:","• change of order, e.g. trzynasta godzina, godzina trzynasta ‘1 pm’. For this and similar phrases separate rules reflecting all possible orders were defined. In many other cases the problem was made manageable through the annotation of shorter text fragments. 1 Stop names consist of proper names (e.g. street name, build-","ing name) and the numbers 01, 02 etc."]},{"title":"2098","paragraphs":["• inflectional errors, e.g. in przy Metro Politechnika ‘at/near Politechnika metro station’ the noun phrase is in nominative instead of locative (should be: przy Metrze Politechnika). As this turned out to be a frequent mistake we did not put restrictions on case in prepositional phrases, which could not be ambiguous. So this phrase is recognized by a rule which requires the preposition przy followed by a stop name (includ-ing metro station names) regardless of its case.","• elliptical phrases, e.g. na Krakowskim2","instead of na Krakowskim Przedmieściu or siedem po (‘seven past’ unknown hour). For phrases which cannot be disambiguated without knowing textual or situational context and unfinished phrases, we introduced special concepts, e.g. for dalej (that means either ‘futher, long distance away’ or ‘then, afterwards’) – LOC_TIME_REL. If the meaning of an elliptical phrase was unambiguous, we introduced the appropriate concept. For unfinished phrases, we introduced special concepts, e.g. siedem po is annotated as AT_HOUR_MINPART instead of AT_HOUR as there is no information about the hour itself.","• interjections, e.g. przystanek w stron\\be tegoŻoliborza ‘bus stop to – you know – Żoliborz’, około godziny, nie wiem, gdzieś ósmej rano ‘at around – I don’t know – eight am’. In such situations concepts were recognized only if we created rules for each case. It was also possible to put optional elements into the rules but with great caution. Otherwise we would obtain concepts with some elements that do not belong to the very phrase.","• unfinished utterances, which may appear when one speaker breaks off in the middle of a sentence or is interrupted by another speaker. For such cases we introduced special concepts (with PART in concept name) to describe these pieces of information: NUM_BUS_PART, NUM_TRAM_PART, AT_HOUR_PART and AT_HOUR_MINPART.","• domain related phrases which appear in a context not represented within the domain model (it would probably be better to not annotate them at all), e.g. Czy s \\ba[ACTION Be] na tych słupkach te rozkłady [TIMETABLE General] nowe? ‘Are there new timetables on those poles?’. The general distribution of concepts in the corpus is given in Table 3 while Table 4 contains numbers of concepts with different numbers of values.","2","Krakowskie Przedmieście is a name of the street, often used in abridged form Krakowskie. Because in Warsaw there exists a similar street name Krakowska, that has the same lemma in our dictionary of proper names but differs in gender, the appropriate rule had to depend not only on lemma but also on the gender of a form (or alternatively had to list all case forms). vis-a-vis Hotelu Polonia jest autobus 118 w kierunku vis-as Hotel Polonia there is bus 118 in the direction tak / yes Alei Niepodległości / Niepodległości Alley i on również dojeżdża bezpośrednio do ulicy Spartańskiej and it also goes directly to Spartańska street <concept id=\"40\" span=\"word_100..word_102\" attribute=","\"LOCATION_BLD\" value=\"OPPSIDE Hotel Polonia\" /> <concept id=\"41\" span=\"word_103\" attribute=\"Action\"","value=\"ToBe\" /> <concept id=\"42\" span=\"word_104..word_106\"","attribute=\"BUS\" value=\"118\" /> <concept id=\"43\" span=\"word_109\" attribute=\"REACTION\"","value=\"Confirmation\" /> <concept id=\"44\" span=\"word_110..word_111\" attribute=","\"GOAL_DIRECTION_STR\" value=\"Aleja Niepodległości\"/> <concept id=\"45\" span=\"word_113\" attribute=","\"MEANS_OF_TRANSPORT\" value=\"General\" /> <concept id=\"46\" span=\"word_115\" attribute=\"Action\"","value=\"Approach\" /> <concept id=\"47\" span=\"word_116\" attribute=","\"CONNECTION_Q\" value=\"Direct\" /> <concept id=\"48\" span=\"word_117..word_119\"","attribute=\"GOAL_STR\" value=\"Spartańska\" /> Figure 1: Attribute level annotation example"]},{"title":"3. Predicate level annotation 3.1. Frames definitions","paragraphs":["The next level of annotation represents the predicate– argument structure. Our description consists in linking a verb with its compliments in one frame and is based on the FrameNet proposal, (Baker et al., (1998)). This annotation is based on the previous one, i.e. frame slots can only be filled by concepts. A verb constitutes a frame set which is filled by frame elements defined by single concepts or a sequences of concepts. This makes annotation easier, but sometimes leads to data loss as in the following example: tam do na do Carrefoura ‘there to for to Carrefour’ in which two concepts LOCATION_REL (tam) and GOAL_BLD (do Carrefoura), which could be annotated as representing frame slot GOAL are separated by ‘do na’). At the first step of predicate annotation, 84 most frequent verbs have been described with one to six (for być ‘to be’ and mieć ‘to have’) frames. Then, frame proposals were automatically generated and manually disambiguated. In the last step of annotation we added frame descriptions for less frequent verbs as well as some new frame definitions (domain related usage of 140 verbs is described). In total, 47 frames have been defined. In the set of frames there are three well formed thematic groups. The main one is built from verbs of movement and consists of 15 frames. Two other frame groups are formed from verbs describing places (6 frames) and verbs related to recognition/statement (5 frames). Frames which are represented in dialogues by the highest number of verb lexemes are: MOTION built from 17 verbs, SELF_MOTION represented by 16 verbs, and ARRIVING – 15 verbs. Most of the frames are the same as defined in the English FrameNet, (Fillmore et al., 2003). In many frames new"]},{"title":"2099","paragraphs":["class path occurrences TRANSPORT MEANS_OF_TRANSP 519 LOCATION > LOCATION_ABS 1382 > LOCATION_REL 1263 PLACE 1579 TRANSP_LINE_FEAT> DEPARTURE 192 TRIP_FEATURE > GOAL 1777 > GOAL_STP 276 > GOAL_STR 635 > SOURCE 1228 > SOURCE_STP 277 > SOURCE_STR 400 > PATH 377 > CONNECTION_Q 256 TRANSPORT DIALOGUE CONV_FORM 1657 REACTION 5046 QUESTION > Q_CONF (confirmation) 1040 > Q_WHAT_PLACE 84 > Q_WHAT_TIME 135 > Q_WHERE 224 TIME TIME_POINT > TIME_POINT_ABS 1144 > TIME_POINT_REL 448 Table 2: Most frequently occurring concepts","nb % of concepts occurrences % of all >=500 12 6.03 21800 66.50 100-499 32 16.08 7301 22.27 50-99 28 14.07 1903 5.80 10-49 65 32.66 1569 4.79 0-9 62 31.16 210 0.64 Σ 199 32783 Table 3: Concepts’ frequencies frame elements have been introduced, e.g. in the START frame, which was used for the description of the verb zaczynać si\\be(‘start ’ in ‘a street starts from’) instead of the element EVENT we chose THEME. Some completely new frames were also defined, e.g. ENTITLED frame which describes fare discounts and GET frame created to present finding one’s way. For describing verb frames, we used the concepts defined in the previous level of annotation. Sometimes this resulted concepts with concept concept different # of values types occurrences values above 100 12 6459 2264 from 51 to 100 7 8328 492 from 11 to 50 45 4958 979 up to 10 136 13038 486 Table 4: The overall distribution of concepts’ values in an unexpected context for a given verb, as in the phrase dziecko bezpłatnie jeździ autobusami ‘a child goes by bus for free’, which gives us information about fare regulation not trip description. In such cases we chose the best fitting frame to the utterance, in the presented example – ENTITLED: BENEFICIARY, PRIVILEGE, CIRCUMSTANCES. The same set of frame elements can be found in the description of verbs indicating fare discounts, e.g. studenci mog \\ba korzystać z 50% zniżki na bilety ‘students may use 50% discounts on tickets’. The secondary meaning of a given verb lead us also to the frame change during the last stage of annotation. For example phrases built by a verb interesować ‘to interest’ were first annotated with a frame INTEREST. The usage of that verb points out an aspect of getting a piece of information (e.g. verbs ‘to ask’, ‘to learn’, ‘to find out’). Thus, we changed the frame description of the verb interesować to the frame TOPIC. In Polish there are also predicates represented by two words, frequently they are constructed by an auxilliary verb być ‘to be’ or mieć ‘to have’ and a predicative noun or adjective, e.g. mieć przystanek (‘to have a stop’ meaning ‘to stop’), być czynnym (‘to be operational’ meaning ‘to be open’) or mieć pytanie (‘to have a question’ meaning ‘to ask’). Descriptions of complex predicates depended on their occurrence in text: if predicate parts are continuous, then the whole predicate is treated as the head of a predicate set, e.g. mieć pytanie constitutes frame TOPIC, and być czynnym – BEING_OPERATIONAL. In the HALT frame describing the phrase mieć przystanek we introduced POSI-TION for representing przystanek ‘a stop’, as these words were frequently separated by others. Fillmore’s frames cannot fully reflect the complexity of Polish prefixal verbs. However, from the other point of view they give the opportunity for generalizing several verbs. For example, we represented jechać ‘to go’ as RIDE_VEHICLE or SELF_MOTION, dojechać ‘to arrive’ – ARRIVING, odjechać ‘to depart’ – DEPARTING, podjechać ‘to drive up’ – MOTION, pojechać ‘to go’ – MOTION, przejechać ‘to pass’ – MOTION or TRAVERSING, wjechać ‘to drive in’ – ARRIVING, wyjechać ‘to go away’ – DEPARTING, zjechać ‘to turn aside’ as MOTION_DIRECTIONAL. 3.2. Annotation related problems Frame annotation of transcribed speech is not easy. The most significant problems encountered were polysemy and frame selection. Moreover, we had to address problems of metonymy and discontinuities. Regular polysemy could rarely be resolved automatically, – due to the lack of context, most cases had to be decided on manually, e.g. jechać can be represented by the frame RIDE_VEHICLE – if someone goes by bus or tram, or SELF_MOTION if the verb describes bus or tram motions. The verb być ‘to be’ gives a good example of potential problems with frame selection. It was especially difficult to decide which frame: EXISTENCE or APPEARANCE should be chosen, as in examples A bezpośredniego poł \\baczenia niestety nie b\\bedzie‘unfortunately there will be no direct connection’ and B ile to jest przystanków ‘how many stops is it’. We analysed the usage of the verb być in different contexts, and during the annotation process we followed two"]},{"title":"2100","paragraphs":["rules: an EXISTENCE frame was chosen when a predicate built a structure ‘It is (not) X’ (It is ENTITY), as in example A; a predicate of an APPEARANCE frame has two arguments and the structure ‘X is Y’ (PHENOMENON is CHARACTER-IZATION), presented in example B. Sometimes two frames could be assigned to the text but one frame can represent more information than another, e.g. for czy eskaemk \\ba z Wesołej do Warszawy emeryci jeżdż \\ba za darmo ‘do seniors go by (eskaemka) train from Wesoła to Warszawa without paying?’ the frame ENTITLED could be used, but more elements would be represented if the frame RIDE_VEHICLE was chosen. Metonymy is present in the example 23:12 jest tylko do przystanku Młynarska ‘23:12 is only to Młynarska stop’. The time description refers to the bus which departs at that moment; but as it was not annotated as such, it cannot be used as a filler of the THEME slot. Discontinuous phrases required some changes in description or leaving part of information unannotated, e.g. the phrase przejazdy ma bezpłatne ‘rides have for free’ is annotated as the ENTITLED frame. If the nominal phrase were continuous, przejazdy bezpłatne, it would be annotated as a PRIVILEGE slot. However, in the cited order the word przejazdy was not annotated at all. <Set id=\"5\" subset=\"1\" span=\"word_103\" frame= \"EXISTENCE\" head=\"być\"> <Frame fe=\"1\" span=\"word_104..word_106\" concept_id=\"42\" name=\"ENTITY\" /> </Set> <Set id=\"6\" subset=\"1\" span=\"word_115\" frame= \"ARRIVING\" head=\"dojeżdżać\"> <Frame fe=\"1\" span=\"word_113\" concept_id=\"45\" name=\"THEME\" /> <Frame fe=\"2\" span=\"word_116\" concept_id=\"47\" name=\"MANNER\" /> <Frame fe=\"3\" span=\"word_117..word_119\" concept_id=\"48\" name=\"GOAL\" /> </Set> Figure 2: Predicate level annotation example Figure 2 shows the frame level annotation of the same fragment which was presented in Figure 1.
