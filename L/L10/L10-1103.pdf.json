In real text, this is often a difficult decision because identity is never adequately defined, leading to contradictory treatment of cases in previous work. This paper introduces the concept of ‘near-identity’, a middle ground category between identity and non-identity, to handle such cases systematically. We present a typology of Near-Identity Relations (NIDENT) that includes fifteen types—grouped under four main families—that capture a wide range of ways in which (near-)coreference relations hold between discourse entities. We validate the theoretical model by annotating a small sample of real data and showing that inter-annotator agreement is high enough for stability (K= 0.58, and up to K= 0.65 and K= 0.84 when leaving out one and two outliers, respectively). This work enables subsequent creation of the first internally consistent language resource of this type through larger annotation efforts."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["The Coreference task requires humans or systems to group together all expressions (typically, NPs) that refer to ‘the same thing.’ Corpora built in the past by manual annotation include MUC (Hirschman and Chinchor, 1997), ACE (Doddington et al., 2004), OntoNotes (Pradhan et al., 2007), ARRAU (Poesio and Artstein, 2008), AnCora (Recasens and Martı́, 2009), PDT (Kučová and Hajičová, 2004), etc. Unfortunately, determining coreference is a highly complex task (Versley, 2008; Poesio and Artstein, 2005), and even these corpora differ on some of the same examples. Compare the two annotations for (1) and (2), where coreferent NPs are printed in italics, and (a) and (b) correspond to the ACE and OntoNotes corpora, respectively.","(1) a.

Last night in Tel Aviv, Jews attacked a restaurant that employs Palestinians “ we want war,” the crowd chanted. The principal complexity arises when two references denote ‘almost’ the same thing, either for a single individual (1) or across two groups (2). Such cases are indicative that the binary distinction between coreference (identity) and non-coreference (non-identity) is too limited and fails to account for all the phenomena observed in real data. In-stead, coreference relations are better regarded as a continuum with a middle zone of near-identity relations. Relations of partial, but not total, identity are the core of the typology presented in this paper. Near-identity relations resemble ‘bridging anaphora’ (Clark, 1975) in that they are indirect relations that require the reader to draw an inference, but they differ from typical bridging (Krasavina and Chiarcos, 2007; Nedoluzhko et al., 2009) in that they cannot be said to be relations other than identity. For instance, two NPs that stand in a part-whole semantic relationship can refer to two objects which are related but are not identical, as one is a part of the other —like the room and the ceiling (3-a)—, in which case we talk of a bridging relation; but it is also possible for them to refer to nearly the same entity (3-b), in which case we must talk of a near-identity relation: although the United States in principle denotes the entire US government and the White House is restricted to denoting the US president (via metonymy), the discourse in (3-b) employs them as ‘almost’ coreferent.","(3) a. I looked into the room. The ceiling was very high.","b. The United States has officially restored diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia . . . The White House said the United States will provide 45 million dollars in food aid to Yugoslavia. Further evidence for the need of a middle ground relation between identity and non-identity is provided by the fact that Krasavina and Chiarcos (2007) and Nedoluzhko et al. (2009) identify as a source of inter-annotator disagreement cases that can be interpreted as coreference and bridging. To construct a theoretical model, and before being able to create a corpus, it is necessary to establish how many and what types of near-identity relations exist. The aim of the paper is twofold: (i) to present a typology of coreference relations that includes identity, non-identity, and near-identity"]},{"title":"149","paragraphs":["relations; and (ii) to validate the theoretical model by annotating a small sample of real data and showing that inter-annotator agreement is high enough for stability.

The Problem of Identity","paragraphs":["In discourse, we introduce entities or events into a ‘reference space’ or discourse model by using referring expressions, such as he, John, the event, then, etc. These expressions refer to Discourse Entities (DEs), which are mental representations existing in our minds (Karttunen, 1976; Webber, 1979). Though they often correlate with entities and events in the external world, they need not. It is upon DEs, not the external referring expressions, that coreference operates, unlike typical definitions of coreference in the NLP literature that talk about real-world entities (Finkel and Manning, 2008; Ng, 2009). To identify a DE, the speaker provides one or more of its attributes, the most basic one being the name of the concept, entity, or event. When DEs are mentioned multiple times throughout a discourse, new attributes might be introduced, old attributes might be omitted or changed, etc. The speaker states a series of attributes that the hearer is able to recognize or know as (supposedly) true of the DE (at that time), enough to pick it out uniquely. The problem of coreference is determining when expressions in a discourse refer to the ‘same’ DE, and when they introduce a new (albeit possibly very closely related) one. The different possible ways of coreferring pertain to different identity criteria. Since DEs are anchored in discourse, so is coreference. We cannot, for instance, make a general statement that Barack Obama and Obama are coreferent without analyzing the discourse in which they appear, i.e., the DEs they refer to. Compare (4-a) and (4-b).","(4) a. The Clinton campaign is circulating a fake photo of Barack Obama in Muslim clothes to damage his reputation. In the photo, Obama wears a long sari-like garment.","b. The Clinton campaign is circulating a fake photo of Barack Obama in Muslim clothes to damage his reputation, but Obama never wore Muslim clothes. The two italicized expressions in (4-a) corefer as they both refer to the DE corresponding to Barack Obama as represented in a specific photo. The very same expressions in (4-b), however, stand in a more complex relation: whereas the first NP refers to a photo representation of Barack Obama, the second NP refers to the actual person of Barack Obama. In this regard, then, they are not identical, yet they are in the sense that the former stands for the latter. Notice that we could even replace Obama for he in (4-b). This dilemma between identity and non-identity is the reason why the concept of ‘near-identity’ (akin to Geach’s (1967) ‘relative identity’) needs to enter the field of coreference resolution. Currently, automatic coreference resolution systems make no distinction between (4-a) and (4-b), which can lead to erroneous or contradictory conclusions. A user searching for information about Barack Obama would learn from an information extraction system that Obama wears a long sari-like garment and that he never wore Muslim clothes. Another important dimension that causes a conflict between identity and non-identity is time. The attributes of an entity change through time, thus the problems with (1). Similarly, the different roles an entity can play make it hard to analyze a discourse in terms of only coreference or non-coreference. In (5),1","the reader is forced to identify the artist and the man separately; identifying the one or the other with the central person would result in an incoherent discourse.","(5) You cannot read Cyril Connolly for very long without wanting to acquire —and then developing— a relationship with the personality of the man himself. [. . . ] With Connolly there is a marked difference and the difference is that the artist and the man are so conjoined and intermingled that you cannot savour the one without the other and vice versa. The shortcomings of a coreference definition grounded on real-world reference and on a binary conception of identity became evident when annotating the AnCora corpus with coreference information (Recasens and Martı́, 2009) as well as when training coreference resolution systems on the OntoNotes and ACE corpora (Doddington et al., 2004; Pradhan et al., 2007). This led us to develop the NIDENT typology that we present in the next section."]},{"title":"3. A Typology of (Near-)Identity Relations","paragraphs":["This section presents NIDENT, a typology of coreference relations that contemplates relations of partial, but not total, identity by including near-identity relations. Table 1 gives a schematic summary. We followed a bottom-up approach consisting in first extracting problematic coreference relations2","from real data, and then analyzing them and defining a set of coreference types that accounted for the observed differences.","1. Non-Identity. The two NPs point to two different DEs. Even if they share any feature, they are not ‘the same thing.’ President Samaranch sent a letter to Sydney in which he asked for information. A similar missive has also been received by all the candidate cities to host the Olympic Games of 1996.","2. Identity. The two NPs point to the same DE (i.e., they have the same set of attributes, as far as one can tell). They are (almost certainly) ‘the same thing.’ 1 Example taken from William Boyd’s Bamboo (2005). 2 By problematic we mean those cases that involved disagree-","ments between the annotators or that could be argued either way","—coreferent or non-coreferent— according to the authors."]},{"title":"150","paragraphs":["Relation Type Subtype","1.

It began when a Hasidic Jewish family bought one of the town’s two meat-packing plants 13 years ago. First they brought in other Hasidic Jews, then Mexicans, Palestinians, Ukrainians. Sometimes, the second NP provides more information about the DE, or selects a subset of characteristics of the DE and ignores the rest. If this introduces no opposition or contradiction between the new attributes and the ones already known, then the new NP refers to the same DE. While the Cubans from Miami and Cuba fight for the custody of little Elián González, US companies do not take their eyes off the juicy market that the Caribbean pearl has become. Referring to Cuba as a pearl stresses what accounts for the interest of US companies in the island while leaving out Cuba’s poverty. But we can still talk of Identity as there is no aim to draw any opposition.","3. Near-Identity. If two NPs are neither Identical nor Non-Identical, they are partially the same in that they share most of the important characteristics, but differ in at least one crucial dimension. According to the dimension of contradiction or opposition, the following types and subtypes can be distinguished.","3.A Name metonymy. Since many entities in the world are complex, multifaceted, it is possible to refer to the same entity via different facets. For example, a company produces a product, is headquartered in a location, has a president, etc. Under Name metonymy, a proper noun (a name) appears first, and a subsequent NP refers to some facet of the DE. Since the specific facets available depend on the type of entity under consideration, there are a great many possibilities. Nonetheless, certain facets occur frequently enough that we create specially named subtypes for them. All the remainder we group as the OTHER category (3.A.f). The subtypes are the following.","3.A.a. ROLE. A specific role or function performed by a human, animal or object, is distinguished from their other facets.","“Your father was the greatest” commented an","anonymous old lady while she was shaking","Alessandro’s hand —Gassman’s best known","son. “I will miss the actor, but I will be lack-","ing my father especially,” he said. The actor and father pertain to two different roles of the same individual Gassman. The opposition here pertains to the typical activities of Gassman: actor-like actions or father-like ones. Presumably, they are not the same, given the opposition expressed in the citation.","3.A.b. LOCATION. As a metaconcept, the name of a location can be used indiscriminately to describe facet(s) such as the physical place, the place associated with a (political) organization, the population living in that location, the ruling government, an affiliated organization, an event celebrated at that location, etc.","The Jordan authorities arrested, on arriving","in Iraq, an Italian pilot who violated the air","embargo to this country. LOCATION can co-occur with PART·WHOLE (3.B.a). Metonymy wins over meronymy, so 3.A.b is preferred when they co-occur.","3.A.c. ORGANIZATION. As a metaconcept, the name of a company or other social organization can be used indiscriminately to describe facet(s) such as the legal organization itself, the facility that houses the organization or one of its branches, the company shares, a product manufactured by the company, etc.","The strategy has been a popular one for Mc-","Donalds . . . It’s a very wise move on for them","because if they would have only just original","McDonalds, I don’t think they would have","done so great. This type is chosen if it co-occurs with 3.B.a."]},{"title":"151","paragraphs":["3.A.d. INFORMATIONAL REALIZATION. A DE corresponding to an informational object (e.g., story, law, review, etc.) can be split according to the format in which the information is presented or manifested (e.g., book, movie, speech, etc.). The content, however, is shared by all the DEs.","She hasn’t seen Gone with the Wind, but","she’s read it. The two DEs pertain to a film and a book, which are not identical, though their content —the story— is.","3.A.e. REPRESENTATION. One NP is a representation of the other —as in a picture or a starring of a person, or a toy replica of a real object. The representation can also be of a more abstract kind, like one’s mental conceptualization of an object. One NP corresponds to the thing represented; the other, to the element that represents it.","We stand staring at two paintings of Queen","Elizabeth. In the one on the left, she is","dressed as Empress of India. In the one on","the right, she is dressed in an elegant blue","gown. Each painted queen is a different DE even though they are all the same queen: they can coexist, and each one is dressed differently.","3.A.f. OTHER. Since metonymic readings are potentially open-ended and can be invented dynamically, this subtype captures any other case.","Chevrolet is a brand of automobile produced","by General Motors Company. It is feminine","because of its sound.","3.B Meronymy. A meronym (a constituent part or a member of a composite entity) is used to refer to the whole or set (Chaffin et al., 1988).","3.B.a. PART·WHOLE. One NP mentions a part to refer to the whole expressed by the other NP. The two NPs can be interpreted as referring to nearly the same DE because one expresses a functionally very relevant part of the whole it belongs to. The whole is composed of different, functionally distinct, parts (e.g., the engine and the car), organized into some kind of patterned organization or structure.","Bangladesh Prime Minister Hasina and Pres-","ident Clinton expressed the hope that this","trend will continue . . . Both the US govern-","ment and American businesses welcomed the","willingness of Bangladesh. Here President Clinton is seen as a function-ing part of the entire US government. Since the president acts as the spokesperson of the government, they are often used indistinctively as near-identical. But clearly, there are other, quite different, parts in the government.","3.B.b. STUFF·OBJECT. One NP expresses the constituent material of the other NP. Unlike components, the stuff of which a thing is made cannot be separated from the object. The City Council approved legislation prohibiting selling alcoholic drinks during night hours . . . Bars not officially categorized as bars will not be allowed to sell alcohol. Given that the most relevant component of alcoholic drinks is alcohol, this can be used to refer to the drinks. Bars do not sell alcohol by itself, but alcoholic drinks.","3.B.c. SET·SET. The two NPs denote two largely overlapping sets. Since each set is not clearly bounded, the reader intuitively interprets the two sets as near-identical even though they might not correspond to exactly the same collection of individuals. Unlike 3.B.a, the collection consists of repeated, closely similar, members, and the members are not required to perform a particular function distinct from one another. This is the preferred type when-ever a strict identity relation between the two plural NPs is dubious (no total overlapping).","Last night in Tel Aviv, Jews attacked a restau-","rant that employs Palestinians “ we want","war,” the crowd chanted. For the purposes of the discourse, the three NPs Jews, we and the crowd can be considered to refer to the same set, although not every Jew that attacked the restaurant might have chanted “we want war,” or one of the in-dividuals who chanted “we want war” might not have been Jewish. SET·SET shows an interesting pattern when the first NP denotes a well-established (often named) set and the second NP denotes the sum of its members.","The administration of the European","Union has demonstrated neither an ex-","cellent foresight capacity nor a capacity","of resolution . . . It has not taken into ac-","count the characteristics of the countries","in the EU, which have large differences","in their systems of medical practice. The second NP refers to the EU via the collection of its members, although theoretically we know that the organization is greater than the sum of the parts (since the EU has its own governing authorities, its own resources, its own agenda, etc.).","3.C Class. The two NPs share the type (is-a relationship), but they stand in a different position in the categorical hierarchy so that one can be viewed as more general or specific to the other.","3.C.a. MORE SPECIFIC. The second NP expresses a class more specific than that expressed by the first NP so that the predication affects only a subset of the class."]},{"title":"152","paragraphs":["It shows that attackers, like the two who","killed 13 people at Columbine High School","last year in Colorado, come from a variety","of family and ethnic backgrounds.","3.C.b. MORE GENERAL. Similar to 3.C.a but in the opposite direction: The second NP goes one level up in the conceptualization hierarchy by expressing a more general class.","Diego looked for information about his char-","acter in the novel forgetting that Saramago","does not usually describe them. The introduction of Diego’s character allows the text to generalize and talk about Saramago’s characters as a class, but his character is only one of them. If it is hard to decide between 3.C.a and 3.C.b, then 3.B.c is probably the solution.","3.D Spatio-temporal function. The DE is split based on different values for its spatial or temporal characteristics: it is the ‘same’ entity or event but realized in another location or time. One can imagine a function or box (the superconcept of the DE) to which a place/time argument is provided (by clicking a place and/or a time), obtain-ing a different instance of the DE in each case.","Place Time ↓ X ↓","X1, X2, . . . Often, the sentence includes a temporal or locative phrase (e.g., in 1999, old, etc.) that provides the argument. This function assumes 3.C, but 3.D is preferred since it is more specific. We differ-entiate the following four subtypes.","3.D.a. PLACE. The same DE is instantiated in different physical locations, each time resulting in a different DE due to the change in the spatial feature. It is possible for them to coexist but not in the same place.","New York’s New Year’s Eve is one of the","most widely attended parties in the world",". . . Celebrating it in the Southern Hemisphere","is always memorable, especially for those of","us in the Northern Hemisphere. Although the two NPs refer to the same celebration, New Year, the celebration in New York is clearly not the same as the celebration in the Southern Hemisphere.","3.D.b. TIME. Similar to 3.D.a but the split into different DEs is due to a change of the temporal value. It sees a physical object as a function from time to a portion of space, a slice of the object’s history. Thus, it is not possible for the temporally-different DEs to coexist.","On homecoming night Postville feels like","Hometown, USA, but a look around this","town of 2,000 shows it’s become a miniature","Ellis Island . . . For those who prefer the old","Postville, Mayor John Hyman has a simple","answer.","3.D.c. NUMERICAL FUNCTION. The two NPs refer to the same function (e.g., price, age, rate, etc.) but have different numerical value due to a change in time or a change in space. Although 3.D.a or 3.D.b might apply, 3.D.c is more specific.","At 8, the temperature rose to 99o",". This morn-","ing it was 85o",". The two DEs differ in that the value of the first is 99 degrees while the value of the second is 85 degrees, but they are near-identical in that they refer to the same temperature function.","3.D.d. ROLE FUNCTION. The two NPs refer to the same role (e.g., president, director, etc.) but is filled by a different person due to a change in time or space. Although 3.D.a or 3.D.b might apply, 3.D.d is more specific.","In France, the president is elected for a term","of seven years, while in the United States he","is elected for a term of four years. The two DEs differ in that the value of the first is the president of France (e.g., Sarkozy) while the value of the second is the president of the US (e.g., Obama), but they are near-identical in that they refer to the same role.

Method Participants Six paid subjects participated in the study: four undergraduate students and two authors of this paper. Although the undergraduates were not linguistics students, they were familiar with annotation tasks requiring semantic awareness, but had not worked on coreference before. Materials A total of 60 text excerpts were selected from three electronic corpora —ACE (Doddington et al., 2004), OntoNotes (Pradhan et al., 2007) and AnCora (Recasens and Martı́, 2009)— as well as from the Web, a television show, and real conversation. The excerpts were divided in three rounds of 20, each including examples of the different identity types in different proportions so that annotators could not reason by elimination or the like. To the same effect, each round varied the proportions (see Table 2), yet the largest number of examples always was Near-Identity, as we were mainly interested in evaluating to what extent coders discriminated among the fine-grained subtypes."]},{"title":"153","paragraphs":["Round Non-Identity Identity Near-Identity First 4% 40% 56% Second 8% 28% 64% Third 7% 12% 81% Table 2: Proportion of types in the stability study.

In each excerpt, two or more NPs were marked with square brackets and were given a subscript ID number. Apart from the set of 20 excerpts, annotators were given an answer sheet where all the possible combinatorial pairs between the marked NPs were listed. See a sample item from the annotation task in Figure 1. The first 20 excerpts included 78 pairs to be analyzed; the second, 53, and the third, 43.3 Procedure The task required coders to read the annotation guidelines and classify the selected pairs of NPs in each excerpt according to the (near-)identity relation(s) that obtained between them by filling in the answer sheet. They had to assign one or more, but at least one, class to each pair of NPs, indicating the corresponding type and subtype identifiers. They were asked to specify all the possible (sub)types for underspecified pronouns and genuinely ambiguous NPs that accepted multiple interpretations, and to make a note of comments, doubts or remarks they had. The three groups of 20 excerpts were annotated in three separate rounds, spread out over a span of four weeks. In each round, a different version of the annotation guidelines was used, since the typology underwent substantial revision —in a decreasing manner— after completing each round. The typology presented in Section 3. corresponds to the final version that was used in the last round. 4.2. Results and Discussion Inter-coder agreement was measured with Fleiss’s kappa (Fleiss, 1981), computed with the R package irr, version 0.82 (Gamer et al., 2009). Statistical significance was tested with a kappa z-test provided by the same package. Kappa calculates the degree of agreement in classification over that which would be expected by chance and its values range between -1 and 1, where 1 signifies perfect agreement, 0 signifies no difference from chance agreement, and negative values signify that agreement is weaker than expected by chance. Typically, a kappa value of at least 0.60 is required. For the cases in which a coder gave multiple 3","We address the reader to Recasens et al. (in prep) for the entire collection of texts as they make evident the difficulty of the task. We are happy to send it to interested requesters. classes as answer, the one showing the highest agreement was used for computing kappa. The first round of 20 texts, which served as a practice round, only obtained K= 0.32. More importantly, it revealed serious shortcomings of the first version of the typology. In this regard, the comments and notes included by the coders in the answer sheet were very helpful. Cases for which four —or even five— different types were suggested, especially those that included both IDENTITY and NON-IDENTITY answers, manifested the difficulty and subjectivity of the task. Some cases could be addressed by including an additional type or restricting the scope of an existing one. Second, multiple answers given by the same annotator (the highest number of types being three) were in general indicative that the definitions provided in the guidelines were not specific enough and more criteria had to be included to choose between the different types. In some cases, how-ever, there were problems of overlapping, i.e., two types were equally valid for the same relation, and we decided to merge them. Finally, broad types without identifying force were removed. As a result of the major revision of the guidelines after the first round, the agreement of the second set of 20 texts reached K= 0.54. In contrast with the previous round, the answers were not so spread over different types: a larger number of pairs obtained total agreement, and low disagreements were concentrated in a few types. To address this, a solution was found in setting clear preferences in the guidelines for cases when it was possible for two types to co-occur with no contradiction, like LOCATION and PART·WHOLE. A large number of isolated (5-to-1) answers made us consider the possible presence of outliers, and we detected two. If agreement was computed between the other five coders, we obtained a considerable improvement resulting in K= 0.63; between the other four coders, K= 0.71. The third and final round obtained a further improvement in agreement: K= 0.58, and up to K= 0.65 and K= 0.84 leaving out the one and two outliers, respectively. Table 3 details the per-class and overall K of this last round. The changes introduced in the typology after the second round were small compared with the revision we had undertaken after the first round. Basically, we improved the guidelines by adding some clarifications and commenting all the examples. Setting the preferences of some types over others also contributed in the overall improvement. Nevertheless, the (near-)identity task is difficult and requires a mature sensitivity to language that not all coders had, as revealed by the presence of outliers. To exemplify a case of 50%-50% disagreement, consider (6), which obtained four SET·SET answers, four TIME, and one NON-IDENTITY. Proponents of the first saw inthe people and they a relation between two underspecified plurals, proponents of the second saw a clear temporal function at play, distinguishing the people from the past and the people from today; the last proponent failed to see any of the two previous near-identity relations and interpreted them as two groups with no identity at all."]},{"title":"154","paragraphs":["Relation Type Subtype K z p-value","1.

Conclusion","paragraphs":["We have motivated the need for a middle ground category between identity and non-identity in the coreference task by showing examples from naturally occurring data that cannot be accounted for under a binary coreference definition. The NIDENT typology includes fifteen near-identity types —grouped under four main families— that capture a wide range of ways in which (near-)coreference relations hold between discourse entities. We see it as an open, rather than definitive, typology as there are many (creative) ways in which discourse entities can be connected in a near-identical fashion, but we believe that it provides main axes along which near-identity can manifest itself in discourse. Support for NIDENT came from an inter-annotator agreement study, which showed that agreement increased over three consecutive rounds, achieving K= 0.58, and up to K= 0.65 and K= 0.84 when leaving out one and two outliers, respectively. The assumption of a near-identity category in the processing of coreference relations has consequences not only for computational linguistics but from theoretical to cognitive linguistics. We have hinted at the potential future work in the field of psycholinguistics."]},{"title":"6.
