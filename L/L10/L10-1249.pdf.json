Introduction\\b","paragraphs":["Within the research project “Viennese socio\\fect and dia\\fect synthesis” (VSDS) \\b",", we deve\\foped three voices for speech synthesis mode\\fing three Viennese varieties. In the \\fight of persona\\fization and regiona\\fization of speech based interfaces it becomes indispensab\\fe to deve\\fop not on\\fy high qua\\fity speech synthesis for different \\fanguages but a\\fso for a representative set of \\fanguage varieties, i.e., dia\\fects that differ from the standard variety substantia\\f\\fy enough to treat them a\\fongside different \\fanguages. In performing this task, the focus \\fies on the necessity that the deve\\foped synthetic voices must be ab\\fe to shift between the standard variety and specific dia\\fects, simi\\far to everyday \\fanguage use (Pucher et a\\f., 20\\b0). In Vienna, \\fanguage varieties are differentiated rather socia\\f\\fy than regiona\\f\\fy, therefore it wou\\fd be correct to speak about socio\\fects.2","In the VSDS project, we deve\\foped three different voices\\t a voice representing “the Viennese dia\\fect”, one representing co\\f\\foquia\\f Viennese, and one representing the youth \\fanguage in Vienna. For the recordings, we cou\\fd win two renowned actors and for the recordings of youth \\fanguage, we arranged a casting among pupi\\fs of vocationa\\f schoo\\fs. This is the first attempt to deve\\fop mu\\ftip\\fe synthetic voices that represent different dia\\fects of a certain \\fanguage, as opposed to synthetic voices speaking with an accent, such as A\\fan3","(Eng\\fish with a Scottish accent) or Anja\\fi4","(Eng\\fish with an Indian accent). These voices are \\s \\s \\s \\b See\\t http\\t//dia\\fect-tts.ftw.at 2 In urban varieties, the term “dia\\fect” coincides with the socio\\fect spoken by the \\fower socia\\f c\\fasses.

Dea\\fing with a dia\\fecta\\f \\fanguage variety is a far more comp\\fex task. In Figure \\b, we i\\f\\fustrate the various \\feve\\fs of \\finguistic information where differences between a dia\\fect and some standard can be found. In our project we concentrated on speech synthesis, no attempts were made to imp\\fement an automatic trans\\fation between the standard and the dia\\fect variety. However, many \\fexica\\f and phrasa\\f items specific for a dia\\fect are stored in the \\fexica\\f resources when they occurred in the input texts for the speech recordings."]},{"title":"105","paragraphs":["Representing a dia\\fect primari\\fy requires a specia\\fized pronunciation dictionary, tai\\fored for each recorded speaker, which ref\\fects deviations from the standard variety on the re\\fevant \\finguistic \\feve\\fs.

Therefore, we deve\\foped methods to derive Viennese dia\\fect dictionaries from a standard Austrian German dictionary using various sets of transformationa\\f ru\\fes and added on\\fy those entries manua\\f\\fy that cou\\fd not be captured by the ru\\fes or were ambiguous. Since the correct transcription is crucia\\f for the success of automatic segmentation of speech, we sti\\f\\f had to exact contro\\f over a\\f\\f items that actua\\f\\fy occurred in the recording texts.

Speaker\\bselection\\b","paragraphs":["The se\\fection of the professiona\\f speakers was based on severa\\f criteria, amongst others\\t reading speed and accuracy, the accuracy of their standard Austrian pronunciation, the degree of authenticity of their socio\\fect, the consistency of their pronunciation (in particu\\far, we did not want them to shift between different socio\\fects without being to\\fd so), and the p\\feasantness of the voice. A\\f\\f these criteria are high\\fy subjective, so we were a\\fso \\fooking for more objective ones. It has to be mentioned beforehand that we decided to engage professiona\\f speakers for the dia\\fect voices (with the exception of youth \\fanguage), rather than a genuine dia\\fect speaker. This decision is based on the fact that genuine dia\\fect speakers are usua\\f\\fy not fami\\fiar with the task to read non-meaningfu\\f texts f\\fuent\\fy, error-free, with constant prosody and in a studio situation. Moreover, recording a speech database for unit se\\fection speech synthesis requires the reading of thousands of sentences. Consequent\\fy, instructing and monitoring a genuine speaker wou\\fd take significant\\fy more time and efforts than working with a professiona\\f speaker, such that emp\\foying a genuine dia\\fect speaker for this task might put the success of the entire project at risk. Regarding criteria for speaker se\\fection, it is we\\f\\f known that automatic phone segmentation works much better for some speakers than for others. A c\\fear and consistent pronunciation certain\\fy he\\fps, but there are other factors as we\\f\\f, which are not entire\\fy c\\fear yet. The best way to find out how we\\f\\f a speaker is suitab\\fe for unit se\\fection speech synthesis is to actua\\f\\fy make a voice and eva\\fuate it in a \\fistening test (Syrda\\f et a\\f. \\b998). That way, pitch tracking and pitch marking qua\\fity is tested as we\\f\\f, which a\\fso varies for reasons not a\\fways as obvious as for e.g. creakiness of voice. The recording materia\\f for our test voices was se\\fected among very short (3 words) sentences from EU par\\fiament debates. These sentences contained no proper names, numbers, or abbreviations. \\b0 of these sentences were se\\fected as test sentences and we assured that the training data covered a\\f\\f the diphones contained in the \\b0 test sentences. The phone strings were derived from a standard German \\fexicon; the \\finguistic context features were\\t \\fexica\\f stress, sy\\f\\fab\\fe boundaries, and word boundaries. It turned out that mere\\fy 93 sentences (consisting of 3 words each) provided enough data to cover the phonetic materia\\f in the test sentences. This was part\\fy due to a partia\\f over\\fap of phone strings and the re\\fative shortness of the sentences. Because the phone segmentation had to work with a “f\\fat start” (Young et a\\f. 2006), this was intended. For the “dia\\fect” and the “co\\f\\foquia\\f” voice, we casted \\b0 professiona\\f speakers (main\\fy actors\\t 5 ma\\fe and 5 fema\\fe), recorded them and made tiny Standard Austrian voices, each approximate\\fy 2 minutes \\fong, synthesized the test sentences and assessed them in a group meeting. A\\fthough this eva\\fuation was sti\\f\\f subjective, it certain\\fy he\\fped us making our decision with more confidence. In addition, we a\\fso made \\b0 dia\\fect unit se\\fection voices, based on the materia\\f mentioned above, but transcribed with an orthography approximating Viennese . The dia\\fect test voices gave us a better idea of how consistent the speakers were when reading in an ‘unusua\\f’ orthography. For choosing the appropriate voices we had to decide which speaker comes c\\fosest to an authentic Viennese dia\\fect speaker, hence the rea\\fizations of dia\\fecta\\f speech produced by the professiona\\f speakers were compared with recordings of authentic Viennese dia\\fect speakers. It turned out that none of the professiona\\f speakers was ab\\fe to produce a prototypica\\f Viennese dia\\fect in such a way that it matches with an authentic dia\\fect voice. This resu\\ft is based on the fact that speakers mimicking a certain variety usua\\f\\fy capture the prominent features of such a variety (Torstenssen et a\\f., 2004, Neuhauser, 2008), i.e., stereotyping takes p\\face. Moreover, in stereotyping a variety, unusua\\f \\finguistic patterning can be observed (Schi\\f\\fing-Estes, 2002). In our case, e.g., the mono-\\fatera\\f rea\\fization of the \\fatera\\f, a very sa\\fient feature of the Viennese dia\\fect, was over-genera\\fized by mere\\fy a\\f\\f speakers to phonetic contexts in which the mono-\\fatera\\f rea\\fization is not a\\f\\fowed (Moosmü\\f\\fer, in print). On the other hand, one a\\fso has to take into account that the overa\\f\\f majority of \\fisteners have not too much direct acquaintance with authentic speakers of different varieties, consequent\\fy, in their expectations they re\\fy on stereotypes rather than on authenticity. Therefore, in choosing an appropriate speaker, one has to ba\\fance the expectations of the \\fisteners and the c\\faim for the production of an authentic variety."," Voice\\b ID\\b","Variet\\f\\b Age\\b group\\b gender\\b","Database\\b","size\\b HPO Viennese dia\\fect 45-60 m 2\\t55 HGA Co\\f\\foquia\\f Viennese 60-70 f 3\\t\\b0 JOE Viennese youth \\fanguage \\b5-25 f 2\\t\\b\\b  Tab\\fe \\b\\t Re\\fease voices  A\\fthough none of the professiona\\f speakers were authentic Viennese dia\\fect speakers (i.e., they were not brought up in that variety), and a\\f\\f of them “misapp\\fied” some phonetic features of the dia\\fect, there were a\\fso some advantages.

Text\\bselection\\b","paragraphs":["The qua\\fity of a unit se\\fection voice high\\fy depends on how we\\f\\f the recorded materia\\f covers the set of possib\\fe diphones and prosodic contexts. Most of our recording text script for the standard Austrian variety was se\\fected from \\farge corpora of non-proprietary texts, such as EU par\\fiament debate transcripts, and from the Viennese city magazine “Fa\\fter” (with their friend\\fy approva\\f). We were aiming at diphone coverage with the fo\\f\\fowing \\finguistic context features\\t \\fexica\\f stress, sy\\f\\fab\\fe boundaries and word boundaries. During the initia\\f iterations of text se\\fection, we focused on the most frequent diphones without features whi\\fe taking account of some back off strategies, for examp\\fe that diphones bridging a word boundary can easi\\fy be backed off by inserting a short pause. On the other hand, we paid particu\\far attention to prosodic phrase boundaries\\t in order to cover diphones in phrase-fina\\f yes-no questions with rising intonation (in ToBI H-H%), we constructed 672 sentences of the form \"artic\\fe-noun-question mark\". In order to cover diphones in front of continuation rises, we gave sentence-interna\\f pauses a symbo\\f different from sentence-framing pauses. Thus we avoided to add yet another \\finguistic context feature for “boundary tone”, e.g. in ToBI L-L%, H-H%, L-H% or “defau\\ft”. During synthesis, these tones are determined by punctuation and a \\fist of interrogative pronouns serving as additiona\\f features at sentence \\feve\\f. This quite \\farge samp\\fe of texts, however, was designed on the basis of transcriptions corresponding to the Austrian standard, and cou\\fd on\\fy be used for the co\\f\\foquia\\f voice and the Viennese youth voice, since both of these varieties resemb\\fe the Austrian standard enough on the transcription \\feve\\f. In particu\\far, the re\\fevant differences are phonetic to the \\fargest extent, and therefore represented in the recorded speech itse\\ff. Sti\\f\\f certain differences had to be respected, in particu\\far that there are no preterit forms in either of the varieties and that certain \\fexica\\f items do not exist, but have a distinct correspondent. Therefore, sentences ungrammatica\\f in the Viennese varieties were either fi\\ftered out (part\\fy automatica\\f\\fy) or a\\ftered according to Viennese. For the voice representing the prototypica\\f Viennese dia\\fect we had to emp\\foy additiona\\f measures. First, our recording text script for Viennese additiona\\f\\fy contained a manua\\f\\fy compi\\fed set of sentences from various sources existing in various orthographic encodings, a\\f\\f of them representing “the Viennese dia\\fect”\\t e.g., sentences extracted from poems by H.C. Artmann, from songs by “Dr. Kurt Ostbahn”, from a trans\\fation of the comic “Asterix” etc. A\\fthough these were c\\fear\\fy authentic Viennese texts, they were not sufficient with respect to diphone coverage, so we had to resort on texts from the standard variety. The speaker was instructed to trans\\fate the texts adapted to Viennese into proper dia\\fect on the f\\fy, a task that was unexpected\\fy easy to perform. The transcriptions of the text were transformed into dia\\fect according\\fy, uti\\fizing the ru\\fes mentioned in section \\b.
