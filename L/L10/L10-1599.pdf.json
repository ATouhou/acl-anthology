This paper aims to develop a framework for automatic CG tagging for Thai. We investigated two main algorithms, CRF and Statistical alignment model based on information theory (SAM). We found that SAM gives the best results both in word level and sentence level. We got the accuracy 89.25% in word level and 82.49% in sentence level. SAM is better than CRF in known word. On the other hand, CRF is better than SAM when we applied for unknown word. Combining both methods can be suited for both known and unknown word.",""]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["Thai language resources [Asanee et al. 2002, Chai & Sadaoki 2007] are gradually developed. However, only few of them are practical and provided. There are several researches focusing on developing practical language resources in Thai, such as, BEST [BEST Corpus 2009] which develops a 7-million word corpus for word segmentation. Asian Wordnet, which focuses on developing an infrastructure in terms of word concept. Orchid corpus [Thatsanee 1997], a POS tagging corpus contains 36,457 sentences with 43 POS types in tagset. There are several dependencies Treebank under developing step [Vee & Asanee 2004]. BEST is only a corpus which distributes to various researchers with enough amounts of data. The most effective word segmentation using BEST is around 97% based on F-measure. Others are inadequate for developing reliable NLP applications for Thai.  Categorial Grammar (CG) [Bob 1992, Kazimierz 1935] and Combinatorial Categorial Grammar (CCG) [Mark 2000] are formalisms in natural language syntax which focuses on compositional principle of syntactic constituents. There are several researches on automatic CCG tagging [James et al, 2007, Stephen 2002]. All of them are originated from CCG bank [Mark 2000, Julia & Mark 2002] which is developed from Penn Treebank. Recently, CG dictionary [Taneth et al 2007] and CG Treebank [Taneth et al 2009] are developed in Thai.  With limited time and human resources, it is necessary to develop a framework for implementing an automatic CG tagging. We investigate two main algorithms. One is CRF which becomes a well-known algorithm for sequence labelling problem. Another is a statistical alignment model based on information theory, which adapted from Noisy channel model. It focuses on CG pattern and maps between word and CG sequentially.  This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 explains Thai CG dictionary and Treebank. Section 3 illustrates the overview of our system work flow. Section 4 explains two methodologies which are applied in this work. Section 5 shows experiments which compare between two main algorithms. Finally discussion, conclusion and future work are explained in section 6."]},{"title":"2. Thai CG","paragraphs":["Categorial Grammar (CG) is a formalism which focuses on principle of syntactic behavior. It can be applied to solve word order issues in Thai. To apply CG for machine learning and statistical based approach, CG Treebank, is initially required. There are two main resources in Thai CG, CG dictionary and CG Treebank.  CG dictionary presently contains 70,441 lexical entries with 89 CG syntactic categories. For Thai language, six argument syntactic categories are determined. Thai CG arguments are listed with definition and examples in Table 1. Additionally, np, num, and spnum are Thai CG arguments that can directly tag to a word, but other can only be used as a combination for other arguments.  Recently, CG Treebank has been developed. Currently there are 20,824 sentences in our Treebank. It plays an important role as a fundamental resource for other Thai NLP processing, such as automatic CG tagging, chunking and parsing.

AutoTagTCG : An automatic Thai CG tagging","paragraphs":["AutoTagTCG is an automatic Thai CG tagging. Figure 2 illustrates the flow of our system. Given a raw data, it is necessary to segmented in to word. We apply a Statistical approach for Word Segmentation Tool (SWS) [14] in this task. The output from SWS is constructed based on CG dictionary in order to obtain words with all possible CG information. The remaining words which are not included in CG dictionary will be recognized as unknown word. After we get a segmented corpus, we apply CG tagging process. This process is composed of two processes, CG tagging and CG tag prediction for unknown word  1 This spnum category has a different usage from other numerical use, e.g. ม้า[noun,'horse'] ตัว[classifier] เ\\fียว[spnum,'one'] 'lit: one horse'. This case is different from normal numerical usage, e.g. ม้า[noun,'horse'] ห\\b\\tง [num,'one'] ตัว[classifier] 'lit: one horse' 2 This example is a part of a sentence ฉั\\bเชือว่าเขาจะมาสาย 'lit: I believe that he will come late' algorithm. CG tree bank is applied to generate the all possible tagged sentences. Tagged sentences will be sent to CG tag verification to check the correctness of tagged results.
