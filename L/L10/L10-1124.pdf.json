The corpus contains newspaper articles and scientific papers in which exactly the same numerical facts are presented many times (both within and across texts). Some annotations of numerical facts are original: for example, numbers are automatically classified as round or non-round by an algorithm derived from Jansen and Pollmann (2001); also, numerical hedges such as ‘about’ or ‘a little under’ are marked up and classified semantically using arithmetical relations. Through explicit alignment of phrases describing the same fact, the corpus can support research on the influence of various contextual factors (e.g., document position, intended readership) on the way in which numerical facts are expressed. As an example we present results from an investigation showing that when a fact is mentioned more than once in a text, there is a clear tendency for precision to increase from first to subsequent mentions, and for mathematical level either to remain constant or to increase."]},{"title":"1. Introduction 1.1. Why collect the corpus?","paragraphs":["Our aim in building the NUMGEN1","corpus was to create a resource for NLP that would provide empirical evidence on linguistic and mathematical variations in numerical expressions. These expressions are extremely common in the factual documents that many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications generate or analyse (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008; Reiter et al., 2005; Hallett et al., 2007; Gatt et al., 2009), and have been highlighted as a key problem in communicating information to the public (Paulos, 1988). In our own research area, Natural Language Generation (NLG), numerical expressions have received surprisingly little attention, even though communicating numerical information is an important problem since input data is wholly or partially numerical in nearly every NLG system. For example, SkillSum and GIRL (Williams and Reiter, 2008) generated feedback on basic-skills tests, but variations in the presentation of numerical data were limited to a choice between number words and digits e.g.: “You scored seventeen.” as opposed to: “You scored 17.” The CLEF answer-renderer system for generating answers to queries posed to a medical database (Hallett et al., 2007) was limited to expressing whole numbers when it could have expressed results more interestingly (and, perhaps, more usefully) as proportions:","“Your query has returned 965 patients between 30 and 70 years of age who had a clinical diagnosis of malignant neoplasm of breast and underwent surgery. This chart displays the 1","Generating intelligent descriptions of numerical quantities for people with different levels of numeracy.

There has been no research on deeper issues such as whether to generate a vague phrase (over ten) or a precise one (exactly twelve), nor any empirical investigation of the range of possible choices, or of differences among authors or genres. Yet this is an important area where infelicities are common2",", and readers may differ widely in their levels of numeracy (Paulos, 1988). We suspect that in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) research the situation is much the same. Indeed we are not aware of any systems that can recognise that two phrases (‘25.9 per cent’, ‘more than a quarter’) describe the same 2 In academic sources that will be nameless, we recently found","‘33 1 3 %’ and ‘591,000.0 people’."]},{"title":"2396","paragraphs":["numerical fact3","— an issue of some importance in information extraction, when fact-alignment would allow a system to check for consistency among statements, or to select the most precise value from a set of alternative formulations. If we consider numerical expressions of proportion, the range of possible linguistic variation becomes vast, since a proportion such as 0.259 can also be expressed through a variety of mathematical forms: just over a quarter, around one in four, 25%, and so on. Apart from some noteable research on numerical hedge phrases such as more than, less than, and around (Dubois, 1987), variations in numerical proportion expressions have been largely ignored in linguistics. 1.2. What is unique about the corpus? The NumGen corpus is fact-aligned, which means that where two or more phrases express the same numerical fact, they are assigned the same fact identifier (factID). Such numerical facts occur both within a single text, and across texts written by different authors for different audiences. This cross-linking is akin to the semantic alignment of concepts in paraphrase corpora, e.g., Barzilay and McKeown’s (2001) machine-learning alignment of pairs of paraphrases (“burst into tears”, “cried”) and (“comfort”, “console”) in their corpus of multiple translations of five classic novels into English. Our alignment differs in that it applies only to numerical expressions. Furthermore, texts on the same topic in our corpus are not strictly parallel (in the sense that not all content overlaps and ordering of information varies); they are linked only through references to the same numerical facts. Another novelty of the NumGen corpus is that each set of texts represents a wide range of linguistic settings for numerical expressions, from the formality of scientific articles to the relative informality and high readability of popular science magazines and ‘tabloid’ newspaper articles. They also cover an assortment of mathematical forms of varying degrees of technical difficulty, ranging from proportional changes in risk over time to simple integers."]},{"title":"2. Corpus collection and annotation","paragraphs":["The corpus was collected by searching the Internet for articles published on the same date that described the same numerical fact (or constellation of facts). Articles were downloaded from scientific journals, popular science magazines, and newspapers,4","see table 1.

In addition, we created the following attributes which are unique to our corpus: • Fact-alignment, e.g., factID=‘ALevels02’ • Given value, e.g., VG=0.25 • Actual value, e.g., VA=0.259 • Decision on roundness of VG, e.g., round=‘y’ • Numerical hedges, e.g., hedge=‘more than’ • Numerical hedge semantics, e.g., hedgeSem=‘>’ Fact-alignment is the means by which we track instances of numerical facts within a text and across groups of texts. In the above fragment, the fact identifierALevels02 denotes the proportion of exam papers with A-grades, which is expressed as More than a quarter (sentence 4) and 25.9 per cent (sentence 9). In total, we found 22 instances of this particular fact in 14 texts with linguistic variations: 25.9%, one in four, 25.9 per cent, 25.9 percent, more than a quarter, more than one in four, one in four. We annotated the values given in the text (VG). Once we had identified numerical facts with more than one mention, we were in some cases able to judge whether one value (e.g., a quarter) was an approximation of another value specified elsewhere (25.9 per cent). If so, we assumed that the most precise one (25.9 per cent) was close the actual value (VA). Of course, if a fact only occurred once, or if the given values were all the same, then it was not possible to estimate actual values in this way. We also implemented an automatic decision procedure to determine whether the given number VG was round, adapt-ing a proposal by Jansen and Pollmann (2001) based on empirical studies of number frequencies in texts. Briefly, Jansen and Pollmann suggest that round numbers are simple multiples of so-called ‘favourite numbers’, which in decimal systems are defined as members of the set10N","∗M , where N is any integer, and M is either 1, 2, 0.5, or 0.25. In other words, a favourite number is a power of ten, either left alone, or doubled, halved or quartered. A round number is then defined as a relatively small multiple of a favourite number; Jansen and Pollman suggest the set given by K ∗ F where F is a favourite number and K is an in-teger from 1-20. We have preferred to implement a rather stricter criterion in which M can take only the values 1 and 0.5. This is in part an arbitrary judgement (since there are degrees of roundness), but we find it counterintuitive for in-stance to admit 42.5 as a round number (it can be expressed as 17 * 2.5 where 2.5 is the favourite number 101","∗ 0.25). Under our stricter definition, the favourite numbers (count-ing from 1) are 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, . . . and the round numbers over 20 are accordingly 25, 30, 35, 40, and so forth. Lastly, we annotated numerical hedges. Since these often indicate that VG is approximate (or indeed precise in the case of the hedge exactly), they also contributed to our estimates of VA. We created an attribute for hedge semantics (hedgeSem)which can have values ‘>’, ‘<’, ‘=’, or ‘≈’."]},{"title":"3.

For instance, in the previous section we gave an example where ‘more than a quarter’ was mentioned first and ‘25.9%’ subsequently. These phrases differ both in precision and mathematical form (simple fraction in the first case, more technical percentage in the second). To test the validity of this observation, we extracted from the corpus the 88 instances in which the same fact was presented at least twice in the same text, and compared first and second mentions. Each pair was classified as showing equal, increasing, or decreasing precision by two judges, with agreement of 94% (κ = 0.88, Cohen’s kappa). The results (table 2) showed a clear tendency for precision to increase, and for mathematical level either to remain the same or to increase (binomial tests). How this result should be interpreted is an interesting question. It is well-known that newspaper articles standardly begin with a summary: however, if we equate summarisation with brevity, we find that paradoxically the less precise formulation is often longer (compare ‘more than a quarter’ with ‘25.9%’). Perhaps the less precise formulation is more memorable, or more useful for reasoning purposes. Whatever the explanation, the finding is clear and was made possible by the use of a fact-aligned corpus6","."]},{"title":"4. Conclusions","paragraphs":["To our knowledge, the NUMGEN corpus is unique in containing multiple texts describing overlapping facts, with selected numerical facts linked across and within texts. By choosing texts on the same topics from varied publications (ranging from tabloid newspapers to scientific journals), we have shown that numerical expressions differ not only in their surface form (e.g., ‘12%’ vs ‘twelve percent’) but also at a deeper semantic level, through features like the mathematical form, the distinction between actual and given value, and hedges representing arithmetical relations. These features have also been annotated, so that the corpus can be used for studying a fuller range of options (both deep and superficial) in describing numerical facts, and linking 6","The corpus has also been used in two further studies, one on the relationship between hedging and rounding, the other on planning approximate expressions (both forthcoming). them to contextual factors such as document position and intended readership.
