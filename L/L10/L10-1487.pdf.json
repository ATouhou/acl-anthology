Introduction","paragraphs":["Many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools require or benefit from reliable linguistic resources, such as lexicons and grammars. In particular, for tasks such as parsing, a morphological and syntactic lexicon is a highly valuable source of information. However, such a lexicon needs (1) to have a large coverage, (2) to guarantee a high level of quality, (3) to be directly usable in NLP tools, and (4) to be available to all its potential users. Such resources now exist for English, but are often lacking or incomplete for other languages, even major ones. For example, for French, several lexical resources exist that contain syntactic information, such as Lexicon-Grammar tables (Gross, 1975), Dicovalence (van den Eynde and Mertens, 2006) or Les Verbes Franca̧is (Dubois and Dubois-Charlier, 1997), but none of them combines satisfactorily the four above-mentioned properties. These properties are the basis of our lexical development work. In this paper, we introduce both our lexical formalism, named Alexina, and the most advanced lexical resource developed within this framework, the Lefff (Lexique des Formes Fléchies du Franca̧is — Lexicon of French inflected forms), now in its third version (3.0.1). The Lefff is a widely-used and freely available 1","large-coverage morphological and syntactic lexicon for French. Apart from the Lefff , other Alexina lexicons are being developed, in particular the Leffe for Spanish (Molinero et al., 2009), and resources for Galician, Polish (Sagot, 2007), Slovak (Sagot, 2005), Persian (Sagot and Walther, 2010), Sorani Kurdish (Walther and Sagot, 2010) and soon English.2","1","The Lefff is distributed under the LGPL-LR license.

The Alexina framework","paragraphs":["Alexina is a lexical modeling and acquisition framework that covers both the morphological and syntactic levels. Alexina allows to represent lexical information in a complete, efficient and readable way, that is meant to be independent of the language and of any grammatical formalism (Sagot, 2005; Sagot et al., 2006; Sagot, 2007). Moreover, it is compatible with the LMF3 standard (Francopoulo et al., 2006). Therefore, an Alexina lexicon can be directly used in NLP tools. Taking parsers as an example, we are aware of Alexina lexicons, and most notably the Lefff , being used in parsers based on LTAG, including LTAGs generated from metagrammars developed in various meta-grammar formalisms (Thomasset and de la Clergerie, 2005), LFG (Boullier and Sagot, 2005), Interaction Grammars (Guillaume and Perrier, 2010), Pre-Group Grammars (B échet and Foret, 2009), and other less known formalisms. An Alexina lexicon consists of lexical entries that correspond to lexemes, i.e., to a meaning of a lemma that exhibits consistent morphological and syntactic properties. The morphological information in an Alexina lexicon has a simple and standard structure. Each entry is associated with a lemma, a category (or part-of-speech) and an inflection class. The morphological description defines how to build all wordforms (inflected forms, or simply forms) from a given lemma depending on its inflection class and associate with each inflected form a morphological tag (e.g., ms for masculine singular) and a morphosyntactic flag (see below). The morphological formalism used in Alexina for defining inflection classes is described in Section 2.2.. The syntactic level of the Alexina model deserves a more detailed description. Each phrase or pronoun whose existence, type, morphosyntactic properties and distribution is controlled by a given form in a given sentence is considered as the realization of a (syntactic) conversion would lead to a morphological and syntactic Alexina lexicon for Dutch.","3","Lexical Markup Framework, the ISO/TC37 standard for NLP lexicons."]},{"title":"2744","paragraphs":["argument of this form. In languages such as French or English, such a predicative form may be among others a verb, an adjective or a noun. In most cases, a syntactic argument corresponds to a semantic argument of the form, i.e., a participant to the process expressed by this form. In this case the syntactic argument can also be called an actant of the form. However, a syntactic argument may have no semantic counterpart, and is then called a pseudo-argument . This is for example the case of the se/s’ in French pronominal verbs such as s’évanouir (to faint). Conversely, it may be impossible to provide a syntactic counterpart to a semantic argument. This if the case in French in so-called se-moyen constructions (Abeillé, 2002, p. 193). The set of syntactic arguments of a given form and the associated constraints is modeled by the means of a sub-categorization frame. It encodes the set of arguments of the form, as well as additional syntactic properties (e.g., control, various constraints on the arguments, etc.). A sub-categorization frame associated with a predicative form is defined as a list of syntactic arguments of this form; each of them is assigned a syntactic function with respect to the predicative form, i.e., a consistent set of morphological and syntactic constraints, as well as the set of its possible realizations; pseudo-arguments are also included in the sub-categorization frame, with no associated syntactic function. The notion of syntactic function (or grammatical function) is widespread across formalisms and approaches (Tesnière, 1959; Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982; Perlmutter and Postal, 1983). We define them on a per-language basis by the mean of several syntactic criteria that can be sketched as follows:","• the commutation principle, taking into account both pronouns and phrases, contrarily to (van den Eynde and Mertens, 2003): if a pronoun or a phrase can be replaced at the same position or another by another pronoun or phrase (both pronouns or phrases being mutually exclusive), without changing the dependency structure underlying the sentence, then they occupy the same syntactic function;","• the unique realization principle: for a given predicate, a syntactic function is realized at most once.4 With such criteria, the linking between semantic arguments and syntactic functions is not necessarily unique. Several sub-categorization frames may be found among the various forms of a given lexeme, for at least two reasons. First, there are form-dependant specificities in the syntactic behavior (e.g., in French, the infinitive form of a verb may have a non-realized subject). Second, and more importantly, a same inflected form of a given lexeme may have its semantic arguments linked to (final)","4","Note that with such a principle, the clitic subject inversion in French needs an appropriate treatment. Indeed, in sentences such as Ainsi Pierre viendra-t-il demain (Thus Pierre will come tomorrow), one could argue that both Pierre and il should receive the syntactic function subject, which is apparently incompatible with the unique realization principle. syntactic functions in many ways: this is the well-studied phenomenon of regular syntactic alternations (e.g., active, passive or impersonal for French or English verbs). Therefore, inspired by previous work (Perlmutter and Postal, 1983; Candito, 1999), we define initial syntactic functions as follows:5","• for most lexemes, there exists a non-marked mapping between their semantic arguments and syntactic functions that leads to syntactically non-marked constructions;","• initial syntactic functions are defined as identical to final syntactic functions for the non-marked case;","• therefore, the set of initial syntactic functions is the same as the set of final syntactic functions;","• marked mappings (e.g., passive for French or English verbs) or mappings that lead to syntactically marked constructions (e.g., impersonal constructions for French or English verbs) are defined as redistributions of the set of initial syntactic functions;","• each redistribution must be defined formally on a per-language basis; a redistribution may assign a syntactic argument to a different syntactic function than its initial one, affect the list of realizations and/or change some of its properties (optionality, control, etc.). Given the correspondence between the lemma and the inflected forms of a lexeme, as well as the correspondence between an initial sub-categorization frame of a lexeme and the various final sub-categorization frames its inflected form may receive, the Alexina model is based on a two-level representation that separates the description of a lexicon from its use:","• The lexicon proper, or intensional lexicon, factorizes the lexical information: each entry corresponds to a lexeme and provides its lemma, morphological class and initial syntactic information; it is used for lexical resource development;","• The extensional lexicon, which is generated automatically by compiling the intensional lexicon, associates each inflected form of a given entry with a detailed structure that represents its morphological information","5","The notion of initial syntactic function is not standard. It is an alternative to the more widespread notion of lexical rule (see for example (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982)). Lexical rules can be applied iteratively, starting with a base entry, and successively generating derived entries. The difference with the initial vs. final syntactic functions approach is that lexical rules can be applied on a derived entry, the result being itself a derived entry that on which another lexical rule may be applied, and so on. On the opposite, a redistribution is a mapping between initial and final syntactic functions that applies to an initial sub-categorization frame, and the resulting final sub-categorization frame cannot undergo another redistribution. This allows to avoid termination issues, and does not prevent from defining a redistribution as, e.g., the sequence of two redistributions (see Section 2.3.)."]},{"title":"2745","paragraphs":["and (some of) its possible syntactic behaviours; it is directly used by NLP tools such as parsers.6 The set of syntactic functions, the set of possible realizations and the set of redistributions defined for French and used in the Lefff are described in Section 2.1..

Syntactic functions, realizations and","redistributions in the Lefff For verbs, the Lefff uses the following syntactic functions (defined here in a simplified way):","• Suj for subjects: cliticization with the nominative clitic;","• Obj for direct objects: cliticization with the accusative clitic, commutable with ceci/cela (this/that), impacted by passivization when it is possible;","• Objà for indirect objects canonically introduced by the preposition à: commutable with à+non-clitic pronoun (in the sense of (van den Eynde and Mertens, 2006)) but not with ici (here) or là(-bas) (there), may be cliticizable into the dative clitic or y;","• Objde for indirect objects introduced by the preposition de: cliticization with en, not commutable with d’ici (from here) or de là (from there),","• Loc for locative arguments: commutable with ici (here) or là(-bas) (there), cliticizable with y;","• Dloc for delocative arguments: commutable with d’ici (from here) or de là (from there), cliticizable with en;","• Att for (subject, object or à-object) attributes and pseudo-objects (e.g., 3 euros in j’ai acheté ceci 3 euros — I bought this 3 euros),","• Obl and Obl2 for other (non-cliticizable) arguments;Obl2 is used for verbs with two oblique arguments, such as plaider auprès de quelqu’un en faveur de quelqu’un d’autre (to plead in front of somebody for somebody else). For predicative adjectives and nouns, that can be headed respectively by a copula or a support verb, the same set of functions are used. The argument of a preposition is considered as an Obj. Adverbs may have arguments with the syntactic function Objà (contrairement) or Objde (indépendamment). Possible realizations are threefold:","6","Note that in our approach, redistributions are computed during the compilation process of the lexicon.

For verbs, the inventory of possible redistributions is the following:","• %actif, a dummy “redistribution” that has almost no effect on the initial sub-categorization information; 8 • %passif for the standard passive in par;","• %passif de for the passive in de (“Pierre est aimé de Marie”/“Pierre is loved by Mary”);","• %impersonnel for (active) impersonal constructions with inverted subject, if any;","• %passif impersonnel for passive impersonal constructions with inverted subject, if any;","• %se moyen for modelling constructions such as “ce livre se vend bien”/“this book sells good” on the basis of the underlying transitive construction for the same verb;9","• %se moyen impersonnel, the impersonal counterpart of the previous redistribution (see il se vend beaucoup de livres ici/there are many books sold here); For adjectives, we have defined two redistributions:","• %adj impersonnel when an adjective is the lexical head of an impersonal construction (see il est difficile de travailler/it is hard to work); • %adj personnel for other cases. For now, all other categories only use the %default construction that builds a final sub-categorization frame which is identical to the initial one.","7","de-scompl and à-scompl are exceptions, in so far that they do not correspond to à or de followed by a clause, but to à ce or de ce followed by a clause (“Pierre se souvient de *(ce) que Marie est belle”/“Pierre remembers that Marie is beautiful”).","8","It corresponds to the non-marked case, but is not assigned to all verbs. For example, some meteorological verbs have only the impersonal redistribution.","9","Neutral constructions, with or without se, are considered as corresponding to a different lexeme, and therefore a different although semantically related lexical entry (Danlos and Sagot, 2008)."]},{"title":"2746 2.2. The morphological formalism","paragraphs":["In the Alexina formalism, inflection is modelled as the affixation of a prefix and a suffix around a stem, while sandhi phenomena may occur at morpheme boundaries (see below), sometimes conditioned by stem properties. The formalism, which shares some widespread ideas with the DATR formalism (Evans and Gazdar, 1990) , relies on the following scheme:","• The core of a morphological description is a set of inflection tables that define corresponding inflection classes; inflection tables can (partly or completely) inherit from one another,","• Each inflection table defines a set of forms, each one of them being defined by a morphological tag and by a prefix and a suffix that, together with the stem, constitute the sequence of morpheme-like units prefix stem suffix;","• Sandhi phenomena allow to link the inflected form to the underlying prefix stem and stem suffix sequences by applying regular transformations; such rules may use classes of characters (e.g., [:aou:] can be defined as denoting one of the characters a, o or u with or without diacritics, as illustrated in Table 1);","• Forms can be controlled by tests over the stem (e.g., a given rule can apply only if a given regular expression matches the stem and/or if another one does not match the stem);","• Forms can be controlled by “variants” of the inflection classes (e.g., forms can be selected by one or more flags which complement the name of the class). Tables 1 and 2 illustrate this model by showing respectively a few sandhi rules and an excerpt of a verbal inflection class. Within the Alexina architecture, a morphological description using this formalism can generate two tools:","• an inflection tool that generates all inflected forms of a given lemma according to its morphological class;","• an ambiguous lemmatization tool, that computes for a given form (associated or not with a category) all possible candidate lemmas (existing or not) that <letterclass name=”aou” letters=”a à â ä o ô ö u û ü ù”/> <letterclass name=”ou” letters=”o ô ö u û ü ù”/> <sandhi source=”g [:aou:]” target=”ge [:aou:]”/> <fusion source=”[:ou:]y es$” target=”[:ou:]i es$”/> <fusion source=”et 2e$” target=”ett e$”/> Table 1: A letter class definition and three sandhi rules from our Alexina description of French morphology (the “ ” models a morpheme boundary; the first sandhi associates for example mangeons with mang ons, the second associates for example broient with broy ent, the third associates for example jette with jet 2e)","<table name=”v-er” canonical tag=”W” stems=”..*”>","<form suffix=”er” tag=”W” synt=”Infinitive”/>","<alt> <form suffix=”2e” tag=”PS13s”","var=”dbl” synt=”ThirdSing”/> <form suffix=”e” tag=”PS13s” rads=”..*ay”","var=”std” synt=”ThirdSing”/> <form suffix=”e” tag=”PS13s”","var=”std” synt=”ThirdSing”/> </alt> . . . <form suffix=”a” tag=”J3s” synt=”ThirdSing”/> <form suffix=”ai” tag=”J1s”/> . . . Table 2: Excerpts of the inflection class for French regular first group verbs in the Alexina morphological description used by the Lefff . The attributes tag and synt respectively define the morphological tag and the morphosyntactic flag. The attribute var, if present, indicates that the form must be generated only if the inflection class of the input lemma has the corresponding variant (e.g., v-er:std). The attributes rads (resp. except) indicates that the form must be generated only if the stem matches (resp. does not match) the corresponding pattern. Alternatives are represented with alt tags; within an alternative, at least one form must be generated, otherwise an error occurs. are consistent with the morphological description and have this form among their inflected forms. 2.3. The redistribution formalism For a given language, redistributions are defined formally as a sequence of elementary transformations to be applied on the initial sub-categorization frame in order to produce the final sub-categorization frame. More precisely, each inflected form generated for an intensional entry tries to combine itself with each redistribution associated with this intensional entry. In some cases, it may lead to an incompatibility (e.g., in the Lefff , non-third person singular for the %impersonal redistribution). One of the ways to control this is by the means of the morphosyntactic flag associated with each inflected form (e.g., all past participle forms in the Lefff receive the morphosyntactic flag PastParticiple, which is required by the %passive redistribution in order to apply). Each elementary transformation belongs to one of the following categories","• it may control the compatibility of the inflected form with the redistribution ({Only morphosyntacticFlag} or {Skip morphosyntacticFlag});","• it may add or remove a realization from the realization list of a syntactic function10","(e.g., {Obj -cla } removes the cla realization — accusative clitic — from the list of realizations of the object syntactic function);","10","Apart from syntactic functions, the special 0 may be used as a syntactic function, in order to add elements that do not realize any syntactic function (e.g., in French, the impersonal pronoun il for the %impersonal redistribution."]},{"title":"2747","paragraphs":["• it may change the optionality status of the surface realization of a syntactic function (e.g., {Obj ()} makes optional the surface realization of the object);","• it may build a list of realizations for a syntactic function (replacing the previous one if any) from an existing list, namely that of the same syntactic function or another one (e.g., the realizations of the subject for the %passive redistribution are built by the elementary transformation {Suj <Obj[cla>cln,de-sinf>sinf,seréfl>,seréc>]});","• it may add a new piece of information in the additional information section (e.g., {Macros @ être} adds a macro which means the auxiliary must be être, which is the case for example for the passive past participle);","• it may simply replace a regular pattern by another in the additional information section (e.g., {@CtrlObjObjà @CtrlSujObj à} turns a macro expressing the fact that the control of the object on the à- object must be transformed into a control of the subject on the à-object, which is necessary for the %passive redistibution); Each of these elementary transformations can be controlled by a morphosyntactic flag (e.g., Infinitive:{Suj ()} makes optional the subject only for the inflected form that has the Infinitive flag). Moreover, each elementary transformation may be mandatory (if it is not applicable, it means that the inflected form and the redistribution are incompatible) or optional (it is then prefixed by ?). Finally, any redistribution can be used as an elementary transformation (e.g., %passive impersonal is simply defined as %passif + %impersonnel). An example of redistribution definition in the Lefff is shown in Table 3.","%se moyen = %active + ?{@avoir } # removes the @avoir macro + {Macros @être} + {Macros @se moyen} + {0 se} + {Suj <Obj[cla>,de-sinf >sinf,seréfl>,seréc>]} + {Suj )(} # if the Obj was optional, the Suj is as well,","# and must therefore be made mandatory + ?{@AttSuj } + ?{@AttObj @AttSuj} + ?{@Ctrl.* } + ?{@Comp.* } Table 3: The formal definition of the %se moyen redistribution in the Lefff . This redistribution models sentences such as “ce livre se vend bien” (“this book sells good”). 2.4. The Intensional format Each entry in the intensional lexicon corresponds to a unique meaning of the corresponding lemma. It contains the following information:","• a morphological class, which defines the patterns that build its inflected forms (see Section 2.2.);","• a category (or part-of-speech); categories can be divided in two types: open (productive) categories (adjectives, adverbs, verbs, nouns) and closed (grammatical) categories; • the initial sub-categorization frame;","• additional syntactic information (e.g., control, raising, attributes) represented by macros (e.g., @CtrlSujObj indicates that if it is realized as an infinitive phrase, the object is controlled by the subject); • the list of possible redistributions. For example, the intensional entry (slightly simplified for clarity reasons) in the Lefff for the French lemma diagnostiquer1/to diagnose is as follows: diagnostiquer1","v-er:std Lemma;v;","<arg0:Suj:cln|sn,arg1:Obj:(cla|sn)>;","%actif,%passif,%se moyen It describes a transitive entry with the following information:","• its morphological class is v-er:std , the class of standard first-conjugation verbs (ending -er );","• its semantic predicate can be represented by the Lemma as is, i.e., diagnostiquer; • its category is verb (v);","• it has two arguments canonically realized by the syntactic functions Suj (subject) and Obj (direct object); each syntactic function is associated with a list of possible realizations, but the Obj is optional as shown by the brackets;","• it allows for three different redistributions: %active, %passive, and %se moyen. 2.5. The Extensional format The compilation process builds one extensional entry for each inflected form and each compatible redistribution, by inflecting the lemma according to the definition of its morphological class and by applying the formalized definitions of these redistributions. For example, the only inflected forms of diagnostiquer that are compatible with the passive redistribution are the past participle forms. The (simplified) extensional passive entry for diagnostiqués/diagnosed is the following (Kms is the morphological tag for past participle masculine plural forms): diagnostiqués v [pred=’diagnostiquer1<arg1:Suj:cln|sn, arg0:Obl2:(par-sn) >’,@passive,@pers,@Kms]; %passive The original direct object (Obj) has been transformed into the passive Subject and an optional Agent (Obl2) realized by a noun phrase preceded by a preposition (par-sn ) was added."]},{"title":"2748 3. Lexical data 3.1.

This was applied among other to impersonal constructions (Sagot and Danlos, 2008), pronominal constructions (Danlos and Sagot, 2008), adverbs in -ment (Sagot and Fort, 2007), several classes of frozen verbal expressions (Danlos et al., 2006), verbs in -iser and -ifier (Sagot and Fort, 2009)","• finally, a certain amount of nominal and adjectival entries have their origin in the Multext morphological lexicon for French (Veronis, 1998). 3.2.

However, we performed three types of evaluation: (1) quantitative comparison with other resources, (2) comparative evaluation of NLP tools based on a lexicon, depending on whether they use the Lefff or no lexical resource, and (3) comparative evaluation of NLP tools based on a lexicon, depending on whether they use the Lefff or another lexical resource. The two latter types of evaluation are illustrated respectively on a part-of-speech tagger and on a deep parser. 4.1. Quantitative comparison with other resources We provide in Table 5 direct comparison with other lexical resources in terms of morphological coverage (number of distinct lemmas).

Evaluating a POS tagger using the Lefff vs. no","lexicon In (Denis and Sagot, 2009), the authors compared the performance of a maximum-entropy-based part-of-speech tagger for French depending on the amount of lexical information extracted from the Lefff it relies on. This tagger, trained solely on the French TreeBank (Abeillé et al., 2003), exhibits a 97.0% accuracy (86.1% for words unknown to the training corpus). An additional coupling with the Lefff by adding Lefff -based features to the model increases this figure up to 97.7% (90.1% for words unknown to the training corpus), which is state-of-the-art for French. The explanation for this significant improvements is that the Lefff -based features reduce data sparseness and provide useful information on the right context: first, fewer errors on words unknown to the training corpus (a direct result of the use of a morphosyntactic lexicon) necessarily leads to fewer erroneous contexts for other words, and therefore to better tagging; second, the possible categories of tokens that are on the right of the current tokens are valuable pieces of information, and they are available only from the lexicon. In their study, (Denis and Sagot, 2009) also compare the effect of the use of increasingly large sub-parts of","12","Note that in Morphalou, masculine and feminine variants of a noun are considered as two different lemmas, whereas in the Lefff they are forms of the same lemma (ex.: fermier/fermière — farmer."]},{"title":"2749","paragraphs":["the Lefff in a way that approximately simulates the development of a morphological lexicon, by retaining only the most frequent lemmas (frequency figures come from a large journalistic corpus). The results show that using a morphological lexicon drastically improves the tagging accuracy on unknown words, whatever the development stage. Moreover, for fixed performance levels, the availability of the full lexicon consistently reduces the need for training data by at least one half (and up to two thirds). 4.3. Evaluating a deep parser using the Lefff vs.","another lexicon Comparative experiments with the FRMG parser for French (Thomasset and de la Clergerie, 2005) have been described, depending on the lexicon used by FRMG. FRMG is based on Tree-Adjoining Grammars, and normally relies on the Lefff . However, the lexical information included in Lexicon-Grammar verb tables, a high-quality and large-coverage resource (Gross, 1975), were converted into the Alexina framework (Tolone and Sagot, 2009). This allowed for integrating it within FRMG, by replacing verb entries in the Lefff . Results show that FRMG performs slightly better with the original Lefff : according to the metrics used by the EASy French parsing evaluation campaign (Paroubek et al., 2006), f-measures on “relations” (approx. dependencies between lexical words) drop from 59.9% to 56.6% when replacing Lefff verb entries with entries extracted from Lexicon-Grammar tables. 13 Several explanations can be given to explain these results. First, despite their fine-grainedness, Lexicon-Grammar tables lack some information, for instance on subject and object attributes and on pronominal redistributions. Second, the limit between arguments and modifiers tends to be different from that used in the Lefff ; the higher number of verb arguments listed in Lexicon-Grammar tables have some negative effects on the disambiguation heuristics used by FRMG. Moreover, the higher number of entries in Lexicon-Grammar leads to higher ambiguity levels, which in turn increases parsing times (and therefore the amount of sentences that can not be parsed before a fixed timeout) and affects the precision of disambiguation heuristics. Finally, the Lefff has been developed from the very beginning for and in parallel with NLP applications, which is not the case for Lexicon-Grammar tables."]},{"title":"5. Conclusion and perspectives","paragraphs":["Since its first versions (Sagot et al., 2006), the Lefff has turned into a widely used morphological and syntactic lexical resource for French. Its lexical framework, Alexina, is used for developing Lefff -like resources for several other languages. Moreover, the lexical data in the Lefff is under continuous improvement thanks to various semi-automatic techniques. The next step of the Lefff ’s development shall be twofold. First, we intend to carry on the improvement of the","13","Note that these figures cannot be directly compared with classical f-measures based on evalb metrics.

Second, we aim at extending the Lefff to the semantic level, by coupling it with semantic resources such as the WOLF (Wordnet Libre du Franca̧is — Free French Wordnet) (Sagot and Fišer, 2008)."]},{"title":"6.
