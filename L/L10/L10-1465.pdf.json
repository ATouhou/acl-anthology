We present the results of analysis and evaluation of the corpus annotation – currently, the inter-annotator agreement kappa value being 0.80 which indicates substantial agreement between the annotators. We also discuss some of linguistic resources (key factors for distinguishing facts from opinions, opinion lexicon, intensifier lexicon, pre-modifier lexicon, modal verb lexicon, reporting verb lexicon, general opinion patterns from the corpus etc.) developed as a result of our corpus analysis, which can be used to identify an opinion or a controversial issue, arguments supporting an opinion, orientation of the supporting arguments and their strength (intrinsic, relative and in terms of persuasion). These resources form the backbone of our work especially for performing the opinion analysis in the lower levels, i.e., in the lexical and sentence levels. Finally, we shed light on the perspectives of the given work clearly outlining the challenges."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["There have been growing efforts in developing annotated resources so that they can be useful in acquiring annotated patterns e.g. via statistical or machine learning approaches and ultimately aid in the automatic identification, extraction and analysis of opinions, emotions and sentiments in texts. Some of such works on text annotation, among many others, include Wilson (2003), Stoyanov and Cardie (2004), Wiebe et al. (2005), Wilson (2005), Read et al. (2007) etc. These works are primarily focused on annotating opinions or appraisal units (attitudes, engagement and graduation) in texts. This follows from the definition of annotation schemes sharing similar notions within the Appraisal Framework developed by Martin and White (2005). Other works on annotating texts include Carlson et al. (2001),Maite Taboada and Jan Renkema1","(2008) etc., which deal with text annotation in the discourse level employing discourse connectives and rhetorical relations. Much interest towards the analysis of opinionated texts like news editorials are also coming up in the recent years, for example, in Elisabeth Le’s works1",". However, despite these efforts, the development of a suitable annotation scheme for corpus annotation from the perspective of opinion and argumentation analysis in news editorials seems to be clearly missing. While the existing annotation schemes and guidelines may be sufficient for annotating appraisal units, discourse connectives, discourse units and even possibly some 1 http://www.sfu.ca/rst/06tools/discourse_relations_corpus.html","rhetorical relations, we argue that for analyzing the","various forms of argumentation, it is necessary to","determine the type of supports with respect to an","argument (either “For” or “Against”) and the persuasion","levels and effects in opinionated texts. This then requires","us to make some additional provisions in the annotation","scheme for addressing these issues which include: - the introduction of some metadata of the source text like date and source of publication useful for source attribution during opinion and argumentation analysis - the introduction of the date of the opinion or event in case of a temporal analysis (opinion evolution), - the parameters for identifying arguments and for determining the orientation of their supports, - the evaluation of the strength determining attributes like the levels of commitment (expressed via the use of different report and modal verbs) - and other forms of expressions indicating direct, relative and persuasion strengths (mostly involving words or phrases consisting of a combination of one or more adjectives, adverbs, intensifiers and pre-modifiers or even in isolation). Annotating argumentation in opinionated texts and particularly news editorials is certainly not an easy task. This is because the underlying process can be very involved depending upon the structure of the editorials. Our experience has shown that this is quite a complicated process as the argumentation structure in such texts does not necessarily resemble the standard forms of rational thinking or reasoning."]},{"title":"1152","paragraphs":["Similarly, the editorial argumentation structure does not necessarily always fit into one of the argumentation schemes as discussed by Toulmin (2008): “Data→Warrant→Conclusion”","or “Data→Warrant→Unless Rebuttal→Conclusion”. To make things even more complicated, the possible association of the strength of an argument with the standard notion of validity does not exactly fit in case of persuasive texts and hence editorials. There are other parameters like specific exceptions and exclusions that would need to be taken into consideration as argued by Kolflaath (2007). In persuasive texts, in order to perform an argumentation analysis, we would need to take into consideration several correlated aspects like text, author, purpose, audience, context as revealed by Silva Rhetoricae (www.rhetoricae.byu.edu). This encompasses rhetorical analysis, an important domain of engagement in text analysis."]},{"title":"Finally, editorials are abound with irony, over-emphasis, provocations, etc. which tend to prevent the reader from making an objective analysis. 2. Building a Corpus of Editorials and Making Preparations for Annotation","paragraphs":["We have collected the editorials from three different sources being published from Nepal and others from a number of sources in India and English journals around the world. The editorials we have selected are related to a common theme – “Socio-political” and are taken from different dates towards the end of 2007 and till the mid of 2009 amounting a total of around 500 text files, with a total of 8000 sentences and an average of 20 sentences per editorial. The texts covering events of Nepal are taken respectively from journals with varying political affiliations: The Kathmandu Post Daily 2",", The Nepali Times Weekly3","and The Spotlight Weekly4",". We also have added to our collection editorials from the online electronic resources 5",", that contain editorials from different national and international newspapers published on a monthly basis. These editorials basically write about some of the prime events that have taken place in Nepal or around the world in a particular month. Considering non-Nepali journals is of much significance since their styles are quite different and their analysis is less committed to a certain local political party or orientation. While making preparations for annotating the editorials, it should be noted that often not all portions of the editorials are useful for argumentation or opinion analysis. An important point in identifying argumentation in texts is that the whole argumentation unit is in general composed 2 http://ekantipur.com/ktmpost.php 3 http://nepalitimes.com.np 4 http://nepalnews.com/spotlight.php 5 http://nepalmonitor.com of at least two parts – a claim part and a justification part (respectively a conclusion and its support). The claim part puts forward an opinion or statement on an issue and the justification part provides support to the statement being put forward. In fact, how persuasive an argument is and what persuasion effect it has, largely depends on how effectively the justification part is employed and its contextual environment. Similarly, rhetorical relations alter the strengths of these supports and correspondingly arguments. Non-argumentative units from the text which do not play a role in providing direct or indirect supports to an argument (in this case the claim), may be ignored while annotating. For illustration purpose, we present an excerpt of an editorial text and underline its argumentative units in Table 1: Opening statement/claim/conclusion: 2007 was a violent year full of conflicts and confusions. Text: Nepali leftists have always had a flair for pompous rhetoric. Pushpa Kamal Dahal and BabuRam Bhattarai insist on using a paragraph to say what they can in one sentence. So we have a 23-point agreement among the seven parties in which the communists commit themselves, once again, to constituent assembly elections. Nepal has been declared a republic, but it will only take formal effect sometimes in the middle of next year after it is ratified by the constituent assembly. But the king is in his palace, still paid a salary by tax-payers money.","Table 1: Argumentative and non-argumentative fragments in editorial text In the text above, the contents is analyzed with respect to the opening statement or claim, which is also sometimes referred to as the concluding statement. The result of the analysis shows that the text portion in italics belongs to the non-argumentative unit as it does not convey any direct or indirect association with the opening statement or claim. On the other hand, the remaining blocks of texts with certain underlined fragments belong to the argumentative part as they convey, possibly via inferences, supports for the opening statement. The decision of labeling the text fragments belonging to argumentative or non-argumentative units in the above text is purely manual and based on human analysis. It is obvious that automation efforts would require developing sophisticated linguistic methods and analysis. As part of the corpus analysis, we are also studying argumentation schemes in news editorials by conducting a careful analysis of the general argumentation structure found in the corpus. While we would be also looking at more general argumentation schemes (deductive, inductive and presumptive), our major focus would be on identifying the structure and occurrences of defeasible schemes in news editorials. This information would be vital in analyzing the change in opinions over time. We will attempt to apply the identified argumentation"]},{"title":"1153","paragraphs":["schemes for classifying the different argumentation instances from the corpus."]},{"title":"3. An Overview of the Annotation Scheme","paragraphs":["As a result of the analysis of our corpus of editorials, we have developed a semantic tag set specifically designed for the annotation of the editorials; a sample is shown below in"]},{"title":"Table 2","paragraphs":[". The values associated with the tags are subject to change. Parameters Possible values Argument_type Support, Conclusion,","Rhetorical_relation Expression_type Fact, Opinion, Undefined Fact_authority Yes, No Opinion_orientation Positive, Negative, Neutral Orientation_support For, Against ID Id number of the support Date Date of publication of the","Editorial Source Source or name of the","newspaper Commitment Modal, Low, High Conditional Yes, No Direct-strength Low, Average, High Relative-strength Low, Average, High Persuasion-effect Low, Average, High Rhetoric_relation type Exemplification, Contrast, Discourse Frame, Justification, Elaboration, Paraphrase, Cause-effect, Result, Explanation, Reinforcement Table 2: Semantic tagset","Below, we briefly explain the designated purpose of each","of the tags:","- Fact_authority: level of authority of the author,","- Orientation_support: for or against the controversial issue being studied,","- Conditional: contains a conditional expression that limits the scope of the utterance,","- Direct_strength: the intrinsic strength of the utterance measures from the terms it contains,","- Relative_strength: measures the strength of the utterance in comparison with the other utterances of the same document: the idea is to take into account the author’s style.","- Persuasion_effect captures the persuasive force of the utterance, this is quite different from the strength.","- Rhetoric_relation is a specific tag introduced to identify utterances which have a rhetorical relation with others, they are not necessarily arguments or opinions. The semantic tag set above has been tested for coverage in annotating some 56 editorials from our corpus of varying topics and structures. The use of the tag set for annotation on the corpus has been experimented manually as well using automatic diagramming tools like Araucaria (http://araucaria.computing.dundee.ac.uk/doku.php) and Athena (http://www.athenasoft.org/) . While we found the tools quite robust in terms of producing argumentation diagrams and correspondingly developing argumentation mark-up language - AML text (applicable in case of Araucaria), they clearly lack the provision for introducing rhetorical relations in the whole argumentation outlining setup. The assessment of the strength of an argument is provisioned in the Athena software on a [0-100]% scale. However, specialization of the strengths of arguments on the basis of varied parameters (direct-strength, relative-strength and persuasion effect) as in our case, is not available even with the Athena software. We present at the end of this document examples of this annotation in diagrammatic forms (Figures 1 and 2). In Figure 1, the labels denoted by broken and dotted arrow forms and coming out of the conclusion and support nodes are rhetorical relations that further develop (paraphrase, explain, exemplify, produce results etc.) supports or conclusions. Such a development with the help of rhetorical relations adds persuasion effects or strength to the arguments (supports and conclusion). In the diagram shown in Figure 2, the tree structure has the root node as the conclusion or the main thesis of the argumentation. The child nodes below the root node are the positive and the negative supports to the given conclusion. The positive supports, characterized by “For the Conclusion” are denoted by green color nodes while the negative supports, characterized by “Against the Conclusion” are represented in red. The yellow part represents the detailed information on each node (the conclusion and the supports) elaborated by the attributes – date, source, orientation, strength etc. The figures in percentages reflect the subjective weights or estimates placed by any human annotator or analyzer with respect to how convincing and to what degree an argument is in terms of providing either a positive or a negative support."]},{"title":"4. Linguistic Basis for Distinguishing Facts and Opinions","paragraphs":["Since editorials are usually a mix of facts and opinions, there is apparently a need to make a distinction between them. Opinions often express an attitude towards something. This can be a judgment, a view or a conclusion or even an opinion about opinion(s). Different approaches have been suggested to distinguish facts from opinions. Generally, facts are characterized by the presence of certain verbs like “declare” and specific tenses or a number forms of the verb to be. Moreover, statements interpreted as facts are generally accompanied by some reliable authority providing the evidence of the claim. Opinions, on the other hand, are characterized by the evaluative expressions of various sorts such as the following - Dunworth (2008):","a) Presence of evaluative adverbs and adjectives in","sentences – “ugly” and “disgusting”.","b) Expressions denoting doubt and probability –","“may be”, “possibly”, “probably”, “perhaps”,","“may”, “could” etc.","c) Presence of epistemic expressions – “I think”, “I","believe”, “I feel”, “In my opinion” etc."]},{"title":"1154","paragraphs":["It is obvious that the distinction between facts and opinions is not straightforward. Facts could well be opinions in disguise and, in such cases, the intention of the author as well as the reliability of the information needs to be verified. In order to make a finer distinction between facts and opinions and within opinions themselves, opinions are proposed for gradation as shown below in Table 3: Opinion type Global definition Hypothesis statements Explains an observation.

Attitude statements Based on implied belief system. Table 3: Gradation of Opinions","Source:[www.clc.uc.edu/documents_cms/TLC/","Fact_and_Opinion.ppt]"]},{"title":"5. Maintaining an Opinion Lexicon","paragraphs":["For the purpose of developing a linguistic base in order to identify opinions (opinion words or phrases) in texts, we developed a dedicated Sentiment/Polarity lexicon with opinion words and expressions collected from the corpus categorized into prototypically positive and negative sets. Next, by consulting the available electronic resources like dictionaries, thesaurus and WordNet, we manually increased the size of the lexicon by introducing semantically related terms to the already compiled entries from the corpus. This gives the opportunity of compiling a rich collection of opinions – both context dependent (phrases from the corpus) and context independent (words from dictionaries and other sources). Moreover, as part of the lexicon building, we group semantically similar members within the bigger sets into smaller subsets. Below, we provide a sample of the sentiment/polarity lexicon in Table 4: Positive Negative Peace-{peace(n),peaceful (adj), accord(n),pact(n),treaty(n ), pacification(n),pacify(v), peacefulness(n),serenity( n)} Infamy–{infamy(n),discre dit(n),disrepute(n),notoriet y(n), infamous(n),dishonor(n), notorious(adj)} Happy-{happy(adj),happi ness(n), felicitous(adj),glad(adj), willing(adj),happiness(n), felicity(n)} Height of impunity, drama of consensus. Table 4: Sentiment/Polarity lexicon Besides detecting the polarity of opinions as Positive, Negative or Neutral, it is equally important to determine the strength of the opinions (e.g.: Weak, Strong, Mildly Weak, and Mildly Strong, etc.). The widely used approach is making use of comparative relations, i.e. adjective degrees (positive – low, comparative - average, superlative - high), but this approach is really limited and can only be used on large collections of documents. We additionally suggest considering intensifiers, pre-modifiers, report verbs and modal verbs in this regard. We have developed the Intensifier and Pre-modifier lexicons, which basically consist of adverbs and pre-modifiers. The latter come in front of adverbs and adjectives. Both the intensifiers and pre-modifiers play a role in conveying a greater and/or lesser emphasis to something. Intensifiers are reported to have three different functions – emphasis, amplification and downtoning. We give below a sample of the intensifier lexicon in Table 5."]},{"title":"Type Value","paragraphs":["Emphasizer Really: truly, genuinely, actually. Simply: merely, just, only, plainly.

The ## set of words, similarly, has an average commitment or intent level and hence has average or medium strength effects. Finally, the ### set of words has a low commitment or intent level and hence has low strength effects. The evaluation of the various forms of strengths, based on these factors is under investigations, via a metrics that we are testing. 6. Discovering the General Opinion Patterns in the Corpus of Editorials Since our ultimate aim would be to achieve an accurate analysis of at least domain dependent editorials, it would be very necessary that we define the general opinion patterns prevalent in editorials of the theme under investigation, “Socio-Political”. Below in Table 9, we report a sample of such Opinion Patterns from the corpus. This work is still under development, together with the study of its extension to other domains.

Evaluation of the Annotations","paragraphs":["The collected texts have been annotated in the XML format using the semantic tag set described above by two annotators having a good knowledge and understanding of the English language. The inter-annotator agreement kappa value was approximately 0.80, which means there was substantial agreement between the annotators. The disagreements were basically noted for three attributes – Expression_Type (with values Fact, Opinion, Undefined), Opinion_Orientation (with values Positive, Negative and Neutral) and Orientation_Support (with values For or Against). The annotated corpus was peer reviewed for inconsistency checks. The disagreements were resolved by mutual discussions as well as consultation with experts.

Further, we would be possibly extending our annotation scheme and consequently the annotation work keeping in mind the different argumentation schemes in news editorials and their varying roles in the analysis of the changes of opinions over time.
