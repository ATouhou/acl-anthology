Most often, due to lack of resources, manual verification and annotation of electronic text material is a prerequisite for the development of NLP tools. In the context of under-resourced language, the lack of copora becomes a crucial problem because most of the research efforts are supported by organizations with limited funds. Using free, multilingual and highly structured corpora like Wikipedia to produce automatically labeled language resources can be an answer to those needs. This paper introduces NLGbAse, a multilingual linguistic resource built from the Wikipedia encyclopedic content. This system produces structured metadata which make possible the automatic annotation of corpora with syntactical and semantical labels. A metadata contains semantical and statistical informations related to an encyclopedic document. To validate our approach, we built and evaluated a Named Entity Recognition tool, trained with Wikipedia corpora annotated by our system."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["Easy access to language resources is crucial for experiments in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Information Extraction (IE) and Retrieval (IR) tasks. Such resources, like annotated corpora, domain dependent labeled corpora or lexicons, are an essential part of evaluation, software prototyping and design implementation. Most often, due to lack of resources, manual verification and annotation of electronic text material like corpora is a prerequisite for the development of NLP tools. In this paper, we present NLGbAse, a multilingual NLP resource built from the Wikipedia encyclopedic content. It produces structured metadata and annotated corpora with syntactical and semantical labels, from any language edition of Wikipedia. Our approach is validated by experiments on a Named Entity Recognition (NER) task. The NER tool used is trained on annotated corpora generated by our system. The results obtained by this NER system on NER evaluation campaign test sets confirm its reliability and the potential of the proposed method. This paper is structured as follow. First we present existing structured resources extracted or derived from Wikipedia and describe our proposition. Then we explain how we extract the metadata from Wikipedia, and generate with those metadata, rich multilingual annotated corpora. Next, we illustrate one application of our system, with training of a multilingual NER application. We finally evaluate results obtained with this NER tool and conclude with description of our future development."]},{"title":"2. Wikipedia as NLP resource","paragraphs":["With most of NLP applications, significant performance gains can be obtained with an increasing of available data and improvement of its quality, rather than algorithm complexity. This is illustrated by the increasingly popular use 1 Contribution of the first author have been done has affiliate of","Laboratoire Informatique d’Avignon of the web as a very large and exhaustive corpus. It seems therefore natural to exploit the web knowledge to try to discover semantic informations, useful relationships between named entities mentioned in text documents, or to solve the name disambiguation problem. As it’s an open, collaborative, and rapidly growing encyclopedia on the Web, Wikipedia is considered as one of the most promising resources to extract knowledge dedicated to NLP applications. Many methods have been proposed to transform Wikipedia into structured content like DBpedia (Auer et al., 2007) or Yago (Suchanek et al., 2007) improvement . Other proposition experiment the transformation of the encyclopedic content into various forms of lexicons. Those lexicons are used for identification and disambiguation tasks, and more specifically, to improve Named Entity Recognition (NER) systems. In (Bunescu and Pasca, 2006) a named entity disambiguation method is presented that is intrinsically linked to a dictionary mapping proper names to their possible named entity denotations. The use of Wikipedia as external knowledge to improve NER is also explored by (Kazama and Torisawa, 2007) . The described method retrieves the corresponding Wikipedia entry for each candidate word sequence and extracts a category label from the first sentence of the entry, which can be thought of as a definition part. These category labels are used as features in a CRF-based NE tagger. 2.1. Architecture of proposed system Our idea is to extract lexical resources from Wikipedia, then to use those resources to produce labeled corpus, usable to train NLP applications like NER tools. Lexical resources are metadata extracted from the Wikipedia content. Those metadata represent each encyclopedic article as a concept, described by its possible surface writing forms, a set of contextual words and a category tag. Labeled corpus component of the system is the Wikipedia corpus augmented by Part Of Speech and Named Entities tags. Finally, we use this labeled corpus to train a NER system. ."]},{"title":"2621 3. Extraction of metadata from Wikipedia","paragraphs":["According to the Wikipedia DTD, each description of an encyclopedic object is associated with its name as a unique database key. For example, if two objects share the same name (i.e. Martin Gray), the unique key for each object is distinguished by a complementary information included in parentheses such as Martin Gray (Photographer) or Martin Gray (Holocaust Survivor). Moreover, a disambiguation page Martin Gray (disambiguation) is instantiated and contains a link to the two different pages. The disambiguation page is the first displayed page in case the user submits an ambiguous request. Several words or locutions can denote an encyclopedic object. For example, Paris is also called Ville Lumière or Métropole franca̧ise. This situation entails the instantiation of a special empty Wikipedia page, named redirect page for each alternate word or locution. The redirect page includes a single redirection to the main page describing the encyclopedic object. We consider all the characteristics of the Wikipedia internal structure to extract the metadata. For each encyclopedic article, a corresponding metadata is extracted. It consists of a semantic graph of all writing forms, a set of weighted words extracted from the encyclopedic article description and a taxonomic class label (such as PERson, ORGanization, LOCation). The example of the metadata associated to the “Shinkansen” encyclopedic article is depicted in figure 1. Figure 1: The NLGbAse metadata representation with surface forms, class of entity and contextual words with their tf.idf weight. A sequential process provides the metadata set as follow:","1. For each article of Wikipedia we create a metadata instance.","2. We explore all redirection and disambiguation pages of Wikipedia linked to this article to include in the metadata instance a graph representation of all its possible writing forms. 3. We collect all the terms from the textual description of the Wikipedia article and calculate their tf.idf weight. We include all pairs of terms and weight in metadata instance","4. We use a classification system to associate a class label to the metadata instance. 3.1. Metadata extraction process Formalization of steps 1,2 and 3 can be expressed as follow. Considering C, the Wikipedia corpus. Inside C, exists some Cl","representing a linguistic edition of Wikipedia (i.e fr.wikipedia.org or en.wikipedia.org are independent language sub-corpus of the whole Wikipedia). Each Wikipedia article D ∈ Cl","is required to be associated with properties D = (D.t, D.w, D.l). Property D.t is the title of an article, made of words, D.w is a collection of words contained in the Wikipedia article, D.l is a set of links between D and other Wikipedia pages of C. The D.l links can be internal redirection inside Cl","(a link from a redirection page or a disambiguation page) or C (in this case, a link to the same article in an other language). The Metadata E have properties E = (E.t, E.w, E.r, E.k). We consider that E and D are in relation if and only if, E.t = D.t. This means E → D. E.w contain twins built with all words of D.w associated with their T f.Idf value calculated from Cl",". All possible writing surface forms for a metadata are collected trough heuristics in Wikipedia articles linked in D.l, and then stored in E.r . 3.2. Classification process Step 4 is performed as follow. The property E.k is a class label, according to taxonomy model of a NER tasks (i.e PERS for a person or LOC.GEO for a geographic place). The classification process is based on a combination of SVM, Boostexter, naive bayes classifiers and heuristics applied on the text content of the Wikipedia article. It has been described in (Charton and Torres-Moreno, 2009). The final accuracy of the classification process is around 0.92% using the ESTER 2 taxonomy model (i.e PROD ase general product tag and subclasses like PROD.VEHICLE for a vehicle description). The final accuracy of the classification task is around 0.92% for a ESTER 2 like taxonomy model1 (PERS, ORG, LOC, PROD, FONC and 32 subclasses). The amount of entity descriptions presented in table 3.2. are obtained from three language editions of Wikipedia, transformed in metadata."]},{"title":"4. Rich labeled corpus generation","paragraphs":["Next, we use the generated metadata to automatically build rich labeled corpora. Those corpora are then used to train a NER system. Considering that we hold now a metadata representation for each Wikipedia encyclopedic article. Each metadata representation includes a graph of surface form describing how the entity corresponding to the article can be written and a class label describing the NE category of the entity. The basic principle of this phase is to use the internal links between pages of Wikipedia in conjunction with the metadata to automatically label Wikipedia texts corpora. 1 see http://www.afcp-parole.org/ester/ for naming convention"]},{"title":"2622","paragraphs":["PERS ORG LOC PROD FONC TIME UNK FR 232027 87052 183729 96571 1588 18871 130530 EN 754586 305706 565941 326155 3783 13575 468829 ES 84623 58600 93030 51427 41 2048 92462 Table 1: Named entity classes of objects contained in three Wikipedia encyclopedic editions Basically the process can be described with the following example: inside the Wikipedia article related to Victor Hugo, there is some internal links to Wikipedia objects like Panthéon, Besanco̧n, the Napoléon III Emperor, etc. With the metadata class label E.k, we know that Panthéon is a Location (LOC.FAC class label), Besanco̧n is a city (LOC.ADMI class label) and Napoléon III is a person (PERS.HUM class label). According to this, we can produce a version of the Victor Hugo Wikipedia article labeled with NE tags. This is possible because each internal links contained in the encyclopedic text description is related to an encyclopedic object and we know the class of each encyclopedic object by its metadata representation. Consequently, the labeled generated file, derived from a Wikipedia encyclopedic corpus, is built as follows. We explore sequentially each word of the text description of the encyclopedic object. We encounter two cases: either a word or a group of words is linked to another encyclopedic object of Wikipedia; or words are just part of text and are not associated with any internal links. If a word or group of words is linked, we search the class label E.k of the metadata E related to the encyclopedic article linked, and we associate this label to the word sequence as a NE tag. To illustrate the process, let’s consider the following sentence, extracted with its wiki syntax2","from the English Wikipedia corpus:","• The national team of [[Kenya national football team|Kenya]] is controlled by the [[Kenya Football Federation]]. As we know that in their metadata representations, Kenya encyclopedic article is referenced as LOC object and Kenya Football Federation encyclopedic article is referenced as ORG object, we obtain the following annotated text.","• The national team of <ent begin> Kenya <ent=kenya><tag=LOC> is controlled by the <ent begin> Kenya Football Federation <ent=kenya football federation><tag=ORG>.

SENT The Cd2 representation of Wikipedia content is not sufficient to train a statistical NER system because internal links of the encyclopedia are not exhaustive, and consequently, a lot of unlabeled potential NE remains in corpus. The corpus Cd3 is obtained by rejection of sentences from Cd2 with probable missing labels, determined by logical rules. Un-labeled NE should introduce a bias in the inference learning process. To avoid this, we select from Cd2 the sentences containing probably labeled NE, with a limited set (less than a dozen) of logical rules. For example, we reject sentences containing proper names (NP), numbers (NUM) and words with capital letters, not associated with NE label. Finally, the corpus Cd3 contains sentences that can be used as it for NER system training : Gregory NAM PERS of IN PERS Tours NAM PERS accused VVD UNK Mummolus NAM PERS of IN UNK subjecting VVG UNK many JJ UNK Franks NNS ORG who WP UNK had VHD UNK ..."]},{"title":"5.

The NLGbAse corpus Cd3, derived from Wikipedia, contains enough information to train a conditional random field (CRF) based NER system. A CRF is a discriminative probabilistic model often used for the labeling or parsing of sequential data. For our experiments, we used the CRF++ implementation4",". CRF++ is designed for generic purpose and had been applied to a variety of NLP tasks, such as Named Entity Recognition, Information Extraction and Text Chunking. This software is natively compatible with Cd3 corpus for learning and labeling. CRF++ uses tokens. A token consists of multiple (but fixed-numbers) columns. The definition of tokens depends on tasks, in our application case, they simply correspond to words, POS and NE tags for the learning process, and POS and NE tag for the tagging process. In the context of this article, we train with CRF++ three models for French, English and Spanish language. Training time is about 16 hours for each language with 3 CPU (I7) and 5 gb of memory. Labeling process is in real time."]},{"title":"6. Evaluation and results","paragraphs":["We applied CRF NER system to three evaluation test sets covering French, English and Spanish language. Our performance results are given as micro-averaged precision, recall and F-measure both in terms of ESTER 2 and ACE-2 style scoring. We complete evaluation with the slot error rate (SER) error measure (used as reference in the ESTER 2 campaign). The NE tag set consists of 7 main categories (persons, locations, organizations, products, amounts, time and functions). The tag set considered is therefore more complex than the one used in the NE extraction tasks of the MUC 7 and DARPA HUB 5 programs, where only 3 categories were considered, or the CoNLL tagset (4 tags PER,ORG, LOC, MISC). We evaluated all experiments with the original ESTER 2 categories (PROD, ORG, PERS, LOC, FONC, TIME, AMOUNT) when available in test corpus, or with equivalent categories (i.e GPE from the ACE test corpus is adapted to LOC). 6.1. French test set The French test set come from ESTER 2 evaluation campaign. This named entity (NE) detection task on French was first implemented in ESTER 1 as a prospective task in order to define the first annotation guideline, corpus and scoring tools. The corpus come from broadcast news transcript. In ESTER 2, the task was proposed as a standard one. Two subtasks were defined: detection on the reference transcriptions and detection on automatic transcriptions. For the automatic transcript subtask, in order to precisely 4 Toolkit CRF++:http://crfpp.sourceforge.net/ measure the impact of the WER on named entity detection, three automatic transcripts with different WER were given to the participants. Original results obtained during this campaign are described in (Galliano et al., 2009). 6.2. English test set The English test set corpora come from ACE-2 Version 1.0 evaluation campaign (Doddington et al., 2004). Data sources include audio and image data in addition to pure text, and Arabic and Chinese in addition to English. The entity attributes are the type (person, organization, geopolitical, location, facility, vehicle, weapon) and subtype of the entity, the entity class (specific, generic), and the name(s) of the entity that appear in the source data. Corpora include broadcasts transcripts (comparable to ESTER 2 ne-ref), and labeled documents from newspaper and newswire. We used for our experiments the broadcast transcript test corpus. 6.3.

Discussion Performances of the NER system have to be examined with consideration to it’s nature : it’s an unsupervised system (the CRF training is done with Wikipedia anotated corpora and no particular adaptation to the test conditions), and it is strictly not rule based (the presented results are obtained directly from the output of CRF++ labeling tool). Best systems ranked on reference transcriptions part of evaluation campaign uses both a rule-based approach where thousands of manually written rules are applied in conjunction with very large entity dictionaries. Although these carefully handcrafted knowledge models give excellent performance on a reference transcriptions, there is a clear lack of robustness of these models when applied to speech transcripts or when operate in unsupervised context. Primary objective of our work is to generate automatically robust NER system, using the diversity of languages available in Wikipedia Corpus. Performances of the French NER system are directly comparable to those obtained by systems presented in ESTER 2 evaluation campaign, and specially with the CRF based system (described in (Béchet and Charton, 2010)) that obtained best results on the 3 robustness tasks, and first rank of non-rule based systems on ref task. Our French NER system F-measure performances are similar to this system (+0,02%) and minimize its SER rate ( 19 vs 23.91). Performances of English NER system are not directly comparable to official results of ACE-2 campaign 5","as they are obtained on Dev-Test corpus. However, we obtain a good precision and recall rate regarding to usual performances obtained on broadcast reference transcriptions. Performance of Spanish NER tool is for reference only and to demonstrate the ability of our system to train rapidly and automatically a new linguistic edition of our NER tool."]},{"title":"7. Conclusion","paragraphs":["We have presented NLGbAse, a set of metadata representing encyclopedic concepts contained in Wikipedia. We have shown that, those metadata allow to automatically produce annotated corpora. Those corpora can be used to train statistical annotation tools. We have tested a CRF NER tool trained with the annotated corpora generated by our system, in the context of NER evaluation campaign and obtained interesting results. For evaluation purposes, the taxonomy model of metadata is inspired from NER tasks. But the classification process used to apply this model can be modified for specific applications. We plan to exploit yet unclassified Wikipedia content (like medicine terms, biological terms, animal names) to generate new subject oriented metadata classes 5 see http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/mig//tests/ace/ and labeled corpora. Next, the language coverage of this system will be extended by the progressive inclusion of new linguistic editions, using the 267 available language versions of Wikipedia6",". We plan to update the NER system to Polish, German and Italian languages. The metadata, annotated corpora, and CRF NER models are free to use. They can be downloaded or used on line on their dedicated website7",". They are available in the English, French and Spanish languages. Metadata representation can be browsed on line and a demonstration tool of the NER application is also available."]},{"title":"8.
