The frequency and contextual combination patterns of classical discourse markers and of the vocalic hesitation has been studied. This analysis highlights some specificities in terms of combination patterns of the analyzed items. The classical discourse markers seem to help initiating larger discursive blocks both at initial and medial positions of the ongoing turns. The vocalic hesitation also stand for marking the user’s embarrassments and wish to close the dialog."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["Most often oral messages do not perfectly transcribe to written language. When interacting by speech, humans are involved in a complex process including both message generation proper and interaction handling. As a result, they may produce disfluencies, make mistakes during produc-tion and include signs of dynamic re-planning in the middle of an utterance; acknowledge or ask questions for ground-ing purposes; notice that conversation partners become uncomfortable, upset, argumentative; and take or concede the floor (Traum and Hinkelman, 1992; Heeman and Allen, 1999). It is widely acknowledged that unprepared spoken utterances and more generally oral conversations include a variety of speech events which do not contribute directly to the final message under elaboration as conveyed at the lexical level. However, the conversational level is highly concerned with such events as they contribute to efficiently implement the interaction and carry out interpersonal information. Such items may be qualifyied as words (for example, ok, well, then, in English; alors well, donc now in French, etc.) or non-words (for example, oh, eh, mmhh, uh, um, etc.). They share some commun contextual features, and are designed as discourse markers (Schiffrin, 1987), grunts (Ward, 2006b; Campbell, 2007) or filled pauses (Shriberg, 1994; Shriberg, 2001). This paper deals with the role of some discourse markers and of the vocalic hesitation euh in French man-machine spoken dialogs. According to (Schiffrin, 1987), discourse markers can be defined as set of linguistic expressions that brackets units of talk. (Schiffrin, 1987) includes in a broad class of discourse markers conjuctions (e.g. and, but, or), interjections (oh), adverbs (now, then), and lexicalized phrases (y’know, I mean). As for the filled pauses, they have been initially counted as disfluencies marks (Maclay and Osgood, 1959). More recently (Clark and Tree, 2002) underlined the lexical status of the American English vocalic hesitations uh and um, and confirmed previous assumptions on their interaction management functions. Studies on French confirm cross-language shared properties of discourse markers and vocalic hesitation euh (Ducrot, 1980; Hansen, 1995; Candea, 2000; Vasilescu et al., 2009). Finally, during the last decades, a significant body of work has been dedicated to both discourse markers and filled pauses in the computational area, ((Hovy, 1995; Shriberg, 2001; Litman et al., 2005; Litman and Hirschberg, 1990; Adda-Decker et al., 2003), etc.). Studies focused on their acoustic/prosodic and linguistic discriminant features, on the automatic identification and classification of such events for the automatic speech recognition or dialog modeling purposes, or to study their impact on automatic speech recognition performance. What about man-machine conversations? Generally, automatic generation systems aim at producing straightforward answers to questions. When in trouble, they either ask for missing information or tend to close the interaction on failure. Earlier research on man-machine dialog for travelling applications (Lamel et al., 2000) highlighted the need for more flexible interaction strategies. In the field of human-machine interface research, building dialog systems that can handle social conventions is one of the ultimate objectives. Most work on real-time social conventions concentrates on turn-taking (Ward, 2006a; Edlund et al., 2005) and responsiveness (Ward and Tsukahara, 2003). In order to improve the naturalness of human-machine interaction, some studies investigate the recognition and generation of emotions. Most of these studies have been conducted in the field of multimodality (Cowie et al., 2001) and of animated conversational agents (Cole et al., 2003). However, in the field of man-machine conversation, up to now few systems make a smart usage of such discourse structuring items to facilitate the interaction1",". The major aim of this study is then to improve the interaction possibilities in man-machine dialog by an appropriate usage of such discourse markers, including items clas-1 This aim has been expressed by (Swerts, 1998)"]},{"title":"2450","paragraphs":["sically defined as discourse markers, but also filled pauses.

The R","paragraphs":["ITEL"]},{"title":"system","paragraphs":["Spoken interaction has the potential to be very helpful to humans in information retrieval applications. However, a lack of proactivity and perceived cooperativity was judged as stifling in earlier implementations. To mimic the human behavior and to keep up the naturalness of the dialog with the human user, dialog systems must reproduce the linguistic phenomena corresponding to discourse markers including filled pauses and react efficiently both to the semantic content of the question as carried by the lexical level and to the additional information conveyed by the discourse markers. Moreover, systems need to introduce such items in appropriate places within their responses to ease communication and receptivity by human listeners. The RITEL project aims at providing userfriendly access to open-domain information via spoken interaction (Rosset et al., 2006; van Schooten et al., 2007; Toney et al., 2008). This system integrates a spoken language dialog system and an open-domain information retrieval system in order to enable human users to ask general question and to refine their search for information interactively. 2.1. System architecture We provide a brief overview of the RITEL system architecture. A more detailed description ca be found in (Rosset et al., 2006).

The Speech Activity Detection and the Automatic Speech Recognition components are fully described in (van Schooten et al., 2007). Analysis of both indexed documents and user utterances are handled by the same module which is called Non Contextual Analysis (NCA) because no information from the dialogue or previous utterances is used. . The Question Answering system is described in (Rosset et al., 2008). The indexing server’s main role is to retrieve snippets, i.e. lines of documents corresponding to a given query. Queries take the form of a list of named entities and answer types. Candidate answers are ranked according to the scoring mechanism detailed in (Rosset et al., 2008). 2.2. Data processing The data collected during different evaluations of the RITEL system ((Rosset and Petel, 2006; Rosset et al., 2006; van Schooten et al., 2007; Toney et al., 2008)) has been used in this study. The overall corpus has been tagged with the Ritel analyzer. The analysis is non-contextual because each sentence (or turn or speech segment) is processed in isolation. The general objective of this analysis is to find the bits of information that may be of use for search and extrac-tion, which we call relevant information chunks. These can be of different categories: named entities, linguistic entities (e.g. verbs, prepositions), or specific entities (e.g. scores). The entity definition on which the system is based is hierarchical. This system is rule-based and uses WMatch (Galibert, 2009) This engine matches (and substitutes) regular expressions using words as the base unit instead of characters. This property enables the use of classes (lists of words) and macros (sub-expressions in a larger expression). WMatch includes also NLP-oriented features like strategies for prioritizing rule application, recursive substitution modes, word tagging (for tags like noun, verb, etc.), word categories (number, acronym, proper name, etc.). Analysis is multipass, and subsequent rule applications operate on the results of previous rule applications which can be enriched or modified. The RITEL analyzer provides more than 300 different types classes of words and multi-word expressions, most of them being semantic and close to some NE definition. The figure 2 shows an example of such an analysis."]},{"title":"3.

Examples of discourse markers in the RITEL corpus Whereas the RITEL system provides answers with different levels of accuracy and without any use of discourse markers/hesitations, human users show variable propensity to negotiate with the system by rephrasing up to a dozen of times the initial question. They make use of different rephrasing techniques and employ such items with different aims. The examples below illustrate for instance typical occur-rences of discourse markers in the RITEL corpus. In the Example 1 alors and euh are employed as discourse markers. The two items behave as turn-initiators, the turn-opening function being frequently carried out by the analyzed items (almost half of the discourse markers occur at the beginning of a speaker turn, as detailed in section 5.). In this example, the speaker makes use of the rephrasing strategy four times to question the RITEL system. S/he starts with a question in which the only discourse marker is the discourse particle alors (now) which stands here for a mark of turn-initiation. Then, s/he uses rephrasing four times, each time employing the filled pauseeuh as turn-initiator but also to search for a phrase (Q2","2) or only for a word (Q2","3). Finally, in Q2","5, s/he employs the same filled pause with a different function: as turn and dialog-ending initiator. • Example 1 Q2 1: alors j’ aimerais savoir qui a inventé la théorie des avantages comparatifs (I would like to know who invented the comparative advantages theory) Q2 2: euh je cherche le nom d’ un économiste qui a inventé la théorie des avantages comparatifs (uh I’m looking for the name of the economist who invented the theory of comparative advantages) Q2 3: euh je souhaiterais euh connaître le nom de celui qui fut l’ inventeur de la théorie des avantages comparatifs (uh I would like uh to know the name of the person who invented the theory of the comparative advantages) Q2 4: j’ ai déjà répondu à cette question je voudrais savoir de quand date la théorie des avantages comparatifs et qui l’ a mise au point (I already answered to this question and I would like to know when the theory of the comparative advantages was invented and who invented it) Q2 5: euh non ça n’ est pas euh ça n’ est pas euh le sujet de (uh/um no it’s not uh/um it’s not uh/um the topic) In Example 2, the first question (Q1","1) does not exhibit discourse markers, but then as the human speaker is confronted with a wrong answer, h/she makes use of a rephrasing strategy in order to get a more appropriate reaction from the automatic system. Q1","2 and Q1","3 illustrate this strategy (rephrasing). The filled pauseeuh stands for turn-initiation and for speaker’s effort to put the first question in other words. • Example 2 Q1 1: je voudrais savoir combien il y a d’ aéroports internationaux à Marseille (I would like to know how many international airports are there in Marseilles)? Q1 2: euh j’ aimerais connaître le nombre de d’ aéroports internationaux dans la ville de Marseille (uh I would like to know the the number of international airports around the city of Marseilles)? Q1 3: euh je voudrais savoir combien d’ aéroports compte la ville de Marseille s’il-vous-plaît (uh I would like to know how many international airports are located around the city of Marseilles please)? The examples discussed here suggest that the filled pause euh carries the following functions: turn initiation, and also phrase search within a rephrasing strategy. In addition, the user employs of discourse particles to initiate the dialog such as alors in Example 1. 3.2. Selected data description In this study we make use of the data obtained through the methodology described in section 2. The RITEL corpus contains 652 dialogues with more than 6 hours from user turns. There are 6720 user turns comprising a total of 71 089 lexical items (tokens), with a total of 3434 distinct lexical words (types). Discourse markers are then present in 1718 that is 25.56% of the utterances of the RITEL corpus. The Table 1 gives a summary of the RITEL corpus.

As for the hesitations, the filled pause euh may also indicate the words or phrases prone to rephrasing and which are not optimally processed by the RITEL system. That means if the speaker rephrases the question or the particular regions of a question using a classical discourse marker or a hesitation as initiators, the broad lexical context of such elements may point out the problematic speech region for the RITEL system. Discourse markers may stand for rephrasing plans of the human speakers, namely to put in other words the utterance or only a salient region with the final aim of getting more responsiveness from the RITEL system. In order to highlight the spoken regions of interest, we conducted a study on the discourse markers combination patterns with different dialog tags. Different lexical contexts prior to/following the discourse markers have been considered. In this purpose, the word and multi-word tags obtained through the methodology described in section 2.2. have been clustered in two main classes. The obtained classes gather two types of lexical items and multi-word expressions, that is:","PM pragmatics markers which group speech act markers (e.g. <Dialog-opening> hello </dialog-opening>, <Qdial> I’m looking for </Qdial>, <Qnegdial> I’m not looking for </Qnegdial>) and question markers (e.g. <Qwho> who </Qwho> wrote..., <Qmeasure> how many </Qmeasure>)","RIC relevant information chunks, that is linguistic chunks which regroup extended named entities ( e.g. <loc>La Valette</loc>, <pers>Victor Hugo</pers>) and other linguistic chunks (i.e. lexical items/syntagms which are not in one of the previous categories). The rationale behind the clustering is that classes of words and multi-word expressions may be categorized in the RITEL corpus according to the final aim of the study, which is to delimit the relevant information chunks prone to rephrasing, e.g. RIC. Then words and multi-word expressions may belong to the class of RIC, or serve other purposes, mainly interactional. The global class of pragmatic markers assemble all lexical items and expressions which are not salient linguistic chunks or discourse markers. As illustrated by Figure 3, discourse markers may initiate rephrasing at two major points of a speaker turn: at the beginning of the utterance as a global initiation of the whole sentence; or within the utterance pointing on a local region to rephrase (word or phrase). As for Figure 2, it shows the output of the RITEL analyzer after clustering the different dialog tags as pragmatic markers PM or relevant information chunks RIC. The cooccurrence of discourse markers versus PM or RIC has been considered in different combination patterns within a maximum scope of two tags.

Table 3 summarizes the lexical entries concerned with the combinatorial analysis. One may notice that the great majority of the data is represented by relevant information chunks RIC (65.2 %). Delimiting such chunks with the help of discourse markers is the final objective of this work. Then 17.7 % of the data are represented by the pragmatic markers PM. Both PM and RIC may occur in the neighborhood of discourse markers, however the position of discourse markers in the speaker turn is expected to correlate with a particular initiation role, e.g. global (utterance) or local (word/phrase) initiation.

Table 5 shows that both CDM and euh are followed in their great majority by pragmatic markers when in initial position (INIT(+1)). On the reverse, the medial position favours the occurence of relevant information chunks after euh (65 %) versusCDM (43 %). The right context patterns are somehow different for classical discourse markers and for the vocalic hesitation. The latter is more often followed by relevant information chunks whereas the classical discourse markers equally occur next to pragmatic markers and relevant information chunks. This tendency supports the hypothesis of the word/phrase search marker of the vocalic hesitation: this function is generally acknowledged and in this paper we look for evidence to support similar behavior of the analyzed items. As for the CDM, the distribution in the neigborhood of both PM and RIC is to confirm in further studies: such items seem to be specifically prone to initiate global rephrasing than the vocalic hesitation. When occuring in the initial position, the turn-initiation function is non-ambiguous for both CDM and vocalic hesitations. The left context patterns of the discourse markers follow the same tendency, i.e. the vocalic hesitation being surrounded by RIC, whereas the CDM occuring in both RIC and PM contexts. Finally, only the vocalic hesitation may fill the final position of the speaker turn, preceded in majority by RIC. This distribution supports the idea that CDM are obviously to be related to rephrasing strategies, whereas the vocalic hesitation may fill other pragmatic functions. Speakers seem to make use of vocalic hesitations to notify turn or dialog ending and to possibly mark an embarassement due to the unsuccesful interaction with the system. 5.2. 3-gram patterns Tables 7 and 6 below summarize the 3-gram combination patterns. The same factors as for the 2-grams are considered to display the data. Tables show the three most frequent patterns, whereas the remaining combinations are listed as \"Others\". The differences observed for CDM versus euh patterns according to the position in the speaker turn (initial, medial and final) are supported by the 3-grams specificities. Whereas both CDM and euh are followed by a pragmatic marker and a relevant information chunk in initial position, the medial position correlates with different patterns. The most frequent right (n+2) context for euh is two relevant information chunks (59.32 %), whereas CDM may be followed equally by two relevant information chunks or a pragmatic marker and a relevant information chunk (30.8 % of combinations). Concerning the left bigrams, euh distribution confirms the global tendency of being in a RIC context if the speaker hesitates in the middle of the utterance.

Conclusion","paragraphs":["We presented here a preliminary analysis of the role of some discourse markers and the vocalic hesitation euh in the RITEL corpus. The RITEL corpus has been obtained through an open-domain question/answering system and consists in speaker turns from human interlocutors who question the automatic system. The relatively poor responsivenes of the early stage of the RITEL system leads to the systematic use of rephrasing strategies and humans are will-ing to put the same question in other words up to dozen of times. The corpus was annotated to delimit strings of words mainly serving interactional purposes, termed pragmatic markers (PM), from the relevant information chunks (RIC) typically prone to rephrasing. The occurrence of discourse markers, both classical items and filled pauseseuh, and their contextual combinations with PM and RIC have been examined with the long term objective improving the naturalness of the RITEL system in two possible ways: (i) an improved spotting of relevant information chunks within the questions; (ii) introducing discourse marker generation and hesitation capacities within the RITEL response module. The proposed analysis highlighted combinatorial specificities of the discourse markers and hesitations with respect to the considered PM and RIC classes. Concerning the general rephrasing, both classical discourse markers and filled pauses are used to initiate the speaker turn, whereas euh is more frequent to initiate local word/phrase search. The classical discourse markers, apart from being less frequent in our corpus than the vocalic hesitation, seem to help initiating larger discursive blocks both at the initial and medial positions of the ongoing speaker turn. Finally, the relative frequency of the vocalic hesitation may be linked to other contextual functions than rephrasing: as the human speaker is confronted with unsuccessful answers in the course of the dialog, vocalic hesitations may also stand for marking his/her embarassement and wish to close the dialog. Discourse markers and vocalic hesitations will further be examined in relation with the speaker turn position within the dialog. Future work will address the corpus-related functions of different items acting as markers of discourse and dialog structure in the RITEL system, as well as implementations to improve the capacities of the RITEL system ."]},{"title":"7.
