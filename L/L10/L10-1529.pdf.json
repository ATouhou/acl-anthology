The verb lexicon in its current state has 173 classes which contain 4392 verbs and 498 frames providing information about verb root, the deverbal form of the verb, the participle, thematic roles, subcategorisation frames and syntactic and semantic descriptions of each verb. The taxonomy is available in XML format. It can be ported to MYSQL, YAML or JSON and accessed either in Arabic characters or in the Buckwalter transliteration."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["Class-based approaches to verb lexicon that provide key elements information about the syntax and semantic enjoy a popularity in a variety of natural language tasks including machine translation, document classification (Klavans and Kan, 1998), semantic role labeling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), sense disambiguation (Dang, 2004), and subcategorisation acquisition (Korhonen and Briscoe, 2004). A prominent large scale lexical resource that uses the notion of verb classes is Verbnet for Engish. Despite the universality postulate asserting that verb-classes can be identified across languages (Jackendoff, 1990), only few languages dispose of standardized collections of verb-classes or a verb lexicon. Most theoretical work on verb classes for Arabic does not result in a verb lexicon, not least because the approaches are still controversial. The contentious issue is the correlation between morphological basic forms (root, stem, etymon) and the meaning as well as the organsation in the lexicon. The common approach to verb classes in Arabic is a root based approach, which claims that the core meaning of a verb is carried by a root consisting of 2-4 consonants in a specific order which guarantee the semantic relation to other verbs in the lexicon (McCarthy, 1981). This approach is indeed useful for grouping entries related to the same root, but it reveals itself to be irrelevant when it comes to accounting for more complex semantic relations, because the relation between root and derivation is hard to find. An alternative model presented in (Ehret, 1995) and especially in (Bohas, 1991) claims that verb meaning resides in a 2-consonants root-like form called etymon ∈. An etymon is a combination of two consonants presented as a matrix μ of primitive phonetical features (dental, labial ..) that are assumed to have a semic value shared by all words built on the basis of the etymon. For example the feature matrix in (1) produces etymons like f t","or f è which have a semic nucleus described in Table 1. The verbs built on the basis of this etymons are listed in Table 2. (1) μ   ","[+consonantal [+consonantal] [labial] [-voiced] [-nasal] [+continuant]    - movement of air, wind - breathing - passing of wind by an man or an animal - implication → various smells Table 1: Semic nucleaus of the features matrix μ nafat","a : “to blow on something” faèèa : “to hiss, to wheeze while sleeping” faèfaha: “to wheeze while sleeping” faèaa: “to perfume meals with aromas” lafaèa: “to blow (said of a warm wind)”","Table 2: Verbs carrying the etymons f t and f è Despite the fact that the two models (root model and etymon model) cannot be generalized over the whole lexicon, they make no attempt to associate the semantic meaning of verbs with their syntactic structures. A more NLP oriented lexicon providing semantic description of verbs is Arabic Wordnet (Elkateb et al., 2006). Despite the fact that the lexicon contains only 1400 verbs (a school conjugation manual of Arabic contains 10000 verbs), it inherits all shortcomings of the Engish Wordnet pointed out by (Kipper et al., 2000), such as listing to many fine-grained sense distinctions and the lack of explicit syntactic information like predicate-argument structures. (Diab and Snider, 2006) attempted to apply clustering techniques to induce verb classes for Arabic from a corpus using features like subcategorization frames, verb patterns, subject animacy, LSA semantic vectors. They reported that their clustering method perfomed well with respect to a gold standard produced by a noisy translation of Engilsh verbs from the Levin classes. However no information about the number or the natures of classes produced by the clustering was reported. On the other hand, the English verb lexicon Verbnet provides the advantage of treating syntactic and semantic properties of verbs in a compact way by profiting from Levin’s detailed work on Engish verb classes. In this lexicon,"]},{"title":"2675","paragraphs":["verbs are grouped into classes according to shared syntactic and semantic properties. Other verbs are grouped into subclasses according to restrictions on the thematic participants or to semantic predicates separating them from the prototypical class member. The main assumption is that diathesis alternations are meaning preserving (Levin, 1993). This assumption served as basis for the building of Verbnet for English (Schuler, 2005). Computational linguists may encounter many difficulties when they try to generalize the claim to other languages in perspective of building similar lexicon as in English. This article presents some of the issues encountered during the building process of a Verbnet for Arabic."]},{"title":"2. Basic approach","paragraphs":["The building of a large coverage verb lexicon for Arabic is a challenging task. Unlike the developers of the English Verbnet, we do not dispose of a collection of verb classes like the one provided by Levin (Levin, 1993). The main work that has to be done essentially is of the collection and classification of verbs. In this context two approaches can be used given the available data:","1. the first approach departs from a given set of classes trying to give them a computer readable form and to populate them automatically or semi automatically with members sharing their properties. This approach uses mostly the results of years of theoretical works such those compiled in (Levin, 1993).","2. the second approach works on corpora using algorithms for supervised or unsupervised clustering to automatically induce classes of verbs on the basis of some shared syntactic and grammatical features (Stevensons and Joanis, 2002). This approach is grounded in theoretical considerations assuming that verbs with similar meaning components can be detected according to surface properties like the ability to alternate in the same syntactic structures. In this work I opted for the first approach and used Levin’s verb classes and some of the novel classes of (Korhonen and Briscoe, 2004) assuming that with some adaptations to its properties (syntactic structure, morphological structure, etc.) these classes can also be used for Arabic. Each Verbnet class is represented by the set of properties carried by its prototypical verb. The relevant semantic information for class mapping are:","1. the kind and number of thematic roles the prototypical verb selects. 2. the selectional restrictions on its participants. 3. the core semantic meaining of the prototypical verb. The information related to last two points have been made possible by the compositional semantics added to each verb frame in Verbnet (Dang et al., 2000). Table 3 shows the relevant information for mapping the hit class in Verbnet to Arabic. Members of each Verbnet class are translated to Arabic and expanded according to relations like synonymy, hyponymy, hyperonymy, etc. using different dictionaries including dictionaries of classical Arabic like lissan Al Arab or Al qaamus al muhit. The last ones turns out to be useful for clarifying the etymological background of verbs, which, some times, is a neccecary step for inducing root forms from infinitival forms of verbs. A prototypical verb is selected under the set of verbs produced in the translation and the expansion and put into all its possible frames. Each frame is described by an example sentence, a syntactic structure reflecting the subcategorization information of the verb and a semantic structure including information about its temporal aspects. The rest of the verbs are then added to the new class according to whether they shares properties of the prototype verb. Other are added to subclasses when they diverge from the main class in some not central points. For example trying to apply this building process on the class manner speaking, which in English includes verbs like whisper, babble and cluck results in two groups of verbs as shown in Table 4. The protoytype verb waswasa of the fist group attests the most of the meaning aspects of the Verbnet class manner speaking as the three thematic roles agent, topic and recipient and the main semantic predicates cause and tansfer info which can be composed to: cause(agent, transfer info(topic, recipient)). However the second group consists of verbs which do not share these properties, since they lack the thematic roles topic and recipient, which are two important roles for the meaning transfer info. Group 1 Groupe 2 ↩awh. aā ‘reveal’ tamtama ‘mumble’ hashasa ‘swish’ walwala ‘make a howl’ hassa ‘murmur’ ǧa↪ǧā ‘growl’ waswasa ‘murmur’ damdama ‘burr’ wašwaš ‘whisper’ etc. hamasa ‘whisper’ etc. Table 4: Two verb groups resulting from translating Verbnet class manner speaking Diathesis alternations are indeed a good indicator for mapping English verb classes into Arabic verb classes when they are detected, but they are not a condition since they are not expected to be always similar in two different languages. So for example the conative alternation in (2) may be crucial in distinguishing some classes in English, but it plays no role in Arabic since it simply does not exist.","(2) Conative Alternation a. Paula hit the fence. b. Paula hit at the fence. The same can be said about the temporal information of verbs (they are also included in the semantic descriptions of frames in Verbnet). Whereas the temporal aspect plays a"]},{"title":"2676","paragraphs":["Thematic roles and Restrictions Semantic predicates Agent(+int control) Cause(agent, E) Patient(+solid) Contact(during(E), patient) Instrument(+solid) degradation material integrity(result(E), Patient)","pyscical form(result(E), From, Patient) Table 3: Relevant semantic information of the class hit crucial role in characterizing verbs of the class hit, it plays no role in building a class like smell emission in Arabic.

Verb entries","paragraphs":["The main verb entry in the Arabic verb lexicon is a diacritized infinitival form which corresponds to the perfective of the third person masculine singular, as it is common for referring to verbs in Arabic. Every verb entry is a node that contains four child nodes representing the verb itself, its root, a deverbal noun, and a participle. The last two derived forms can have multiple entries since one verb can bear more than one deverbal nouns or participle. The containment relation between the node element and its children does not make any claim about the organization of these elements in the lexicon. It is just a way to organize an entry and the elements, which are morphologically and semantically related to it. The motivation behind adding the deverbal noun and the participle is the fact that they inherit all the semantic and partially the syntactic properties of the verb they are derived from. The relation between verb and the two derived forms is by no way a one-to-one relation, but at this stage of the work we are not concerned with encoding the special predication behaviour of these elements in comparison to the verb. Encoding the root of verbs will eventually have the effect of connecting all verbs carrying the same root across the classes. It will help reconstructing the steps that a meaning takes from the root stage to the actual verb and clarifying the stage in which polysemy arises. Classes of the Arabic verb lexicon can be accessed not only through the main verb entry but also through the deverbal and the participle or the root. Polysemy in the verb level is resolved through cross listing entries in different classes. Hence the verb ǧaraā , which has the meaning of ‘to run’, ‘to meander’ or ‘to occur’ is listed in four classes: the class run, meander, occurrence and finally the class mode of being."]},{"title":"4. Diathesis Alternations","paragraphs":["A preliminary study about diathesis alternations in Arabic was required to determine whether the alternation building the basis of Levin’s classes are also available in Arabic. Table 5 shows some of the alternations.1 Surprisingly 65% of all alternations availalbe in English are also available in Arabic. The specificity of Arabic alternations lay in the fact that they often engage morphological operations. This is the case with transitivity alternations and causative alternations like the middle alternation and the causative/Inchoative alternation etc. The crucial point here is the distribution of this alternation in classes and their relevance for the class building process. Whereas the spread/load alternation is relevant for building the spray class, the congnate object contruction alternation has in constrast a marginal siginificance since almost all verbs in Arabic (transitive as well as intransitive) can appear in this construction (example (5)).","(5) a. ↩uh. ibbohaā 1sg-love-3sg-Fem-Acc h. ubā’n INDEF-love-Acc ↪amiyqā’n . deep-Mas-Acc ‘I love her deeply.’","b. ǧarah. a cut-Mas-SG ālwaladu DEF-child-NOM ↩us. bu↪ahu thumb-his ǧurh. ā’n INDEF-cut-acc ↪amiyqā’n . deep-Mas-Acc","‘The child cut her thumb deeply.’","c. tas. arrafa beahave-Mas-SG tas. arrufan INDEF-behavior-acc lāmas↩ūwlan . deep-Mas-Acc ‘He behaves irresponsibly.’ Since the diathesis alternations are assumed to be meaning preserving, the question to ask here is: can we still 1 A more comprehensive is to find in: http://ling.uni-","konstanz.de/pages/home/mousser/alternations"]},{"title":"2677 Alternation Occurrence Example Translation","paragraphs":["Middle + causative alternation Prefix + - qat.a↪a ’ālfallaāh. u ’ālššǧarah - The farmer cuts the tree Inchoative alternation - ↩inqat.a↪ati ’ālššaǧarah bisuhuwlah - The tree cuts (easily) Induced action alternation Duplication+ - qaffazat salmaā ’ālh. is. aāna - Salma jumped the horse","-qafaza ’ālh. is. aānu -The horse jumped Unspecified object alternation yes - ↩akala ↪is. aāmun aālka↪kah - Issam ate the cake","- ↩akala ↪is. aāmun - Issam ate Substance/source alternation Prefix+ - tanba↪it","̄ aālh. araāratu mina ’ālššamsi - Heat radiates from the sun","- tab↪at ̄","u ’ālššamsu ’ālharaārata - The sun radiate heat Undestood body-part object yes - tamšit.u su↪aādun ša↪rahaā - Suwad brushed her hair alternation - tamšit.u su↪aādun - Suwad brushes Undestood reflexive object no alternation Understood reciprocal object yes - ↩iltaqaā saliymun ↪is. aāman - Salim met Issam alternation - saliymun wa ↪is. aāmun ↩iltaqayaā - Salim and Issam (both) met PRO-arb object alternation yes - yas. dimu ’ālfilmu ’ālmušaāhidiyna - The movie shocks the public","- aālfilmu yas. dimu - The movie shocks Chracteristic property of yes - qat.a↪tu ālh","̆","ašaba biālminšaāri - I cut the piece of wood with the saw instrument alternation - ālminšaāru yaq↪ta↪ - The saw cuts Benefactive alternation no Preposition drop alternation yes - tasallaqa saliyamun ↪alaā ’ālǧabali - Salim climbed up the mountain","- tasallaqa saliyimun aālǧabala - Salim climbed the mountain Dative alternation yes - baā↪a ǧamiylun sayyaāratahu lih. amiyd - Jamil sold a car to Hamid","- baā↪a ǧimiylun h. amiydan sayyaāratahu - Jamil sold Hamid a car Spray/load alternation yes - rašaštu ’āls. s. ibaāġta ↪alaā ’ālǧidaāri - I sprayed paint on the wall","- rašaštu ’ālǧidaāra bi’āls. s. ibaāġati - I sprayed the wall with paint Clear alternation (intr.) yes - ↩inqaša↪ati ’ālssuh. ubu mina ’ālsamaā↩i - Clouds cleared from the sky","- ↩ı̄nqaša↪ati ’ālssamaā↩u - The sky cleared Table 5: Occurrence of some Alternations in Arabic speak about the same class when deleting some of its alternations because of their absence in a language or when adding other alternations because of their absence in the original language? Then it often happens that an alternation which is relevant for building a class in English is not present in Arabic. For example the amuse class in English (Table 6) has 6 frames with two relevant alternations (the causative and the resultative) which all belong to the main class, whereas the Arabic amuse class (Table 7) lacks the resultative alternation and adds a new alternation. Verbs which appear in alternations resulting from morphological changes are transported to the the marvel class (Table 8), which is declared as a sibling class of the class amuse. It turns out that the behaviour of a verb particularly with respect to the alternations it allows and the class it can belong to is to a large extend determined by its meaning. The universal part of a class is essentially its semantic meaning. The diathesis alternations are language specific. New classes are therefore built for Arabic on the basis of the universal class meaning adapted to its specific syntactic alternations."]},{"title":"5. Morphological interface","paragraphs":["The morphology plays a significant role in the expression of event structures of verbs in Arabic. Since morphological changes of derived verbs technically produce new lexical entries, a decision has to be made about whether derived verbs (and derived verb classes) still belong to the original class and whether they should therefore be distinguished by building a separate subclass inside the original class –since they share most of their properties–, or they should build a new class –since they are lexically autonomous entries? I opted for a mixed approach which can be summarized as follows:","• If there is a class which shares exactly the same properties as the derived verbs, the derived verbs are transported to this class.","• If the derived verbs do not fit any existing class and the effect of the derivation is only a valancy changing effect, a sibling class is created and the verbs linked to the verbs of the original class.","• If the derived verbs correspond to one of the existing classes, but adds additional semantic predicates separating them form the meaning of the original class, the verbs build a new class."]},{"title":"6.

Frame Description and syntactic structures","paragraphs":["Arabic Verbnet uses descriptive constructs that allow to call each frame precisely and to distinguish it from other frames. They consist of a primary description which is more general and reflects the surface syntactic structure of the frame and a secondary description which is more specific and reflects the kind of alternation used in the frame. For example the description in example (6) describes the frame of a sentence whose main verb subcategorizes three arguments and where the third argument has the thematic role beneficiary.

Semantic predicates such as cause, emotional state, motion, made of are associated with each tree to describe the key component meaning of the verb as well as the relation between participant and event structures. Each event E is presented as a tripartite structure according to (Moens and Steedman, 1988), which describe the temporal aspect of the event. The semantic predicates are associated with time functions specifying the part of time in which the event is true. This functions are: the begin of the event(start(E)), the preparatory stage (during(E)), the end stage (end(E)), and the consequent (result(E)). Example (7) shows the semantic structure of sentence (8). The predicates are: cause which has as argument the agent and the event E, b. and state, which take another predicate as argument namely result and use, which describe the use of an instrument to fullfil the action.

Introducing sibling classes","paragraphs":["In the effort of building a Verbnet for Arabic the problem of class overgeneration arises because of the morphologically overt realisation of many semantic predicates of verbs. To be able to alternate in some syntactical structures verbs in Arabic use productive morphological operations (affixation and prosodical stem mutation etc.). This operations have an impact on either the thematic arity of the verb Table 9 or of the semantic predicates building its meaning. The derived verbs diverge significantly from the base verbs, but they inherit their core semantic meaning. The divergence produce a new lexical entry and expels the derived verb from the class of the base verb. However the fact that the derived class contains a part of the morphologically marked diathesis alternations of the verbs make reconnecting the main classes with the derivative classes a reasonable task since it reflects the natural connection between verbs and their derived forms in the lexicon. Those all classes morpholgically related to each other and sharing the same meaning are linked bidirectionally to each other. In addition each class member (verb) is linked separately to the verb it is derived from. The linking establish no hierarichal relation between two classes (such as parent child relation). However only the classes resulting from a valancy changing operations are linked to their sibling classes since this operations are more regular (affect all classes with a particular semantic meaning) and complete (affect all members of the concerned class). Linking morphologically related classes and their members helps taking all morphological manifestations of alternations under account.

Some classes are integrated into other classes since the properties which may make them to autonomous classes does not exist in Arabic like the class gobble whose members are integrated in the class devour since Arabic unlike Engish does not make a distinc-tion between gobble-verbs and devour-verbs. In addition, Levin’s class inventory does not describe event structures of some Arabic verbs. Verbs like šhhada which can be paraphrased as ‘to make a statement of belief’ does not match any class of communication in Levin’s collection. They lexically incorporate the proposition or formula used in the statement using acronymy. Those a new class with the name of the prototype verb šahhada is created to contain all verbs which share the same semantic meaning and show the same syntactic behaviour.

Diathesis alternations engage often overt morphological operations. The risk of losing the connection between main classes and derived classes while building a lexicon is countered by linking them and their verb members together. Evaluating the coverage of the actual lexicon and expand-ing its classes and members is part of the next step. I expect to reach a similar coverage and accuracy as provided by Verbnet for English."]},{"title":"13. References","paragraphs":["G. Bohas. 1991.
