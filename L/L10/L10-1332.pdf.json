We discuss our collection of Arabic discourse connectives as well as principles for identifying and annotating them in context, taking into account properties specific to Arabic. In particular, we deal with the fact that Arabic has a rich morphology: we therefore include clitics as connectives as well as a wide range of nominalizations as potential arguments. We present a dedicated discourse annotation tool for Arabic and a large-scale annotation study. We show that both the human identification of discourse connectives and the determination of the discourse relations they convey is reliable. Our current annotated corpus encompasses a final 5651 annotated discourse connectives in 537 news texts. In future, we will release the annotated corpus to other researchers and use it for training and testing automated methods for discourse connective and relation recognition."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["Discourse relations such as CAUSAL or CONTRAST relations between textual units play an important role in producing a coherent discourse. They are widely studied in theoretical linguistics (Halliday and Hasan, 1976; Hobbs, 1985), where also different relation taxonomies have been derived (Hobbs, 1985; Knott and Sanders, 1998; Mann and Thompson, 1988; Marcu, 2000). Discourse relations can be signalled by explicit lexical indicators, so-called discourse connectives (Marcu, 2000; Webber et al., 1999; Prasad et al., 2008a). We follow (Prasad et al., 2008a) in defining discourse connectives as lexical expressions that relate two text segments that express abstract entities such as events, belief, facts or propositions. These text segments are called the arguments of the discourse connective. In Ex. 1 the connective because indicates a CAUSAL relation between Jack not getting a high mark and his fatigue at exam time. In Ex. 2, the connective however indicates a CONTRAST relation. We indicate discourse connectives and the two arguments via annotated square brackets.","(1) [Because]DC [he was very tired during the exam,]Arg2 [Jack did not achieve a high mark.]Arg1","(2) [The TV was broken.]Arg1[However]DC,[I was able to fix it]Arg2 Discourse connectives are often used as an important feature in the automatic recognition of discourse relations, a task useful for many applications such as automatic summarization, question answering and text generation (Hovy, 1993; Marcu, 2000). Recently, to enable corpus studies and automatic discourse relation recognition algorithms, the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) has been developed (Prasad et al., 2008a) – an English corpus which is annotated for discourse connectives, the relations they convey, which they call senses, and their arguments.1","One of its main attractions is that its annotation is theory-neutral (for example, it does not subscribe to any restrictions on the distance of the two arguments of a connective). It has also been shown to be extensible to other languages such as Hindi (Prasad et al., 2008b), Turkish (Zeyrek and Webber, 2008) and Chinese (Xue, 2005). We extend these efforts to Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) by producing the Leeds Arabic Discourse Treebank (LADTB). The remainder of this paper is or-ganized as follows: Section 2. describes related work. Section 3. describes our methodology for collecting the potential discourse connectives in MSA. A brief description of the annotation scheme follows in Section 4. The corpus, annotation tool, and the annotation methodology are discussed in Section 5. The results of our agreement studies and the gold standard corpus","1","The PDTB project has been extended to also annotate implicit discourse relations, i.e. discourse relations which are not indicated via discourse connectives. In this first study for Arabic, we focus on discourse relations signaled explicitly via connectives. 2046 details are in Sections 6. and 7., respectively."]},{"title":"2. Related Work","paragraphs":["Several textual corpora of Arabic exist. Some of them are available with Part-of-Speech and syntactic annotation such as the Arabic Treebank (ATB) (Maamouri and Bies, 2004). The Prague Arabic Dependency Treebank (PADT), which is smaller in scale than the ATB, contains multilevel annotations, including morphological and analytical level of linguistic represen-tation (Hajic et al., 2004). Moreover, a recent effort by Dukes and Habash (2010) has produced The Quranic Arabic Corpus, a free annotated linguistic resource which provides morphological annotation and syntactic analysis (using dependency grammar) of the Holy Quran. Surprisingly, the annotation level of existing Arabic corpora has not yet included the discourse layer. Al-Sanie et al. (2005) and Seif et al. (2005) discuss a limited set of rhetorical relations and discourse connectives. However, they did not distinguish between discourse connectives such as"]},{"title":"\\t B","paragraphs":["/l↩an/because2","and","other syntactic connectors such as prepositions like"]},{"title":"œ \\tfl","paragraphs":["/fy/in or"]},{"title":"'","paragraphs":["/m↪/with, where the latter signal a semantic relation between two concrete objects instead of a discourse relation between abstract entities such as clauses or sentences. Moreover, the studies had a small empirical basis using only a small number of Arabic texts and no agreement studies on identification of discourse connectives and relations in context have been carried out. Therefore, our work is the first principled discourse annotation effort for Arabic. We work on the syntactically annotated Arabic Penn Treebank v.2 (Maamouri and Bies, 2004), which we extend to a discourse-level resource by identifying its explicit discourse connectives and annotating them with the discourse relations they convey as well as their arguments. We based our annotation guidelines on the same principles as the PDTB but adapt and expand the annotation to take into account properties specific to Arabic."]},{"title":"3. Collecting Arabic Connectives","paragraphs":["Although several references in the Arabic literature (Al-Warraki and Hasanayn, 1994; Ryding, 2005; Alansari, 1985; Alfarabi, 1990) point out the discourse usage of connectives such as"]},{"title":"\\t B","paragraphs":["/l↩an/because and"]},{"title":"\\tÆ” ̧","paragraphs":["/lkn/but, no single exhaustive list of Arabic discourse connectives exist. 2","Arabic examples contain in order: the Arabic right-to-left script, the transliteration (standards ISO/R 233 and DIN 31635) and the English translation (if possible). We collected a large set of Arabic discourse connectives using text analysis and corpus-based techniques. We enhanced the ones mentioned in the literature with manual extraction of all connectives from 50 randomly selected texts from the Penn Arabic Treebank and from 10 different web sites. In addition, we extracted all lexical items with connective-typical POS tags (such as conjunctions) automatically from the Penn Arabic Treebank (Al-Saif et al., 2009). The resulting list was manually verified by two Arabic native speakers. Our final list contains 91 basic Arabic discourse connectives, enhanced with 16 modified forms of basic connectives (such as"]},{"title":"@ \\tX@ œ k","paragraphs":["/h. tā ād ̄ ā/even if as a modified form of"]},{"title":"@ \\tX@","paragraphs":["/ād ̄","ā/ if), yielding 107 discourse connectives overall.

Annotation Scheme","paragraphs":["We followed the annotation principles in the PDTB as far as possible. Necessary adaptations were made to take into account properties specific to Arabic. PDTB annotation is based on lexicalized grammar theory. The anchor of the annotation is the lexical item - a discourse connective (DC). The argument labels of the signalled relation are partially syntactically driven, in that the Arg2 label is assigned to the argument with which the connective was syntactically associated. The Arg1 label, however, can refer to an abstract object at any distance from the connective. 4.1. Types of Discourse Connectives Discourse connectives in the PDTB are coordinating or subordinating conjunctions such as and, but and or, adverbials such as then, later and otherwise, and prepositional phrases such as in contrast and as a result. All these are also used for MSA (see Examples 3, 4 and 5). (3)"]},{"title":"[ \\tÆ J@̧ Ø \\t¢oAK.]","paragraphs":["DC"]},{"title":"[A \\tD”]̧","paragraphs":["Arg1"]},{"title":"[. ’@Yg.

Argument Types We consider any text segments expressing abstract objects as arguments. For Arabic, these might be one or more, tensed or untensed, verbal sentences or clauses ǧmlh f↪lyh, noun sentences ǧmlh ↩smyh, anaphoric expressions (if they refer to an abstract object such as many demonstrative pronouns) or verb ellipses. 3 Al-Mazdar is a well defined noun category in the Ara-","bic literature with 58 noun forms. Figure 1: Discourse relations in the LADTB. The main difference to English is the inclusion of certain noun sentences. The Arabic noun sentence is equivalent to one of two English sentences/clauses: (i) a verbal phrase of the form (x verb-to-be y) (such as the university is famous/ "]},{"title":"ŁPæD Ø“Am. ’@","paragraphs":[") or (ii) a noun phrase (such as famous university/ "]},{"title":"ŁPæD Ø“Ag.","paragraphs":["). The latter is normally not an abstract object, except if it is a nominalization. We allow the first type and nominalizations (Al-Mazdar) from the second type as arguments of a discourse connective. 4.3. Types of Relations We use the same 4 main relation classes as the PDTB does for English: TEMPORAL, CONTIN-GENCY, COMPARISON and EXPANSION. However, we reduce the number of subclass relations we use to 18. We especially do not currently annotate further fine-grained distinctions, such as whether a conditional is counterfactual, as done in the PDTB. Future versions of the LADTB might include finer-grained distinctions. Figure 1 shows the hierarchy of discourse relations for Arabic. We introduce two new relations at subclass level as we found them necessary in our pilot annotation for Arabic. These are EXPANSION.Background and COMPARISON.Similarity. EXPANSION.Background applies when the argument that is syntactically associated with the connective describes prior eventualities which are background information of the other argument.

It consists of 734 files containing roughly 166K words of written Modern Standard Arabic newswire from the Agence France Press.","5.2. Arabic Discourse Annotation Tool (ADA) and Annotation Process We developed a dedicated discourse annotation tool to deal with requirements specific to Arabic discourse annotation such as the annotation of clitics and right-to-left script order. The tool allows selection of Arabic or English annotation (see Figure 2). It also highlights all potential discourse connectives from our connectives list (see Section 3.), including potential clitics. This is also shown in Figure 2. The annotator reads the text to get an overall understanding, and then makes a series of decisions for each potential connective in context. Figure 2: Discourse Annotation Tool for Arabic/English: screenshots before annotation Figure 3: Discourse Annotation Tool for Arabic/English: screenshot after annotation.","1. If the potential connective is in this particular context not a connective (for example, because it does not relate two abstract entities), highlighting is removed and all annotation ceases.","2. If the potential discourse connective is indeed used as a connective, annotators will mark the text segments that express the two arguments of 2049 the connective as well the discourse relation it conveys from a drop-down list of relations. Similar to the English annotation, annotators are allowed to use more than one relation, if a connective is deemed to express two relations at the same time. The screenshot in Figure 3 shows an example annotation.","3. Annotators are allowed to add comments into a comment box. 5.3. Annotation Methodology Annotation was conducted by two independent native speakers of Arabic who were not involved in tool or scheme development. Agreement is measured on two tasks. The first task TASK I measures whether annotators agree on the binary decision on whether an item constitutes a discourse connective in context (Step 1 in the annotation procedure described above). Due to clitics and Arabic’s complex morphology this task is potentially harder than in English. Agreement is measured by the kappa statistic (Siegel and Castellan, 1956). The second task TASK 2 measures whether annotators agree on which discourse relation an identified connective expresses. As annotators can use sets of relations for a connective, we use kappa as well a variant of kappa called alpha, which allows us to measure partial agreement on sets while keeping kappa’s advantage of factoring out random agreement (Artstein and Poesio, 2008). A pilot annotation on 121 texts was used to train the annotators and to clarify the annotation guidelines, if necessary. The actual annotation after training has been conducted on 537 texts."]},{"title":"6. Results","paragraphs":["Agreement on TASK I is highly reliable (N= 23331, percentage agreement of 0.95, kappa of 0.88). Full agreement is shown in Table 1. Due to proliferation of ambiguous clitics, most potential connective tokens are actually not connectives so that only 5586 of a potential 23331 connectives are actually really discourse connectives. Agreement on TASK II (relation assignment) is relatively low (N = 5586, percentage agreement of 0.66, kappa of 0.57, and alpha of 0.58). It turns out that one of the major sources of disagreement is due to a convention in Arabic newswire writing: each sentence (if not introduced by an alternative connective) is introduced by /w/and, mostly without a specific discourse relation conveyed. This caused a high level of confusion. We therefore report agreement on three different datasets (see Table 2): the set of all identified connectives, the set of identified connectives excluding /w/and and the set of identified connectives excluding /w/and at the beginning of a paragraph (BOP). We see that reliability for connectives excluding rhetorical use of /w/and is good. Connectives are mostly unambiguous in English (Pitler et al., 2008). However, for Arabic we encountered higher levels of ambiguity. The most ambiguous connectives at class level are in order /w/and,"]},{"title":"\\t‹","paragraphs":["/f/then,"]},{"title":"AJ \\tfl","paragraphs":["/fymā/while,"]},{"title":"A»","paragraphs":["/kmā/as and"]},{"title":"\\tÆg œ \\tfl","paragraphs":["/fy h. yn/while/in the same time.

Gold Standard","paragraphs":["We are now in the process of reconciling the annotations into a gold standard. First, we realized that 2050 /w/and at BOP is the most ambiguous connective and that due to its mostly rhetorical use, the annotators could not agree on its discourse use in context. Therefore, we for now assign automatically Expansion.Conjunction to all disagreed instances of /w/and at BOP.4","A further disambiguation study is necessary for /w/and at BOP. Other automatic corrections of easily detectable annotation errors have also taken place (such as making sure that modified forms of a connective were indeed only annotated as one and not as two connectives). In a second step, we now reconcile other disagreements via further discussions and an arbitrator. The final LADTB contains 5651 annotated connectives, their relations and arguments in 537 files (75% of ATB, part 1). Table 3 summarizes the statistics of the LADTB corpus and the most and least frequent connectives and relations. Of the potential 107 connective types we collected (see Section 3.), only 68 occurred in the LADTB. Apart from the 18 single discourse relations, 22 different set combinations of discourse relations were also used. Also note that due to automatic corrections, the number of all potential connectives as well as of real connectives in Table 3 varies slightly from the number of connectives cited in the annotation study."]},{"title":"8. Conclusion and Future Work","paragraphs":["We present the first annotation study for discourse relations in Arabic, concentrating on explicit discourse connectives. We show that identification of connectives is highly reliable and annotation of the discourse relations the connectives convey is reliable, if we exclude the purely rhetoric occurrence of the connective /w/and at the beginning of paragraphs. In future, we aim to (i) measure the reliability of argument assignment, (ii) release the agreed gold standard of the LADTB (Version I) and (iii) develop automatic models for connective recognition and relation disambiguation.
