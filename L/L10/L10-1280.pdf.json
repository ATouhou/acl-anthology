The GENEREG corpus consists of 314 abstracts dealing with the regulation of gene expression in the model organism E. coli.

Introduction","paragraphs":["We currently witness a proliferation of semantically annotated corpora, containing named entity and relation annotations, particularly in the area of biomedical language processing. As examples, we here only mention the AIMED corpus (Bunescu et al., 2005), the LLL corpus (Nédellec, 2005), the BIOINFER corpus (Pyysalo et al., 2007), and, most recently, the BioNLP’09 Shared Task corpus (Kim et al., 2009) gathered from the GENIA event corpus (Kim et al., 2008) for the BioNLP’09 Shared Task Challenge on Event Extraction.1 These corpora are characterized by highly specialized named entity or relation types still covering only tiny little bits of the vast domain knowledge in the life sciences. While this seems inevitable for such supersized domains with a huge span of ‘interesting’ entities and relations, one might think of docking such specialized corpora to complementary resources in order to increase their usability. We, first, introduce GENEREG (Gene Regulation Corpus), the result of an annotation campaign led by the Jena University Language & Information Engineering (JULIE) Lab. The corpus, a preliminary version was described by Buyko et al. (2008), is suited for the extraction of relations between entities whose focus is on the regulation of gene expression. Its structure and some quantitative characteristics will be described in Section 3. In an effort to consolidate our work on GENEREG, we further explored ways to link the metadata it contains to other, independently developed annotated corpora or lexical resources. Such concerns for empowering the interoperability of language resources were made concrete by linking GENEREG with the GENIA event corpus on the one hand, and with lexicon resources such as the SPECIALIST LEXI-1 http://www-tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/","GENIA/SharedTask/","CON,2 WORDNET,3","FRAMENET,4","etc., on the other hand.","These efforts will be described in Section 4."]},{"title":"2. Related Work","paragraphs":["One of the key issues in the BioNLP domain is the extraction and interpretation of relations (RE) between named entities. For the development and evaluation of RE methodologies, a large variety of RE annotated corpora were developed in different labs. Most of these corpora contain protein-protein interaction (PPI) annotations, e.g., AIMED, BIOINFER, LLL, but they also differ in many respects (Pyysalo et al., 2008). While some corpora provide untyped undirected annotations (AIMED), other corpora employ annotations based on ontological definitions (BIOINFER). Another major difference between these corpora is the level of detail, i.e., the granularity of annotations. Finally, only few corpora provide the marking of key words that stand at the textual level for the conceptualization of an interaction between named entities (e.g., BIOINFER, GREC (Thompson et al., 2009)). In recent challenges such as the BioNLP’09 Shared Task, these issues gained further attention. While the granularity of relations used for corpus annotation is increasing (e.g., from PPI to Binding, Regulation, etc.), the annotations are also grounded in the explicit linguistic expressions being used for the denotation of relations (e.g., various interaction types are linked to the key interaction words). Pyysalo et al. (2008) showed that the majority of annotated interactions from various RE corpora fall under the Causal-Change sub-tree of the BIOINFER ontology (Pyysalo et al., 2007). These interactions correspond to events occur-2 http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/","umlslex.html 3 http://wordnet.princeton.edu/ 4 http://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/"]},{"title":"2662","paragraphs":["ring as part of biochemical processes in cells. The interaction annotations from different corpora vary thereby at the level of granularity. Let us consider an example from the AIMED corpus. “p53 transcriptional activation mediated by co-activators TAFII40 and TAFII60.” contains an annotation of two PPI interaction relations, namely PPI(p53, TAFII40) and PPI(p53, TAFII60). However, more specifically, TAFII40 and TAFII60 regulate the transcription of p53. The interactions mentioned in the sentence finally boil down to two molecular events, namely Positive Regulation and Transcription, which are more specific than the more general interpretation as PPI. It is exactly this kind of more precise information biologists are looking for. Obviously, PPI extraction is a complex task since various molecular events and even cascades of events are involved both of which are hard to sort out. This observation holds for the GENEREG corpus as well. For example, the sentence “XapR regulates the expression of xanthosine phosphorylase (XapA).” contains a Regulation of Gene Expression relation between XapR and XapA that can be represented by means of two cascaded GENIA corpus events, i.e., Regulation(Theme:Gene Expression(Theme:XapA), Cause:XapR). Given the inherent complexity of relation extraction at such a fine level of distinction RE may benefit from a methodological approach which deals with the extraction of molecular events in a bottom-up manner. This way, the general PPI problem can be decomposed into more specific and, possibly, more feasible subtasks. To put this work on firmer empirical ground, we wanted to consolidate our work on the GENEREG corpus by making it compatible with the GENIA event corpus. In the BioNLP’09 Challenge, the tagging of key words (called triggers) has been shown to be particularly useful for the extraction and interpretation of fine-grained interactions between entities. Similarly, Buyko et al. (2008) gathered evidence that the extraction of trigger words considerably boosts an RE system’s performance in terms of its f-score. Thus, the need arises to link the annotations of trigger words from different corpora in a standardized way. Some attempts have already been made in this direc-tion in the PASBIO (Wattarujeekrit et al., 2004) and BIOFRAMENET (Dolbey et al., 2006) projects both of which, unfortunately, cover only a very small portion of biomedical verbs. We here advocate the consideration of larger-scale lexical resources such as the SPECIALIST LEXICON and the BIOLEXICON (Sasaki et al., 2008) which offer a substantial number of subcategorization frames for biomedical verbs. Turning our attention to the general language domain, we additionally find lexical resources such as WORDNET, VERBNET, FRAMENET that (though differing in the scope of their lexical coverage) might be beneficial for the biomedical domain as well. In this study, we consolidate the GENEREG corpus by elaborating on its compatibility with the GENIA event corpus annotation guidelines and by linking the most frequent trigger words from both corpora to selected in-domain (i.e., biological) and out-of-domain (non-biological) lexicon and corpus resources."]},{"title":"3. Corpus Annotation","paragraphs":["The GENEREG corpus consists of 314 PUBMED5","abstracts dealing with the regulation of gene expression in the model organism E. coli. The regulation of gene expression can be described as the process that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of gene expression. During gene expression, the coding sequence of a gene is converted into a mature gene product or products, namely proteins or RNA (taken from the definition of the Gene Ontology class Regulation of Gene Expression, GO:0010468).6","GENEREG provides three types of semantic annotations: named entities involved in gene regulatory processes, such as transcription factors and genes, pairwise relations between regulators and regulated genes, and event triggers (clue verbs) essential for the description of, e.g., gene expression and gene regulation events.7","For all three annotation levels, the annotation vocabulary was taken from the Gene Regulation Ontology (GRO) (Beisswanger et al., 2008). 3.1. Event Triggers After an extensive manual analysis of biomedical texts, events classified as relevant for the process of gene expression regulation were grouped into nine categories based on GRO concepts, viz. Gene Expression, Transcription, Regulation of Gene Expression (ROGE), Positive ROGE, Negative ROGE, and Experimental Intervention with subtypes Genetic Modification, Artificial Increase, and Artificial Decrease.8","Trigger words indicating textual mentions of the listed events were annotated with the corresponding categories. An event trigger is any literal verbal form that explicitly signals the occurrence of a particular molecular event. Trigger words are basically main verbs, verb nominalizations and adjectives. For example, the sentence “H-NS and StpA proteins stimulate expression of the maltose regulon in Escherichia coli.” contains two triggers: first, ‘stimulate’ is a trigger for a process in the category Positive ROGE, second, ‘expression’ is a trigger for a process belonging to the category Gene Expression. 3.2. Gene Expression Regulation Relations Omitting the direct linking of arguments to atomic events anchored by trigger words in the text, in the second step, a domain expert directly annotated pairwise relations between genes and regulators affecting the expression of the genes. This annotation was based on the GRO class ROGE with its two subclasses Positive ROGE and Negative ROGE. A relation instance contains two arguments, viz. Agent, the entity that plays the role of modifying gene expression, and Patient, the entity whose expression is modified. Agents can be occupied by transcription factors (in core regulatory relations), or by polymerases and chemicals (in 5 http://www.pubmed.org 6 http://www.geneontology.org/ 7 The annotation process and IAA figures for named entities,","event triggers and semantic relations are described by Buyko et","al.

The patterns range from the most frequent ones containing the mention of regulation verbs, adjectives and nominalizations (e.g., ‘regulator’), to uncertain expressions such as ‘be essential’, ‘be involved in’, adjectives indicating requirements or dependencies (e.g., ‘dependent’), and causal relation constructions between molecular processes in which gene and transcription factors are involved."]},{"title":"4. Studies on the Interoperability of GENEREG 4.1. Linking to the GENIA Event Corpus","paragraphs":["The BioNLP’09 Shared Task focused on the extraction of detailed behavior of proteins, characterized as bio-molecular events, and provided annotations of selected events from the GENIA events corpus (Kim et al., 2008). The main difference between GENIA events and GENEREG relations is the level of detail of annotations. While GENEREG provides only shallow event annotations anchored through trigger words in the text, GENIA links the event arguments to their triggers.10","The two GENEREG annotation layers, viz., event triggers and relations are currently not inter-linked. The second main difference is the use of biomedical knowledge for inference in GENEREG (in contrast to the GENIA guidelines). GENEREG annotators frequently used the knowledge about experimental conditions for drawing conclusions about the role of the transcription factor in the gene regulation processes. The second difference can be explained considering the sentence “In absence of H-NS and StpA proteins we detected the loss of the maltose regulon expression in Escherichia coli.” Here an annotator will infer that H-NS and StpA proteins positively regulate maltose operon genes. We explored about 150 (about 13%) of the relations annotated in the GENEREG corpus. For 142 relations (approximately 90%), we can provide GENIA event annotations and automatically infer the corresponding GENEREG relations. 9 Auxiliary regulatory relations (606 instances) extend the orig-","inal GENEREG corpus. 10 In GENEREG the additional linkage annotation costs could be","avoided by automatically connecting triggers to relations. Thereby, the participants of GENEREG relations have to be linked to various events, e.g., Transcription or Gene expression events (see the example in Section 2.). For 19 relations (12%), we annotated Mutagenesis events. A Mutagenesis event denotes the process by which genetic material undergoes a detectable and heritable structural change. Eexperimental environments for gene regulation detection often involve genetic modifications of genetic material. By means of these genetic modifications and the expression levels of other genes, researchers implicitly draw conclusions about the role of the transcription factor in the gene regulation processes. The sentence “Transcription of the chromosomal asr was abolished in the presence of a phoB-phoR deletion mutant.” contains such an inferred relation of asr with phoB and phoR, respectively. This relation would be represented according to the GENIA guidelines, e.g., for phoB as Negative Regulation(Theme:Transcription(Theme:asr), Cause(Mutagenesis(Theme:phoB))). For 15 relations (approximately 10%), we annotated a cascade of Regulation events. For example, the sentence “Fis protein is a major factor responsible for catabolite repression at the nrf promoter.” contains a Regulation of Gene Expression relation between Fis and nrf that can be represented by means of two cascaded Regulation events, i.e., Regulation(Theme:Negative Regulation(Theme:nrf), Cause:Fis). In 10% of the annotations we could not provide the GENIA annotations, where 7 relations (about 5%) are statements and not events, and 8 relations (again, about 5%) are too complex and cannot be represented as GENIA events. For example the sentence “Primer extension analysis of the asr transcript revealed a region similar to the Pho box (the consensus sequence found in promoters transcriptionally activated by the PhoB protein) upstream from the determined transcription start.” contains such a relation annotation between asr and PhoB that would not be annotated in the GENIA event corpus according to its guidelines.","4.2. Linking to Biomedical and General Language Lexicon and Corpus Resources 4.2.1. Linking to Biomedical Lexicons Although event trigger annotation and collection is crucial for biomedical information extraction, there is still a need for lexical resources containing specific verbs and nouns which express molecular events in texts. Up until now, some home-grown verb lists have been compiled (e.g., by Fundel et al. (2007)), while the BIOLEXICON and the SPECIALIST LEXICON currently constitute per-haps the most comprehensive repositories for ‘biological’ verbs. The most frequent triggers of the GENEREG and BioNLP’09 Shared Task corpora can almost completely be found in both of these lexicons. The extracted frames of trigger verbs are either just syntactic (as with the SPECIALIST LEXICON) or automatically gathered syntactico-semantic ones (as with the BIOLEXICON)."]},{"title":"2664","paragraphs":["Event (lemma) Verbs Nouns Other FRAMENET VERBNET/PROPBANK NOMBANK WORDNET Total Transcription (14) 3 10 1 2 (14%) 1 (7%) 6 (42%) 7 (50%) 7 (50%) Gene expression (17) 5 11 1 6 (35%) 2 (11%) 2 (11%) 10 (59%) 10 (59%) Regulation (21) 10 6 5 13 (62%) 8 (38%) 4 (19%) 18 (86%) 18 (86%) Positive regulation (43) 19 13 11 22 (51%) 12 (28%) 5(11%) 31 (72%) 32 (74%) Negative regulation (29) 15 13 1 20 (69%) 9 (31%) 5 (17%) 19 (66%) 19 (66%) TOTAL (124) 52 53 19 63 (50.1%) 32 (25.8%) 22 (17.7%) 85 (68.5%) 86 (69.3%) Table 2: Number of trigger words matching general language resources per event category","Event Frames in FRAMENET","Transcription Causation (induction), Becoming aware (detect)","Gene Expression Causation (induction), Becoming aware (detect), Creation (produce), Presence (present)","Regulation Objective influence (effect, affect, influence), Control (control), Participation (involve, involvement), Cause change (change, alter), Contingency (dependent), Response (response).","Positive regulation Causation (induce, lead, result, cause), Cause change position on a scale (increase, enhance, promoter), Being necessary (require, essential, necessary), Contingency (dependent), Cause to start (stimulate), Amassing (accumulation), Relative time (after), Time vector (through), Importance (important), Extreme value (high), Being active (active)","Negative regulation Hindering (inhibit), Cause change position on a scale (decrease, reduce, reduction, diminish), Change position on a scale (decline), Preventing (prevent), Possession (lack) Table 3: Frames in FRAMENET corresponding to GENEREG’s event categories 4.2.2.

We explore, in this section, the linking of event triggers (similar to the work of Uematsu et al. (2009)) from GENEREG and BioNLP’09 Shared Task annotations for Transcription, Gene expression, Regulation, Positive regulation and Negative regulation events.11 We manually linked the most frequent triggers to the most prominent general language lexical resources, viz., WORDNET, FRAMENET, and VERBNET, but also included the lexical patterns used for general language proposition annotations as contained in the PROPBANK (Palmer et al., 2005) and the NOMBANK (Meyers et al., 2004). The results are summarized in Table 2.12 The resource with the highest number of matches (68.5%) is WORDNET where we found between 50% (Transcription) to 86% (Regulation) of all triggers. WORDNET is followed by FRAMENET with 50.1% matches, and VERB-","11","ROGE, Positive and Negative ROGE in GENEREG are subtypes of Regulation, Positive regulation and Negative regulation events in GENIA, respectively.","12","For many triggers, we could not find a corresponding lemma or its sense in the screened resources. Accordingly, in Table 2, we only counted the lemmata with correctly traceable and identified senses. NET/PROPBANK with 25.8% matches. At the bottom of the list appears NOMBANK with 17.7% matches. The most difficult event to link is the Transcription event as it is expressed through compounds such as ”mrna levels“, ”transcriptional activity”, “mrna expression”. Transcription and Gene expression events share a set of frames, e.g., Causation and Becoming aware, that represent different views on the production of proteins from the DNA strain: the view of regulation by proteins and the view of a biologist in experiments (see Table 3). The sharing of frames can be explained by the fact that the Transcription event is a part of the Gene expression event (see GRO (Beisswanger et al., 2008)). Regulation and Positive regulation triggers are the ones with the highest coverage in general language lexicon resources. They could be successfully linked in particular to FRAMENET (see Table 3). These events are usually expressed by words that describe general regulation, influence or control. Regulation events are expressed by frames such as Objective influence, Causation, and Control. Positive regulation and Negative regulation correspond to frames that express more outspoken influence such as Cause change position on a scale, and Hindering. Still, many triggers could not be connected to FRAMENET. The linkage ratio lies between 14% (for Transcription) to 69% (for Negative regulation). Very specific biomedical triggers such as ‘down-regulation’ or ‘up-regulation’ are not at all represented in any of the lexical resources we explored."]},{"title":"2665 5. Conclusion and Outlook","paragraphs":["We described and discussed the semantic complexity of the GENEREG corpus by linking its metadata to an alternative event corpus in the life sciences (GENIA), as well as to biomedical and general language domain lexicons including lexical specifications from general language corpus annotations. We gave evidence for the coverage of resources such as FRAMENET and WORDNET related to biomedical triggers which are relevant for the extraction of gene expression regulation events. While some overlap exists for all of the considered resources, WORDNET exhibits the highest degree of coverage way beyond the 50% line. Interlinking these resources to GENEREG will help us improve the RE performance on this corpus. Experiments on JREX, our most recent RE extraction pipeline (Buyko et al., 2009), are under way.
