The parsed version of CORDIAL-SIN is intended to be a more efficient resource for the purpose of studying dialect syntax by allowing automated searches for various syntactic constructions of interest. To achieve this goal we adopted a rich annotation system (the UPenn corpora annotation system) which codifies syntactic information of high relevance. The annotation produces tree representations, in form of labelled parenthesis, that are integrally searchable with CorpusSearch, a search engine for parsed corpora (Randall, 2005-2007). The present paper focuses on CORDIAL-SIN annotation issues, namely it presents the general principles and guidelines of the adopted annotation system and describes the methodology for constructing the parsed version of the corpus and for searching it (tools and procedures). Last section addresses the question of how an annotation system originally designed for Middle English can be adapted to meet the particular needs of a Portuguese corpus of dialectal speech.

The CORDIAL-SIN corpus","paragraphs":["The Syntax-oriented Corpus of Portuguese Dialects (CORDIAL-SIN) is being built up at the Linguistics Center of University of Lisbon (CLUL) within the scope of a research project aimed at promoting the study of European Portuguese dialect syntax by means (among other things) of the implementation of an online linguistic resource fulfilling the empirical demands of dialect syntax inquiry1",". CORDIAL-SIN is a corpus of spoken dialectal EP that collects a geographically representative body of excerpts of spontaneous and semi-directed speech, selected from the oral interviews gathered by the Linguistic Variation Team at CLUL in the course of several Dialect Geography projects (ALEPG; ALEAç; ALLP; BA). At its current state (the final state, in terms of extent), the corpus covers 42 locations within the (continental and insular) territory of Portugal and it compiles about 600 000 words. Map 1 shows the geographical distribution of the CORDIAL-SIN locations. The corpus is available online, on the CORDIAL-SIN website, under three different formats 2",": (i) verbatim orthographic transcripts (which include phonetic and morphological variants and also general spoken language phenomena), (ii) normalized orthographic transcripts (which eliminate phonetic transcriptions of variants and the marked up spoken language phenomena) and (iii) morphologically tagged texts (automatically tagged using the morphological tagger created by M. Finger for the Tycho Brahe Corpus of Historical Portuguese; cf. Finger, 1998, 2000).  1 The CORDIAL-SIN project is supported by national funding (PRAXIS XXI/P/PLP/13046/1998; POSI/1999/PLP/33275; POCTI/LIN/46980/2002; PTDC/LIN/71559/2006). 2 CORDIAL-SIN is part of a European network of dialect syntax, promoted by the ESF-funded project Edisyn, and, in the near future will be also searchable (and interoperable with other dialectal corpora/databases) via the Edisyn Search Engine.

To this end, we make use of a rich annotation system, based on the Penn Parsed Corpora of Historical English syntactic annotation set-up (Kroch & Taylor, 2000; Kroch, Santorini & Delfs, 2004; Kroch, Santorini & Diertani, 2010), which is integrally searchable with CorpusSearch, a query program for parsed corpora (Randall, 2005-2007)3",". The Penn annotation system is designed to facilitate automated searches for various syntactic constructions of interest and not to associate every sentence with a correct structural description. This strategy leads to quite flat and sometimes linguistically uncommitted syntactic objects: multiple branching nodes, some word level nodes (e.g. verbs, negation, sentence focus particles), omission of undecidable information (e.g. VP boundaries) and subtle distinctions (e.g. argument vs adjunct PPs), use of default rules (in w.r.t. location of wh-traces and structural ambiguity, among others). The representation in (1) illustrates a typical CORDIAL-SIN syntactic structure.  (1)            In spite of this, the Penn system is a really rich annotation system which provides the marking up of information of high relevance, such as constituent boundaries, phrase and clause dependencies, categorial information (e.g. NP, PP, ADVP), grammatical relations (e.g. SBJ, ACC, DAT), discoursive functions (e.g. left dislocation, pragmatic marker), sentence and clause types (e.g. EXL, CMP, QUE), some null constituents and certain transformational relations. Syntactic annotation is represented as labeled bracketing over morphologically tagged texts. At the word level, POS tags are preserved4",". Phrase and clause main labels are category labels and extended labels provide information concerning ‘sub-category’, ‘grammatical relation’ or  3 The Penn annotation scheme is equally used on the Tycho Brahe corpus (a parsed corpus of historical portuguese) and on the Canadian Parsed Corpus of Historical French – both of them currently under construction too. The idea is that all these corpora, by using the same standards with respect to data annotation, constitute a corpora network suitable for research on comparative syntax. 4 The format of the POS tags and the basics of the tagset essentially stem from the Tycho Brahe POS annotation system. Main tags include morpho-syntactic tags, word specific tags and punctuation tags; subtags codify inflectional information or specify in more detail morpho-syntactic information (on the CORDIAL-SIN POS annotation system, cf. Magro & Morgado (2008)). ‘discoursive function’.

The parsed texts result from a two steps process. At the first stage, a version of Mike Collins and Dan Bikel’s statistical parser (Collins, 1999; Bikel, 2004), modified for treebank construction by Seth Kulick, runs over the POS tagged texts. At the second stage, the parser output is hand corrected with the help of CorpusDraw, an editing annotation tool5,","6",". The parser output is a regular text file (ASCII file) that contains parsed, labelled sentences. CorpusDraw takes this file as a source file, displays the tree structures assigned to the sentences in the parsed corpus and allows the annotator to edit these trees. The CorpusDraw graphical user interface contains a row of editing buttons that enables the annotator to change syntactic labels, to break up run-on sentences or to consolidate fragments, to add subcategory information, to change attachment level, to add empty categories and to coindex related elements7",". CorpusDraw will not permit the annotator to accidently change the order of words in the sentence or to delete any. (4) and (5) show the same parsed sentence pre and post editing respectively (see (2) for the gloss and translation). Notice that, in (4), both clauses lack a subject position, the  5 CorpusDraw and CorpusSearch (to be presented bellow in the text) are components of CorpusSearch2 – a java program developed by Beth Randall that supports research in corpus linguistics (Randall, 2005-2007). CorpusSearch2 is useful both for the construction of syntactically parsed corpora and for searching them. It runs under any Java-supported operating system (requires Java 2, version 1.5 or later) and expects labeled bracketing (Penn Treebank style). 6 We are currently training the Penn parser with EP hand corrected annotated data. Details about the automatic parser performance have not been available yet. Nonetheless, such a rich annotation system will always require a considerable amount of human editing. In the face of an unsatisfactory parser performance it will be possible to make use of CorpusSearch corpus-revision feature (which allows to make automatic changes to an entire corpus) to assign syntactic structure to the corpus. 7 The actions controlled by the editing buttons can also be triggered by the use of shortcuts, both keystrokes and mouse clicks, which facilitates the time-consuming task of human editing of the parser output. relative clause is wrongly attached (it is modifying the noun badejo/ whiting and not the noun redes/ fishing net, as it should be) and the wh-phrase is not projected nor co-indexed with the subject of the relative clause. In (5) these adjustments are already made and the sentence is properly annotated.  (4)              (5)           At the end of this process, we get a parsed version of the corpus in a format that allows to retrieve automatically several syntactic configurations of interest using CorpusSearch, a dedicated search engine for parsed corpora. CorpusSearch operates in a friendly manner, making use of a basic query language plus linguistically intuitive search functions and providing very versatile searching options. A query file of CorpusSearch contains a node (which gives CorpusSearch a node boundary within which to search) and a query (which instructs CorpusSearch as to what action to carry out). A basic query is composed by a search function call (each search function looks for one basic structural relationship) and the respective arguments (which correspond to the nodes being searched for). Search function arguments may take the form of an or-list, may include wild cards, and may be negated. Any number of search-function calls may be combined into more complex queries using the logical operators AND, OR, and NOT. CorpusSearch creates a text output file, containing the sentences that match the condition(s) in the query (this output file is itself searchable). Table 2 lists the main search functions of CorpusSearch.

Adapting the Penn system","paragraphs":["The adopted annotation system – that was originally designed for Middle English – has to be adjusted to meet the particular needs of a Portuguese corpus of dialectal speech. In this domain, our team’s work is that of adapting the existing system and creating the solutions required by those grammatical features where Portuguese and English differ or by other aspects that are specific of our dialectal data, namely, microvariation within the same construction and syntactically-relevant discourse phenomena. The original annotation schemes and label set are preserved or slightly adapted wherever is possible but, in certain cases, new solutions are required. For consistency and for the ease of the process, the Portuguese additions are defined within the standards already operative in the Penn corpora and readable by the automatic parser. Typical examples of the solutions we have found for Portuguese specifics are presented in the following subsections (for a comprehensive description of the CORDIAL-SIN syntactic annotation system, see Carrilho & Magro, 2009) 2.3.1. The label set To set apart some syntactic units that abound in spoken texts, a small group of new extended labels was added on to the original label set, namely the labels -ANS, -POL, -TAG and -PRG. To avoid adding extra complexity for the annotation, no empty categories are codified inside the units identified with these extended labels.

For the treatment of clitic climbing (a nonexistent phenomenon in English) we had to slightly adapt the original system, making use of an already available option. We applied the annotation scheme of A-movement to the annotation of clitic climbing. A-movement traces are annotated when the extraction involves more than a single IP. This sort of trace is codified using the symbol *, which is co-indexed with the moved phrase (see (21)). In clitic climbing contexts, the annotation marks the connection between the climbed clitic and the clause where it originates by means of the same co-indexed null element * (see (22)).
