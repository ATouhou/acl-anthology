Next to standard association-based extraction, we focus on morpho-syntactic, syntactic and lexical-choice features of the MWE candidates. A broad range of such properties (e.g. number and definiteness of nouns, adjacency of the MWE’s components and their position in the sentence, preferred lexical modifiers, etc.) along with relevant example sentences, are extracted from dependency-parsed text and stored in a data base. A sample precision evaluation and an analysis of extraction errors are provided along with the discussion of our extraction architecture. We furthermore measure the contribution of the features to the precision of the extraction: by using both morpho-syntactic and syntactic features, we achieve a higher precision in the identification of idiomaticMWEs, than by using only properties of one type."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["Much work has been done on the automatic extraction of multiword expressions (MWEs) from text corpora (cf. e.g. the regular ACL SIGLEX workshops on multiword items). Some of these efforts mainly aim at the identification of semantically non-compositional combinations, leaving their detailed linguistic description for a separate step (e.g. (Fazly and Stevenson, 2006)). In this article, we describe an approach which allows us to do both steps in one go: identifying idiomatic MWEs, and providing detailed corpus-based material for their lexical description, e.g. in entries of the lexicon of a formal grammar or in a database similar to the Dutch DuELME lexicon (Grégoire, 2007). Our approach is applied to German data and uses dependency-parsed material (section 2). The parser relies on a substantial amount of lexical and subcategorization information; its underspecified output distinguishes between attachment and label ambiguities. We describe the handling of both ambiguity types. The objective is to maximally exploit the corpus data while keeping precision as high as possible. We use various forms of syntactic patterns to identify candidates, going beyond simple verb+object, verb+prepositional phrase types: these are only basic patterns that can be expanded by adjectives, further nouns or prepositional phrases (PPs) (cf. section 4). The approach involves a variety of morpho-syntactic properties of the elements of the collocation candidates, insofar as we not only extract MWE-candidates, but also numerous context parameters: these morpho-syntactic properties are mostly preferential in nature, and many of them are idiomaticity indicators (section 3). We do not differentiate between idioms and collocations; in order to keep our terminology simple, we will call the extracted patterns collocation candidates."]},{"title":"2. Extraction methods 2.1. Preprocessing: dependency parsing","paragraphs":["As German constituent order is quite flexible, the components of multiword expressions do not always occur adjacently. Using the results of a deep syntactic analysis allows us to easily extract MWEs of different patterns together with their morpho-syntactic features, even if the components are distant. We work with FSPAR (Schiehlen, 2003), a finite-state based dependency parser which provides an explicitly underspecified (disjunctive) representation of syntactic ambiguities, both at the level of attachment and grammatical function (expressed by means of case). Its output format is one token per line, annotated with POS-tag, lemma, morpho-syntactic features, governors and information about the token’s grammatical function in the sentence (cf. the columns in the table in figure 1). Morpho-syntactic features of nouns or adjectives indentified by the parser (and extracted along with the collocation candidates) include gender, number and case. As can be seen in the example (cf. figure 1) reproduced in figure 2, morpho-syntactic annotation as well as dependencies can be ambiguous: The parser lists two possible attachments for the preposition in line 11, referring either to the noun directly above it (Kopf in den Sand: ’head in the sand’) or to the verb in line 6 (stecken [...] in den Sand: ’hide [...] in the sand’). Attachment ambiguities (line 11) and in particular case syncretism (ambiguous at the level of grammatical functions, cf. line 17) can be an obstacle for an accurate extraction of collocation candidates. 2.2. Extraction The first step in the extraction process is to identify verbs, and then to basically ’collect’ all potential complements referring to the respective verb. In the sentence in table 1, we would find that the prepositional phrases bei Gefahr"]},{"title":"3195 pos word pos","paragraphs":["- lemma","morpho-syntactic gover- gramm.","form tag features nor function 0 ” $) ” | -1 TOP 1 Kann VMFIN können 3:Sg:Pres|1:Sg:Pres -1 TOP 2 sehr ADV sehr | 4/1||3 ADJ 3 schnell ADJD schnell | 4/1 ADJ 4 laufen VVINF laufen Inf 4/1 RK 5 und KON und | -1 TOP 6 steckt VVFIN stecken 3:Sg:Pres|2:Pl:Pres 16 ADJ 7 bei APPR bei Dat 6 ADJ 8 Gefahr NN Gefahr Dat:F:Sg 7 PCMP 9 den ART d | 10 SPEC 10 Kopf NN Kopf Akk:M:Sg 6 NP:8 11 in APPR in Akk 6||10 ADJ 12 den ART d | 13 SPEC 13 Sand NN Sand Akk:M:Sg 11 PCMP 14 ” $) ” | -1 PUNCT 15 , $, , | 16 PUNCT 16 sagt VVFIN sagen 3:Sg:Pres|2:Pl:Pres -1 TOP 17 G.

Figure 2: Translation of the sentence used as example in figure 1. (line 7) and in den Sand (line 11) refer to the verb stecken in line 6, as well as the direct object Kopf (line 10). Information about the number and determiner of noun phrases is extracted as well. 2.3. Ambiguity handling Due to the difficulty to distinguish between complement and adjunct PPs, pp-attachment is very often ambiguous. Since any PP or a combination of several PPs might be collocationally relevant, we include every dependency listed in the parse output. We assume that we can statistically even out the noise we get by including every possible pp-attachment listed in the parse-output: when applying statistical association measures (e.g. log-likelihood ratio, (Evert, 2005)), idiomatic and collocational expressions (being highly associated) are better rated than mere free combinations. However, noun phrases with case label ambiguities are not included in the data collection, in an attempt to keep the data as clean as possible. While this clearly leads to a loss in recall, we will not have to deal with multiple entries, as it would be the case with several noun phrases being annotated as either subject or as direct/indirect object. 2.4. Storage Extraction results are stored in a PostgreSQL-database. Table 1(a) shows a (partial) entry containing the results obtained from the sentence given in figure 1. An entry in the column V LEM is obligatory, while all other fields are optional as long as there is at least one subject, object or prepositional phrase.

Since PPs often occur as adjuncts, there can be an unlimited number of them in PREP PHRASE. To be able to study each of these prepositional phrases individually, multiple values in this column are split into separate entries, (illustrated in table 1(b)), which are enriched with morphological information about the respective PP. This design allows us to study patterns containing a single prepositional phrase as well as patterns with several combined PPs. Table 2 gives an impression of a more extensive entry: the expression gute Miene zum üblen Spiel machen is idiomatic (’make the best of it’, lit. ’make (a) brave face to the bad game’) and only complete with both adjectives."]},{"title":"3. Context parameters","paragraphs":["We extract the following context parameters: reflexivity of the verbal element of the collocation candidate, negation, adverbs and fusion of a preposition and a definite article"]},{"title":"3196","paragraphs":["V LEM SUBJ ACC ACC PREP","N N OBJ ADJ LEM ADJ","machen Diplomat Miene gut zu Spiel übel FUS NEG ADV SENTENCE + − wieder Der frühere Diplomat macht wieder mal mal gute Miene zum üblen Spiel ... Table 2: Example for a data-base entry. Number and determiner of the nouns are not shown. (cf. zur fused vs. zu der unfused). Each noun has the features number, determiner and adjective. There are 6 possible values for determination: definite, indefinite, demonstrative, possessive, nulland quantifying. In the case of a quantifying determiner, we also extract its lemma like jeder (’every’) or keiner (’no’). Occurring (nearly) always in a negated context is characteristic of a certain group of MWES, namely negative polarity items. Since there are far more possibilities for negative contexts than just negation of the verb or noun (which can be derived from the negation particle nicht (feature NEG) or the quantifierkein), we experimented with modeling negative contexts, to specifically extract negative polarity items. For example, an inherently negative verb like bezweifeln (’to doubt’) would indirectly negate a subsequent statement. For a more detailed description of negative polarity items see (Lichte and Soehn, 2007) or (Fritzinger et al., 2010a). In the case of preposition-noun-verb combinations (PNV-triples), we also applied two syntactically motivated features. As we expect the components of idiomatic MWEs to be (immediate) neighbours, we compute a simple adjacency measure. It is based on the positions of the preposition, the noun and the verb. While trivial preposition-noun-verb combinations can appear in combination with e.g. adjectives and adjuncts like relative clauses (as demonstrated in example 1), idioms and collocations tend to exclude such modifiers and hence are (immediately) adjacent (see example 2). Preposition, noun and verb of a non-trivial combination cannot be immediate neighbours if a determiner or adjective is part of the idiom/collocation (shown in example 3). However, the relative position of verb, noun and preposition is still fixed.","1 Auf kleinen Zetteln, die an Bäume geklebt worden waren , stand: “Wilson kommt”. On small notes, that to trees glued been had, stood: “Wilson comes”. On small notes that had been glued to trees, it read: “Wilson comes”.","2 Sie glauben, daß dadurch die Wirtschaft wieder in Fahrt kommt. They believe that thereby the economy again in run comes. They believe that thereby the economy gets going again.","3 Den Grünen werden vorschnelle und unüberlegte Politiksprünge in die Schuhe geschoben. The Greens are overhasty and unreflected political moves in the shoes shoved. Thes Greens are made responsible for overhasty and unreflected political moves. Furthermore, idiomatic MWEs rarely occur at the very be-ginning of a sentence (in vorfeld position), except in contrastive contexts, e.g. together with adverbs like jedoch (’however’). We distinguish different types of vorfeld occurrences: All the MWE components (preposition, noun, verb) can be in the vorfeld with the verb being either finite or infinite followed by an auxiliary verb. Idiomatic MWEs can appear in this structure ((partial) VP-fronting, cf. example 4), although usually only in contrastive or otherwise special contexts. In the second type, only the preposition and the noun are in vorfeld position, followed by an auxiliary in the subsequent position (the linke Satzklammer, left verbal position) with the main verb later in the sentence. This structure does not work for idiomatic MWEs (example 5), but it can be used without problems for trivial MWEs (see example 6). We can thus use the restrictions on this particular context as one syntactic feature (among others) to tell idiomatic PNVs apart from non-idiomatic ones. The non-trivial triple in Stellung bringen (’to bring into position’) (total frequency 188), occurs once in the vorfeld (example 4). Moving the verb out of the vorfeld, (as demonstrated in example 5), leads to an ungrammatical sentence as opposed to the sentence in example 6 with the trivial expression in Klinik bringen (’to bring into hospital’).","4 In Stellung gebracht worden seien Al-Samoud-Raketen mit einer Reichweite von 200 Kilometern In position brought been have Al-Samoud missiles with a range of 200 kilometres Al-Samoud missiles with a range of 200 kilometres have been positioned","5 *In Stellung seien Al-Samoud-Raketen mit einer Reichweite von 200 Kilometern gebracht worden","6 In die Klinik hatten die Eltern sie gegen ihren Willen gebracht. Into the hospital had the parents her against her will brought. The parents took her into a hospital against her will. The restrictions on the use in vorfeld can thus be used as indicators of idiomatized MWE candidates. They are a symptom of a more general syntactic-semantic phenomenon, and even if they are not relevant for human-oriented lexicography, they are indeed relevant for the lexicon of text generation tools; provided an adequate information structure, it may be useful for such a system to have access to data about the possibility of VP- or PP-fronting in multiwords. Since many idiomatic MWEs are morpho-syntactically fixed in number and determination, and also may be special in terms of their syntactic behaviour, these parameters can be used for sorting syntactically defined word co-occurrences (PNV-triples in table 3) into idiom/collocation candidates vs. non-fixed non-idiomatic combinations.

A further step towards more general predicate-argument-structure extraction, e.g. for texts from specialized language, could be to replace the actual nouns by an abstract term, such as the categories provided by GERMANET1","."]},{"title":"4. Experiments and results 4.1. Patterns","paragraphs":["As illustrated in table 4, idiomatic expressions can be of different length and form. While components like certain adjectives or nouns can be obligatory within a given MWE, there might be more variation in other cases. It is also possible that an idiomatic MWE occurring mostly with a certain (group of) adjective(s) can also felicitously occur without an adjective. The adjectives in lines 2, 5 and 8 of table 4 are integral parts of the respective MWE. Looking at the expression ’auf ADJ Ohren stoßen’ (’(not) find a good listener’, table 5), it becomes evident that there is a clear preference for the two most frequent adjectives. However, to be idiomatic at all, the expression must occur with an adjective, while e.g. the combination Wert legen (’to insist’) occurs (roughly) equally often with or without adjective. The fact that longer patterns contain less complex ones leads to a problem of overlapping results: when extract-ing data covered by short patterns, we do not want to find incomplete expressions. Similarly, we are not interested in finding valid, shortMWEs combined with varying adjuncts. For more details, see section 4.4. 4.2. Data and evaluation The corpus collection we worked with (269 million tokens) consists of newspaper articles (1987-99) and the proceed-ings of European parliament debates (EUROPARL2","). Table 6 gives an impression of the number of extracted syntactic structures and the results of a simple evaluation we carried out for this selection of patterns. 4.3. Extraction errors Generally, we can distunguish between two kinds of undesired extraction results: the first ones are trivialMwes, that 1 http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/lsd 2 http://www.statmt.org/europarl","Syntactic pattern example 1 noun verb Wert legen 2 adj noun verb grün Licht geben 3","NOUN NOUN VERB (dem) Fass (den) Boden","ausschlagen 4 prep noun verb in Sand setzen 5 prep adj noun verb für bar Münze nehmen 6 noun prep noun verb Kopf in Sand stecken 7","ADJ NOUN PREP NOUN dick Strich durch VERB Rechnung machen 8","ADJ NOUN PREP ADJ gut Miene zu böse NOUN PREP Spiel machen 9 PREP NOUN PREP NOUN mit Kanone auf Spatz","VERB schießen","10 PREP NOUN PREP NOUN wie Sand an Meer 11","PREP NOUN VERB VERB mit Angst (zu) tun bekommen Table 4: Different syntactic patterns with entries of idiomatic expressions (examples are lemmatized).

But there can also be ’false positive’ results, i.e. expressions that appear to be an idiom but are not idiomatic in all observed instances. Here again, we can distinguish two types: literal use of an idiomatic Mwe, vs. a wrong analysis, e.g. of pp-attachment making a combination look like a valid idiom. For more information, see Cook et al. (2008) or Sporleder et al. (2010) for English and Fritzinger et al. (2010b) for German, who investigate the actual rate of literal use of idioms in different corpora. At this point, we ignore the possibility of literal usage and focus only on wrong pp-attachment in PNV-triples leading to false positives. We carried out an analysis of 69 valid idiomatic PNV-triples with 100 randomly chosen occurrences for each3",". The sentence length was restricted to 40 tokens. Example 7 shows the false positive triple in Betrieb sein (lit. ’to be in operation’: ’to operate’) found in a sentence with in Lohn und Brot stehen (lit. ’to be in pay and bread’: ’to be in so.’s pay’), where the latter is an idiomatic expression and in Betrieb (’in business’) a mere adjunct. If the verbal elements are sein (’to be’) or haben (’to have’), our system might confuse auxiliary verb readings with full verb readings. In the above examples, extracted triples are printed in boldface while correct structures are underlined. We found that MWEs containing certain noun-preposition combinations are prone to extraction errors; these noun-preposition combinations are commonly used as (idiomatic) adjuncts: in+Augen (lit. ’in (his) eyes’: ’in his 3 This set of sentences is smaller if the given idiom has a fre-","quency below 100."]},{"title":"3198","paragraphs":["PNV NPNV PANV NV ANV EP NEWS EP NEWS EP NEWS EP NEWS EP NEWS tokens 1.576.220 10.165.415 572.523 3.139.948 404.813 2.580.320 978.083 4.913.847 260.621 1.216.437 n=25 16 23 0 5 3 16 14 19 7 10 n=50 28 39 3 14 8 31 27 37 10 19 n=100 55 82 4 31 16 46 47 71 17 37 n=500 153 290 29 86 57 131 165 247 59 113 Table 6: Number of extracted database-entries (’tokens’) for the syntactic patterns highlighted in table 4 and number of non-trivial items in the top n when sorted by frequency.

Table 7(a) shows how many false positives were among 100 randomly chosen occurrences for some of the examined idioms, while table 7(b) gives an overall impression of the evaluation. Note that the first entry in table 7(a) needs a reflexive pronoun to be complete; although information about reflexivity of verbs is available, we chose to exlcude this feature from this evaluation in order to keep the evaluated data as simple as possible: we do not want the same PNV-triple to occur twice, with and without a reflexive pronoun. As can be seen in the examples, the idiomatic version and the adjunct have different preferences for determiner and number: If the morphological preferences of an idiom are known, false positives can be discarded in many cases. 4.4. Detailed analysis of the extracted morpho-","syntactic features As most of the above examples illustrate, collocations and idioms are morphologically and/or syntactically restricted. In the following experiment, we want to examine the usefulness of the extracted morhosyntactic features for the identification of non-trivialMWEs. The test set consists of the 1013 most frequent PNV-triples (f ≥ 210) extracted from newspaper text. Nouns like Mark, Franc, Prozent (’percent’), being very frequent in newspaper text, but not interesting for MWE-extraction, have been excluded in advance. Two native speakers manually annotated the data deciding about the idiomaticity of each candidate. Cases with conflicting annotation were discussed in detail with a third native speaker. Incomplete patterns, e.g. idiomatic triples with a missing adjective, were marked as valid idioms since we expect the PNV-part under rewiew to be morpho-syntactically restricted in the same way as the complete idiom would be. Overall, 513 candidates were labelled as non-trivial MWEs. To test the indicator value of morpho-syntactic features, we intend to identify these cases by searching for strong preferences (see section 4.5). For each triple, we computed a fixedness-score derived from the averaged or most prominent features of this triple. This score is intended to represent the morpho-syntactic preferences of an MWE. All PNV-triples are then sorted according to their scores. The quality of a sorted list can be measured with the uninterpolated average precision (UAP) score, peaking at value 1 for a perfectly sorted list (Manning and Schütze, 1999). We opt for this measure as we want to split candidate expressions into trivial and non-trivial combinations. Since degrees of fixedness vary, we attempt to sort them ranging from very idiomatic at top to less idiomatic towards the end of the list. In table 8(a) we present the UAP-scores for the list sorted seaparately by each of the enumerated features. The respec-"]},{"title":"3199","paragraphs":["(a) feature num det neg adjacency vorfeld uap 0.607 0.650 0.643 0.694 0.566 (b) grouping M1 M2 S M2+S","det+num det+num+neg adja+vorf. uap 0.635 0.681 0.664 0.830","(c)","weighted M2+2S M2+3S M2+4S M2+5S M2+6S uap 0.845 0.853 0.857 0.858 0.859 Table 8: UAP-values for the morpho-syntactic features computed separately (a), grouped (b), and weighted (c). Candidates with the same score are ordered alphabetically. Ordering according to frequency results in an UAP-value of 0.651. tive scores are either based on the number of occurrences of the features in relation to the triple’s overall frequency (vorfeld, neg) or the percentage of the most prominent value (num, det), i.e. singular or plural and the determiner occurring most often with a given PNV-triple. The adjacency measure was averaged over all occurrences of a triple and averaged to be within 0 and 1. Table 8(b) shows the resulting UAP-values when the features are grouped into morphologically and syntactically motivated categories. The features within the groups are weighted equally. Adding the neg feature to M1 improves the sorting quality, while combining morphological (M2) and syntactic (S) features results in an even bigger improvement. The morphologically and syntactically motivated features are independent from each other and complementary: this can be exploited, for example, to identify a morphologically fixed trivial combination because of its lower S-score for being syntactically unrestricted. However, the syntactically motivated features have a greater impact on sorting quality than the morphological ones as illustrated in table 8(c), where the weight for S has been gradually increased. This might be due to the fact that det and num are related features while, vorfeld and the adjacency measure are independent. In fact, the adjacency measure has only been computed for verb-final sentences and therefore there is no overlap with the vorfeld feature. 4.5. Expanding basic patterns By detecting a strong preference for a certain object and/or adjective, basic, incomplete patterns could be expanded into more complex idioms. In the following experiment, we want to focus only on adjectives in PNV-triples. There are two aspects we need to consider: Does a given PNV-triple occur always or nearly always with an adjective, and if so, is there lexical variation in adjectives or are they always the same? As a first step, triples occurring mostly without adjectives are excluded: Out of 1013 PNV-triples,133 never appear with an adjective and 610 occur in at least 90% of all cases without an adjective. When sorting the list of candidate-triples by a score based on the combination of morpho-","size of test set 1013 [all] 610 [ADJ≤0.1] 133 [ADJ=0] idioms 512 390 99 UAP 0.833 0.892 0.937 Table 9: Results when sorting according to a score based on morpho-syntactically features combined with the precantage of adjectives per candidate. logical and syntactic features (cf. table 8(b)) and the percentage of adjective occurrences, an UAP-value of 0.833 is achieved, a slight improvement compared to the sorting result without the adjective feature (0.830). By reducing the entire list of 1013 candidates to the 610 supposedly adjective-free candidates, sorting quality is improved to a UAP-value of 0.892. A further reduction to the 133 entirely adjective-free candidates results in an UAP-value of 0.937 (cf. table 9). Using a threshold of 90%, we still allow for a few adjectives to occur occasionally with a candidate triple. By including the percentage of adjective appearances into the score, very few or no adjectives at all are rewarded compared to more adjectives indicating no clear preference. Creative use of language definitely is an obstacle to our approach: Some idioms a native speaker would intuitively judge as not being able to be used with an adjective appear nevertheless in such combinations. In example 10, the idiom zu Sache gehen (lit. ’to go to thing’: ’there is a great ambiance’) is used with the adjective fröhlich (’funny’) to describe the atmosphere at the event, resulting in a sentence on the verge to ungrammaticality.","10 Dort geht es bei Schunkelmusik des Musikcorps Stierstadt zur fröhlichen Sache. There goes it with beer tent music of the music club ‘Stierstadt’ to the funny thing. With beer tent music played by the music club ‘Stierstadt’, there is a great ambiance. With supposedly adjective-free triples now identified and exluded from the test set, the remaining 403 candidates have to be divided into a set of idioms where a specific adjective is an obligatory part of the pattern vs. one where the presence of adjectives is common and not restricted. At this point, the distribution of adjectives co-occurring with a cendidate expression is used to indicate preferences. Table 10 shows candidate triples with their respective most frequent adejctive and the precentage of occurrence in all instances with an adjective. While there are idiomatic expressions with a clear preference, there are also (morpho-syntactically fixed) frequent non-idiomatic formulae with a specific, obligatory adjective. In the case ofmit sofortig Wirkung bestellen (’to order with immediate effect’), only the preposition-adjective-noun construct is fixed: it can be used with different verbs. To overcome this problem, a more detailed study including the association between individual parts of a pattern would be necessary (e.g. (Zinsmeister and Heid, 2004)).

Although some of the trivial items with a strong preference for adjectives (cf. table 10) could be relegated to lower ranks, its UAP-value of 0.566 is very low. While it is relatively easy to find idiomatic MWEs without adjectives, it is difficult to divide triples commonly containing adjectives into idioms with a restricted range of possible adjectives (cf. table 5) and idiomatic expressions with unrestricted combination possibilities."]},{"title":"5. Conclusion","paragraphs":["We showed methods to extract German idiomatic multiword expressions along with their morpho-syntactic features from dependency-parsed text. By storing all features, as well as all typical lexical modifiers, complements, etc. of a given MWE, as extracted from the parsing output, we can identify MWE candidates of different complexity. In addition, the stored features and a manually created small gold standard list of ca. 1000 idiomatic MWEs allowed us to start assessing the usefulness of individual features or feature combinations for the identification of idiomatic MWEs. As morpho-syntactic fixedness and syntactic preferences are neither necessary nor sufficient condidtions for idiomaticity, an approach that combines both types of features leads to better accuracy in idiom identification. The context parameters identified for individual MWEs can directly be reused in the lexical description of the expressions: among others, they are inserted into the electronic collocation dictionary under construction in the work described by (Spohr, 2008). Monolingual context parameters are one type of indicators of idiomaticity. Another one is semantic transparency vs. opaqueness, as it is identified, for example, in work by (Villada Moirón and Tiedemann, 2006), (Fritzinger, 2009), by use of translational behaviour. In the same spirit as with combining morpho-syntactic and structural syntactic features, we are experimenting with a combined use of both types of indicators and find results quite promising. Another strand of future work concerns the separation of incomplete shorter and complete longer versions of multiword expressions. We intend to carry out this work on larger chunks of text from the web."]},{"title":"6. References","paragraphs":["Paul Cook, Afsaneh Fazly, and Suzanne Stevenson. 2008. The vcn-tokens dataset.
