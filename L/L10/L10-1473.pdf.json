This corpus is available in all 6 official languages of the UN, consisting of around 300 million words per language. We describe the methods we used for crawling, document formatting, and sentence alignment. This corpus also includes a common test set for machine translation. We present the results of a French-Chinese machine translation experiment performed on this corpus."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["The development of machine translation systems, regardless the paradigms behind them, requires a significant amount of knowledge resources in both languages. The essential resource for building a high-quality statistical machine translation (SMT) system is a well-prepared parallel corpus of a reasonable size. Lack of such a corpus is one of the most common reasons of the low translation quality for certain language pairs. There are many other cross-lingual applications relying on parallel corpora, including parallel term extraction, cross-lingual information retrieval, and cross-lingual question answering. In addition to multilingual applications, parallel corpora are also valuable source for propagating linguistic knowledge across languages, which is especially important for morphological (Snyder and Barzilay, 2008) and syntactic analysis (Hwa et al., 2005) for resource poor languages.","As the coverage of language pairs has been extended to include Chinese and Arabic in the EuroMatrixPlus project, we collected parallel texts from official documents through the Official Document System (ODS) of the United Nations in all six official languages, namely Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish, with a small part of the documents available also in German.","In addition to the processed individual documents, we also provide sentence-aligned bilingual texts of all 21 language pairs. The current release of this MultiUN corpus contains 463, 406 documents encoded in XML, around 1% of them is in German. Over 10, 000 new files have been added to the corpus since previous internal pre-release 6 months ago. The corpus can easily grow when new documents become available in ODS. We hope this corpus can play the role of a bridge from the resources in European languages to the others. The paper explains the automatic acquisition procedure of the corpus and a step further towards its applications in statistical machine translation: a set of SMT systems constructed upon the corpus."]},{"title":"2. Background","paragraphs":["In general, the more data is used, the better the translations the system may produce. The size of a parallel corpus directly influences on the translation quality of the SMT system built based on it. Furthermore, the domain and the time range of the corpus also have an effect on the SMT system, since the the use of languages varies significantly under different conditions. Hence, given the domain of the corpus, it is always useful to have a corpus from a source providing up-to-date new documents/texts such as EuroParl (Koehn, 2005).","While early parallel texts usually involve only two languages, one of which is English in many cases, many corpora developed in recently years contain versions of texts in more languages. Such multilingual aligned texts provide a more compact way for storage. A parallel corpus in N languages is equivalent to at least N (N − 1)/2 bilingual corpora. As a matter of fact, multilingual corpora carry far more information than the union of the corresponding bilingual corpora. The correspondences among multiple languages are able to reveal hidden knowledge that cannot be easily inferred from any single correspondence. One instance of utilizing such corpora is triangulation, either through the unions of multiple translation correspondences (Cohn and Lapata, 2007; Och and Ney, 2001; Kumar et al., 2007; Simard, 1999) or through the intersections (Chen et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2009). To our knowledge, this type of corpora mostly exists for European languages, such as Europarl (11 European langugaes), UMC (Klyueva and Bojar, 2008) (English-Czech-Russian), UN Parallel text (Graff, 1994) (English-French-Spanish) and JRC-Acquis (Steinberger et al., 2006) (23 European languages) .","Multilingual corpora of European languages, such as EuroParl and JRC-Acquis, were the essential materials to produce as many as 462 machine translation systems (Koehn et al., 2009). Although multilingual data acquired from UN documents has already been used/discussed by many researchers (Eisele, 2006; Kumar et al., 2007) and a limited subset of the official documents is available (Rafalovitch and Dale, 2009), there is no corpus comparable to the one we present here."]},{"title":"3. Corpus collection","paragraphs":["We describe here briefly the acquisition procedure of the MultiUN corpus from the ODS of the United Nations. The documents we collected are in public domain according to the Administrative Instruction"]},{"title":"2868","paragraphs":["(ST/AI/189/Add.9/Rev.2) from the United Nations (United Nations Secretariat, 1987). Crawling We crawled a set of documents from the ODS website of the United Nations, where most of the documents are encoded in Microsoft Word DOC format. The bulk of the data we obtained is from the years 2000 up to 2009, and before document alignment and cleaning, we had more than a million documents per complete year. Preprocessing We converted the documents collected from the ODS to XML. In order to preserve high quality texts, we discarded certain contents in the original documents, including the pictures, the tables and some style markers. Besides, the converted files also contain the following meta-information regarding the original files: • a file ID, which is unique for each individual file,","• the language with which the document is labeled in the ODS, • the publication date of the document, and","• a document symbol, a unique identifier consisting of numbers and letters for a United Nations document.","A symbol in ODS is a unique identifier consisting of numbers and letters for a United Nations document. The first component in a symbol usually indicates the parent organ issuing the document or to which the document is being submitted and the rest of the components may reflect subsidiary bodies, the nature of the document or modifications to the original text, which appear as suffixes. For instance, the symbol “A/CONF.157/PC/63/Add.4” refers to document No. 63 from the Preparatory Committee of the World Conference on Human Rights in General Assembly. The symbol is shared by all language versions of a document. In other words, we can easily identify parallel documents by the symbols. It is possible for one document to be related to several dates. We only preserved the final publication date to avoid confusion. Selection and cleaning Not all the extracted contents are fully suitable for direct use in natural language processing applications. There are several types of meta-information in these documents beyond the text. Even though it is always desirable to collect as many texts as possible, it is even more important to ensure the quality of the texts, which is crucial for the systems built from the texts. We are thereby strict on selection of the documents. Most documents before 1993 are only scanned pictures. Moreover, many files before 2000 are formatted in various en-codings other than unicode depending on the languages, which became the major obstacle for the extraction of useful texts. Thus, we processed documents only starting from year 2000 due to this irregularity. As for the documents we kept, we filtered out all out-of-range characters as well as noisy lines, for example, lines with only URL links.","The language of each individual document is another criterion for our selection. We observed that the language information provided in the ODS is not always reliable. Including texts in a different language will certainly introduce noise to the corpus. The size of the texts in a language different from the one given for the file varies from one line to the complete document. To find out the documents inconsistent with their language labels, we applied mguesser(Barkov, 2008), a C implementation of the N-gram based text classification algorithm TextCat (Cavnar and Trenkle, 1994), to all the documents. We manually selected 10 manually verified files, roughly 500Kb, to build a customized character-based language model for each language. A file is removed from our collection if it is identified as different from the given language. Mean-while, the annexes in the documents, mostly duplicated rather than translated across the languages, are the main source of such noisy texts. We discarded any documents containing annexes without further language identification. It is also possible to introduce more fine grained language identification to preserve more texts in the future. Formating After the documents are selected and cleaned, there are a few more steps to facilitate the use of the corpus. Firstly, the UN official documents only provide paragraph boundaries. However, most machine translation tasks consider sentences as the basic units, as the complexity of both system training and translations increases significantly with longer units. We conducted sentence splitting to the extracted texts to follow this tradition. The Chinese texts are split with simple regular expressions, while the others are processed using the sentence tokenization module from NLTK toolkit (Bird and Loper, 2004). However, the paragraph boundaries are preserved in the documents.","Secondly, the files are originally assigned by ODS with names not related to the documents’ properties in any obvious way. We renamed the files according to the document symbol and the language. Since some characters in the document symbols are not allowed to appear in file names in certain operating systems, we abbreviate the symbols to meet the requirements while maintaining the unambiguity of the symbols. For instance, the file originally labeled with the file id “N0831582” is now named “ S AGENDA 5874-ru”, where “ S AGENDA 5874” indicates the document symbol “ S/AGENDA/5874” and “ ru” refers to Russian.","Finally, we introduced several additional XML tags to indicate special phrases. Only URLs and emails are identified and tagged so far for the current release, but it is clearly possible to include further tags, especially for named entities like person names, locations, organization names, etc. Sentence alignment As the last step, the sentences are automatically aligned with hunalign (Varga et al., 2005), which takes tokenized sentence-segmented texts in two languages and outputs a sequence of bilingual sentence pairs. Without dictionaries for all languages, we chose the two-pass option that first aligns based on sentence-length information, builds an automatic dictionary based on this alignment and realigns the text in a second pass, using the automatic dictionary. The paragraph boundaries are also considered for the alignments. However, the changes of 2"]},{"title":"2869","paragraphs":["sentence order are not handled. Aligned texts are prepared bilingually for all 21 language pairs between the 7 languages. We plan to deliver multilingual alignments in the near future. Common Test Set We plan to renew the corpus every half a year. Since the documents usually become available in 6 months after its original publication date, it is only necessary to process documents for the last 12 months in each update. Furthermore, we reserved the documents in the last 6 months for testing and comparisons, which is going to be included in the training set in the next update. This not only allows us to increase the size of the training set but also help to compare the MT systems on a up-to-date test set."]},{"title":"4. Availability of the corpus","paragraphs":["We made the corpus available to the research community through the web site of the EuroMatrixPlus project 1",". We hope that free access to this parallel corpus will be beneficial for extending the coverage of publicly available MT systems to additional languages in similar ways as Europarl and the Acquis Communautaire were crucial for research and development of MT systems for EU languages in the recent past."]},{"title":"5. Property of the corpus","paragraphs":["The current version of the corpus consists of documents from January 2000 to September 2009. Meanwhile, the documents from October 2009 to March 2010 are included as testing material.","Table 1 lists all sections of the corpus by language. The corpus consists of 463, 406 documents, 80, 931, 645 sentences in total. There are 326 million tokens on average for five of the six official languages.","We disregarded Chinese for all word counts as there are many distinct standards for Chinese word segmentation. Hence, we only report the counts of Chinese characters in the corpus here.","More statistics of the aligned parallel texts for each language pairs are given in Table 2, 3 and 4."]},{"title":"6. Application in MT","paragraphs":["As the first step towards applying the corpus in MT, we use this corpus to construct SMT systems with the Moses toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007). Translation models were trained using the complete set of parallel texts, while 5-gram language models were built with only the target side of the aligned texts. We randomly extracted 3, 000 sentences from the reserved portion of the corpus, 1, 000 of which were used for training the feature weights of the decoder and the rest was for testing.","Using the Moses toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007), we followed a standard routine to build SMT systems for four translations directions between three languages: Spanish 1 http://www.euromatrixplus.eu/downloads 2 Only number of characters are counted for Chinese texts. to Chinese, Chinese to Spanish, French to Chinese and Chinese to French. We segmented the Chinese texts with Stanford Chinese Word Segmenter (Tseng et al., 2005). The phrase-based translation models are trained on sentences with less than 80 tokens.","The systems also include 5-gram language models trained on the target side of corresponding parallel texts using SRILM (Stolcke, 2002). The feature weights required by the Moses decoder are further determined with minimum error rate training (MERT) (Och, 2003) by optimizing BLEU scores on the 1,000-sentence development set. The test sets were translated by the resulting systems and thus used to evaluate the systems in terms of BLEU scores (Papineni et al., 2001), as shown in Table 5 Language pairs Development set Test set Spanish-Chinese 33.25 31.35 Chinese-Spanish 40.65 39.08 French-Chinese 29.40 29.94 Chinese-French 34.85 34.66 Table 5: BLEU scores of the SMT systems","Figure 1 shows an example translation produced by our Chinese-French system together with translation of the same sentence provided by an online MT engine. Our system is able to correctly translate the organization names and the dates, even though we did not include preprocess-ing such as named entity recognition into the system. It is mostly likely because of the large amount of in-domain training data."]},{"title":"7. Conclusion","paragraphs":["We have presented MultiUN version 1, the new release of the multilingual parallel corpus extracted from official documents of the United Nations. Using the corpus, we were able to construct SMT systems for several language pairs that were not often studied before and the translation results are satisfactory given the amount of efforts required to build the systems. However, the released corpus may still contain various errors and flaws. We plan to further improve our processing techniques and provide more features in further versions.","We believe MultiUN corpus is a very useful resource for MT developers. The corpus not only allows us to build SMT systems for the 21 translation directions, but also provides many potential bridges between European languages that are included in existing multilingual parallel corpora to other languages, such as Arabic and Chinese. We hope the release of this corpus will further boost the research in the field."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["This work was supported by the European Community through the EuroMatrix Plus project (ICT-231720) funded under the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development. 3"]},{"title":"2870","paragraphs":["Language English French Spanish Arabic Russian Chinese German Documents 96240 85651 70509 65156 77061 65022 3763 Sentences 17098695 14805529 13052875 11050313 13852535 10839473 232225 Words2","385894793 377242310 352460926 237412090 278606813 756108566 5848668 Table 1: Sizes of monolingual data","fr es ar ru zh de en 96240 68314 63257 74053 62815 3643 fr 68014 63193 73973 62738 3632 es 63241 64230 62707 3632 ar 63194 63031 3677 ru 62842 3635 zh 3886 Table 2: Number of document pairs for the language pairs","fr es ar ru zh de en 12317630 10663070 8206568 6166942 8829060 156507 fr 11062423 8841529 8244246 8727150 153177 es 8794485 6873585 8788366 150874 ar 9045096 7581084 144408 ru 4778903 120836 zh 153815 Table 3: Number of sentence pairs for the language pairs","fr es ar ru zh de","en 301878068 267327033 214681635 163816832 220423478 4770788 337798816 311593654 180759040 97272528 629509919 4626954","fr 315786275 255119236 236294787 243833077 5332166","328728803 195015089 154383105 627949668 4583826","es 262276003 209978115 252782013 5511988","193169242 128538959 621772385 4494109","ar 200786093 162186078 3976850","196836622 574219433 4384192","ru 68484167 3089380","392289340 3758626","zh 13109304","4525561 Table 4: Number of words (L1:L2) for the language pairs 2"]},{"title":"8.
