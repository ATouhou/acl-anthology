We introduce the tagging scheme and develop a tagging tool for constructing this corpus. Anno-tated samples are described. Information including opinions (yes or no), their polarities (positive, neutral or negative), types (expression, status, or action), is defined and annotated. In addition, five structure trios are introduced according to the linguistic relations between two Chinese words. Four of them that are possibly related to opinions are also annotated in the constructed corpus to provide the linguistic cues. The number of opinion sentences together with the number of their polarities, opinion types, and trio types are calculated. These statistics are compared and discussed. To know the quality of the annotations in this corpus, the kappa values of the annotations are calculated. The substantial agreement between annotations ensures the applicability and reliability of the constructed corpus.",""]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["Opinion analysis is practical for many applications. Sentiment information can be applied to product recommendation, review summarization, public polling, etc. Product reviews, due to their availability on the web, are often adopted to develop prototyped opinion analysis systems (Bai and Padman, 2005; Ghose and Ipeirotis, 2007). However, documents collected from real world are usually raw, and need some text pre-processing before usages. Besides, only documents and their evaluative stars are available in such corpora. The lack of syntactic or semantic information limits the development of opinion analysis technologies.  This problem is more serious for Mandarin Chinese. Few materials are available. NTCIR MOAT1","is the most well-known task (Seki et al., 2008) which provides experimental corpora at sentence and clause levels for multilingual opinion analysis. Opinion labels, their polarities, holders, and targets were annotated in MOAT corpus. However, this corpus does not provide linguistic features either.  Linguistic features such as word boundaries, parts of speech, and sentence structures might be important in opinion analysis. Previous research revealed that parts of speech are useful features (Wiebe 2000; Riloff et al., 2003). However, there are limited resources for researchers to do thorough researches on the relations of other linguistic features and opinions. Parts of speeches are the most often available features and other more intensive linguistic features are difficult to get. To further explore how composite components function linguistically to express an opinion needs an opinion corpus with labeled syntactic information. For this purpose, Chinese Treebank is selected as the cor-  1 http://research.nii.ac.jp/ntcir/index-en.html pus for annotation in this paper, and opinions were not annotated on it before."]},{"title":"2. Opinion Tagging Scheme","paragraphs":["Thoughts expressed by persons or organizations are often considered as opinions. In the example: “this expert said that the authority will not forbid workers to leave”, an expert expresses his thoughts, and it is considered as an opinion.  However, opinions are not always in the form of expressions. Let us consider another example. The sentence, “the government has hesitations and may not do it right away”, indicates that the government is not really supportive. Instead of an expression, the action “has hesitations” reveals the attitude of the subject “government”. In this case, both supportive and oppositional actions should be treated as opinions.  Subjective information, including expressions, statuses, and actions, is considered as opinions. Dur-ing annotation, we tag whether a sentence is an opinion. If it is, its opinion type, i.e., expression, status, or action, is also determined. In opinion sentences of expression type, people reflect their subjective judgment. In opinion sentences of status type, the subjective information appears as descriptions. These descriptions could reflect the author’s opinions. In opinion sentences of action type, the opinion holder’s attitude is revealed by his action.  For those opinion sentences, we also annotate their polarities including positive, neutral, and negative. Positive opinions express a supportive attitude, while negative opinions express an opposite one. Neutral opinions indicate impartial attitudes.  In addition to label fragments as opinions and deter-"]},{"title":"1315","paragraphs":["mine their polarities, our tagging scheme introduces relations between the composite words of opinions. Linguists have defined five structural relations between two words in the Mandarin Chinese (Cheng and Tian, 1992) as follows.  (1) Parallel Type: Two word sequences play coordinate roles in a sentence. For example, “美麗 (beautiful) 而 (and) 聰慧 (smart)”,the words “美麗” (beautiful) and “聰慧” (smart) are of the parallel relation.  (2) Substantive-Modifier Type: A modified word sequence follows a modifying word sequence. For example, “淒涼地 (sadly) 笑著(laugh)”.  (3) Subjective-Predicate Type: One word sequence is an expresser and the other is described. For example, “討論 (discussion) 熱烈 (enthusiastic)”. Be verb is sometimes omitted in this case.  (4) Verb-Object Type: The first word sequence usually plays the role of verb which governs the second one, making these two word sequences similar to a verb followed by its object. For example, “ 恢復 (overcome) 疲勞 (tiredness)”.  (5) Verb-Complement Type: The first word sequence usually plays the role of verb but sometimes adjective, and the second word sequence explains the first from different aspects. For example, “收拾 (put things) 乾淨 (in order)”.  When constructing a Chinese Opinion Treebank, all relations except Parallel Type are annotated on opinion sentences. Relations of Parallel Type are not annotated because their two components are of equal importance, and the total opinion score can be calculated by simple addition.  Structural relations are represented by structural trios as follows.  (1) A structure trio contains two child nodes which bear a relation.  (2) A structure trio contains one head node which is the nearest common parent of these two child nodes.  Figure 1 shows a partial parsing tree containing words “取得” (obtain), “可喜” (happy), “成果” (results) and two annotated structure trios. The lower one contains two child nodes “可喜” (happy) and “成果” (results), and is labeled as Type 2, i.e., Substantive-Modifier (S-M (2)) in their nearest common parent node, while the upper one contains two child nodes “取得” (obtain) and “可喜成果” (happy results) and is labeled as Verb-Object (V-O (4)). ","","Figure 1: An Example of annotated structural trios"," Some tagging schemes were adopted for annotating opinions in previous researches. The MOAT corpus adopted the same schemes for the opinions and the polarities as ours, but opinion sentence types and structural trios are not labeled in it. The well known English opinion corpus MPQA (Wiebe et al., 2002) annotated at the sub-sentence level. The type of attitude (positive, negative, uncertain,) the basis for the opinions (supporting beliefs, experiences, etc.,) and the expressive style of the sentences (sarcastic and vehement, neutral, etc.) were annotated. However, information related to syntactic structures was not annotated either.

It was annotated at the word level and the syntactic structure is not available in it."]},{"title":"3. Corpus and Annotation Tools","paragraphs":["We adopt Chinese Treebank 5.1 obtained from Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) as our experimental corpus. It contains 507,222 words, 824,983 Hanzi, 18,782 sentences, and 890 data files. At first, opinion related labels are annotated on all sentences in Chinese Opinion Treebank. Then, structural trios are annotated on the parsing trees of opinion sentences.  Two tools, OAT and PAN, are developed for the annotations of opinion information and structural trios, shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3, respectively. OAT supports multiple languages by using the bilingual (English and the domestic language) command mapping file from users. Figure 2 is shown in English mode to give a better illustration. With OAT, we can browse a document sentence by sentence, and annotate opinion related labels. In addition, cues at the sub-sentence level such as opinion holder, opinion target, opinion sections and their polarities can also be annotated. Considering the annotation cost, we focus on the annotations at the sentence level at the current premier stage.   2 http://sentiwordnet.isti.cnr.it/ 3 http://wordnet.princeton.edu/"]},{"title":"1316","paragraphs":["To annotate structural trios, the parsing tree must be displayed at first. PAN analyzes the given parsing tree structure and draws the tree for annotation. OAT and PAN are both designed as browser interface to build a friendly annotation environment.  Each sentence is annotated by three annotators and the gold standard is set up by majority voting. In this way, we can generate ground truth for all sentences. The details of generating the gold standard by the lenient metric are described by Ku et al. (2007)."]},{"title":"4. A Chinese Opinion Treebank","paragraphs":["For opinion annotations, labels including opinion (opinion, or non-opinion), polarity (positive, negative, or, neutral), and type (expression, status, or action) are provided for each sentence. For structural annotations, three kinds of files with file extensions “node”, “tree”, and “trio” are generated. Table 1 shows the annotations of an example sentence. The quality of annotation is satisfactory: the average kappa value, which indicates the agreement between two annotation sets, is 0.49 (moderate agreement) between two annotators and 0.73 (substantial agreement) between one annotator and the lenient gold standard.  Table 2 shows the distribution of the opinion labels, polarity labels, and type labels in the lenient gold standard. Moreover, Figure 4 shows the statistics of opinions by type. It reveals an interesting result: the distribution of the action type is different from the other two types, and the percentage of positive opinions of the action type is overwhelming. In other words, most action opinions encourage people. Opinion expressions which stop someone doing something are rare.","","","Figure 2: An OAT interface in English mode "]},{"title":"1317 ","paragraphs":["Figure 3: PAN interface","(S ID=230: 黄河“金三角”成为新的投资热点)","(Golden Triangle of Yellow River becomes a new in-","vest hotspot)   Table 3 shows the statistics of structural trios.

The distributions of trios appearing in positive, neutral, and negative opinion sentences are similar. If we further check the ratios of four types in each polarity shown in Figure 6, we can find that there are more Type 4 (Verb-Object) trios in positive opinion sentences, compared to Type 4 trios in neutral and negative sentences.
