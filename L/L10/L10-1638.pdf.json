In particular, the research tends to analyse the use of certain terms in Computer Science in order to verify their change over the time with the aim of retrieving from the net the very essence of documentation. Its main source is a reference corpus made up of 13,500 documents which collects the scientific productions of three CNR research Institutes. They are ISTI (Institute of Information Science and Technologies), IIT (Institute of Informatics and Telematics) and ILC (Institute of Computational Linguistics), all of them born from the “Centro Studi sulle Calcolatrici Elettroniche (CSCE)” and now belonging to the CNR Department of Information & Communication Technologies and Cultural Identity. This study is divided in three sections: 1) an introductory one dedicated to the data extracted from the scientific documentation: the data have in common the use of some terms proper of the Computer Science lexicon although these term belong to different branches (Linguistics, Informatics and Telematics); 2) the second section is devoted to the description of the contents managed by the PUMA (Publication Management System) system; 3) the third part contains a statistical representation of terms extracted from archive: some comparison tables between the occurrences of the most used terms in the scientific documentation produced by the three Institutes will be created and diagrams with percentages about the most frequently used terms will be displayed too. Lastly, indexes and concordances will allow to reflect on the use of certain terms in this field and give possible keys for having access to the extraction of knowledge in the digital era.

Introduction","paragraphs":["Nowadays the need of retrieving the great amount of digital knowledge available on the web is ever more important: the vast majority of this knowledge is conveyed by means of textual material stored in scientific documentary repositories and digital archives. This documentary word preserve inside the wealth of far-off terms belonging to the past which have often fallen out of use as well as a more recent terminological production derived from the feverish need of coining new terms, a very common trend in certain branches. “Documentation is a relatively new field that deals with the collection, analysis, assignment, classification and storage of documentation in order to make the information retrievable for various uses, users, and purposes. Like terminology, documentation is cross-disciplinary in the sense that it can be applied to any branch of science or human activity. It is practice-oriented because its aim is to provide information users with suitable documents. Documentation centres also disseminate information in the form of secondary (bibliographies and dictionaries) or tertiary (bibliographies of bibliographies) publications” (Cabré, 1999: 1). The technical-scientific vocabulary represents a significant part of the lexicon of any language and plays an important role in the information exchange between the experts of the field and the users of the Internet community, the new market of knowledge where people producing informative contents can meet – by means of a common lexicon - those who are actually looking for that specific information. Information dissemination on the World Wide Web contributes to make terminology ever more important: in particular, the use of certain specific terms which become the keys for retrieving information. Temmerman says: “Terms are the engine of any comprehension process since they point out a new comprehension as well as an old comprehension, and for the classic terminology terms denote concepts. (Temmerman, 2000: 228). The analysis of scientific documentation in the field of Computer Science is especially relevant because its continuous evolution in the last decades is very significant from a terminological point of view. It is especially from the 1960s, when the use of the computer spread over all human activities thanks to the possibility of using the natural language (Giacomo Ferrari, 2003: 122), that Computer Science becomes a privileged observatory of terminological evolution: in these years, the need of naming rapidly grew within the computer scientists community and the coining of new terms and compound names satisfied this initial need by linking terms to their respective semantic and cognitive value. Since the advent of the www technologies in the 90’s, computing has had a strong impact on modern society offering new opportunities of expansion for future research. In these years the Internet has evolved to such an extent that the important changes in the field of acquisition, storage and transmission of data have provided new resources to the web society, satisfying its needs for constantly updated information. Such information can appear in journals on-line, which were started as such, or of publications originally in paper format and then made available also in electronic form. New forms of publication have emerged which provide the scientific community with free and easy access to research studies, establishing a direct relation between producers and consumers who share knowledge on the web. The people who, in rapidly increasingly numbers, access the internet to obtain information about Computer Science"]},{"title":"1245","paragraphs":["and other associated disciplines (i.e. Computational Linguistics) often encounter great problems as much of what they might be looking for can be impossible to find because of inappropriate searches. Different terms used to communicate the same idea can generate linguistic ambiguity, since the same word or phrase can allow for more than one interpretation, thus affecting the information retrieval process. It follows that the queries which are made through these linguistic variations do not always obtain the response looked for, and large amounts of information, although available, do not emerge from the web because the term is not present in the document requested. Access to the semantic contents of a document can become extremely difficult in the case of polysemy (when a word has two or more similar meanings) or of synonymy (when a word means the same as another word). The word web – which abundantly emerges from the corpus - can be taken as an example: Figure 1 shows the use of this term in the scientific documentation belonging to the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) field over the time."]},{"title":"2. PUMA","paragraphs":["Data have been extracted from a system called PUMA (Publication Management System), a digital library management system for institutional repositories of technical or scientific documents, either published or self-archived. PUMA is therefore a software infrastructure, user-focused and service-oriented, developed by the ISTI Institute: the system functionalities manage, for different collections, the whole life cycle of different types of documents, from their submission by authors to their dissemination through web access. The most important PUMA feature is its capability to allow stored content to be reusable for different purposes, so that researchers and librarians can manipulate the stored content to fulfill scientific and administrative issues. PUMA also constitutes the first step towards creating the Italian network of CNR Institutional repositories, looking at the DRIVER vision, i.e., building an infrastructure that allows European research institutions to share content and functionality. It presently manages 33 CNR institutional repositories that in all contain about 21,000 documents covering different disciplines. ICT repositories contain about 13,500 documents (the reference corpus of this study already mentioned above) of different types, i.e. published documents – journal papers, books or book chapters, conference papers etc. – and grey literature ones – project deliverables, technical reports, theses and so on. A great part of these documents are Open Access."]},{"title":"2.1 Background Information","paragraphs":["ISTI is nowadays entitled to the memory of Alessandro Faedo, who was Rector of the University of Pisa e President of CNR.

And also “The word digital is most commonly used in computing and electronics, especially where real-world information is converted to binary numeric form as in digital audio and digital photography”. The processing of concordances on the 13,500 documents of the Archive shows that the term digital/digitale is combined with a multitude of words: these co-occurences are showed in Table n. 1 in alphabetical order, with the frequency and the year of the first entry in archive.

As a conclusion, it is very significant what Teresa Cabré says about the relationship between documentation and terminology: “While terminology is at the service for documentation, documentation is also at the service of terminology. Technical documents are the basis for terminological work. Terminologists do not invent designations for concepts in a previously established system, but rather identify and collect terms that specialists use in documents. Terminologists use documents in order to acquire knowledge of the subject and its conceptual structure , to search for the term used in a subject field, to confirm the quality of the primary data they have collected, to study the data from the various viewpoints represented by different documents” (Cabré, 1999: 51)."]},{"title":"6.
