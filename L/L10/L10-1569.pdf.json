Chunking is performed using a regular-expression grammar which operates on the dependency tagged sentences. As this is the first implementation of a parser for unrestricted Irish text (to our knowledge), there were no guidelines or precedents available. Therefore deciding what constitutes a syntactic unit, and how it should be annotated, accounts for a major part of the early development effort. Currently, all tokens in a sentence are tagged for grammatical function and local dependency. Long-distance dependencies, prepositional attachments or coordination are not handled, resulting in a partial dependency analysis. Evaluations show that the partial dependency analysis achieves an f-score of 93.60% on development data and 94.28% on unseen test data, while the chunker achieves an f-score of 97.20% on development data and 93.50% on unseen test data.

Using Constraint Grammar (CG), dependency relation tags and grammatical function tags are applied to text which has already been morphosyntactically analysed and disambiguated (Uí Dhonnchadha and van Genabith, 2006) In addition, we annotate the dependency tagged text with chunk boundaries using a regular-expression grammar which operates on the dependency tags. Currently, all tokens in the surface structure of sentences are tagged for grammatical function or local dependency."]},{"title":"2. Methodology ","paragraphs":["We implemented a dependency parser rather than a constituency parser for a number of reasons. Firstly, there are a number of unresolved issues in the theoretical syntax of Irish which could present problems for a constituency analysis, e.g. the non-adjacency of verb and object in a VSO language, and the treatment of several periphrastic aspectual constructions in Irish. By carrying out a dependency analysis we can annotate functional dependencies and other grammatical notions such as subject, object etc. which are somewhat clearer.  A second reason for choosing a dependency analysis is that we can develop the parser using Constraint Grammar (1995; Tapanainen, 1996; 1999), which integrates well with previous work in POS tagging for Irish (Uí Dhonnchadha and van Genabith, 2006).  There are a number of differences between CG and other parsing methodologies (Karlsson, 1995, p37). Unlike a context-free grammar, a Constraint Grammar does not attempt to define the set of grammatical sentences in a language. The CG philosophy is that everything is licensed which is not explicitly ruled out. This makes it more robust in handling unrestricted text. Also, it does not aim to produce a minimal set of general rules – a CG grammar can contain many specific lexically-marked rules to handle special cases. Neither does it attempt to determine constituency structure.  The primary aim of this exploratory work is to account for as much of the linguistic phenomena of Irish as possible and to decide on an initial style guide for the partial syntactic annotation of the language. In developing a parser for the first time, deciding what constitutes a syntactic unit, and how it should be annotated, accounts for a major part of the work. In order to begin, relevant grammatical and syntactic studies were consulted, (e.g. (Ó hUallacháin and Ó Murchú, 1981); (Doherty, 1996); (Stenson, 1981); (Biber et al., 2003)), and a number of short, grammatical, sample sentences, covering the main syntactic phenomena were devised. These sample sentences (225 approx.) constituted our initial Test Suite.  The Test Suite sentences were anotated using the Constraint Grammar Dependency Rules being developed. These annotated sentences were manually corrected and used as a gold standard in the iterative development and testing of the CG Dependency Rules (250 approx. to date).  The final results reported in the Abstract and Section 5 are based on unseen real data randomly selected from a 30 million word corpus of Irish (Kilgarriff et al., 2007)."]},{"title":"799 3. Dependency Parsing ","paragraphs":["Constraint Grammar (CG) is used to produce a dependency analysis of the already POS tagged sentences (Karlsson, 1995, p33). Surface syntactic dependency labels (highlighted in bold type) are appended to the existing morphosyntactic tags of each token, as shown in (1). By convention, the dependency tags all start with the @ symbol to distinguish them from tags which have already been appended to the token in the POS tagging stage.

Table 1 shows a sample of the Dependency Tags which are used in this dependency analysis (for full details see (Uí Dhonnchadha, 2009; 2010)). While this tagset follows the style of tags described for English (Karlsson, 1995), and for Danish (Bick, 2003),1","there is not a prescribed list of tags for CG. This allows us to tailor the tagset to the language under consideration.  A dependency analysis consists of a root, and leaf nodes, without intermediate levels, therefore, the tokens present in the input string are annotated without introducing any abstract categories (phrasal nodes or ellipted or elided items). Clause boundaries and head-modifier dependencies within clauses are identified, as well as the grammatical functions of subject, object, predicate, and various types of prepositional phrase, e.g. adverbial, aspectual, predicative, etc.  Dependent modifiers can come before or after the head, therefore the tag specifies the direction of the head they modify, e.g. the tag @>N marking a noun pre-modifier, points to a head noun to the right, whereas @N< points to a head noun to the left.  As a sentence with multiple clauses can have more than one subject, a number of different subject tags are used, i.e. @SUBJ_INF, @SUBJ_ASP and @SUBJ_REL for subjects of infinitival, aspectual and relative clauses respectively (similarly for object labels).  In (2), the subject of the main clause is annotated as @SUBJ, whereas the subject of the subordinate relative  1 Other languages are also detailed on the VISL website: http://visl.sdu.dk/corpus_linguistics.html (last accessed on 29 Oct 2009).","TAG DESCRIPTION EXAMPLE","@>N pre-modifier dependent on the first noun to the right an 'the'","@CLB clause boundary e.g. agus ‘and’ when followed by a verb, and subordinating conjunctions. etc.","@COP copula","@FAUX finite auxiliary verb Tá sé ag cócaireacht 'He is cooking'","@FMV finite main verb rith 'run'","@N< noun post-modifier, e.g. adj. teach mór 'big house'","@NP unlabelled noun head, e.g. list item, apposition, or fragment 1) dathuithe, 2) leasaithigh, '1) colours, 2) additives'","@OBJ object Chonaic Seán Máire, 'Seán saw Máire'","@OBJ_ASP object of aspectual ag déanamh oibre, 'doing work'","@PP_SUBJ prep + subject pronoun D'éirigh liom, 'I succeeded' i.e. success was with me'","@P< noun dependent on the preceding prep. ag an doras 'at the door'","@PP_ADVL adverbial PP head ag an doras 'at the door'","@PP_ASP aspectual PP head ag rith '(at) running'","@PP_PRED predicative PP Is liom é 'It is mine'","i.e. Is with me it","@SUBJ subject Chonaic Seán Máire,","'Seán saw Máire'","@SUBJ_REL subject of relative clause a rinne sé 'that he made'  Table 1 Selected Dependency Tags for Irish  clause is annotated as @SUBJ_REL.

In contrast to full dependency parsers such as FDG (Tapanainen and Järvinen, 1997) or MaltParser (Nivre and Hall, 2005), this implementation does not explicitly mark the head associated with a dependent (usually encoded in terms of numerical indices). Currently this information is largely recoverable from the tagset and the marking of clause boundaries. All modifier dependency tags include either '<' or '>' indicating the direction of the head, which in the current implementation will always be the first such head in the indicated direction. All heads have a grammatical relation tag, and where appropriate additional information is included in the tag indicating the clause, e.g. in (4) the tag @OBJ_ASP indicates that the token is the object of the aspectual construction. All other tokens are dependent on a head, and therefore receive a dependency relation tag. "]},{"title":"4.
