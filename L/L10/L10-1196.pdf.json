Our aim is to develop a part-of-speech tagger for annotating a wide range of Arabic text formats, domains and genres including both vowelized and non-vowelized text. Enriching the text with linguistic analysis will maximize the potential for corpus re-use in a wide range of applications. We foresee the advantage of enriching the text with part-of-speech tags of very fine-grained grammatical distinctions, which reflect expert interest in syntax and morphology, but not specific needs of end-users, because end-user applications are not known in advance. In this paper we review existing Arabic Part-of-Speech Taggers and tag-sets, and illustrate four different Arabic PoS tag-sets for a sample of Arabic text from the Quran. We describe the detailed fine-grained morphological feature tag set of Arabic, and the fine-grained Arabic morphological analyzer algorithm. We faced practical challenges in applying the morphological analyzer to the 100-million-word Web Arabic Corpus: we had to port the software to the National Grid Service, adapt the analyser to cope with spelling variations and errors, and utilise a Broad-Coverage Lexical Resource combining 23 traditional Arabic lexicons. Finally we outline the construction of a Gold Standard for comparative evaluation. "]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["Morphological analyzers and part-of-speech taggers are essential technologies for most text analysis applications. The most obvious applications are in lexicography and NLP/computational linguistics. Further applications include using the tags in data compression; more fine-grain information about the compressed text will help in more compression for the data (Teahan, 1998); and as a possible guide in the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence (Elliott & Atwell, 2000). Other specific uses that make use of part-of-speech tag information are: searching and concordancing, grammatical error detection in Word Processing, training Neural Networks for grammatical analysis of text, or training statistical language processing models (Atwell, 2008). Part-of-Speech tagging is a key technology in discovering suspicious events from text, and processing Arabic is a key task to discover these suspicious events.  Many automatic taggers have been made. TAGGIT, achieved an accuracy of 77% tested on the Brown corpus. CLAWS1, data-driven statistical tagger had scored an accuracy rate of 96-97%. Hidden Markov Model (HMM) taggers have been made for several languages. Brill’s tagger (1995) is an example of data-driven symbolic tagger. The ENGCG and EngCG-2 are based on a Constraint Grammar (CG) framework. Currently, many new systems based on Markov Model and Machine Learning (ML) techniques appeared for many languages. Hybrid solutions have been investigated (Voulainin, 2003). ACOPOST 1",", A Collection Of POS Taggers, consists of four taggers of different frameworks; Maximum Entropy Tagger (MET), Trigram Tagger (T3), Error-driven Transformation-based Tagger (TBT) and Example-based tagger (ET).

Hurdles of the development of Arabic part-of-speech taggers described when developing Brill’s “transformation-based” or “rule-based” part-of-speech tagger for Arabic (Freeman, 2001). An early stage of the architecture of a web-based Arabic tagger has been developed (Harmain, 2004). Support Vector Machines (SVM) a supervised learning algorithm achieved an accuracy of 95.49% (Diab et al, 2004). Another SVM-based Yamcha; which uses Viterbi decoding, was developed by (Habash & Rambow, 2005). HMM part-of-speech tagging for Arabic achieved accuracy of 97% for modern standard Arabic (Al-Shamsi & Guessoum, 2006) and 69.83% when tested on Egyptian Colloquial Arabic and the Levantine Arabic (Duh & Kirchhoff,  3 http://l2r.cs.uiuc.edu/~cogcomp/asoftware.php?skey=FLBJPO S 4 http://www.nltk.org/ 5 http://opencog.org/wiki/RelEx 6 http://nlp.ipipan.waw.pl/Spejd/ 7 http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/cg3.html"]},{"title":"1258","paragraphs":["2005). Applications of Memory-based learning to morphological analysis and part-of-speech tagging of written Arabic have been explored (Masri et al, 2005). Besides, combinations of rule based and machine learning methods for tagging Arabic words (Tlili-Guiassa, 2006). The multi-agent architecture was adopted for the conception and the realization of the part-of-speech tagging system of Arabic text with vowel marks (Zribi et al, 2006). Arabic Morphosyntactic Tagger AMT, uses the pattern-based technique and lexical and contextual technique. The accuracy of the AMT tagger reported was 91% (Alqrainy, 2008)."]},{"title":"2. Motivation and Hypothesis","paragraphs":["Arabic is a highly inflectional language, and the traditional classification into nouns, verbs and particles is not enough detail. Arabic has many morphological and grammatical features, including sub-categories, person, number, gender, case, mood, etc. (Atwell, 2008). More fine-grained tag sets are often considered more appropriate. The additional information may also help to disambiguate the (base) part of speech (Schmid & Laws, 2008).  Very fine-grain distinctions may cause problems for automatic tagging if some words can change grammatical tag depending of function and context (Atwell, 2008); on the other hand, fine-grained distinctions may actually help to disambiguate other words in the local context. A practical experiment of using fine grain morphological tag set was reported by Schmid and Laws (2008). Their experiments were carried out using German and Czech as examples of highly inflectional languages. Their HMM part-of-speech tagger makes good use of the fine-grain tag set; it splits the part-of-speech into attribute vectors and estimates the conditional probabilities of the attribute with decision trees. This method achieved a higher tagging accuracy than two state-of-the-art general-purpose part-of-speech taggers (TnT and SVMTool). We believe that this kind of approach may yield better results for an Arabic part-of-speech tagging including fine-grained morphological features."]},{"title":"3. The Morphological Features Tag Set","paragraphs":["The Morphological Features Tag Set captures long-established traditional morphological features of Arabic, in a compact yet transparent notation. Each feature and possible values of the Morphological Features Tag Set were explained and illustrated in detail. A tag consists of 22 characters; each position represents a feature and the letter at that location represents a value or attribute of the morphological feature; the dash “-” represents a feature not relevant to a given word, and the question mark “?” represents a feature relevant but its attribute value is not known yet. The first character shows the main Parts of Speech, from: noun, verb, particle, punctuation, and residual; these last two are an extension to the traditional three classes to handle modern texts. The characters 2, 3, and 4 are used to represent subcategories; of noun, verb and particle. Residuals and punctuations are represented in letters 5 and 6 respectively. The next letters represent traditional morphological features: gender (7), number (8), person (9), morphology (10) case or mood (11), case and mood markers (12), definiteness (13), voice (14), emphasize (15), transitivity (16), humanness (17), Variability and Conjugation (18). Finally there are four characters representing morphological information which is useful in Arabic text analysis, although not all linguists would count these as traditional features: augmented and unaugmented (19), number of root letters (20), verb internal structure (21), noun finals (22). The Morphological Features Tag Set is not tied to a specific tagging algorithm or theory, and other tag sets could be mapped onto this standard, to simplify and promote comparisons between and reuse of Arabic taggers and tagged corpora.  Tag-assignment is significantly more complex for Arabic. An Arabic lemmatiser program can extract the stem or root, but this is not enough for full PoS-tagging; words should be decomposed into five parts: proclitics, prefixes, stem or root, suffixes and enclitics. The morphological analyzer should then add the appropriate linguistic information to each of these parts of the word; in effect, we need a sub tag for each part (and possibly multiple sub tags if there are multiple proclitics, prefixes, suffixes or enclitics). The word tag inherits its morphological feature attributes using an algorithm that establish agreements on morphological feature attributes of the word’s morphemes and combining morpheme tags into word tag.

These tagging schemes are; our detailed and fine-grain morphological tag set, the Penn Treebank FULL tag set, the morphochallenge2009 Qur’an gold standard tagging scheme, and the Quranic Arabic Corpus tagging scheme.  In figure 3, the sentence is tagged using our detailed and fine-grained morphological features tag set. It also shows the sentence tagged using Tim Buckwalter morphological analyser and the Penn Arabic Treebank FULL tag set. The Penn Arabic Treebank tag set is the most widely used tag set for Arabic. It is used to annotate the Penn Arabic Treebank (PATB) with part-of-speech tags. The Penn Arabic Treebank model postulates a FULL tag set which compromises over 2000 tag types (Diab, 2007). The FULL tag set includes combinations of 114 basic tags. The FULL tag set exhibits the morphological features; case, gender, number, definiteness, mood, person, voice, tense, aspect and other features. Figure 3 also shows the sentence tagged using morphochallenge2009 Qur’an gold standard morphological tagging scheme which has developed using the data of Morphological Tagging of the Qur’an database (Talmon & Wintner, 2003; Dror et al, 2004). The word analysis is shown after each word where the morphological features are separated by space and “+” sign. These features include the part-of-speech of the word, number, gender, person, case, definiteness, voice and others. The figure shows sentence tagged using the Quranic Arabic Corpus (http://corpus.quran.com/) morphological tagging scheme. The tagged example shows that the words are divided into three parts; prefixes, stem, and suffixes. Each part is assigned morphological features such as, part-of-speech, person, number, gender, definiteness and mood. The construction of the Quranic Arabic Corpus is mainly depends on the Tim Buckwalter morphological analyser and Morphological Tagging of the Qur’an database (Talmon & Wintner, 2003; Dror et al, 2004). The tag set used combines the morphological features of the words derived from Buckwalter morphological analyzer and the tagged database of the Qur’an into new tag set.  The tags of the Full Arabic Treebank, MorphoChallenge 2009 Qur’an gold standard and the Quranic Arabic Corpus, are word tags. The “+” sign is used to separate the tag information of the word’s morphemes. In figure 3, we showed the morpheme tags instead of the whole word’s tag, we manually separated the morpheme tags as shown in the figure. On the other hand, our morphological features tag set, gives each word’s morpheme a specified tag. These tags can be combined into one tag for the whole word using the same tag structure.  By looking to the different tagging schemes and tag sets, we conclude that the morphological features tag set is more detailed; consisting of 22 morphological features of the word, which captures most of the linguistic information of the word and its clitics and affixes. Moreover, the morphological features tag set has a fixed structure where the tag consist of 22 characters, each position represents a feature and the letter at that location represents a value or attribute of the morphological feature; the dash “-” represents a feature not relevant to a given word. This structure makes the morphological features tag set to be more readable than the existing tag sets for Arabic."]},{"title":"4.

Our morphological analyzer uses linguistic knowledge of the language as well as corpora to verify the linguistic information. It uses a broad-coverage lexicon constructed by analyzing 23 established Arabic language dictionaries. The broad-coverage lexicon contains correct vowelized words and roots. It will be developed to contain multi-word expressions, idioms, collocations requiring special part-of-speech assignment, and words with special part-of-speech tags. The morphological analyzer depends on comprehensive lists of affixes, clitics and patterns extracted from authoritative Arabic grammar books. These lists were then cross-checked by analyzing words of three corpora: the Qur’an, the Corpus of Contemporary Arabic and Penn Arabic Treebank (as well as our lexicon, considered as a fourth cross-check corpus). The morphological analyzer uses novel algorithms that generate the correct pattern of the words, deal with the orthographic issues of the Arabic language and other word derivation issues, such as the elimination or substitution of root letters, tokenize the word into proclitics, prefixes, stem or root, suffixes and enclitics, generate all possible vowelizations of the processed word, and assign morphological features tags for the word’s morphemes (Sawalha & Atwell, 2009a; Sawalha & Atwell, 2009b).

These steps, described below, are executed sequentially where each step depends on the previous step. Intermediate results can be obtained from each processing step.  Inputs: the morphological analyzer accepts single Arabic word or Arabic text, whether they are vowelized, partially vowelized, or non-vowelized, as inputs to the system.  Outputs: the outputs of morphological analyzer are the full analyses of the words from the analyzed text. The full analyses means all possible analyses of the word such as, all possible root, clitics, affixes, stems, lemmas, patterns, different forms of vowelization, and the morphological features of each analysis represented by a morphological tag using the fine-grain morphological feature tag set.  Step 1, Tokenization: the tokenizer program uses the NLTK regular expression tokenizer to tokenize the input text into Arabic words, punctuations, currency tokens, numbers, words written in Latin letters, and HTML/XML tags. The regular expression tokenizer uses regular expression patterns that suite the Arabic text.   Step 2, Clitics, Affixes and Stems: for each tokenized Arabic word, a special module divides the word into three parts; proclitics and prefixes, stem/root, and suffixes and enclitics. The first part is searched in a list of proclitics and prefixes consisting of 220 entries, and the third part is searched with a list of suffixes and enclitics consisting of 341 entries. Only the analyses that match both of the lists of clitics and affixes are taken as candidate analysis.  Step 3, Root extraction: for each candidate analyses from step 2, the second part of the divided word; stem/root, is searched in the broad-coverage lexical resource. If the non-vowelized stem/root is found in the lexicon then all vowelized words-root combinations are retrieved and attached to that analysis, which assumed as candidate analysis.  In this step each stem/root is searched in other three linguistic lists; list of function words (stop words) which have fixed syntactic analysis in any context (Diwan, 2004), named entities list (Benajiba et al, 2008) and list of broken plurals8",". If the stem/root of any analysis matches one of these lists, then a new analysis entry along with its morphological analysis is added to the candidate analyses list of the word.  Step 4, Pattern Generation: we provided the analyzer with a list of patterns, containing 2,730 verb patterns and 985 noun patterns. Morphological feature tags are assigned to each pattern in the lists. The pattern generation module uses two algorithms; the first depends of the word itself and the extracted root from step 3, while the second algorithm depends on matching the word with one or more patterns from the pattern lists.   8 http://sites.google.com/site/elghamryk/arabiclanguageresources For each candidate analysis of step 3, both pattern generation algorithms are applied. Then the generated patterns are searched in the pattern lists, and the fully vowelized pattern and its morphological features tag are assigned to that analysis.  Step 5, Vowelization: After matching the patterns and the analyzed word, in the previous step, taking into account that the patterns are fully vowelized, the analyzer adds the short vowels which appear on the patterns to the analyzed word, whether it is partially-vowelized or non-vowelized. The result is a correctly fully vowelized list of the possible analyses.  Step 6, Morphological features tag assignment: most Arabic words are complex words consisting of multiple morphemes.

To build a widely used general purpose gold standard, we have to select corpora of different text domains, formats and genres of both vowelized and non-vowelized Arabic text. First, we selected the Qur’an corpus to be used in the construction of the gold standard. We have two versions of the Qur’an text, vowelized Qur’an text, where diacritics appear above or below each letter of Qur’an text, and a non-vowelized one, where diacritics are omitted from the vowelized text of Qur’an. Second, we want to use the Corpus of Contemporary Arabic (Al-Sulaiti & Atwell, 2006). This corpus contains 1 million words taken from different genres collected from newspapers and magazines.  The gold standard will include morphological and part-of-speech information for each word. The analysis divides the words into their morphemes; conjunctions, prepositions, prefixes, stem or root, suffixes and relative pronouns. For each morpheme, part-of-speech tag is assigned, as well as a compound part-of-speech tag of the whole word. Moreover, the gold standard will contain the root and the pattern information of the words.

"]},{"title":"7. Conclusions","paragraphs":["Morphological analyses and part of speech (PoS) tagging are very important and basic applications of Natural Language Processing. In this paper we highlighted the importance of morphological analyses and part of speech tagging in wide range of NLP applications. We listed the most recent part of speech taggers and the key technologies used so far for part of speech taggers for Arabic text.  Our hypothesis is based of the fact that Arabic has many morphological and grammatical features, including sub-categories, person, number, gender, case, mood, etc. (Atwell, 2008). More fine-grained tag sets are often considered more appropriate. The additional information may also help to disambiguate the (base) part of speech (Schmid & Laws, 2008).  For the implementation of a fine-grain morphological analyzer and part of speech tagger for Arabic text, we designed a detailed morphological feature tag set that captures long-established traditional morphological features of Arabic, in a compact yet transparent notation. Each feature and possible values of the Morphological Features Tag Set were explained and illustrated in detail. A tag consists of 22 characters; each position represents a feature and the letter at that location represents a value or attribute of the morphological feature; the dash “-” represents a feature not relevant to a given word, and the question mark “?” represents a feature relevant but its attribute value is not known yet.  Then we described the Arabic morphological analyzer algorithm which consists of six sequential steps. The morphological analyzer accepts different types of text whether the text is fully vowelized, partially vowelized or non-vowelized. The morphological analyzer outputs all possible analyses of the word. the analysis include all possible roots, clitics, affixes, stems, lemmas, patterns, different forms of vowelization, and the morphological features represented by detailed and fine-grain morphological feature tag.  A practical application of part of the morphological analyzer has been applied to lemmatize large and real data of the Web Arabic Corpus consisting of 100 million words. The lemmatization process highlighted some challenges when applying NLP application to large data. Such challenges are speed and spelling mistakes. We used high performance computing power of the NGS to run the lemmatizer in reduced time. And we added a spell-check procedure which detects and corrects the spelling errors caused by typing mistakes. The spell-check procedure is specific for Arabic.  The morphological analyzer uses linguistic lists of functional words, named entities and broken plural lists. It also used the broad-coverage lexical resource constructed by analyzing 23 traditional Arabic lexicons. The coverage of the constructed broad-coverage lexical resource showed that about 85% of the words processed using the lemmatizer referenced the broad-coverage lexicon and retrieved correct analyses for the analyzed words.  The evaluation plan of the morphological analyzer and part of speech tagger depends on constructing widely used general purpose gold standard for evaluation of different text domains, formats and genres of both vowelized and non-vowelized Arabic text. We showed the MorphoChallenge2009 Qur’an gold standard as example of constructing gold standard for evaluation of Arabic text processing applications."]},{"title":"8.
