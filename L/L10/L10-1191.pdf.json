In contrast to primary resources like speech and text corpora BAStat comprises statistical estimates based on a number of primary resources: first and second order occurrence probability of phones, syllables and words, duration statistics, probabilities of pronunciation variants of words and probabilities of context information. Unlike other statistical speech resources BAStat is based solely on recordings of conversational German and therefore models spoken language. It consists of 7-bit ASCII tables and matrices to maximize inter-operability between different platforms and can be downloaded from the BAS web-site. This paper gives a detailed description about the empirical basis, the contained data types, some interesting interpretations and a brief comparison to the text-based statistical resource CELEX."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["In this contribution we describe a new type of language resource BAStat published by the Bavarian Archive for Speech Signals (BAS): While a speech corpus may be considered as a primary type of language resource, BAStat is of secondary nature, that is it contains statistical information derived from a (growing) number of different primary language resources (LR). Similar LRs of secondary nature are for example lexica, HMMs, statistical rule sets or grammars. BAStat provides statistical information about the phonetic structure of German conversational speech, that is what types of phonemes, syllables and words are produced in which surface form, with which duration and in which context in a large number of recordings of spoken German. In contrast to existing statistical resources such as CELEX (Baayen et al., 1995) BAStat is based solely on spoken conversational speech. Hence it provides real occurrence probabilities of linguistic entities in spoken dialogues and the corresponding duration statistics. Aside from technical applications we would like to encourage researchers to utilize the statistics from BAStat in the context of psycholinguistic experiments that require the knowledge of a-priori probabilities of linguistic entities (e.g. Levelts production model (Levelt, 1989) or Exemplar Theory (Pierrehumbert, 2001)). This often regards the proper selection of lingustic units with high/low/equal probabilities for perceptual experiments. This contribution is roughly structured into three parts: First we define the empirical basis of BAStat, secondly we describe the contents as being down-loadable from the BAS web-site at the time of writing and present a selection of interesting results that can be drawn from the resource. Finally we briefly compare BAStat to the text-based statistical resource CELEX."]},{"title":"2. Empirical Basis of BAStat","paragraphs":["In its present stage1","BAStat contains data based solely on spoken conversational speech. The reason to deal with con-1 Feb 2010 versational speech as opposed to read speech is that we deem spontaneous speech a more challenging and interesting subject for most scientific investigations, especially if we consider human - machine dialog systems that are in-creasingly allowing connected speech input. In this section we will present the underlying speech resources, the annotation and automatic segmentation applied to these and a method to derive syllable information for statistical analysis. 2.1. Corpora The BAS maintains and distributes a multitude of LRs, mostly corpora of spoken German (BAS, 2010). Some BAS corpora consist entirely or partly of recordings of unimpeded conversational speech, that is either two humans talking to each other or a single human talking to a virtual machine in a Wizard-of-Oz experiment or a triad situation where two human speakers interact which each other and simultaneously with a machine. Table 1 lists the BAS corpora included in the BAStat analysis in its present stage; the maximum number of analyzed word tokens is 689966 representing 16426 word types. We plan to extend this set in the course of 2010 by the spontaneous parts of the ALC, RVG-J and SmartWeb corpora (BAS, 2010). In the following we briefly describe the main properties of the different speech corpora.

Regional Variants of German 1 (RVG1) The RVG1 corpus comprises speech recordings in 4 channels of approx. 450 speaker recorded in the main European areas of spoken German, that is Germany, Austria and Switzerland. A small part of these recordings were done"]},{"title":"1069","paragraphs":["in form of an interview where the interviewee was asked to report about her/his work during the previous week us-ing casual speech. The analyzed channel for BAStat is the headset microphone (channel c) of the interviewee. Recordings across speakers differ considerably in length, speech rate, accent and content. 2.1.2. Verbmobil The Verbmobil corpora (VM1 + VM2) contain conversations between two business colleagues who have to schedule a number of appointments (VM1, VM2) and talk about planing a business trip (VM2 only). While in VM1 the dialogue is structured by a Push-to-Talk button, in VM2 the speakers are free to interrupt their dialogue partner. The analyzed channels are the headset microphones (channel c) of both speakers. 2.1.3. SmartKom The SmartKom corpus (SK) has been recorded in a multimodal WOZ setting where the speaker was asked to test an information kiosk with fully functional speech and gestural interface. The topics here are sight-seeing, restaurants, travel information, TV guide, VCR programming, fax and email, cinema information and reservation. The analyzed channel is the front directional microphone (channel d, if available) or the headset (channel h). 2.2. Orthographic Transcription All four resources have been transcribed according to the Verbmobil Transliteration Convention (e.g. (Burger et al., 1997)). The resulting transcripts and other annotations have been summarized in BAS Partitur Format (BPF) files as well as ATLAS Format XML files (’Annotation Graphs’). Compatible pronunciation lexica manually coded in German SAM-PA are available for all resources. Linguistic markers such as Part-of-Speech, word classes etc. were not considered in BAStat because not all BAS corpora provide tagging for these. An exception is the marker for content and function word which has been considered in BAStat. Para-linguistic markers such as articulatory noise, background noise, cross-talk etc. have also not been taken into account for this analysis. The total orthographic transcript results in 16426 word types. 2.3. Phonetic Transcript and Segmentation The basic durational linguistic entity in BAStat is the phonemic segment as given by the German SAM-PA definition set2",". All other durational entities such as phone sequences, syllables or words are derived from this basic segmentation. Aside from SAM-PA there exist deviating phoneme definition sets for German, for instance in some cases the affricates /ts/, /tS/ and /pf/ are treated as separate entities: /t/ + /s/, ... , tense vowels also appear as unlengthened (e.g. /o/) or the set of diphthongs in SAM-PA /aU/, /aI/ and /OY/ is extended by diphthongs and triphthongs that combine the vocalized ’r’ /6/ with practically all German vowels and diphthongs. Finally, most phoneme sets for German do not allow the coding of non-German words derived from English or French. 2 www.bas.uni-muenchen.de/forschung/ Bas/BasSAMPA To accommodate these differing needs we decided to per-form all analysis in BAStat based on two phoneme sets: one basic set of 52 phoneme symbols, with separated affricates, the three fundamental German diphthongs and extended by four French nasalized vowels, and a second set, called the 6-set, which additionally contains all diphthong and triphthong combinations with vocalized ’r’. Table 2 list the two sets in detail.","set SAM-PA phonemes","basic OY aI aU E: y: 2: a: u: i: ãẼÕ9̃2 6 9 E I N O Q S U Y b d e f g h i j m n o p r s t u y z o: e: @ C Z a k l v x","6-set OY6 aI6 aU6 E:6 y:6 2:6 a:6 u:6 o:6 e:6 i:6 E6 I6 O6 U6 Y6 26 a6 e6 i6 o6 u6 y6 96 Table 2: The basic phoneme set and extension to vocalized ’r’ (SAM-PA /6/) used in BAStat The phonetic transcript and segmentation are produced automatically by the Munich AUtomatic Segmentation system (MAUS, e.g. (Schiel, 1999)). MAUS calculates a string of canonical phonemic segments from the orthographic transcription and then derives hypothetical pronunciation deviations from this canonical pronunciation by means of data-driven substitution rules. In parallel the a-priori expected probabilities of these deviations are calculated and integrated into the hypothesis graph. The result is a directed acyclic graph representing all possible combinations of pronunciation predicted for this utterance together with their combined probability. Finally this graph is passed to a Viterbi decoder (Young, 1995) find-ing and time-aligning the most likely pronunciation variant through the hypothesis graph given the acoustics of the speech signal. The result is a phonetic transcript and segmentation close to the actual sequence of phones. MAUS allows for a variety of reduction and assimilation phenomena, detects silence intervals and has a transcription accuracy of about 96% of the inter-labeler agreement in spontaneous speech. Comparing the segmental boundaries with those of a reference segmentation by phoneticians we find a Gaussian-like distribution of about 25msec standard deviation from the reference boundaries. 2.4. Syllabification The annotation of the analyzed BAS corpora contains no information regarding the syllabification of the phonetic transcript, that is the number and boundaries of syllables per word token is unclear. Furthermore, since our segmentation of the speech signal is non-canonical we are often faced with the problem that syllable nuclei are deleted and new consonantal clusters emerge which are difficult to handle in terms of syllable structure. To obtain statistical information about empirically found syllables we applied a simple syllabification algorithm de-"]},{"title":"1070","paragraphs":["orthography wir haben dazu keinen eigenen Beitrag <”ah> leisten müssen canonical v’i:6 h’a:b@n dats’u: k’aIn@n Q’aIg@n@n b’aItr”a:k Q’E: l’aIst@n m’Ys@n phonetic vi:6 ha:m datsu: kaIn aIg@nn baItra:k QE: laIstn mYsn syllabification vi:6 ha:m dat+su: kaIn aI+g@n+n baI+tra:k QE: laIs+tn mYs+n Table 3: Example for syllabification randomly selected from RVG1; syllable boundaries are marked by a ’+’ veloped by U. Reichel in 2009 in our lab. Based on the string of phonetic segments delivered by MAUS this algorithm searches for minima of sonority between syllable nuclei and applies some other heuristic rules to account for special cases where the primary strategy fails. Phonetic segments are then merged according to this syllabification to form syllable segments for the BAStat analysis. Since the phonetic transcript does not necessarily follow phonotactical rules, this sometimes results in very unusual ’syllables’ (e.g. syllables consisting of one or more consonants only), especially in cases where whole words are reduced to single phones. Table 3 shows a typical utterance recorded in the RVG1 corpus together with its canonical pronunciation, the phonetic segmentation found by MAUS and the automatically derived syllabification (the ’<”ah>’ represents a filled pause; phonetic coding in SAM-PA). As can be seen in this example the verb ’haben’ (to have) is being reduced to a single syllable /ha:m/ in the following syllabification. In the three-syllable word ’eigenen’ (own) the glottal stop (/Q/) and the final Schwa (/@/) are deleted by MAUS and a syllabic /n/ is segmented instead: /aIg@nn/. Since the final /n/ represents a syllable, the derived syllabification contains a syllable without a nucleus but a single syllabic /n/: /aI+g@n+n/. The same effect occurs in the words ’leisten’ and ’müssen’. As a result the syllabification contains two ’syllable’ types /n/ and /tn/ without any vocalic nucleus."]},{"title":"3. The BAStat Resource","paragraphs":["BAStat consists of three main parts: phone, syllable and word statistics. All resources described in this contribution are stored in tables of 7-bit ASCII characters to allow a maximum of inter-operability between different operation systems. Numbers are either represented as integers or floating point numbers in the typical scientific notation, e.g. 1.54632e-03 (= 0.00154632). Special characters not included in the 7-bit ASCII table are represented in LaTeX coding (e.g. German Umlaut ä = ”a). Columns of tables and matrices are always separated by a TAB sign (ASCII octal 011). Each resource file starts with a four-lines header giving the name of the analyzed data set, the number of entity types3",", the number of entity tokens and a table header describing the following table. In the following we will describe the details of each resource type. 3.1. BAStat Phone Statistics and Durations The BAStat phone statistics provides information about duration and probabilities of single phones (monogram), 3 In case of phoneme statistics this rather trivial entry is re-","placed by the number of words. phone bigrams and arbitrary phone sequences. 3.1.1. Phone Monograms All phone segments belonging to a filled pause (hesitation) are excluded from the analysis, because these phones be-have in a different way than phones embedded in spoken words. (For instance they may be exceedingly long.) Also, phone segments of duration more than 1sec are filtered because they most likely stem from errors in the automatic segmentation process. Phone monograms are provided for both phoneme sets (basic and 6-set) and separately for each BAS corpus as well as for all corpora pooled together (denoted as ’TOTAL’). This allows the comparison of different domains as represented in the different speech resources. Each phone monogram consists of a 31-column table with the following entries: • phone label • absolute count • probability (this column adds up to 1) • conditional probability that given the phone the phone","is word-initial • conditional probability that given the phone the phone","is word-final • conditional probability that given the phone the phone","is word-internal, • mean, standard deviation, 25%/50%/75% quantile of","duration • mean, standard deviation, 25%/50%/75% quantile of","duration in word-initial/internal/final position • mean, standard deviation, 25%/50%/75% quantile of","duration of single phone words The total number of analyzed phones is 2126634 derived from 557561 word tokens (development and test sets of VM corpora (VMSets, 2009) not included). 3.1.2. Phone Bigrams Second order statistics or conditional probabilities P (phon2|phon1) or diphone statistics or bigrams (all synonyms for the same thing4",") are calculated in form of a squared matrix containing all un-smoothed conditional probabilities P (phon2|phon1) where phon1 is the predecessor and phon2 is the successor. If n = number of entities, then the matrix is (n + 3) columns times (n + 2) rows since the first column contains an index to the entities and the !ENTER and !EXIT pseudo entities are added to the data to model entry and exit bigram probabilities of utterances. 4 Please carefully distinguish these from the joined probability","P (phon1, phon2)."]},{"title":"1071","paragraphs":["The rows define the predecessor phone phon1 (indexed in the first column), while the columns define the successor phone phon2 (not indexed but in the same order as the rows), one single element contains the linear conditional probability P (col = phon2|row = phon1). Consequently, the elements of each row sum up to 1. For technical reasons the last line indexed by phon1 = !EXIT also contains equally distributed probabilities sum-ming up to 1 although !EXIT has no successor. Since the 2nd colum contains the probabilities for phon2 = !EN T ER but !ENTER has no predecessor, all values in this column are set to zero, to avoid a distortion of the remaining values in the rows. If other entries than the first column are zero, this means that the bigram combination was not seen in the input corpus. You may apply standard discounting techniques to obtain non-zero probabilities for these cases. Identical values following each other are indicated by an optional counter glued by a ’*’ symbol to the probability value5",". As with the phone monogram statistics in the previous section BAStat provides bigram tables for all BAS corpora in-dividually as well as for the joined data set, and for both phoneme sets. 3.1.3. Phone Sequences Classical questions often asked are: ’What is the probability for the word-final phone /x/ to occur after the phone /y/?’ or: ’What is the probability for phone /x/ to occur after the phone /y/ and before the word-final phone /z/?’ or: ’What is the estimated probability for a sequence of four phones /xyzw/, even if we never observed such a phone sequence in the corpus?’ To answer these questions we can estimate the probability of the co-occurrence of an ordered pair of phones (y, x) or an ordered triplet (y, x, z) optionally combined with conditional probabilities of position within the word (see list of monogram table entries in section 3.1.1.). The probability of co-occurrence can be estimated by multiplying the first and second order statistics and ignoring higher order statistics P (x, y) = P (y|x)P (x) (1) P (x, y, z) ≈ P (z|y)P (y|x)P (x) (2)","P (x, y, z, w) ≈ P (w|z)P (z|y)P (y|x)P (x) (3)",". . . (4) where for instance P (x, y, z) denotes the probability of the time-ordered occurrence of three entities x, y and z (in that order). Examples: What is the probability estimate of /n/ following /E/ (e.g. ’Mensch’)? P (n|E)P (E) = 0.00238476 5 E.g. ’1.234*2’ equals ’1.234 1.234 1.234’. What is the probability estimate of a word-final syllable /vOYs/ (e.g. ’Konvois’) P (OY |v)P (s|OY )P (v)P (word-final|s) ≈ 1.806e − 09 Since these are merely rough estimates, caution should be taken to take these for absolute values. For instance it is probably not correct to state: ”The probability for the word final syllable /g@n/ is 7.627e-5!” but we can say with some confidence that ”The probability for the syllable /g@n/ is higher in word-final (7.627e-5) than in word-internal position (2.026e-05).” Likewise durational statistics can be estimated by sums of individual durational measures. 3.2. BAStat Syllable Statistics This part of BAStat provides a collection of syllable data (raw data), duration and probabilities for single syllables (monogram) and syllable bigrams. 3.2.1. Collection of Syllable Segments Since syllable analysis can be tricky, we provide the raw data as well as the statistics derived from it (see following sections). The raw data collection consists of a 7-column table describing one syllable in each line: • the German SAM-PA coding of the syllable with a leading ’ if the syllable was marked as lexically accented and a trailing ’+’ if the syllable is part of a function word • the duration in secs • the orthographic word • the canonical pronunciation of the word coded in German SAM-PA • the syllable position within the word in the form (Pos,Max), e.g. (2,5) is the second syllable in a 5 syllable word • a file identifier of our internal database that allows us to find the corresponding recording • the word position within the recording from which the syllable was taken (words counted starting with 0) • the word duration in secs The order of syllables is preserved in this list, that is the context can be derived from the preceeding and following lines. The tagging of lexical accent was taken from the (predicted) lexical accentuation in the lexical pronunciation form (4th column). There are two possible problems with that: 1. words with arbitrary lexical accentuation (e.g. ’umfahren’), which are fortunately very rare in German 2. the mapping from the canonical pronunciation form to the actual pronunciation fails, because syllables are deleted from a word with more than 2 syllables. In unclear cases no syllable of the respective word is tagged as accented. The tagging as a syllable stemming from a function word is based on the tagging in the lexicon as well. Since the definition for ’function word’ is far from clear, we expect"]},{"title":"1072","paragraphs":["syllable duration word pronunciation position file ID word nr word duration ’da:+ 8.993750e-02 da d’a:+ (1,1) 001/sp100001 19 8.993750e-02 ’gIN 2.099375e-01 ging g’IN (1,1) 001/sp100001 20 2.099375e-01 ’s+ 7.993750e-02 es Q’Es+ (1,1) 001/sp100001 21 7.993750e-02 ’al+ 1.099375e-01 also Q’alzo:+ (1,2) 001/sp100001 22 1.998750e-01 zo:+ 8.993750e-02 also Q’alzo:+ (2,2) 001/sp100001 22 1.998750e-01 ’Um+ 5.993750e-02 um Q’Um+ (1,1) 001/sp100001 23 5.993750e-02 ’das+ 1.499375e-01 das d’as+ (1,1) 001/sp100001 24 1.499375e-01 ’taIl 1.899375e-01 Teilprojekt t’aIl#proj”Ekt (1,3) 001/sp100001 25 4.998125e-01 pro 1.699375e-01 Teilprojekt t’aIl#proj”Ekt (2,3) 001/sp100001 25 4.998125e-01 ’jEkt 1.399375e-01 Teilprojekt t’aIl#proj”Ekt (3,3) 001/sp100001 25 4.998125e-01 ak 2.199375e-01 Akustik Qak’UstIk (1,3) 001/sp100001 26 6.098125e-01 ’Us 1.799375e-01 Akustik Qak’UstIk (2,3) 001/sp100001 26 6.098125e-01 tIk 2.099375e-01 Akustik Qak’UstIk (3,3) 001/sp100001 26 6.098125e-01 ’E:m 4.199375e-01 <”ahm> Q’E:m (1,1) 001/sp100001 27 4.199375e-01 ’vi:6+ 1.799375e-01 wir v’i:6+ (1,1) 001/sp100001 28 1.799375e-01 ’ha:m+ 1.799375e-01 haben h’a:b@n+ (1,1) 001/sp100001 29 1.799375e-01 Table 4: 15 syllables taken randomly from the BAStat raw syllables list. a number of inconsistencies in cases where the semantical and syntactical usage of a word allow different interpretations.

Figure 2 plots the accumulated probability across the ranking of syllable types. The first 1000 top ranked syllables cover over 94,4% of the analyzed corpus speech (dotted lines). 25,6% of the top 1000 ranking syllables are stemming from function words, while only 13,6% of all syllable types are from function words. This concentration in the high-frequent range is also the reason that 40,6% of all syllable tokens are uttered in function words. High-frequent syllables are expected to be produced faster than low-frequent syllables. On the other hand syllables carrying a lexical accent are expected to be pronounced longer than non-accented syllables. Figure 3 shows four box-plots for the distribution of the medians of the duration of each syllable type. That is, each syllable type is represented by one data point in this distribution and the probability of the syllable type is not considered here. Contrary to our expectation the distribution of lexically accented syllables in words with more than one syllable (’Lex.accented’) does not deviate from the distribution over all syllable types (’Duration’). However, as expected the distribution of syllables derived from function words shows significant smaller durations (’Function’) than that of syllables derived from content words (’Content’). In Figure 4 the median duration of syllables types is plotted against the rank (the probability) of the syllable type. There is slight positive linear correlation, but the Pearson correlation is only 0,31. 3.2.3. Syllable Bigrams The syllable bigram statistics is provided for the same filtered set of syllables as in the monogram statistics. Format and method follow the same schema as used in the phoneme bigram statistic (see above). 3.3. BAStat Word Statistics The BAStat word statistics is structured into duration and probabilities of single word types (monogram), word bigrams and conditional probabilities of word pronunciations. Since the number of word tokens (689966) is rather small in relation to the number of word types (16426), the word statistics of BAStat cannot be considered as being representative for spoken German. We hope to expand this section in the future by acquiring larger corpora of transcribed conversational German. Word statistics are given for all word types and the following non-words: silence interval, articulatory noise (e.g. cough), background noise, laughing, breathing, seven types of filled pauses, spellings and a garbage model for nonintelligible speech parts. 3.3.1. Word Monograms The monogram for words provides the following information per word type: • the orthographic word form and canonical pronun-","ciation in SAM-PA including a marker for con-","tent/function word • count and probability • the mean duration • the (canonical) number of syllables 3.3.2. Word Bigrams The word bigram consists of a simple matrix with un-smoothed conditional probabilities for word tuples. Format and method follow the same schema as used in the phoneme monograms (see above). 3.3.3. Word Pronunciation Statistics Based on the phonetic segmentation we can derive 28754 different pronunciation forms for the 16431 word types in BAStat. The BAStat word pronunciation statistics lists these pronunciation forms coded in SAM-PA together with their orthographic form, count and conditional probability. Similar resources have been successfully used in automatic speech recognition in form of probabilistic pronunciation lexica (e.g. in (Schiel, 1998)). As an example we list some of the entries for the word ’Abend’ (evening) in Table 6. For instance the canonical pronunciation /Qa:b@nt/ is with 20 tokens much less frequent than the reduced mono-syllabic forms /a:mt/ and /Qa:mt/ (141 tokens).","CELEX BAStat word tokens 5002442 689966 word types 84173 16426 syllable tokens 9062607 1030588 syllable types 7030 9210 (6397) Table 8: Word and syllable counts in CELEX and BAStat"]},{"title":"4. Comparison with CELEX","paragraphs":["Since BAStat is rather unique in being based solely on empiric speech recordings of conversational speech, it is interesting to compare the statistical data of BAStat to existing resources based on textual data, namely the CELEX lexical database (Baayen et al., 1995). ”CELEX is the Dutch Centre for Lexical Information. It was developed as a joint enterprise of the University of Nijmegen, the Institute for Dutch Lexicology in Leiden, the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen, and the Institute for Perception Research in Eindhoven. ... CELEX is now part of the Max Planck Institute"]},{"title":"1075","paragraphs":["CELEX di: de:r g@ t@ QUnt QIn b@ t@n tsu: das QaI fEr g@n n@ d@n de:n BAStat ja: IC das n dan g@ tn @ da: di: t@ s d6 vi:6 vi: zi: Table 7: Top ranking syllables in CELEX and BAStat. for Psycholinguistics.” (quoted from the CELEX CD-ROM, README) The German part of CELEX contains no empirically based phonetic information about phones and syllables. However, it contains phonological data for phonemes and syllables based on large collections of German texts (derived from the archives of the ’Institut der Deutschen Sprache’, Mannheim, Germany). Table 8 compares CELEX and BAStat with regard to word and syllable types and tokens. The ratio of words types against word tokens is lower in CELEX (1,7%) than in BAStat (2,4%); this is probably caused by the insufficient number of word tokens in BAStat: while the number of word types in CELEX is probably nearly converged, in BAStat the number of word types will probably still grow with increasing corpus size. Because of the smaller amount of word types in BAStat we would expect a proportional smaller number of syllable types, but this is not the case: the number of syllable types in BAStat exceeds the number in CELEX. The reason is probably that the phonetic variation of syllables produces more syllable forms than in the phonological paradigm of CELEX, where each word token is always assigned to the same (lexical) syllables. The statistic of syllable types also differs considerably: in Table 7 we compare the top 15 highest ranking syllables from CELEX and BAStat in descending ranking order8",". The few overlaps in both ranking sets are printed in bold face. If we look at the 1000 top ranked syllables in both resources, we find an overlap of merely 47,5%. This comparison is not entirely justified since in the case of CELEX the syllabification was done phonologically while in BAStat it is based on the phonetic transcript. For instance the syllabic nasal /n/ is very high in the ranking of BAStat but does not even appear in the CELEX syllable type list. Nevertheless, the comparison shows that phone or syllable statistics from a lexically based resource differ considerably from conversational speech and might not be suitable for experimental setups dealing with spoken language."]},{"title":"5. Conclusion","paragraphs":["We presented a new type of language resource BAStat, namely statistical data derived from large primary resources of spoken German. These data are useful for linguists as well as language engineering dealing with statistical models of speech production or speech perception.
