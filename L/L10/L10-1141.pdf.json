In order to satisfy real-scale applicative needs, a main task is to create or to enhance lexical and semantic resources on evaluative language. Classical resources of the area are mostly built for english, they contain simple opinion word markers and are far to cover the lexical richness of this linguistic phenomenon. We propose a new method, applied on french, to enhance automatically an opinion word lexicon. This learning method relies on linguistic uses of internet users and on semantic tests to infer the degree of subjectivity of many new adjectives, nouns, verbs, noun phrases, verbal phrases which are usually forgotten by other resources."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["Web 2.0 as a free expression area has literally boosted interests for opinion mining research. Through blogs and social networks (Twitter, Facebook), users share their sentiments and give media coverage to their points of view to influence their communities. In computational linguistic, blogs are more often used as a support study for opinion mining (Mishne and Glance, 2006) (Conrad and Schilder, 2007) (Kessler and Nicolov, 2009) but are more complex to process than text reviews according to (Liu, 2009). Like in the recent text mining challenge (DEFT’09), a current problem is to annotate fine-grained subjective segments (Wilson, 2008) instead of classifying text, then to categorize different semantic aspects of these segments and to detect evaluated targets (Stoyanov and Cardie, 2008) (Ruppenhofer and al., 2008). In this context, Apopsis (Vernier and al., 2009b) is a tool for fine-grained subjective segments detection and categorization : axiological polarity, discursive role (assessment, judgement, agreement, disagreement, etc.), enunciative strategy, speaker engagement (does he assume his subjectivity or does he try to hide it ?). This tool is based on a french lexico-semantic resource built manually (982 entries). It was evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively on a corpus of 100 blogs and during the DEFT’091","evaluation campaign (Vernier and al., 2009a) where it obtained the best results. These tests show a good precision (from 0.80 to 0.90) but average quality on the quantitative aspect (recall is around 0.50). The resource coverage is the main factor explaining undetected opinions.","In this article, we focus specifically on this issue by presenting a learning method, applied on french, to learn automatically new words and phrases of subjectivity. We attach a particular importance to not bring down the quality of the initial manually-built resource. The learning method relies on document contents indexing by a search engine and results given in response to a large set of queries. The construction of these queries, linguistically motivated, 1 http://deft09.limsi.fr/ can infer the subjective degree of many new adjectives, nouns, verbs, noun phrases, verbal phrases. In particular, we argue that this method is able to learn less frequent but meaningful words and phrases of subjectivity which are usually forgotten by other resources and which can be relevant for real applicative tasks.","Several important works in opinion mining have led to create rich lexical ressources manually or semi-automatically : WordNet-Affect (Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004), SentiWordNet (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006). As noticed by (Banea and al., 2008), these resources are only available for a handful of languages and especially for english. In order to get round the cost of manual creation of such resources, some promising approaches try to determine automatically word’s degree of subjectivity (Banea and al., 2008) or word’s polarity (Turney, 2002) with the idea that word’s polarity can be identified by measuring its co-occurrence with some words whose polarity is known in advance, if a given word occurs with a high probability with a positive (negative) words it can be considered subjective and positive (negative). Results obtained by these methods are interesting but are not able to cover and detect all subjective segments in texts. In particular, these methods are not made for learning infrequent words, subjective phrases or subjective collocations built with objective words : bol d’oxygène (≈ a breath of fresh air), bourreau de travail (≈ work-a-holic). However, some infrequent words or subjectives phrases are particularly meaningful in appraisal language. The purpose of our work is to take account of these points to enhance the initial french opinion word lexicon."]},{"title":"2. Opinion Word Lexicon 2.1. Linguistic definitions of subjectivity and evaluation","paragraphs":["(Lavelle, 1950) definesevaluation as the act of breaking the indifference by which we put things on the same level and we consider all the actions as equivalent. Every speech act that reveals a break in the indifference results from the evaluative phenomenon. These acts involve complex"]},{"title":"1335","paragraphs":["semantic, pragmatic or enunciative mechanisms which have been the subject of many research studies (Benveniste, 1974) (Anscombre and Ducrot, 1983). According to (Kerbrat-Orecchioni, 1997), when an enunciative speaker has to select some units from his lexical and syntactic knowledge, he has the choice between two types of formulation :","• objective discourse : which strive to hide every marks of the enunciative speaker’s presence,","• subjective discourse : in which the enunciative speaker admit his presence explicitly (Je trouve ça moche (I find it ugly)) or implicitly (c’est moche (This is ugly)).","(Charaudeau, 1992) points out that there are five modalities that allow a speaker to express an evaluation (opinion, agreement or disagreement, acceptance or refusal, judgement and appreciation). Each of these modalities reveals a particular attitude of the speaker: his belief which is more or less strong regarding the evaluation he expresses, the experience field from which he takes a stand (ethic, moral, intellectual, aesthetic, etc.), his position in relation to his statement (presence or absence of I). These theories are very similar with the Appraisal Theory (Martin and White, 2005) for english. According to Charaudeau, these modalities have specific lexical markers and linguistic symbolic structures. (Galatanu, 2000)’s theory on evaluation completes Charaudeau’s as it organizes modalities into hierarchy on a scale of subjectivity. When a speaker structures his statement, he can choose to objectivize or subjectivize his speech by activating some modalities. In the examples (Table 1), the concerned feature to lie (modality of judgement (ethic/moral)) is part of a different argumentative strategy. The speaker hides his presence (implicit configuration) and he can sometimes use a modality to modalise another one. Thus, the evaluation Je n’aime pas qu’il mente (I don’t like when he lies) will appear more personal (or more subjective) than Nous condamnons ses mensonges (We condemn his lies) or Oui, c’est un menteur (Yes, he is a liar) even if these phrases use the same evaluative value : mentir (to lie). 2.2. Toward an exhaustive resource of subjectivity","markers","These linguistic studies show that word subjectivity is particularly context-dependent. An objective word at a semantical level can become subjective at a pragmatical level. Thus, in the following example the adjective anglais (english) has in itself a subjective meaning because of the speaker’s enunciation :","• Il est terriblement anglais (c’est d’ailleurs pour cela que je l’aime autant) • He is terribly english (that’s why i like him so much) Nevertheless, some words or phrases are already subjectives at a semantical level (mentir (to lie), intéressant (interesting), etc.) or are so much used in a subjective way","Example 2nd Modality Je doute qu’il mente Weak Explicit Opinion I doubt that he’s lying Weak Explicit Opinion Il est évident qu’il ment Strong Implicit Opinion","This is obvious that he’s lying Strong Implicit Opinion Oui, c’est un menteur Agreement","Yes, he is a liar Agreement","Il ment no other modality","He is lying no other modality Je n’aime pas qu’il mente Explicit Appreciation I don’t like when he lies Explicit Appreciation","Nous condamnons ses mensonges Explicit Judgement We condemn his lies Explicit Judgement Table 1: Example of evaluative discourse for the same evaluative value : mentir (to lie) (1st modality : Implicit Judgement) at a pragmatical level (donner de la confiture aux cochons (to cast pearls before swine), crier de joie (to shout for joy), crier au loup (to cry wolf)) that it makes sense to add them in a resource for subjectivity processing. Typically, all these pragmatic subjective phrases are not present in the classical lexical resources.","The initial opinion word lexicon that we have built manually, contains 982 lexical entries (most of them are simple words): adjectives (493), verbs (192), nouns (166), etc. It has been built from the annotated evaluative passages of the Blogoscopie corpus. We refer to (Dubreil and al., 2008) for a more accurate description of the annotation methodology. Each lexical entry is described by morphosyntactic and semantic informations according to linguistic theories seen previously and by its context in the corpus. The evaluative term serious has the following informations: • lemma: serious • grammatical category: adjective","• evaluation: appreciation polarity: negative context: nothing serious will happen to him","• evaluation: judgement polarity: negative context: raise serious problems","• evaluation: judgement polarity: positive context: He is very serious when he is working"]},{"title":"3. Semantic Tests of Subjectivity","paragraphs":["Our aim is to enhance the french opinion words lexicon by adding terms of subjectivity not present previously. In language, these terms can be words (néfaste (harmful), zizanie (ill-feeling), laminer (to laminate)) or phrases (rafler la mise ( ≈ steal the limelight), faire un pied de nez (≈ to thumb one’s nose), vent de panique (≈ a wave of panic)). It can be adjectives, nouns (or noun phrases) or verbs (verbal phrases). To achieve this objective, we present the principle of semantic tests that underlies the machine learning method."]},{"title":"1336","paragraphs":["Some french adjectives (vrai (true), véritable (real)) or adverbs (littéralement (literally, truly), etc) have a particular impact on the enunciation and on subjectivity (Legallois, 2005) (Suhamy, 2006). Thus, it is considered that the word littéralement (literally, truly) should not be taken literally, and has instead, by common usage, a feature that reveals the intensive mental representations and the speaker’s subjectivity: le contribuable est littéralement écrasé d’impôts (≈ the taxpayer is literally crushed by taxation), il a littéralement déplacé une montagne (≈ he has literally moved a mountain). We develop this idea to formulate the following hypothesis:","Assumption: A neutral term (adjective, noun or verb) is rarely intensified by an intensity marker. It makes sense to say:","• Il est particulièrement dynamique, He is very dynamic • C’est véritablement une hérésie, It’s a true heresy","• Il est littéralement tombé sous le charme, he truly fall under the spell Whereas the following sentences seem semantically badly constructed: • C’est terriblement scalaire, It is terribly scalar • C’est littéralement un oiseau, It’s literally a bird","• Il a littéralement mangé au restaurant, He truly ate at restaurant From this principle, we define a set of semantic tests combining :","• an element of an intensity marker list (Particulièrement, Terriblement, Parfaitement, Véritablement, Littéralement, Réellement, Franchement, Véritable)","• and a given term with an unknown degree of subjectivity","To perform these tests, we rely on linguistic uses of internet users and their frequencies. The hypothesis is to consider that relevance of an utterance can be established by its number of hits on the web. For example, from Yahoo search engine, the following queries provide an indication on subjectivity degrees of terms in bold:","• véritablement scalaire (truly scalar) → 0 occurrence / scalaire (scalar) → 650 000 occurrences)","• littéralement mangé au restaurant (really ate at the restaurant) → 0 occ. / mangé au restaurant (ate at the restaurant) → 25 100 occ.)","• véritable hérésie (true heresy)→ 13 occ. / hérésie (heresy) → 460 000 occ.)","• littéralement soulevé la foule (really raised the crowd)→ 15 occ. / soulevé la foule (raised the crowd) → 9 990 occ.) hérésie (heresy) and soulever la foule (to raise the crowd) are potentially subjectives as these early results.

Candidates extraction","paragraphs":["For experimental purpose, candidates are extracted automatically by sending queries to Yahoo!Search.

These adverbs are chose because of their high frequency of occurence in french. In answer to these eight queries, we consider every abstracts given by Yahoo! as a text of our corpus. Then, we use TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994) and a chunking algorithm (Vergne and Giguet, 1998) to extract every nominal phrases and verbal phrases placed just after an intensity marker in this corpus.

Lexicon enhancement evaluation without textual context","Lexicon enhancement evaluation would require a standard resource on which to compare, but our work is precisely motivated by the lack of such resource. In consideration of this aspect, we made a first validation of lexicon enhancement considering the list of 1,500 terms classified by human-judges as a reference. We used a ten cross-validation method during the learning phase to measure the precision and the recall (table 4). Axiology Precision Recall Objective 75,49% (687/910) 94,62% (687/726) Subjective 77,28% (456/590) 61,81% (356/576) Ambiguous 0% (0/0) 0% (0/198) Table 4: Objective terms and subjective terms classification results in comparison with 1,500 terms classified by human-judges. Results shows that even if recall measure of subjective terms is quite low (Figure 1 shows that lots of subjective nouns are approximately in the same area of objective terms), this method enables to extract 456 subjective candidates with an interesting precision. Nevertheless, we underline that contextual evaluation is a predominant aspect, in particular in opinion mining and subjectivity research domain. This bring us to suggest a different evaluation protocol to observe lexical enhancement impact on an real applicative task. Our evaluation protocol differs from (Turney, 2002) who evaluate his method by comparing results to General Inquirer resource. This protocol has the tendancy to consider always correct some subjective terms which can be used in an objective context.","5.2. Lexicon enhancement evaluation with textual context","For this second evaluation protocol, we extract 5,000 posts from french blog plateform Over-blog without any constraints on themes or on post sizes. Then, we use the tool Apopsis to annotate fine-grained subjective appraisal segments. This tool relies on approximatively 2,000 grammar rules and on pattern recognition method for evaluative segment detection in texts (Vernier and al., 2009b). At the end of the natural language process, two files (CSV) are generated to list : on the one hand, subjective appraisal segments detected with initial opinion words lexicon and on the other hand, segments detected with enhanced lexicon part. Two human-judges estimate the precision of the enhanced part. Observed agreement between human-judges is 0.76.
