Introduction","paragraphs":["The method of linking Czech verb valency frames contained in lexical database VerbaLex developed at the Centre for NLP at the Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University with the frames in Berkeley FrameNet is aimed at building the core of Czech FrameNet. The process of linking the VerbaLex frames with the FrameNet frames consists of two phases. In the first phase we find an appropriate FrameNet frame for each frame in VerbaLex. The second phase includes assigning FrameNet frame elements to the deep semantic roles in VerbaLex. First, a few words should be said about FrameNet (Ruppenhofer et al., 2006). Main goal of this project is to build a large lexical resource of English based on frame semantics and supported by corpus evidence. Frame semantics has been proposed and worked out by Charles J. Fillmore, see e.g. (Fillmore, 1976) or (Fillmore, 1982). Throughout the world, there are several projects built on the same idea as the Berkeley FrameNet – Saarbrücken team has been developing German frame-based electronic lexicon SALSA (Burchardt et al., 2006b), Spanish team has been working on Spanish FrameNet (Subirats and Petruck, 2003) etc. For Czech some experiments have been carried out by the J. Hajič’s group in Prague (Benešová et al., 2008), taking advantage of the lexical database Vallex built in this group. However, at present, Czech FrameNet as such has not been worked out yet. It should be remarked that one of the pitfalls of FrameNet is its relatively low recall and the fact that its building reminds a never ending story. If we start with a reasonably determined list of verbs such as VerbaLex the task can get a more distinct outline. To cover this gap at least partially we present a method of linking Czech verb valency database VerbaLex (Hlaváčková and Horák, 2006) frames to FrameNet frames in order to build a core of Czech FrameNet. While lexical units in FrameNet consist of verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs and prepositions, VerbaLex captures verb valencies of approximately 10,500 Czech verbs. VerbaLex takes advantage of the Czech and Princeton WordNet (CZWN and PWN) notation (Pala and Smrž, 2004), working with synsets and using the same verb sense labeling. Also hierarchical structure (hypero/hyponymy trees) of both WordNets is exploited. By linking VerbaLex valency frames with the FrameNet ones we obtain a mapping of the frame elements in FrameNet to the semantic roles in VerbaLex. The mapping is based on the similarity between the set of frame element realisations in FrameNet and the hypernyms of possible verb valency realisations in VerbaLex, as well as on the utilization of the semantic type hierarchy in FrameNet. One of the aims of this work is to reduce manual work that is expensive and time consuming using the proposed semi-automatic approach, which requires a smaller amount of human effort. By linking FrameNet with VerbaLex, we are able to find a non-trivial subset of the interlingual FrameNet frames (including their frame-to-frame relations), which we are going to use as a core for building Czech FrameNet."]},{"title":"2. Frame semantics and FrameNet","paragraphs":["The central idea of the frame semantics (Fillmore, 1982) is that word meaning is described in a relation to semantic frame, which consists of a target lexical unit (pairing of a word with a sense), frame elements (its semantic arguments) and relations between them. FrameNet is a project in which the information about the linked semantic and syntactic properties of the English words is extracted from a large electronic text corpora, using both manual and automatic procedures. The information about words and their properties is stored in an electronic lexical database. Possible syntactic realizations of the semantic roles associated with a frame are exemplified in the annotated FrameNet corpus. 2.1. Semantic Frames A semantic frame is defined as a script-like conceptual structure that describes a particular type of situation, object or event together with its participants and properties"]},{"title":"3331","paragraphs":["(Fillmore, 1977). The semantic links of the lexical unit are expressed in terms of the kinds of entities that can participate in frames of the type evoked by the lexical unit. Lexical unit is a pairing of a word with a meaning. Typically, each sense of a polysemous word belongs to a different semantic frame. For example, the Commerce sell frame describes a situation in which a seller sells some goods to a buyer, and is evoked by lexical units such as auction, retail, retailer, sale, sell, etc. The semantic participants are called frame elements. 2.2. Frame Elements Frame elements bear some resemblance to the argument variables used in first-order predicate logic, but display important differences coming from the fact that frames are much more complex than logical predicates (Fillmore et al., 2003). In the example above, the frame elements include Seller, Goods, Buyer, etc. FrameNet distinguishes three types of frame elements – core FEs (the presence of such FEs is necessary to satisfy a semantic link of the given frame), peripheral FEs (they are not unique for a given frame and can usually occur in any frame, typically expressions of time, place, manner, purpose, attitude, etc.) and extra-thematic FEs which have no direct relation to the situation identified by the frame, but add new information, often showing how the event represented by one frame is a part of the event involving another frame. 2.3. FrameNet relations In order to make FrameNet more comprehensive several frame-to-frame relations are introduced. Each frame relation in the FrameNet data is an asymmetric relation between two frames, where one frame (the more abstract) can be called the super-frame and another (the less abstract) can be called the sub-frame. The set of the most important relations comprises the following ones:","• Inheritance – the strongest relation between frames, corresponding to IS-A relation in ontologies. Each sub-frame must inherit all properties of its super-frame and share all FEs.","• Subframe – some frames are complex in the sense that they refer to sequences of states and transitions, each of them can be separately described as an individual frame. The separate frames (sub-frames) are related to the complex frames via the Subframe relation.","• Perspective on – this relation indicates the presence of at least two different points-of-view. For example, a neutral Commerce goods transfer frame has two points-of-view – Commerce buy and Commerce sell. The neutral frame is usually non-lexical (Ruppenhofer et al., 2006).","• Using – the super-frame constitutes the background for its sub-frames. Not all attributes of the super-frame must be inherited by the sub-frames. For example, Volubility uses the Communication frame, since Volubility describes a quantification of communica-tion events."]},{"title":"3. VerbaLex","paragraphs":["VerbaLex is a lexical database consisting of the valency frames of Czech verbs. It has been developed in the Centre for Natural Language Processing at the Faculty of Informatics Masaryk University. Basic units (entries) in VerbaLex consist of verb lemmata grouped in synsets together with their sense numbers in the standard Princeton WordNet (PWN) notation. For the description of verb valencies we use two level notation consisting of the semantic labels corresponding to semantic roles (semantic values of the verb arguments) and the surface level comprising the information about morphosyntactic properties (cases) of Czech verbs. A valency frame also contains the information about obligatoriness and optionality of its constituents (noun, prepositional and adverbial phrases, dependent clauses). Further, valency frames contain additional information including: • definition of verb meaning; • verb ability to create passive form; • number of meanings for homonymous verbs; • semantic class a verb belongs to; • aspect (perfective or imperfective); • example of verb use; • types of reflexivity for reflexive verbs. Combining all this information we obtain Complex Valency Frames (CVFs). Information about the verb arguments is represented by the complex semantic roles whose first part are main labels primarily based on the EuroWordNet (Vossen et al., 1998) first-order and second-order Top Ontology entities arranged in a hierarchical structure. The inventory of these labels is closed and currently contains 33 items (concept labels). Second part includes the collection of the selected lexical units (literals) from the set of EuroWordNet and Balkanet Base Concepts (Pala and Smrž, 2004) with their respective sense numbers. This list of labels is open and currently contains about 1,200 literals. We can view them as quite detailed sub-categorization features. Since they represent nodes in the WordNet hypero/hyponymy trees this notation can be characterized as endogenous. An example of a VerbaLex frame corresponding to the synset OPUSTIT:6 (OPOU ŠT ĚT), NECHAT:9 (to leave) is shown in figure 1."]},{"title":"4. Method of linking","paragraphs":["The process of linking frames is asymmetric, which means that at most one frame from FrameNet is assigned to a frame in VerbaLex.

As a translation dictionary the electronic Czech-English dictionary, developed at the University of West Bohemia 1",", which can be freely downloaded under the GNU/FDL licence, has been used.

However, there is a problem of finding a correct translation. Another possible solution is to exploit direct links between VerbaLex and Princeton WordNet (Pala and Smrž, 2004; Fellbaum, 1998) and to use WordNet as an inter-language between VerbaLex and FrameNet. To ensure maximum reliability, the linking of PWN verbs onto FrameNet lexical units is based on a WordNet verb–FrameNet dictionary, which has been built manually as a part of the work presented in (Shi and Mihalcea, 2005). This manually built dictionary has high precision but very low recall – it covers 2,651 from 10,500 verbs. This sparseness of the dictionary function can be overcame by the usage of some additional automatic method. In this work, a rule-based system for mediating frame assignment by a “Detour via WordNet” developed by Burchardt et al. (Burchardt et al., 2006a) has 1 http://slovnik.zcu.cz/ 2 The Jaccard coefficient measures similarity between sample","sets, and is defined as the size of the intersection divided by the","size of the union of the sample sets. been used. The process of linking VerbaLex frames with FrameNet frames based on the inter-language is described in figure 3. Note that multiple frames can be assigned to a single synset if all English translations do not share the same FrameNet frame.

Assigning verb arguments An assumption of this task is that the investigated VerbaLex frame is already connected with exactly one appropriate FrameNet frame. Once each VerbaLex frame is connected with a semantic frame from FrameNet, a mapping between semantic roles in VerbaLex and frame elements in FrameNet can be easily identified. Because of the nature of VerbaLex arguments (reflecting combinatory possibilities of verbs), in the case of FrameNet frame, only the core frame elements are used. The linking of semantic roles in VerbaLex with frame elements from FrameNet is based on the most probable pairing. The FrameNet corpus provides a wide range of annotated frame element realizations. Each frame element of the investigated frame is represented by the set of all its realisations in the FrameNet corpus. If the realisation comprises more than one word form all of them are used. In addition, the constituents are normalized and lemmatized using the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994), developed at the Institute for Natural Language Processing, Stuttgart University. In this method, semantic roles in VerbaLex are not exemplified sufficiently but a large enough set of examples can be obtained by taking into account a hyponym relation in CZWN. Formally, each verb argument of the investigated frame is represented by the associated synset from PWN and all its hyponyms. The similarity of a frame element and a verb argument in VerbaLex is defined as a Jaccard measure between their representing sets. The method of linking VerbaLex semantic roles with FrameNet frame elements is shown in figure 4. The goal then is to find the best pairing in terms of the great-"]},{"title":"3333","paragraphs":["Figure 4: Linking VerbaLex semantic roles with FrameNet frame elements est sum of their similarities. The key issue of this approach is a definition of the ,,best pairing”. The two following requirements on the pairing are formulated:","• sum of the similarities of all the participated pairs must be maximal;","• each frame element (verb argument) can be connected at most to one verb argument (frame element), i. e. a particular node may not share more than one pair. The task can be modeled in the graph theory as the most expensive pairing problem of the bipartite graph G = (E, V1, V2, f ), where V1 is the set of all frame elements in the FrameNet frame, V2 is the set of all verb arguments in the VerbaLex frame, E ⊆ V1 × V2 is the set of edges, s : V1 ∪ V2 → 2W","is the set of lexical units associated with the vertex v ∈ V1 ∪ V2, W is the set of all possible lexical units and f : E → R is the weight of an edge (v1, v2) ∈ E and is defined as f ((v1, v2)) = |s(v1) ∩ s(v2)| |s(v1) ∪ s(v2)| Even though several algorithms performing in polynomial time complexity exist (Cook et al., 1997), the simplest brutal-force algorithm, which searches all possible pairings, has been used. The cardinality of a frame element set is usually up to 5 and the cardinality of a VerbaLex argument set up to 3. For such small graphs, even the brutal-force exponential algorithm can overcome some sophisticated polynomial algorithm. For a better insight into the problem, an example of linking VerbaLex frames with FrameNet ones is given. Let us consider following synset from CZWN: prodat:n9, střelit:n2 (to sell something) and a shortened list of simplified VerbaLex frames corresponding to the synset: (a) AG (in-stitution:1) VERB ART (goods:1) REC (institution:1), (b) AG (person:1) VERB ART (goods:1), (c) AG (person:1) VERB ART (goods:1) REC (person:1). All listed frames should be linked to the Commerce sell frame from FrameNet. The core frame elements of the FrameNet frame include Seller (linked to AG (institution:1) in (a) and to AG (person:1) in (b), (c)), Goods (linked to ART (goods:1) in (a), (b) and (c)) and Byuer (linked to REC (institution:1) in (a) and to REC (person:1) in (c)). In frame (b), there is no equivalent for Buyer. 4.2. Ontologies behind FrameNet and VerbaLex We can say that FrameNet lexical resource comprises two independent ontologies. First of them is the hierarchy of FrameNet frames arranged according to the frame-to-frame relations, using especially the inheritance relation. The second one is the hierarchy of semantic types (e. g. Sentient for the Cognizer FE), which are connected with some general frame elements. While the frame-to-frame relations were exploited in the methods identifying links between FrameNet frames and WordNet synsets (Shi and Mihalcea, 2005; Burchardt et al., 2006a), and subsequently in linking FrameNet frames with VerbaLex frames, the relation between frame elements stood apart from our interest so far. One of the fundamental differences between FrameNet and VerbaLex consists in the fact that while VerbaLex uses as labels of the verb arguments a fixed set of Complex Semantic Roles (CSRs) for all valency frames, FrameNet defines a unique frame element set for each frame. Nevertheless, there are frame elements shared by two or more frames (e. g. Time). On the other hand, some frame elements of the same name can have different meaning in different frames. To extend information value of the frame elements a hierarchy of 72 semantic types has been introduced. Each frame element may be connected with one or more semantic types. Unfortunately, only approximately 20 % of all frame elements (usually very general) is connected with any of them. Moreover, the hierarchy of semantic types does not correspond to any existing ontology (although it reminds the Top Ontology in EuroWordNet). However, we can mention a project (Scheffczyk et al., 2006) in which the authors linked semantic types and frame elements to SUMO ontology (Niles and Pease, 2001).","4.3. Exploitation of Ontologies in Linking FrameNet Frame Elements with Semantic Roles from VerbaLex The most problematic part of the process of linking VerbaLex with FrameNet is the connecting VerbaLex verb arguments with appropriate frame elements from FrameNet. The methods of linking frames described above use statistical technique based on comparison of a typical frame element and semantic role fillers, but it can be improved by using the links between semantic types (or frame elements) and SUMO concepts. Once a SUMO concept is linked to each frame element (or most of them), we can use a SUMO-"]},{"title":"3334","paragraphs":["WordNet frame element sematic role WordNet frame element sematic role (a) (b) Figure 5: Distance of a VerbaLex semantic role and a FrameNet frame element. WordNet mapping described in (Niles and Pease, 2003) and get the corresponding WordNet synset. The distance of the frame element and semantic role from VerbaLex is then defined in the following way:","• The linked synset is equal to the synset associated with the VerbaLex semantic role (see fig. 5.a). In this case, the distance is zero.","• The linked synset is not equal to the synset associated with the VerbaLex semantic role (see fig. 5.b). In this case, the distance is defined as the length of the path from one synset to the other using the hypernym relation in WordNet. The ontology-based method of identifying the nearest FrameNet frame element for a semantic role from VerbaLex is very straightforward solution but suffers from many errors in the SUMO-WordNet mapping as well as the lack of frame elements annotated by a semantic type. That is why the method is used only as a correction of the statistical approach described in section 4.1. The bottleneck of the statistical approach consists especially in ambiguity. The problem arises when two or more edges in the pairing graph have (nearly) equal costs. In that case (on condition that the ontology-based cost is defined), the ontology-based instead of the statistical-based distance is used to decide which edge should be selected. The combination of the statistical and the ontology-based method increases the coverage as well as accuracy of the system."]},{"title":"5. Evaluation","paragraphs":["The first phase describing the mapping of the frames from FrameNet onto VerbaLex is proposed using two different approaches. Both methods return a list of frames with a probability. For the purposes of the future applications and the evaluation, the methods are combined in the following way. Let LA","(vf ) = (f A","1 , pA","1 ) . . . (f A","m, pA","m) be a list of potential (frame, probability) pairs for the VerbaLex frame vf, acquired by the method based on verb translations (A) and sorted in the increasing order according to their probabilities. Similarly, LB","(vf ) = (f B","1 , pB","1 ) . . . (f B","n , pB","n ) be an output of the method based on WordNet (B). The final list of potential (frame, probability) pairs is computed by merg-ing LA","and LB",". If any frame is a member of both lists, the arithmetic mean of their probabilities is used. The whole output list can be useful in some application but for the evaluation only the first, most probable item, is used. The method has been evaluated manually by the human annotator on the randomly chosen set of 200 VerbaLex frames. Main problem of this task are translation errors of two types – translation between Czech WordNet and Princeton WordNet and translation between PWN and FrameNet. In spite of the fact that the sense of a word can relatively easily change, acquired precision of the linking between FrameNet frames and VerbaLex ones is about 84 %. The errors include cases where no frame was assigned at all. The frame is not assigned if either the corresponding frame does not exist or the PWN–FrameNet mapping is incomplete. The second phase deals with the linking between verb arguments in VerbaLex and frame elements in FrameNet. This task is, in the principle, more complicated than the previous one. Regardless of the wrongly assigned frame elements, there is a problem with ambiguity. For instance, if two or more arguments of a verb in VerbaLex represent persons, they all are usually connected with the same literal from WordNet (person:1). The similarities of these arguments with frame elements are then the same and the assignment process is ambiguous (see frames (b) and (c) in examples from section 4.1). The experiments have shown that the error rate of the system is about 24 % and the ambiguity rate about 12 %. The former version of the system without corrections by the ontology-based algorithm has performed with the error rate about 26 % and the ambiguity rate about 19 %. Two main problems were identified – first, some characteristic sets of the lexical units are not representative enough and second, there is a problem with verb arguments for which the corresponding frame element in FrameNet does not exist. The relatively low accuracy is also caused by the high number of combinations for each frame pair – the average number of arguments in VerbaLex is 2.7 and the average number of frame elements in FrameNet is 14.6."]},{"title":"6.
