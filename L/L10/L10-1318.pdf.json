This system leverages on the human annotation effort, by providing the annotator with a simple system that applies rules incrementally.

After explaining the motivation for its development from scratch, we present the current status of the AC/DC project and provide a quantitative description of its material in what concerns semantic annotation. We then present the corte-e-costura system in detail, providing the result of our first experiments with the semantic fields of colour and clothing. We end the paper with some discussion of future work as well as of the experience gained."]},{"title":"1. Overview","paragraphs":["Human annotation is considered fundamental for most natural language processing tasks, but is also recognized as tedious and time consuming. Our goal with the work described in the present paper was to investigate how to leverage on the human annotation effort, by providing the annotator with an intuitive and minimal system that applies rules incrementally. Our goal was twofold: first, to develop an easy-to-use system that required a minimum of learning from the part of the linguist (annotator); second, one that provided a straightforward way of checking the results obtained, in order to immediately evaluate the results of the rules devised. We were not interested in developing yet another large and powerful environment for the sake of elegance or de-sign. Rather, we wanted to experiment with the human-machine workload distribution in corpus annotation. Also, by putting the system in production at an early stage we were interested as well in eliciting further requirements, in close connection with the user(s). And, obviously, we wanted to improve the corpus and tool resources that Linguateca has been providing to the Portuguese language processing community for more than ten years (Santos, 2009; Santos, 2010) in the first place. The system, named corte-e-costura 1","was created in the scope of the AC/DC project (Santos and Bick, 2000; Costa et al., 2009), which allows the free querying on the Web of ca. 25 different parsed corpora containing ca. 250 million words, which have also some semantic information. The particular task for which corte-e-costura was originally created was aiding the human annotation of the corpora for specific semantic fields. 1","This is the Portuguese name for the traditional activity of changing and adjusting clothes, fixing and improving by modest means, instead of creating brand-new clothes. 1.1. Motivation Why yet another annotation system? Well, the first answer is that there are not so many annotation systems that are specifically tailored for Portuguese, and it has been our experience for a long time now that off-the-shelf programs always require a set of “corte e costura” procedures to work with our language anyway (Santos, 1999; Mota, 2004). The second reason is that we were not looking for annotation systems for free text at all. We wanted to add annotation to already heavily processed text. In fact, the combination of the many different attributes is probably unique to our website. And then we did not want fully automatic systems, but flexible systems easy to revise, for people who had been trained in the exact combination of material we wanted to annotate further. It was therefore a well-motivated choice to start by a minimum program and see how it could help linguists to specify simple rules both for automatic annotation, and for the revision and correction of the results of their own rules. As for linguistic motivation, we were intrigued by Halliday’s proposal (Halliday, 1991) that quantitative data on language was often an issue of 1:9. Halliday argues that frequency properties are as important as the values themselves in a language system, and that they are part and parcel of the same phenomenon. He claims that there are two kinds of frequency patterns in natural language, corresponding to the traditional concepts of opposition and markedness, corresponding to equal probability, and to 10%-90% occurrence. His proposal is in addition reinforced by the argument that, since natural languages have to be learned, it would be hard to learn a different specific probability for each different grammatical or lexical phenomenon. If this is the case – and our own annotation experience did not go counter it – one would expect that if the annotation was well organized, for each level of rule annotation, only 10% of the cases would have to be corrected, and this until no more refinements could be done."]},{"title":"1437 1.2. Related work","paragraphs":["We are perfectly aware that other formalisms and environments might help us with this issue: the constraint grammar formalism (Karlsson et al., 1995) in which PALAVRAS is built, or NooJ (Silberztein, 2003), or even programs that have been created as useful extensions for the IMS CWB, as MP (Schulze, 1996). The down size of all these choices was to require the linguist to install, and/or get familiar with, any of these systems, when we were not yet sure of how useful would be the rule writing. In Santos and Ranchhod (1999) we made also the related point that corpus processing has many uses and purposes, and that different corpus processing systems may be developed for different corpus-related activities."]},{"title":"2. The AC/DC project","paragraphs":["The AC/DC2","project was started in 1998-99, and had as its main purpose to make a large number of corpus resources for Portuguese available on the Web, with a unified and simple interface. This interface allowed people to interact with corpora without requiring physical access to institu-tions or software installation – at that time, there was no such thing for Portuguese. Later on, we also considered as one of Linguateca’s tasks to create new resources, such as a large newspaper text corpus, CETEMPúblico (Santos and Rocha, 2001), and more complex evaluation resources with further information as-sociated, as the CHAVE collection for information retrieval (Santos and Rocha, 2005), and HAREM’s golden collec-tions (Rocha and Santos, 2007); all of these resources were later included in AC/DC. The AC/DC project also widened in other directions, constituting what we came to call the “AC/DC cluster”, namely, a set of other related projects that shared the processing core of AC/DC – and in some cases, even the material. So we can consider as members of this cluster also:","• the Floresta Sintáctica3","treebank – the first treebank for Portuguese, a cooperation with Eckhard Bick and his VISL project at the University of Southern Denmark (Afonso et al., 2002; Freitas et al., 2008);","• the COMPARA4","corpus – a large manually revised Portuguese-English fiction parallel corpus, a project led by Diana Santos and Ana Frankenberg-Garcia, which finished in December 2008 (Frankenberg-Garcia and Santos, 2003);","• CorTrad5","– a parallel (multi-version and multigenre) corpus, in cooperation with Stella Tagnin and Elisa 2 The name stands for Acesso a Corpos, Disponibilização de","Corpos (roughly: access to corpora, making corpora available),","and is meant to indicate that it should both benefit users – grant-","ing them access; and corpus owners: helping them to make their","corpora widely available.

Description of the material It is always difficult to provide a good overview of what is available for browsing, given that several corpora share material among them, and some have more markup than others. In Table 1, the AC/DC material is roughly quantified under the genre parameter, as of March 2010. No repeated material was included, i.e., overlapping parts were removed from the computations present in the next tables. Genre Size in words Narrative fiction 17,216,517 General newspaper 246,112,528 Specialized newspaper 6,354,317 Informative, technical 4,488,973 Oral 500,741 Other or not classified 1,903,662 Table 1: Genre distribution in the AC/DC cluster Table 2 presents the material in terms of language variety, only for those corpora where we have this information: for example for the CoNE corpus, a corpus of spam email messages where we have not classified the origin, and therefore the variety, we do not have this information.

Semantic annotation After having the corpora syntactically annotated, a next step was to do semantics. Because there was no off-the-shelf program that we could have employed, we proceeded in a stepwise way, trying out specific semantic domains first. We started by the colour domain in Linguateca for several reasons: colour words are common in natural languages, at least in Portuguese, and there is a huge literature on colour, both in English or in languages in general, as well as in Portuguese (see Inácio et al. (2008) for references). Further-more, we were also interested in classification of images by natural language means. Arguments for the existence of syntactic restrictions on the use of colour adjectives have also been advanced (Ellis, 1993), therefore making colour a category which is also reflected in syntax. The first corpus to be fully annotated with colour was COMPARA, as described in detail in Santos et al. (2008), Silva et al. (2008a), and Silva et al. (2008b). This was due both to our contrastive interests and to the fact that it had"]},{"title":"1438","paragraphs":["Corpus Units Words Sentences Var.

Much more information on each corpus is on the website. undergone several levels of revision, from the texts itselves to the alignment to the syntactic annotation. We then reused the data (colour terms and classes) and knowledge gathered with COMPARA to annotate all other corpora in the AC/DC cluster, that is, in this case all AC/DC corpora and CorTrad as well. We started by the CONDIV corpus (Soares da Silva, 2008; Soares da Silva, 2010) not only because it contained very different genres from literary fiction, namely texts on football, on fashion and on health, but also because the way it was built allowed us to compare systematically two varieties of Portuguese, three temporal areas, and three subject domains. A description of colours in the three genres can be found in Table 4. We stress in any case that it is preliminary, because it was not yet 100% humanly revised. We defined the statistics Itok and Ityp as indices that indicate relative colour extension and variety. Itok stands for the ratio of the number of colour tokens to the total number of word tokens in the corpus (times 10,000), while Ityp is likewise defined. So, a large number in both indices indicates a lot of colour information being present. Also, for the same Itok, a large Ityp, in addition, indicates that the colour field in itself is relevant for the texts. Finally, the ratio of colour types to colour tokens (colour type-token ratio, CTT) indicates variety of shades as opposed to frequency of mention. For types, we use the lemma values, so cases like amarelo, amarela, amarelı́ssimo, amarelos and amarelinho are all subsumed under the AMARELO (adjective) type. On the other hand, the two other forms amarelo classified as noun with lemma AMARELO and verb with lemma AMARELAR are counted as different types. We present in Figure 1 the two indices for all AC/DC corpora. It should be noted that these values have to be treated with care since they were computed for data of very different sizes and are therefore not easily comparable, cf. Baayen (2001) for a discussion of these and similar matters. We are currently investigating different ways of better visualizing and comparing these corpora.6 Figure 1: The semantic field of colour in AC/DC: circles correspond to Ityp, triangles to Itok. After colour, it was natural to start as well by marking clothing due to the fashion theme of CONDIV and the fact that there were already clothing terms available from the CONDIV project.7","Football terms, on the other hand, were 6","Two obvious strategies are: select an equal sized random sample for every corpus, and/or estimate theoretical values cor-rected by the corpus size. 7","Also, there were other sources of clothing information, such as the TexSITE project, http://pt.texsite.info/ and WordNet.PT, and studies we knew about (Bacelar do Nascimento"]},{"title":"1439","paragraphs":["Subject Tokens Types Colour tokens Colour types Itok Ityp CTT ratio Fashion 1,104,347 33,787 13,763 477 124.626 141.179 .0346 Health 1,806,201 46,948 2,276 160 12,601 34,080 .0703 Soccer 2,992,062 60794 4457 120 14,896 19,739 .0269 Table 4: Colour distribution in CONDIV.

Santos et al. (2010). We have, in any case, already defined a somewhat different organization of classes that appear relevant in this context, since different distinctions and properties seem to be at play in Portuguese:","• Clothes are not as widespread grammatically as colours: while we found colours in almost all parts of speech, for clothing the vast majority of items are nominal, with very few verbs indeed: in addition to the prototypical vestir and despir, and calca̧r and descalca̧r, only a few such as agasalhar (’put on warm clothes’), descobrir (’take off the hat’), encasacar-se (’put too many coats’).","• A sort of classifier-like system shows in the pair calca̧r versus vestir (to which a neutral pôr can be added): in fact, calca̧r implies from below (or to a binary pair of items such as feet, legs or hands), and is used for shoes to trousers but also to mittens, while vestir implies from above (or a unique dressing piece) and is used for dresses and everything that is on the upper part of the body but also shirts. Finally, for head garments pôr is required.8","• As a cultural attribute per excellence, gender issues are intricately mixed with the lexicon of clothing, which naturally reflects differences between women’s and men’s clothes. There are also special clothes for babies and infants. But there is a marked tendency to have common clothes for the two sexes as well. So we are marking four independent categories as well: roupa:mulher (woman), roupa:homem (man), roupa:crianca̧ (child), and roupa:unissexo (both genders).","• We have also added an additional layer of classification to the 33 clothing classes currently considered, namely, the six superclasses: agasalhos (warm clothes), calca̧s (trousers), casacoscurtos (short coats), conjuntos (more than one piece), exteriortronco (pieces used over the shoulders), vestidoousaia (clothes including skirt). As was the case for the colour domain, there is a considerable difficulty in deciding what to annotate in borderline and Carvalho, 1996).","8","This is a system that as native speakers we observe that is currently undergoing change: For example, while for whatever you use vestir you can use despir for the opposite action, the verb descalca̧r is hardly in use except for shoeware, and there is marked tendency in Portugal to use mainly tirar (’remove’) for taking off clothes, shoes, etc. cases, and we proceed by documenting rigorously all op-tions taken, together with the cases for which we take an arbitrary decision. Examples of decisions consistent with the approach taken for the colour are:","• The specification of a NãoEspecificada (unspecified) category, including generic references to clothes but not which (just like for colour), including items such as roupa, farrapos, vestes, fato, etc.;","• The use of a Outras (other) category, to include all cases for which we so far did not think a specific category was warranted. To have a glimpse of the kinds of items here, we have bathing suits; culturally-defined clothes such as kimono or poncho, and work-clothes such as fato macaco (overall), bata (school uniform), or hábito (monks clothes);","• The existence of expressions that involve clothing but have a metaphorical import, and which are therefore reclassified in a Original class. Examples are de tirar o chapéu (literally, ’deserves taking off our hats’, for something very good) and apertar o cinto (literally, ’to squeeze the belt’, for describing expense reductions). Problems that so far are unique to the clothing domain is the much higher vagueness of terms out of context: for example, casaco or fato-macaco can belong to three or four classes, and the existence of several related domains such as accessories, parts of clothes (such as collars and zips) and materials, which apparently are more natural to classify in the same fell swoop. We have in any case also compiled lists of those lexical items.9 2.3. Need for revision We needed a system to improve the revision process of the annotated corpora of the AC/DC cluster projects. All these projects share a similar workflow in that the corpora are first parsed by PALAVRAS (Bick, 2000) (or a corresponding English system, if bilingual corpora), then they are transferred to the AC/DC format (Santos, 2008) adding meta-information as well, and then they are automatically annotated with information pertaining to several (semantic) domains. One important feature is that these corpora may be improved (or the annotation may be changed) due to for example correction of the input texts or improvement of the PALAVRAS version or lexicon. So, we did not want to fix their contents and let people start to improve them manually. This would bring severe problems of integration of 9","A similar case but less frequent for colour was the case of vegetable materials, such as in madeira de castanho (a kind of wood) and the concept of green as opposed to ripe."]},{"title":"1440","paragraphs":["the annotated and revised material with new versions of programs applied in earlier stages of the corpus annotation chain. We were in addition aware of the time and labour involved in making a complete corpus human revised, since we had followed this route in COMPARA and in Floresta, and we wanted to minimize human effort. In order to make the most of the previous experience of the annotators, the rules should be established by the human annotators in a format as similar as possible to the one used to query the corpus – the IMS-CWB format (Evert, 2009). These rules should modify, delete or add new attributes to the previous annotation, but could be applied automatically as many times as required."]},{"title":"3. The corte-e-costura program","paragraphs":["Our goal was therefore to create mechanisms and procedures for semi-automatic semantic annotation that would produce good results in a short period of time, and which could be repeatedly applied whenever changes in corpora would take place. Currently all semantic information is encoded in two attributes only: sema, and grupo, which encode a wide range of alternatives, as shown in Santos et al. (2008). However, the program is flexible enough to be applied so that it modifies any attribute or a group of attributes that are encoded in the AC/DC format, and this has actually been extensively used in the correction rules. On the other hand, at the time of this writing, we have to ac-knowledge that the program is very slow, and does not yet allow some of the more expressive CWB constructs such as within s (restriction to a span described by a structural attribute, in this case s for sentence) or [pos!=”N”]* (nega-tion, regular expressions over values, and/or over tokens). The bulk of the work so far has been around filling the attributes sema and grupo, as well as to identify multiword expressions that should be annotated as a single token, which in the AC/DC format are units delimited by the structural attribute mwe. In Silva and Santos (2010) the types of rules used to annotate the colour field, and their linguistic motivation, were presented in detail. A similar documentation for the clothing domain is under way in Santos et al. (2010). 3.1. Rule description Each rule is comprised of an antecedent and a consequent, which are both composed of one or more terms. When the rule aims at delimiting new multiword expressions and does not depend on the context, the consequent can be omitted. In that case, the antecedent is merely the multiword expression that one wants to annotate, such as cor de rosa. Rules to modify attributes of existing units in the corpus always feature an antecedent and a consequent. In the AC/DC corpora, following the CWB scheme, there are two types of attributes: positional and structural. Both sides of the rule can refer to terms of the two types, allowing simultaneous modification of both kinds. (1) a:[lema=\"camisa\"] b:[lema=\"salmão\" & pos=\"N\"] >> a:[sema=\"roupa\"] b:[pos=\"ADJ\" & gen=\"F\" & sema=\"cor\"] (2) [pos=\"N\"] a:<mwe pos=\"N\"> b:[lema=\"cor\"] [lema=\"de\"] [lema=\"laranja\"] </mwe> >> a:<pos=\"ADJ\"> b:[sema=\"cor\"] In example (1), upon encountering the sequence camisa salmão in the corpus the program adds (or replaces, if the attribute already exists) to the first token the indication that it concerns clothing (sema=roupa), and changes the attributes pos, gen and sema of the term salmão into the interpretation of this term as a colour term used as an adjective. A similar action is done in (2), now grammatically (by a noun) and not lexically motivated, and dealing with the multiword cor de laranja, initially annotated as a (multiword) noun. Both general attributes and one referring to the first word of the expression are changed by this rule. Concentrating on multiword expressions, these can be delimited either implicitly or explicitly. In the first case, it suffices to initialize the semantic type and the POS tag that are going to be assigned to the multiword expression independent of context, and list all the instances we want to annotate (initially), as in the next example: (3) # sema=cor pos=ADJ ac ̧́ucar queimado If the multiword expression depends on the context, explicit rules similar to (2) can or should be used, also to create a multiword out of a sequence of words. (4) [pos=\"N\"] a:[word=\"peito\"] b:[word=\"de\"] c:[word=\"rola\"] >> <mwe sem=\"cor\" pos=\"ADJ\"> a:[sema=\"cor\"] b: c: </mwe> 3.2. Rule application For each sentence S in a given corpus C, the set of rules R is applied using this simple algorithm: 1. Copy S to S’ 2. For each element E of S do: (a) For each rule in R do:","i. If rule is activated starting in element E, then execute rule consequent modifying S","3. If S equals S’, then return S; otherwise repeat rule application to sentence S from 1. The repetition step mentioned in step 3. occurs only if the rules are being applied in recursive mode, i.e., when one wants to apply the rules until no more text modifications are observed. Rules are sequentially applied to each sentence left to right, one at a time, in the same order as enumerated in the rule file. A rule is activated if each term of its antecedent matches an element of the sentence. A rule can be activated more than once per sentence, if there are multiple subsequences that match the rule antecedent. Likewise, there may be more than one rule that matches the same sentence subsequence."]},{"title":"1441","paragraphs":["Whenever a rule is activated it is immediately executed. This means that a rule can produce the necessary modification to trigger subsequent rules or to prevent subsequent rules to be activated. The process advances to the next rule, as soon as there is a rule term that is not satisfied. Execution of a rule means updating the attributes of the elements of the sequence that triggered the rule. In the antecedent of the rule, a multiword expression can be either explicitly represented by all its constituents or by using the wildcard * between the structural tags <mwe> and </mwe>. For instance, the following rule is triggered when a noun term is preceded by any multiword expression, regardless of the constituents it is built of: <mwe> * </mwe> a:[pos=\"N\"] >> a:[pos=\"ADJ\"]"]},{"title":"4. Experiments and results","paragraphs":["In this section, we describe the application of the program to the AC/DC corpora, what we learned, and the number of differences that are changed and provide a first idea of the changes in each step. 4.1. Experience gathered In order to optimize performance and rule writing, we conceptually separated the rules among general rules, and corpus specific rules. Later on we understood that for cases of corpora with very different material, rules for particular subjects were warranted. This, in fact, occurred as well for different varieties. So, variety differences or domain differences had to be catered for by more specific rule sets: for example, in a soccer context, amarelo has a specific interpretation (that of a yellow card) that is not primed in a fashion domain. Conversely, fato is a hyperonym for clothes in Portuguese from Portugal but means “fact” in Brazilian Portuguese, while terno is only clothing in Brazil and not in Portugal. It is however important to note that it is not always obvious to consider a rule as general or corpus-specific. Another thing that required tampering with was the conceptualization among four different kinds of rules (the correction rules are straightforward conceptually, and, in fact, they may not even belong to semantic annotation proper). We had the following cases:","1. positive rules: for cases where a particular context implies that a given lexical item is positively a colour (or clothing, or whatever domain we are annotating)","2. negative rules: for cases where a particular context implies that a given lexical item – that was marked as de-fault – is not of the semantic domain we are analysing","3. specialization rules: for cases where specialized con-texts imply a change in the semantic domain, for example assigning subset classifications such as political colour or team colour","4. recursive rules: to be applied on the end, these rules are not only costly but depend on previous applica-tions, so they are mainly used for coordinations, where the fact that something non-standard is coordinated with other members of a given class allows for disambiguation and/or even for coercion, as is the case of Quando usar o batom vermelho, que vai bem a qualquer hora, pinte as pálpebras com sombra marrom e pérola. (... paint the eyelids with a brown and pearl shadow). Now, it is important to explain that it is up to the rule writer how she conceptualizes the issues. It is sometimes easier to write negative rules than positive ones no matter the frequency. This was the case with branqueamento (whitening, also meaning money washing): although most of the cases referred to the illicit activity concerning money, these cases were easier to identify and thus remove with negative rules than the opposite.
