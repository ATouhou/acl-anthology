The firstrelease of the corpus (BAS SK-P 1.0) has been finishedend of 2001 and will be ready for distribution to the scientific community in July 2002. The SmartKom corpus will be the firstof a new generation of Language Resources (LR) designed for a more or less complete data gathering of human-machine communication combining acoustic, visual and tactile input and output modalities. Since the funding of about EU 2 Mio for this LR is 100% public, the corpus will be available without royalties via the Bavarian Archive for Speech Signals (BAS) at the University of Munich."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["This paper gives a detailed specification of the upcoming distribution series BAS SK at the Bavarian Archive for Speech Signals (BAS) located at the University of Munich. Aside from the specs of the first release we also give some background information that might be useful for the prospective user of the resource. Note that the SK Biometric Corpus is not reported in this paper. The paper is organized as follows: In the second section we give a brief description of the project frame work of SmartKom (SK). The SK corpora are not produced as a pure infrastructural initiative (like for instance the CGN corpus or the BNC); therefore it might be interesting for the user of the corpus to know under which motivation these data were produced and for which purposes. The third section describes the basic recording technique using Wizard-of-Oz experiments (WOZ) and naive users. Section 4 gives a very brief overview how the gathered data are processed and annotated. Readers who are only interested in the basic facts of the resource might skip the first three sections and go right to section five which sums up all specifications for the distributed resource. Note that although these are in some cases specific to the first release, most of the specs will hold for all SK corpora released within the next two years by BAS. Section six gives the terms of availability and the intended release plan of the SK corpora, while the last section is dedicated to a brief discussions of the weaknesses of the corpus and prospective uses."]},{"title":"2. SmartKom 2.1. The Project","paragraphs":["The goal of the SmartKom project (SK) is the development of an intelligent computer-user interface which allows almost natural interaction for the user1",". The system recognizes natural speech as well as gestures above a flat interaction area. Additionally, facial expression is analyzed. The output of the system is synthesized speech and a GUI, 1 http://smartkom.dfki.de/ which is either projected on the interaction area or shown on a portable Web Pad or PDA (see figure 1 for a schematic view of the recording setup). The focus of the SK project                                                                   Beamer Monitor Camera Graphical Tablet Front Speaker (Speech Output) Test Subject Microphone Array with Directional MicrophoneFront Camera SIVIT Infrared Camera Figure 1: SmartKom Public setup used for data collection.","does not aim at the development of application products","but to investigate the new possibilities in multimodal com-","munication, in this case by combining natural speech input","with 2D gestures and mimic expressions. To demonstrate","the possibilities of multimodal communication SK is im-","plemented in three different technical example scenarios: ","SK Public : a publicly accessible information interface ","SK Home : intelligent communication assistant at","home ","SK Mobil : portable communication assistant Within of each technical scenario the SK core system covers several task domains. For example: hotel/restaurant information, cinema, weather forecast, MP3-Jukebox, VCR programming, TV program (EPG), E-Mail/Fax assistant, scheduler, navigation etc. Furthermore, the SK system should be capable to verify identities and/or recognize users by biometric measures (voice, signature and hand contour). 2.2. The data collection","Within the SK project BAS is responsible for the collection of multimodal data and the evaluation of the system prototypes (not reported here). In Wizard-of-Oz experiments (see section 2) subjects are recorded in sessions of 4.5 minutes length while they are interacting with a simulated version of the SK system. During these sessions all capture devices of the system are used for collecting data:"," audio is captured using a directional microphone, a microphone array with 4 channels and (alternating) a headset or a clip microphone."," video is recorded by to two standard DV cameras (one for the facial expression, one for the side view of the subject) and by an infrared camera which is part of the gesture recognizer SIVIT (Siemens)."," the graphical output is recorded in a low frame rate video (used only for labeling)."," gesture coordinates captured by the SIVIT system and the graphical tablet. The data collection in SmartKom serves two distinct purposes. First, it is used as training and test material in the developing process of the different recognizers (speech, gesture, facial expression). Second, it provides insight into the human-machine interaction. The information obtained here is used during the concept phase in SmartKom, especially when modeling the interaction strategies. 2.3. Partners","The SK consortium consists of 7 industrial and three academic partners, namely Daimler/Chrysler, DFKI, European Media Lab (EML), Philips, Media Interface, Siemens, SONY, Universities of Erlangen, Munich, Stuttgart. Furthermore, two sub-contractors, Sympalog and ICSI, are involved. For further information please consult smartkom.dfki.de. Partners will have access to the data right after their edition; other parties have access after one year of blocking period exclusively via the BAS."]},{"title":"3. Recording with WOZ","paragraphs":["To explore how users interact with the SK system, data is collected in so-called Wizard-of-Oz experiments: The subjects have to solve certain tasks with the help of the system (e.g. planning a trip to the cinema). They are made believe that the system they interact with is already fully functional. Actually, many functions are only simulated by two ”wizards”, who control the system from a separate room. Each subject is recorded in two sessions of about 4.5 minutes length each. The basic recording parameters of each session are:"," Technical scenario (Public, Home, Mobil)"," Primary task (eg. programming the VCR)"," Secondary task (eg. look for TV shows tonight in EPG)"," User profile (gender, age, education, technical background, etc.)"," Emotions evoked yes/no"," Hand gesture or pen gesture used"," background noise (on/off, type, level)"," background of front camera (different patterns)"," results of user questionnaire Most of the above data (and more) are stored directly into the project database and exported later into the user profile file (SPR) and the recording protocol (RPR). Technical scenarios are defined by blue prints to ensure consistent technical recording conditions. These also include the simulated GUI (see (Beringer, 2001) for details). Task domains are defined by so called task flo w charts which define the possibilities of the simulated system (figure 2).

Each computer is dedicated to record a single data stream because continuous capturing of audio and, especially, of video demands a great amount of computing power. The data from two video streams (front view and side view) are recorded separately via a FireWire bus between camera and computer and are stored as Quicktime files encoded in DV. The video signal of the infrared camera is digitized by an external analog-DV-converter and then recorded in the same way. Video data encoded with DV offer a high picture quality and show very few artifacts which could be other-wise problems for image processing algorithms. However, the advantage in quality comes together with large amounts of data. For capturing the audio data we use a ten track audio card. The recorded audio files are stored in Windows WAVE format, using a resolution of 16 bit and a sampling frequency of 48 kHz. Capturing of the graphical system output is done via a screen capturing tool. It allows recording to a video file in AVI format at low frame rates; in our setup capturing at 4 fps is sufficient because the interaction speed is low. The remaining data tracks, the coordinate files of the SIVIT gesture recognizer and of the graphical tablet are recorded with specially designed tools. In addition to the actual recording, this stage comprises also the generation of a new entry for the session in the database. Information about the user as well as his or her behavior during the recording or details about the setup are stored here. In the following stages gradually more and more information is added e.g. about the current state of the session in the processing pipeline."]},{"title":"4. Processing and Annotation","paragraphs":["After the session recording several non-synchronized","data streams have to be integrated into a common Quick-","Time2","frame and then annotated in severals steps (figure","3).

Recorded Signals","In Smartkom a typical session file contains the following tracks:"," Video of the face, frontal, DV format. The DV camera is in a fixed position so that the head of the user is in the the inner 9th square of the frame. The user may move his/her head outside of this frame. No additional lightning was used. The background colors may change according to the recording specs, but not within one session; no moving objects in the frame except the user."," Video of upper body, from left, DV format. Basically the same conditions as the front camera. White background color throughout the SK Public recording."," Video of infrared camera directed on display to capture hand gestures, from top, DV format. The camera is part of the SIVIT gesture analyzer by Siemens. The camera is a standard PAL camera which delivers an analog video signal in b/w. The background is a special infrared reflecti ve surface. Only objects on this surface appear in the picture as black shadows (background appears in white). Any graphics projected on the background do not appear in the video. The video signal is digitized into a DV compatible stream and then captured by a standard FireWire card."," Audio in 10 channels (microphone array (4), directed mic, headset (2), background noise (2), system output) captured by a 10-channel audio card with 48 kHz. Data are filtered to 8 kHz and down-sampled to 16 kHz before included into the QuickTime frame."," Graphical system output captured by a screen capture application at 4fps, AVI format."," combined video frame with face, upper body, system output and infrared, AVI format (see figure 4)."," Coordinate log files: output of either the gesture recognition system (finger tip) or the output of the graphic tableau (pen tip) For performance reasons all streams are captured on different computers. Coordinate log files are transformed into a sprite track to make coordinates visible in the video signals. Then all raw signals are synchronized, cut and integrated into a QT frame.","Figure 4 shows four data streams of a SmartKom recording within a single flattened video frame. In the upper left quadrant the video signal of the face camera is shown; in the upper right quadrant the video signal of the body from the left; in the lower left quadrant the displayed output of the system, in the lower right quadrant the output of the system and as an overlay the video signal of the infrared camera that captures the user’s gestures. The shown frame is actually from a video stream that was calculated from the original QT frame; the QT Player Pro is principally capable to show many video streams simultaneously, however the performance on a standard Intel platform is still unsatisfying.","5.3. Annotations The BAS SK corpora contain the following annotations:"," SmartKom Transliteration of audio channels"," Turn segmentation"," Segmentation and labeling of gestures in the 2D plane"," Segmentation and labeling of user state (facial and speech)"," Segmentation and labeling of user state from facial expression only"," Segmentation and labeling of complex prosodic features to recognize ’emotions’ There exist two different types of annotations: Script-like annotations for the linguistic (TRS) and prosodic labeling (TRP) and the BAS Partitur File (BPF) that summarize all annotations of a dialog partner. Therefore, you will find two BPF files in each BAS SK session: one regarding the (human) user of the system, the other regarding the system itself (linguistics only). The following example shows an extract from a SmartKom BPF. For better readability the file is abbreviated to the first 12 words of the dialogue and the header block is omitted.

Discussion","paragraphs":["The BAS SK corpus is certainly a task-oriented corpus. This means that data were gathered and annotated with certain aims and have therefore a limited re-usability for other purposes. However, following our experiences with the Verbmobil Speech Corpus we hope that the free distribution of this corpus will encourage other groups in the scientific community to work with the data and add further annotations to the corpus. Aside from that we took some effort to produce not solely the required data for the SK project aims but to enrich the basic corpus with other well-tried data. For instance the SK transliteration is largely conform with the Verbmobil transliteration, additional audio channels were recorded (microphone array) and the recorded situation is not exclusively determined by the performance of the SK prototype system. From our experience so far, the BAS SK corpus is a ”difficult” corpus meaning that the data contain a lot of ”real world” conditions like"," moving faces (sometime even outside of the frame)"," very differing illumination"," differing background light and/or noises"," users of all levels of computer competence"," users with only second language knowledge"," users with beards, glasses, jewelery etc."," complex task dialogs; no fixed schemes to solve a task"," un-supervised and naive users; user were basically told that they could do anything to solve the task; some were very experimental and tried to push the system to its edges There are many thinkable uses for this ”LR”:"," non-prompted speech recognition with different microphone setups"," face tracking"," eye focus tracking"," user state recognition"," lip reading"," behavioral studies"," gesture recognition"," dialog modeling"," multimodal discourse analysis We assume that most parties interested in this corpus will not order the full set of recordings (at least not in the near future as long as our distribution medium is restricted to 5 GByte) but rather download only the annotation files and analyze those."]},{"title":"8.
