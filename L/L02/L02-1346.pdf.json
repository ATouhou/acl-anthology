Through a series of short presentations and discussion focused on the questions below, the participants will attempt to articulate and jointly discover international strategies for language resources and evaluation."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["Individual organizations and countries have been investing in the creation of language resources and the methods for the evaluation of resources, technologies, products and applications. This is evident in the US DARPA HLT programme, the EU HLT programme under FP5-IST, the Francophone AUF programme and others, particularly in the localisation industry (LISA and LRC). The European 6th Framework program (FP6), planned for a start in 2003, includes multilingual and multisensorial communication as one of the major R&D issue, and the evaluation of technologies appears as a specific item in the Integrated Project instrument presentation."]},{"title":"2. Panel Aims","paragraphs":["Substantial mutual benefits can be expected from addressing these issues through international cooperation. A key element to international cooperation is sharing knowledge about problems and solutions. Another are joint activities that go beyond information sharing to cocreation of solutions to global challenges. Although the evaluation paradigm has been a key element in these large national and international programs, there has been limited explicit global planning and coordination. The primary purpose of this panel would attempt to advance the dialogue on international cooperation on this topic by:","1. Baselining current international activities","2. Identifying potential areas for cooperation and","collaboration","3. Discussing a potential international roadmap for","language resources and the methods for the","evaluation of resources for the next decade."]},{"title":"3. Panel Process","paragraphs":["Panelists will briefly summarize strategies within their own programs and countries, discuss possible joint or coordinated activities, and then engage the audience with issues."]},{"title":"4. Panel Questions","paragraphs":["The panelist will address the following questions:","1. What language resources (LR) and evaluation are your programs and institutions relying upon? 2. What should be a minimal LR set for each language?","3. What are your current programs in the collection, creation, and dissemination of LR?","4. What are impediments to advancing LR (financial, technical, legal) and evaluation?","5. What tools, reusable components and abstract architectures are available or being planned?","6. Are there any successes in international sharing and cooperating regarding LR and evaluation? 7. What are your future plans for LR and evaluation?"]}]}
