The Research Laboratory ATILF is the new UMR (Unité Mixte de Recherche) created in association between the CNRS and the University of Nancy 2 since 2001-January 2nd, and succeeds to the local component of the INaLF situated in Nancy. This considerable amount of resources concerning French language consists in a set of more than 3400 literary works grouped together in Frantext, plus a number of dictionaries, lexis and other databases. These web available resources are operated and run through the potentialities and powerful capacities of a software called Stella, a search engine specially dedicated to textual databases and relying on a new theory of textual objects."]},{"title":"1.

A set of linguistic resources for lexical and textual analysis","paragraphs":["The two realizations we present below concern French language and are accessible via the Web. They are managed by a specially dedicated search engine called Stella which allows queries and hyper-navigation through and between the databases."]},{"title":"2.1. Frantext, a textual database","paragraphs":["Frantext (1992) can be defined as a doublet constituted on the one hand by a vast corpus of written literary French texts mainly from the 16th","to 20th","centuries, and on the other hand by a software offering a Web interface with interrogation, consultation and hyper-navigation possibilities. 2.1.1. History","Historically, the base was constituted in order to provide samples to be used in the elaboration of the TLF (Trésor de la Langue Française). It was started in the 60’s. At that time, softwares were not interactive, and corpora were sequentially treated. In the 80’s, a new approach prevailed : the creation of a kind of textual database platform which allowed direct access to the individual words of the corpus, and increased work efficiency. A first user’s interface was realized in 1985, using telematic tools such as Transpac and Minitel. About 90% of the 430000 samples cited in the TLF/TLFi are taken from Frantext.","Then, progressively, this first raison d’être turned to a new one : the desire to offer the scientific community a vast corpus of texts linked to a more and more efficient query tool. 2.1.2. At the present time","At the present time, 3417 literary works are grouped together in Frantext. They cover a period dating from 1505 to 1998, plus one text dating back to 1377. There exists an other textual database covering the period 847 to 1502 (300 texts, soon accessible via the Web).","This corpus is subject to regular updating and enhancing, with three main objectives :","The first one is the good quality of the proposed texts. Some of them are still in the first state of their data capture (first 60’s) and need to be amended.","The second one is the good quality of the editions considered for the data capture. Some of them can be considered as obsolete and/or not reliable.","And the third one is the enlargement of the database with new texts, in order to restore the balance between dates, or genres, or to facilitate some special operations in the domain of linguistic research or teaching. 2.1.3. The two versions of Frantext","Frantext is accessible on the internet, on an annual subscription basis of 305€. The user will have access to the two versions of Frantext, which will be grouped together in a near future :","First, the total base, containing at present 3417 texts ( raw text, not annotated, for a total amount of more than 209 million occurrences). Texts can be interrogated on the graphic forms of the words (all texts at the same time, or one by one).","Second, a sub-base of the corpus, in “modern” spelling, containing 1940 texts (about 127 million occurrences), called “Frantext catégorisé”. This corpus is morphologically annotated with Part-of-Speech labels, with a specific ATILF categorizer. Interrogation is possible on the graphic forms, and/or on the morphological tags, either independently, or in the same request. 2.1.4. The Frantext interface","The Frantext interface is user friendly and offers great possibilities :","Once the user has defined his work corpus (all the texts at the same time, or by author, or by dates, etc.), requests are possible. The user can search simple occurrences (words, tags ), co-occurrences, or sequences (possibly including optional terms), using simple graphic forms, word lists, or grammars. He can make a normal search, pointing on a word, a tag, a word-&-tag, a regular expression, or or make more advanced searches. He can save his results and have them frequency sorted, downloaded, etc.","There is a lot of help on line, explaining how to make a request, get results, or download a personal grammar, as well as modify the color of the screen or the window frame..."]},{"title":"2.2. The TLFi, a lexical database","paragraphs":["The computerized TLFi dictionary (Dendien, 1996) is the logical avatar of the TLF which was started in the 60’s (with Frantext, its sub-project at that moment) 2.2.1. General overview","The TLFi (Trésor de la Langue Française informatisé) can be seen as a lexical database and a finely structured knowledge base. Its originality is based on its content : about 100000 words with more than 270000 definitions, special sections concerning their history, formation, etymology, more than 430000 examples and excerpts from the two last centuries literature. 2.2.2. Specificities of the TLFi","The TLFi is specific in its content :","Its word list is rich of about 100000 entries, all present in our funds and dictionaries. Also original, the treatment of morphemes (almost 60 words presented and defined under the headword –o), the treatment of prefixes, suffixes and other affixes.","It is structured regarding an over-elaborate list of meta-textual objects : headwords, grammatical codes, indications of domain, semantic and stylistic indicators, definitions, examples with their source... About 40 meta-textual objects.","Definitions are illustrated by a great quantity of examples : about 430000.","It proposes a great diversity of sections to be consulted: synchrony, etymology, history, pronunciation, bibliography, etc.","","The TLFi is specific in its structure :","One of the main advantages of a computerized dictionary is to allow full-text requests throughout its whole content. However, in order to increase the precision and eliminate noise in the request, it would be useful to restrict a full text research to a specific kind of “textual object”. That is the reason why the whole dictionary has been transformed into an XML document, with special delimiters for each type of textual objects.","A second dimension has been introduced : there is a hierarchy between the textual objects, using a special internal tagset and a special control grammar. This makes possible to analyse the hierarchical structure of the article, and to take it into account when making a request. 2.2.3. Three levels of query","The TLFi can be freely consulted via internet, according three levels of query (depending on the user’s needs).","A user can simply consult the dictionary, article after article, putting or not into evidence such or such type of information (a definition, an author, etc.).","He has a possibility to use a formulary of “aided request”, i.e. consult the dictionary in a simple way (asking for a definition, a domain or another proposed “object”), or in a transverse way (crossing the criteria , for example : a definition in the domain of...).","A third way of consulting the TLFi is to use a more complex request crossing several criteria and taking into account the hierarchical structure of the textual objects. This request can be single- or multi-objects. It is possible to make and use word lists. For example, one can extract all the words ending wit suffix –âtre, and then extract from this list all words having a pejorative meaning. One can also extract all the conjugated forms of the French verb aimer contained in the core of an example taken from Balzac, etc.","In conclusion, it has been proved that the fine structuring plus the rich content of the TLFi, allied to a very friendly user’s interface allows very pertinent results when making requests."]},{"title":"3.

The interface is very friendly, with much help on line. It offers fine-grained request possibilities, allowing precision in the results.","An optimal response time to all requests.","A good quality of service : Stella contains a linguistic “knowledge” (flexions, categorized databases) which allows a user to make complex requests.","A powerful capacity of interrogation : a user can write parametrable grammars to be used and re-used in different contexts.","A possibility of hyper-navigation throughout all the databases interconnected under Stella.

(Balzac H. de / Correspondance","T.3 / 1839)","• Je me plaignis de son abandon, elle m’appela","fils dénaturé. (Balzac H. de / Le Lys dans la","vallée / 1844)","b) Simple tense (negative form)","• Puis, quand tu ne m’aimeras plus, tu me laisseras,","je ne me plaindrai pas, je ne dirai rien. (Balzac","H. de / Histoire des Treize / 1835)","• Sachez –le bien, madame, je vous pardonne, et ce","pardon est assez entier pour que vous ne vous","plaigniez point d’être venue le chercher malgré","vous...(Balzac H. de / Histoire des Treize / 1835)","c) Compound tense (affirmative form)","• Quand je me suis plaint de cette barbarie à un","ami de M.. Bellizard, il me répondit : Bah !","(Balzac Honoré de / Le Lys dans la vallée / 1844)","• Mais, Camille, je viens de reconnaître la vérité","des critiques dont vous vous êtes plainte","quelquefois. ( Balzac H. de / Beatrix / 1845)","d) Compound tense (negative form)","• ...Et je ne me suis jamais plaint ! (Balzac","Honoré de / La Muse du département / 1843)","• ...j’ai murmuré, écrivait Pauline, mais je ne me","suis pas plainte, Raphael ! (Balzac H.de / La","Peau de chagrin / 1831)","","This grammar can, of course, be completed for finding the verb plaindre in interrogative and interro-negative constructions. It is also possible to use parameters, allowing this grammar to be used for any verb.","3.2.2. Enumerations and Repetitions (in POS-annotated Frantext)","Some writers use lists of items (adjectives on the left of a noun, adverbs, etc..). It is possible to detect and extract them with a Stella grammar. See below an example of parametrable grammar to be used to spot these various enumerations:","","[The \"item\" rule defines the textual item which is going to be repeated. It contains two parameters : &1 et &2 which will be replaced by their real corresponding value when invoking the rule.","For example:","1) &ritem(en,S) invokes the item rule, passing it \"en\" et \"S\" as parameters. The item rule will then be equivalent to \"en &e(g=S)\" which means \"en\" followed by a noun.","2) &ritem(,A) invokes the item rule passing it a first empty parameter and \"A\" as a second parameter. The item rule becomes equivalent to \"&e(g=A)\" which corresponds to an adjective.]","item :","&1 &e(g=&2)","","[The \"repetition\" rule says that the textual item must be repeated twice (sub-expression \"&ritem(&1,&2) , &ritem(&1,&2)\" ) plus a number (greater than or equal to 1) of times (sub-expression \"&+(, &ritem(&1,&2))\" ). So, the item must be repeated 3 times or more.","This rule allows the user to search a textual item being repeated at least three times with an inserted comma between them.]","repetition :","&ritem(&1,&2), &ritem(&1,&2) &+(, &ritem(&1,&2))","","In order to use this grammar (called for instance G2) the user will invoke the \"repetition\" rule passing it the two parameters which will thus be transmitted to the \"item\" rule. Here are some results obtained by this grammar on a corpus of some texts of Victor Hugo:","","&rrepetition(,A),G2 finds : \" sublime, simple, divers, profond, mystérieux, intime, fugitif\" (Les Feuilles d’automne); \"géographiques, politiques, moraux, intellectuels\" (Notre-Dame de Paris) ; \"ingrats, méchants, menteurs, jaloux\" (Les Rayons et les Ombres), etc.","&rrepetition(en,S),G2 finds : \"en musique, en mystère, en effroi \" (Les Quatre vents de l’esprit) ; \"en marbre, en granit, en jaspe, en porphyre, en velours, en satin, en pourpre, en drap\" (Le Rhin) ; \"en style, en art, en conscience, en idéal\" (Correspondance 1849-1866), etc.","&rrepetition(,V),G2 finds : \"contemple, écoute, adore, aspire\" (Les Feuilles d’automne) ; \"flotte, ondule, bondit, tourbillonne\" (Notre-Dame de Paris) ; \"va, vient, rugit, hurle, mord\" (Les Contemplations), \"montait, descendait, lavait, brossait, frottait, balayait, courait, trimait, haletait, remuait.\" (Les Misérables) etc.","","These two sample grammars intend to prove that all linguists, whether they are interested in syntax, semantics, or in stylistic researches can have a rather easy access to our resources, and find a real benefit in consulting them."]},{"title":"3.3.
