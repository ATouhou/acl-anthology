New York University 715 Broadway, 7th Floor New York, NY 10003-6806 macleod@cs.nyu.edu","Abstract New York University has produced a dictionary of nominalizations (NOMLEX) whose entries capture the relationship of the nominalization with its associated verb. This dictionary indicates where the verbal arguments may be found in the noun phrase which contains the nominalization. We have now made a study and produced some entries for nominalizations and their co-occurring verbs. These entries are much more complex than NOMLEX entries. In order to express all the relationships between the nominalization and its co-occurring verb, we made use of the terminology of Igor Mel’ĉuk, whose theories have been used to create dictionaries in French and Russian. His categories were found to be very useful for this task. The verb + nominalization pairs were selected by frequency of co-occurrence and thus do not strictly conform to what are considered support verbs. Support verbs are generally defined as having no semantic content, serving only to carry tense and number which the nominalization cannot express. A typical example of this is “commit a murder”. The paper below describes the NOMLEX entry which is the basis of this work and then demonstrates the additional information needed to describe the verb + nominalization pair."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["New York University (NYU) developed NOMLEX, a dictionary containing 1,000 entries of nominalizations, with detailed information about their arguments. This dictionary is publicly available at the NYU Proteus website: http://cs.nyu.edu/cs/projects/proteus/nomlex/index.html. Given the frequency with which support verbs combine with nominalizations in ways that can only be interpreted by specific lexical information, we have developed an extension to NOMLEX to cover support verbs (and other co-occurring verbs). Support verbs are those verbs which are definedas having no semantic content, serving only to carry tense and number as Maurice Gross definesit (Gross, 1981) p.17. The following examples demonstrate this generally accepted view of support verbs: “he took a walk” he walked; “the y made a decision” they decided; “she made a discovery” she discovered. Below we will describe how the information is captured in our dictionaries. Since the nominalization support verb entries are based on the original NOMLEX entries we will briefly outline what is contained in those entries."]},{"title":"2. NOMLEX Entries","paragraphs":["The notation that had been used for NOMLEX (Macleod et al., 1997) was a quite complicated two part entry with the main arguments of the associated verb being handled differently from the oblique complements. The “main” arguments of the verb (subject, object, direct object) may occur as possessive pronouns, pre-noun noun modifiers,and post-noun prepositional phrases (most often with “of ”). The oblique complements of the verb occur post-noun either unchanged or introduced by a preposition. Figure 1 is a typical NOMLEX entry. In this particular entry, the subject of the verb (VERB-SUBJ) may appear as a prepositional phrase where the preposition is “from” (“the inquiry from Bob”/ Bob inquires), as a noun-noun modifier (“the White House inquiry”/the White House inquires) or a possesive determiner (“Mary’ s inquiry”/Mary inquires). The type of this particular nominalization is VERB-NOM which refers to the fact some nominalizations behave very verbally and can appear with many if not all of the verbal complements. Other possible NOM-TYPEs are (Subject) and (Object); these have one of the verbal arguments absorbed by the nominalization. For example, “teacher” (Subject) and “draftee” (Object).","In the entry, information is also given on the complements of the associated verb which can occur also with the nominalization. The verbal information comes from COMLEX, a large syntactic dictionary, also created by the Proteus group at NYU (Macleod et al., 1998) and (Grishman et al., 1994). The complements are prefixed by “NOM” to make clear that these are now being treated as nominalization complements.The complement NOM-PP-P-WH-S consists of a prepositional phrase (PP) followed by a preposition (P), a wh-word (WH) and a sentence (S). This complement occurs unchanged on both the verb and the nominalization, as in, “John inquired of his tour guide about whether they would arrive on time.” and “John’ s inquiry of his tour guide about whether they would arrive on time [sounded whiney]”."]},{"title":"3. Complexity of the multi-word entry","paragraphs":["The multi-word nominalization entries were based on the NOMLEX entries and thus also on the COMLEX verb entries. There was an attempt made to adapt the original NOMLEX notation for the multi-word entries, but it be-came very dense and difficultboth to enter and to read. The added presence of the support verb made the entry much more complex. Information was now needed to identify the role the nominalization plays with regard to the support verb . It can occur as subject or object of the support verb or as an oblique object where the nominalization occurs in a prepositional phrase; see Table 1.","It was also necessary to state whether the verb was a","(NOM :ORTH \"inquiry\"",":VERB \"inquire\"",":PLURAL \"inquiries\"",":SPELLING \"American\"",":PLURAL-FREQ \"not rare\"",":NOM-TYPE ((VERB-NOM))",":VERB-SUBJ ((PP :PVAL (\"from\")) (N-N-MOD) (DET-POSS))",":SUBJ-ATTRIBUTE ((COMMUNICATOR))",":VERB-SUBC ((NOM-P-WH-S :PVAL (\"about\")) (NOM-PP-P-WH-S :SUBJECT ((DET-POSS)","(N-N-MOD))",":PVAL (\"about\")",":PVAL1 (\"of\" \"from\")) (NOM-P-POSSING :PVAL (\"about\")) (NOM-PP-PP :SUBJECT ((DET-POSS)","(N-N-MOD))",":PVAL (\"about\")",":PVAL2 (\"from\" \"of\") (NOM-PP :PVAL (\"after\"","\"about\"","\"into\")) (NOM-INTRANS :SUBJECT ((DET-POSS)","(PP :PVAL (\"from\")))))) Figure 1: NOMLEX Entry Role Example Subject: The destruction took place last year Object: He took a long walk Oblique: They accepted her for admission Table 1: Nominalization Roles “true” support verb (like “mak e” in “mak e a decision”) or whether it had some semantic content (as in “bring” “the y brought an action against him” where it has a temporal as-pect). In searching for a better type of notation we settled on Mel’ĉuk’s lexical function notation, which suited our purpose admirably."]},{"title":"4. Multi-word entries using Mel’ĉuk’s lexical functions","paragraphs":["For our multi-word entries we took two parts of Mel’ĉuk’s notation (Mel’ĉuk, 1996) and (Mel’ĉuk, 1988), his deep syntactic representation and some of his functions. We augmented these as necessary, from Thierry Fontenelle’s work (Fontenelle, 1995) and our own.","Mel’ĉuk’s syntactic representation seemed particularly adapted for use in expanding NOMLEX coverage to nominalization phrases. First his terminology indicates what syntactic relationship the nominalization has with the co-occurring verb. These are oper(i), func(i) and labor(i,j). Oper(i) specifiesthat the nominalization occur as the direct object of the verb. A subscript (i=1,2) indicates whether the subject of the main verb is also the subject of the nominalization or the object of the nominalization. For example, in the sentence “He paid a visit to Jane.” the combination “pay” “(a) visit” would be marked “oper(1)”. “He” is the subject of both “pay” and “visit”, i.e. “he visited”. On the other hand, “He had a visit from Jane” is oper(2), since the subject of the main verb is the object of “visit”, i.e. Jane visits him. These verbs (“pay” and “ha ve”) are true support verbs, in that they share at least one argument with the nominalization, and they express no semantic content in themselves. They serve only to express number and tense. In our notation, we refer to these verbs as “transp” because they are transparent as to semantics.","Func(i) describes a nominalization that occurs as the subject of the main verb. Examples: “the accusation came from John.” is func(1): John accuses (someone). “The accusation names John.” is func(2): (Someone) accuses John.","Labor(i,j) is assigned to a main verb plus nominalization where the nominalization occurs as the oblique complement of the main verb. Because of this, there are two subscripts to stand for the main verb subject position (i) and the main verb object position (j). For example, “He subjected John to an interrogation.” represents labor(1,2). The subject of the main verb is “He” which is the subject of “interrogate”, the object of the main verb is “John” which is also the object of “interrogate”. The sentence can be in-terpteted as “He interrogated John”.","We added another term to describe the reciprocal relationship, operrecip(i+i). “John and Mary traded insults.” would be marked (operrecip(1+1)) that is, “Mary and John insulted each other.”","Other Mel’ĉuk functions that we made use of in our notation (besides Transp) can be seen in Table 2.","We added or changed functions like the expansion of Mel’ĉuk’s antifact into three different classes, see Table 2 at the end.","If the entry has no lex-func listed, it is unclassified,not transparent. For example, “appro ve” and “license” in the entry for “authorization” are listed simply as (oper1) with no other function.","Although this is still a syntactic dictionary, we were forced to take sense distinctions into consideration, since the selection of support or co-occurring verbs is dependent on the senses of the nominalization. “Admission” meaning “allo wing entry to a place”, co-occurs with verbs like “of-fer”, “grant”, “den y”, “refuse”, “accept”; while the “admission” meaning “mak e a statement that some fact is true”, selects the support verb “mak e” and the collocate verb plus preposition “come from”. This is an interesting syntactic test for the division of senses. It is “real” because the selection of the verb forces one of two different readings of the noun."]},{"title":"5. NOMLEX2 Entries","paragraphs":["We analyzed 20 nominalizations completely and they are the basis for what we call our NOMLEX2 lexicon. We hope over time to expand our coverage. This project was mainly to ascertain whether a lexicon of this sort could be made. Figure 2 shows a NOMLEX2 entry that is typical of the multi-word “support” plus nominalization entries. The significant addition to NOMLEX are the support verbs (SUPP-V). As you can see, the particular support verb (SVERB#) can be one verb as in the transp example “mak e” or a list of similar verbs as in the antifact2 example “den y” “reject” “contest” “fight” etc. Each SVERB (or group) has a LEX-FUNC label with the exception noted above. The LEX-FUNC establishes the role that the nominalzation plays in regard to the support verb. The subcategory defineswhether the SVERB is transparent or has some “meaning” connected with it."]},{"title":"6. Method","paragraphs":["We made a selection of verbs which co-occurred with the particular nominalization frequently. We used Dekang Lin’s Collocation (Dependency) Database (Lin, 1995) which provided us with frequency information on the support plus nominalization pairs. Had the database been larger we would have raised the minimum frequency. As it is, some verbs were allowed that probably would not have been considered with a larger data base. We erred on the side of over-selection of co-occurring verbs, reasoning that we could always make finercuts and eliminate certain verbs but it would be much more complicated to add to the entries afterwards. We also consulted the British National Corpus, and a combination of the Brown and Wall Street Journal corpus."]},{"title":"7. Conclusion","paragraphs":["Mel’ĉuk’s classes have, to our knowledge, been applied to lexicons in French(Mel’ĉuk, 1984) and Russian (Mel’ĉuk and Xolodoviĉ, 1984). We show that they are very useful when adapted to English. We chose a group of nominalizations from NOMLEX. We have done 20 nominalizations, of which 8 were divided for different senses. Therefore, in the nominalization with support verbs dictionary NOMLEX2, we have 28 entries containing 158 support verbs or verb groups. We found that this type of entry was slow but replicable. Three different lexicographers worked on the entries and they were in agreement most of the time on how to assign the classes. Therefore, we feel that the decision to use Mel’ĉuk’s work was a good one and we have seen that the creation of a multi-word dictionary is a doable project."]},{"title":"8.
