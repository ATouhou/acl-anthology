Introduction ","paragraphs":["Rapid changes in specialised areas, such as molecular biology (MB), computer science, telecommunications, etc. result in a vast and constantly increasing amount of knowledge represented via documents. The fast growth of electronic text collections demands innovative techniques to access, gather and systematically structure information. In order to discover knowledge, one has to identify the main concepts, which are linguistically represented by domain specific terms (Maynard et al., 2001). In the specialised fields, there is an increased amount of new terms that represent newly created concepts. Since existing term dictionaries, standardised terminologies, nomenclatures, ontologies, and other language resources offer only a partial solution to the needs of specialists, the automatic term extraction tools are indispensable for efficient knowledge discovery and dynamic update of the language resources (Ananiadou et al., 2001).","There are numerous approaches to the automatic term recognition. Some methods (Bourligault, 1992; Ananiadou, 1994) rely purely on linguistic information, namely morpho-syntactic features of term candidates. Recently, hybrid approaches combining linguistic and statistical knowledge are becoming increasingly used (Frantzi et. al, 2000; Nakagawa et al., 1998; Maynard et al., 2001). (Hatzivassiloglou et al., 2001) used a statistically based machine learning technique to acquire and disambiguate specific terms in MB (e.g. protein and gene names).","The naming conventions in many domains (especially in MB) are highly non-standardised even when it comes to the fundamental concepts. In theory, terms should be mono-referential (one-to-one correspondence between terms and concepts), but in practice we have to deal with (semantic) ambiguities (the same term corresponds to many concepts) and variants (many terms leading to the same concept). For example, the term gene has at least two meanings (senses) within the domain of MB (MBO, 2002):"," 1) a DNA fragment transcribed and translated into a","protein, and 2) a DNA region that carries genetic phenotype.","","On the other hand, all the following variants: nuclear factor-kappa B, NF-kappaB, NF kappa B, NF(kappa)B, kappaB, NFKB factor, NF-KB, NF kB, etc. denote the same concept described as a transcription factor involved in immune responses, inflammation and cell proliferation (MBO, 2002).","Dealing with term sense disambiguation is crucial for classifying terms and ontology populating (Bisson et al., 2000). The appropriate term sense is usually discovered by examining the similarity between the given term and its context (Nenadic et al., 2002). However, there is classificatory ambiguity as well, since one concept can be classified in more than one way depending on the point of view. We refer to this fact as term multi-dimensionality.","If we aim at supporting systematic acquisition and structuring of domain-specific knowledge, then handling term variation has to be treated as an essential part of terminology retrieval. Term variation ranges from simple orthographic variation to semantic variation. For example, (Jacquemin, 2001) processes morphological and syntactic variations by means of meta-rules used to describe term normalisation, while semantic variants are handled using WordNet. In this paper, we propose a framework for effective term variation management in a specific domain. In particular, we address acronyms as a common type of term variation. We present a method for the automatic acquisition of newly introduced acronyms and their mapping to the respective terms.","The paper is organised as follows: in Section 2 we briefly discuss the term variation problems related to the automatic term recognition. In Section 3 we present our approach to the automatic acquisition of acronyms in the domain of molecular biology. Section 4 presents a framework for incorporating term variants into the term recognition process. The experiments and evaluation are given in Section 5.",""]},{"title":"2. Handling term variations ","paragraphs":["In an attempt to name the newly discovered concepts, scientists often use some predefined naming patterns, that is - term formation usually follows some planned, conscious efforts. There are even some formal naming standardisation initiatives: e.g. the Guidelines for Human Gene Nomenclature (Lander et al., 2001) establish a naming convention for new gene names, including principles such as avoiding molecular weight designations, starting a name with a lower case letter, obligatory American spelling, etc. However, this does not prevent ad hoc naming solutions (e.g. a gene known as Bride of sevenless or BOSS). Domain experts frequently introduce specific notations for terms that they use either locally (in a paper) or within a whole community.","In addition to loose naming conventions, a considerable terminological confusion arises from the following problems:"," a) Term variation: the same concept is named","differently in different sources (e.g. TIF2, TIF-2,","transcription intermediary factor-2, and","transcriptional intermediate factor 2 all","denote the same concept). ","b) Term ambiguity: the same term may refer to different concepts, the intended sense being context dependent (e.g. the acronym GR is a short form for both an enzyme (glutathione reductase) and a nuclear receptor (glucocorticoid receptor)).","","Term variation and ambiguity are causing problems not only for automatic knowledge acquisition but for human experts as well. Therefore, there is a genuine need for the standardisation of terminology (White et al., 1998).","In our work, we concentrate on term variation management as opposed to term ambiguity resolution. A variety of sources from which the term variation problems stem are considered. In particular, we deal with orthographical, morphological, syntactic, lexico-semantic and pragmatic phenomena. Our approach to the term variation management is based on term normalisation as an integral part of the automatic term recognition (ATR) process. Term variants are dealt with in the initial phase of ATR when term candidates are singled out. More details about the way in which the ATR process is performed and how term variations are incorporated into this process are given in Section 4.","The following subsections will briefly overview the main types of term variation. Especially, acronyms, as a special type of term variation, are discussed separately in Section 3."]},{"title":"2.1. Orthographical variations ","paragraphs":["This type of variation is very common in certain domains, especially in MB. The simplest orthographical variations include optional usage of hyphens, different cases (lower/upper) and different (standard) spellings (e.g. American and British English: tumour vs. tumor). In order to manage these variations all term candidates are mapped to their normalised forms, which in our approach are lower-case forms without hyphens. In addition, different Latin/Greek transcriptions and neoclassical compoundings are very frequent in the MB domain, e.g.:","","leukaemia vs. leukaemia","oestrogen vs. estrogen","amyloid beta-protein vs. amyloid ββββ–protein","vs. amyliod b-protein"," Different Latin/Greek transcriptions are converted to their normalised forms according to a manually collected mapping list (e.g. ae → e, oe → e, β → B, beta → B, etc.). In order to recognise specific transcriptions, we used a set of morphological constraints for the distribution of neoclassical roots and affixes as explained in the previous work (Ananiadou, 1994).","An additional orthographical phenomenon in MB is the usage of specific “mathematical” words and/or symbols (e.g. +, plus or positive). These symbols can be used interchangeably (e.g. ER positive or ER+). In our approach, we normalise such term candidates by replacing “mathematical” words with the corresponding symbols."]},{"title":"2.2. Morphological variations ","paragraphs":["This type of variation is common in many domains. The simplest morphological variations include the usage of plural, singular and possessive noun forms, e.g.: ","nuclear receptor vs. nuclear receptors","Down syndrome vs. Down’s syndrome"," Since currently used taggers are fairly accurate in recognising such linguistic phenomena, we rely on their output and define a normalised term form as a singular form containing no possessives.","In addition to the mentioned variants, derivational variations are also present (e.g. intermediary factor vs. intermediate factor). They can be handled by stemming, but at this stage we do not normalise terms to their stemmed forms. The main reason is a difference between ‘active’ and ‘passive’ forms of modifiers (e.g. activated factor vs. activating factor), which are usually used to denote different terms."]},{"title":"2.3. Syntactic variations ","paragraphs":["The simplest syntactic variations include structural differences in possessive usage of nouns (with or without a preposition), e.g.:","In our approach, we handle these syntactic variants when applying linguistic filters, which are used to describe term clones of human vs. human clones cancer in humans vs"]},{"title":".","paragraphs":["human cancer candidates (see Section 4). The filters that produce normalised variants are implemented via transformations represented by unification-like LR(1) rules (Mima et al., 1995). Here is an example of a rule describing the transformation of a term candidate that contains the preposition of:  ;Aof B → BA Term -> (A|Noun)* Noun PREP(of) (A|Noun)* Noun","(x0 next1) = x5","(x0 next2) = x4","(x0 next3) = x1","(x0 next4) = x2"," In our approach, the normalised forms do not contain prepositions.  The coordination of terms is also commonly used variation","phenomena in MB. We differentiate between two main types","of term coordination: ","a) Argument coordination: term arguments are coordinated, thus the coordinated terms are retrieved by “multiplying” the arguments with the shared head:  SMRT and Trip-1 mRNAs SMRT mRNA"]},{"title":"→{","paragraphs":["Trip-1 mRNA","b) Head coordination: term heads are coordinated, thus the coordinated terms are retrieved by “multiplying” the heads with the shared arguments:  adrenal glands and gonads adrenal glands"]},{"title":"→{","paragraphs":["adrenal gonads","We supported the two coordination types by the LR(1) rules (Mima et al., 1995), which generate candidate terms when a coordinated structure is recognised. Note that the generated term candidates are not necessarily correct terms, as the syntactic filters describing a coordinated structure are ambiguous:1","the same filter retrieves both coordinated terms and conjunctions of terms (in which case the “multiplication” would give incorrect results) as presented in Table 1. In order to reduce the number of incorrectly recognised coordinated structures, the “multiplied” forms are not treated as term candidates unless they appear in a corpus on their own."," syntactic filter Adj Noun and Noun example adrenal glands and gonads head coordination [adrenal [glands and gonads]] term conjunction [adrenal glands] and [gonads] Table 1: Syntactic ambiguities of coordinated structures","","The problem of more complex syntactic variations, involving more than one type of the described syntactic variations, remains open. For example, prepositional phrases are often combined with coordinated structures, e.g.:"," 1 We have tested coordination generation implemented in our approach, and the overall precision was 70%.","mechanism of steroid/thyroid receptor","↓","mechanism of steroid receptor","mechanism of thyroid receptor","↓ steroid receptor mechanism thyroid receptor mechanism This problem demands further investigation on “precedence” between certain syntactic transformations (in the above example, coordination has a priority over preposition)."]},{"title":"2.4. Lexico-semantic variations ","paragraphs":["Lexico-semantic variations include the usage of synonyms in the process of assigning names to concepts:","","carcinoma vs. cancer","eye surgery vs. ophthalmologic surgery"," In our approach, this type of variants is handled by using a dictionary of synonyms, whose entries consist of a preferred term and a list of its synonyms. The preferred forms are used to normalise terms.","We do not consider other types of semantic variants as part of the term recognition process: e.g. although nucleic acid-binding and DNA-binding are semantically related as DNA is a hyponym of nucleic acids, we do not consider the latter as a term variant of the former as we deal with synonyms only. However, this type of semantic term variation can be useful for term classification and clustering (Jacquemin, 2001)."]},{"title":"3. Acronym acquisition ","paragraphs":["Acronyms are a very common term variation phenomenon in MB. They can be regarded both as lexico-semantic and pragmatic term variants. In the lexico-semantic sense, acronyms are used as synonyms for the corresponding terms (these terms will be referred as expanded forms). In the pragmatic sense, acronyms are used to facilitate the readability of scientific texts.","In the field of MB, domain experts frequently introduce specific acronyms, which are used either locally (in a paper) or within the whole community. Analogously to the problems of variants and ambiguities for terms in general, acronyms are afflicted with the similar problems arising from the following points:"," a) Acronym variation: the same term may have several","acronyms (e.g. NF kappa B, NF kB). b) Acronym ambiguity: the same acronym may refer to","different concepts (GR is an abbreviation for both","glucocorticoid receptor and glutathione","reductase).","","In our approach to acronym acquisition we deal with acronym variation problems only. The acronym acquisition is a part of ATR: each (candidate) acronym occurrence is replaced with the corresponding expanded form prior to the statistical analysis. This way, all term occurrences are considered for calculation of term-hood.","The problem of acronym ambiguity can be simply resolved by using the lastly introduced acronym definition, if there is one. If there is no definition introduced, then general methods for term disambiguation have to be used (Spasic et al., 2002)."]},{"title":"3.1. Method ","paragraphs":["Our three-step method for acronym acquisition is based on both morphological and syntactic features of acronyms and their expanded forms. We rely on syntactic patterns that are used predominantly to introduce acronyms in scientific papers in order to locate potential acronym definitions. Once a word sequence matching such a pattern is retrieved, it is morphologically analysed with the aim of discovering the relation between the acronym and its expanded form. 3.1.1. Retrieval of acronym definitions","","In the first step, we scan the text for the candidate acronym definitions. Several definition patterns have been identified manually in order to describe different contexts for introducing an acronym. We differentiate between two general types of acronym definitions:"," a) left definition: an acronym follows its expanded form","(e.g. 9-cis retinoic acid (9cRA));","","b) right definition: an acronym is followed by its","expanded form (e.g. MIBP (Myc-intron-binding","peptide))."," Left definitions are far more frequent (more then 90% of all acronym definitions). In both cases, acronyms are introduced either by bracketing (e.g. tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) or glutathione peroxidase [GPx]) or rarely by using apposition-like format (e.g. ... enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, ELISA,...). The definition patterns have been modelled by local grammars (Gross, 1989) and applied at the position in the text where a potential acronym is introduced in order to retrieve an acronym and its expanded form. Usually, the extracted context was wider than the actual acronym definition.","However, there are contexts seemingly introducing an acronym, although they provide no syntactic evidence (in the form of brackets or appositions) for that fact (e.g. heat shock protein Hsp90). Such contexts were not considered as acronym definitions in our approach."," 3.1.2. Matching acronyms against expanded forms","","In the second step of the acronym acquisition procedure, a set of acronym formation patterns is applied in order to match a candidate expanded form with the corresponding acronym. In general, acronyms are formed by selecting first (or first few) letters of the words from the expanded form. However, it has been noticed in the MB domain that the initial letters of combining forms are also used for the same purpose. Combining forms are specific affixes (mostly prefixes and infixes, e.g. acetyl, trans, di, hydro, etc.) that are regularly used in term","formation patterns (e.g. chloramphenicol","acetyltransferase (CAT)). A dictionary of domain-","specific combining forms is used when matching an","acronym against the expanded form. The basic matching method between acronyms and","their expanded forms is augmented by taking into account","the following phenomena related to acronym definitions: ","- insertion: a word is present in the expanded form of an acronym, but it is not used in the formation of the acronym (e.g. thyroid hormone receptor (TR));","- omission: a word is missing from the expanded form of an acronym, although it is used when forming the acronym (e.g. [human] estrogen receptor (hER));","- plural acronym: a plural form acronym is defined (e.g. retinoid Xreceptors (RXRs));","- recursive acronym: the expanded form of an acronym already contains an abbreviation/acronym (e.g. CREB-binding protein (CBP));","- coordinated acronyms: acronyms are defined within a coordinated structure (e.g. estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptors);","- partial acronym: an acronym contains a part of its expanded form, usually Greek/Latin words (e.g. retinoid Xreceptor alpha (RXR alpha));","- structural variation: an acronym is defined after a morphological/structural transformation is conducted on its expanded form (e.g. day of hatching (HD));","- formula-like acronym: an acronym contains (a part of) a chemical formula (e.g. 1alpha,25dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3]).","","The listed phenomena are considered when the basic matching method (matching acronym letters against constituents and combining forms) has not produced a positive result. Finally, this step results in a list of matched acronyms and their definitions. 3.1.3. Acronym clustering","","In order to address the problem of acronym variation, in the third step we attempt to establish the classes of variants that correspond to the same concept. First, both acronyms and their expanded forms are normalised with respect to their orthographic, morphological, syntactic and lexico-semantic features (see subsections 2.1 — 2.4). In particular, the plural acronyms (e.g. NRs (nuclear receptors)) are matched with the corresponding singular acronym (NR (nuclear receptor)). All acronyms that share a normalised expanded form constitute an acronym cluster.","","The experiments and evaluation of the acronym acquisition method are presented in Section 5.",""]},{"title":"4. Incorporating term variants into ATR ","paragraphs":["The term variation recognition and acronym acquisition have been embedded in the terminology management workbench ATRACT (Mima, 2001) as part of the term recognition process. Our approach to the term variation management is based on term normalisation as an integral part of the ATR process. The ATR method is based on the C/NC-value method (Frantzi et al., 2000). It is a hybrid approach combining linguistic knowledge (term formation patterns), statistics (frequency of occurrence and frequency of occurrence within other term candidates) and contextual information. The method extracts multi-word terms and is implemented as a three-step procedure. In the first step, tem candidates are extracted by using a set of linguistic filters. The filters describe general term formation patterns and are implemented as unification-like LR(1) rules (Mima et al., 1995). In the second step, the term candidates are assigned the C-values, also referred to as term-hoods, according to formula (1). The contexts of the term candidates are examined in the third step in order to assign context factors to them and to rank the candidates accordingly.","The term variants are handled in the first step of the described procedure, i.e. during the process of the term candidate acquisition. Each term variant occurrence recognised in this step is normalised, and specifically for acronyms this means that their occurrences are mapped to their normalised expanded forms.2","Term variants having the same normalised form are then grouped into classes in order to link each term candidate to all of its variants. This way, a list of normalised term candidate classes, rather than a list of single terms, is passed as input to the second step. The term-hood is then calculated for the whole class according to the following formula:  2 Although term occurrences are normalised, all variants (i.e. their surface forms) are recorded in order to facilitate fast retrieval from a corpus.   In the previous formula, a denotes a normalised representative of a class, f(a) corresponds to the cumulative frequency with which all term variants from the class occur in a given corpus, |a| denotes the length of the normalised form (the number of its constituents), and Ta is a set of all classes that contain normalised form a as a nested term. After assigning context factors in the third step, term classes are ranked and the candidates having term-hoods higher than a given threshold are accepted as terms. This approach guarantees that all term variants are naturally dealt with jointly, thus supporting the fact that they denote the same concept.","Once term variants are recognised automatically, they can be managed manually within the ATRACT workbench, as users can add/remove variants or variant occurrences. For example, Figure 1 shows term variants represented in a text, while Figure 2 presents a sample resulting list of terms and their variants, which can be edited by a user."]},{"title":"     − ⋅ =− ∑","paragraphs":["∈"]},{"title":"otherwise (1) )),( || 1 )((||log nested,not is ),(||log )(","paragraphs":["2 2","a a Tb"]},{"title":"bf T afa aafa avalueC","paragraphs":["Figure 1: Sample of term variants recognised in the text ","Figure 2: Sample of terms and term variants automatically recognised  "]},{"title":"5.

For a larger corpus, precision rose to 99%.","The automatic support for handling term variations can be used for semi-automatic update of the existing language resources. For example, the recognised term variants can be used to populate term dictionaries. Term variants unification and normalisation also provides a broader basis for IR and IE tasks, as queries can be expanded by referring to a class of synonymous terms as opposed to a single term. Any other term-centred tasks, such as classification and clustering of terms, can rely on the unified term variants in order to enhance statistically based procedures or to provide the wider context for specific term analysis.","Although our work is placed within the MB domain, the approach can be easily adapted and applied to other domains. The future work on this subject will include a study on derivational term variants, the improvement of recall by covering additional types of acronym definitions, and possibly the application of the method to other domains. In addition to improving the automatic handling of term variations, we also plan to investigate the problems of term sense disambiguation.","","","Acknowledgment","","We would like to thank Dr Hideki Mima (University of Tokyo) and Kostas Manios (University of Salford) for software support, and Dr. Sylvie Albert (LION BioScience) for the evaluation of results.","",""]},{"title":"7.
