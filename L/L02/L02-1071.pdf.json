Introduction","paragraphs":["Although Dutch is among the world’s best studied languages, very little is known about spoken Dutch, as most linguistic studies deal with written variants of the language. The Spoken Dutch Corpus (“Corpus Gesproken Nederlands” or CGN) is meant to change this. It is a Dutch-Flemish project (1998-2003) aiming at the collection, description and annotation of ten million words of spoken Dutch, two thirds from the Netherlands, one third from the Dutch speaking part of Belgium (Oostdijk, 2000; Oostdijk et al., 2002).1","After enriching the speech data with an orthographic transcription, a firstlayer of linguistic annotation concerns the assignment of base forms and morphosyntactic tags to all words of the corpus (Van Eynde et al., 2000).","A second layer deals with the syntactic analysis. This is carried out for a subcorpus of one million words only, as this type of annotation turns out to be much more time-consuming than e.g. Part-of-Speech-tagging or lemmatisation. The reasons for this difference are threefold. At the beginning of the project,"," there was no such thing as a tool which can automatically parse spoken Dutch sentences with an acceptable degree of quality;"," there was no syntactically annotated corpus of spoken Dutch which could be used as a learning corpus for a statistics based general purpose automatic parser in order to develop such a thing;"," there was no formalised grammar of spoken Dutch: formal analyses of many constructions found in the spoken variants of the language only were simply lacking. Therefore a considerable amount of time was spent writing a syntactic annotation manual (Moortgat et al., 2002),","1","The research reported on here was supported by the project “Spok en Dutch Corpus” (CGN-project) which is funded by the Netherlands Organisation for ScientificResearch (NWO) and the Flemish Government. developing and testing tag sets (Hoekstra et al., 2001), establishing a manually annotated corpus for bootstrapping purposes, etc.","The output of the process of syntactic annotation is a set of dependency trees which are aimed to be as theory neutral as possible (Skut et al., 1997), sticking rather closely to traditional Dutch syntactic analysis as exemplified by the large ANS grammar (Haeseryn and others, 1997). In our view, this is the best way to serve as many potential users as possible: these dependency trees are input to other modules producing data structures useful to users from various theoretical backgrounds and with various practical aims (Hoekstra et al., 2001; Moortgat and Moot, 2001).","This paper consists of two parts. In the firstpart, some details of the annotation philosophy and the tag sets used are given. In the second part, we discuss some examples of ways in which this annotated corpus can enrich (and has already enriched) our knowledge of and insight into some of the pecularities of spoken Dutch."]},{"title":"2. The annotation process 2.1. Background","paragraphs":["Input for the syntactic annotation is a POS-tagged orthographic transcription of the primary sound files. The material is segmented in annotation units. A real life example of such a unit is given in (1).2","(1) ik I zal will u you gaan go uitleggen explain hoe how we we dat that zo’n such-a beetje bit hebben have aangepakt tackled dat that","probleem.","problem.","‘I will explain to you how we more or less tackled it,","that problem’ An example of a POS-tagged unit is shown in Table 1. The leftmost column has the complete sentence in a one word per line manner, the middle column contains the POS-information (main category in caps, features within brackets), the last column has the lexical lemmas. 2","For expository purposes, we have picked a short 14-word unit. Real life annotation units are anywhere between one and more than 150 words. ","au id=1 t=0.000 sp=N00052 ik VNW(pers,pron,nomin,vol,1,ev) ik zal WW(pv,tgw,ev) zullen u VNW(pers,pron,nomin,vol,2b,getal) u gaan WW(inf,vrij,zonder) gaan uitleggen WW(inf,vrij,zonder) uitleggen hoe BW() hoe we VNW(pers,pron,nomin,red,1,mv) we dat VNW(aanw,pron,stan,vol,3o,ev) dat zo’n VNW(aanw,det,stan,prenom,zonder,agr) zo’n beetje N(soort,ev,basis,onz,stan) beetje hebben WW(pv,tgw,mv) hebben aangepakt WW(vd,vrij,zonder) aanpakken dat VNW(aanw,det,stan,prenom,zonder,evon) dat probleem N(soort,ev,basis,onz,stan) probleem . LET() . Table 1: POS-tagged input The first line of the input fragment in Table 1 shows a","unique reference to a CGN soundfile.The second line states","that the element ik (‘I’) is a pronoun, to wit, a personal","pronoun, nominative case, non-reduced form, first person","singular, the lexicon entry form of which is ik, etc.3 The actual POS-tagging is done in a way comparable","to the syntactic annotation, viz., semi-automatically: the","output of an ensemble of automatic taggers, using some 300","different morphosyntactic tags and with an accuracy around","95%, is checked and corrected by hand (Van Eynde et al.,","2000; Van Eynde, 2001). Table 2 gives an example of the kind of syntactic anal-","ysis that is generated for sentence (1) within the CGN","project. It illustrates some prominent features of the CGN","annotation:"," The annotation is a dependency structure and not a constituent structure or functional structure. The resulting object is therefore not a classical tree structure, but a graph. In such a graph, branches may cross and daughters may have more than one mother."," The dependency relations are independent of surface word order and constituency. For example, the verb uitleggen ‘explain’ selects for a direct object (taking the form of an embedded question in this case) marked OBJ1, and an indirect object u ‘you’, marked OBJ2. In the surface string, however, u is between the main clause finiteverb zal ‘will’ (marked HD) and the auxiliary verb gaan ‘go’, the head of a verbal complement (VC), leading to crossing dependencies in the annotation graph."," The question word hoe ‘how’ has two mother nodes: it is both the head of the subordinate question WHSUB, and modifierof the participial group PPART, which it-self is embedded in that subordinate question. This 3","Apart from question marks, full stops and ellipsis marks (. . . ), no interpunction is added in the orthographic transcription. Note that interpunction does not play a role in the syntactic annotation. double function is expressed by the two dependency labels WHD and MOD that connect hoe with the mother nodes WHSUB and PPART.4"," “Right dislocation” and comparable phenomena are considered not to be part of syntax proper. The discourse relation between the main clause and the “mo ved” constituent dat probleem “that problem” is expressed by grouping these consituents under the label DU (for Discourse Unit) where they are assigned the dependency roles of NUCL and SAT, nucleus and satellite, respectively. If, in a later phase of the annotation process, anaphoric relations are going to be marked as well, a link may be made between the cataphoric pronominal element dat in the nucleus component, and the satellite full noun phrase dat probleem."," Interpunction, such as the full stop (which is inserted in the orthographic transcription) on the last line of Table 1, is left out of consideration within the syntactic annotation process.5 2.2. Implementation","For the actual annotation process, which is carried out in Leuven (for the Belgian part of the corpus) and Utrecht (for the Dutch part), the syntactic annotation tool Annotate, developed by DFKI Saarbruecken, is used (Plaehn, 1998; Brants, 1999). Developed for the annotation of written German newspaper text, it is now employed for the analysis of (the orthographic transcription of) spoken Dutch text. Therefore a completely different tagset had to be developed, which in its current form consists of 316 morphtags (i.e. the tags used by the POS tagging), 72 wordtags (in fact simplifiedPOS-tags) and some 100 tags for syntactic nodes and edges (Moortgat et al., 2002; Hoekstra et al., 2001). 4 In principle, it is even possible for an element or constituent","to fulfillmore than two roles. 5 We do not want to claim that interpunction is irrelevant from","a linguistic point of view (Nunberg, 1990), but it is definitelynot","part of the spoken language. 502 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 500 501 502 503 504 505 506 507 508 ik VNW1 T501a zal WW1 T301 u VNW1 U501j gaan WW4 T314 uitleggen WW4 T314 hoe BW T901 we VNW1 T501f dat VNW13 U524a zo’n VNW15 U528c beetje N1 T102 hebben WW2 T302 aangepakt WW5 T320 dat VNW15 U528a probleem N1 T102 DET HD DET HD OBJ1 NP MOD HD SU PPART VC HD WHD SSUB BODY OBJ2 HD WHSUB OBJ1 HD INF VC SU HD INF VC SMAIN NUCL NP SAT DU MOD Table 2: Sample analysis","The tags are the same for the Dutch and the Flemish part of the corpus. This makes the resulting annotated corpus of great importance not only to people interested in ‘general’ or ‘standard’ Dutch, but also to those wishing to study differences between the variants of Dutch spoken in the Netherlands and Belgium.","The Annotate tools are designed to work together with parsers supporting the manual annotation and running in the background via a definedinterface. In this phase of the project, we work with Thorsten Brants’s Cascaded Markov Models (CMMs) approach, which supports learning on the basis of an existing annotated corpus (a tree bank) (Brants, 1999). The CMM approach implements a bootstrapping strategy: starting off with a small corpus, using the hypotheses of the parser to gain speed and quality in manually annotating the next part, add this part to the corpus and let the program refineits hypotheses, and so forth. In practice, however, the statistics based parser turned out to be less useful for spontaneous spoken Dutch than was hoped for: a considerable part of the actual parsing is done by hand, and the output is checked and re-checked both with automatic tools and by hand again. In later phases of the project, the CMM approach will be used in combination with other parsers, so that we can integrate the rich information of the lexicon with the statistical approach."]},{"title":"3. Applications","paragraphs":["Many areas of the Dutch language are virtually unexplored. For example, grammatical analysis usually deals with written variants of the standard language – the aforementioned large ANS grammar (Haeseryn and others, 1997) is essentially still a prescriptive grammar of the written (van der Wouden, 1998). The Spoken Dutch Corpus is meant to help fillpart of this gap by supplying a large body of text for research in this largely unexplored area. In this section, we present some firstresults.","3.1. Application 1: textual differences between The Netherlands and Belgium","Inspired by (Biber, 1988), among others, we start with trying to finddifferences between the Dutch and the Flemish subparts. As we do not have any ideas regarding ‘typical’ or ‘standard’ values of what we count, we are more concerned with possible differences between interesting subparts of the corpus (cf. (van der Wouden et al., 2002)). However, we expect a direct correlation between the complexity of a text and its formality, that is to say: we expect the more formal texts to have higher average word length, sentence length, degree of sentence embedding, etc., than the less formal texts.","A few results with regard to such standard text properties, based on the 1 October 2001 version of the corpus, are given in Table 3.","The data in Table 3 all point in the same direction, viz., that the Dutch spoken in Belgium is somewhat more complex in terms of average word length, average sentence length and degree of sentence embedding. However, be-fore we jump to the conclusion that on the whole, Belgian spoken Dutch is more formal than Dutch spoken Dutch, we have to check whether the two subcorpora are completely comparable. It turns out that this is not exactly the case: for the time being, the Flemish part contains more material from the more formal text types (in an intuitive sense) than the Dutch part. In due time, this skewedness in the composition of the corpus will of course be corrected. Quantitative properties of two subcorpora of CGN (N=150194)","Netherlands Flanders N/B words 92631 57563 1,61 bytes 476793 311265 1,53 bytes/word 5,2 5,4 0,95 SMAIN 6529 3963 1,65 words/SMAIN 14,2 14,5 0,98 embedded tensed clauses 3523 2391 1,47 embedded tensed/SMAIN 0,54 0,60 0,89 Table 3: Textual differences between The Netherlands and Flanders","3.2. Application 2: textual differences between text","types The corpus metadata allow for other selections from the","corpus as well. We therefore proceed and investigate differ-","ences between four text types within the corpus, both from","the Netherlands and Belgium:  interviews (with teachers of Dutch);  parliamentary speeches (recordings of the Dutch “Tweede kamer” and the Flemish “Vlaamse raad”);  radio (various types of broadcasts);  spontaneous conversation (recorded especially for the CGN). As a starting hypothesis, we expect parliamentary speeches to be the most formal, spontaneous conversations the least formal, and the other two text types somewhere in between. Some data are given in Table 4 (van der Wouden et al., 2002).","If we assume that more formal texts show greater complexity, the data in (4) may be taken as support for our initial hypothesis. The average sententence length (taken as number of words divided by the number of main clauses) is highest in the parliamentary speeches and lowest in the spontaneous conversations. The level of sentence embedding is also dramatically higher in the parliamentary material than elsewhere, which points in the same direction. Surprisingly, however, the average word length is highest in the radio subcorpus, with parliamentary speeches in second position only.","Perhaps our initial hypothesis should therefore be adjusted just a little bit, in the sense that a subdivision be made between parliamentary speeches and radio recordings on the more formal side of the scale, and interviews and spontaneous conversions on the less formal side.","According to (Biber, 1988, 241), English discourse particles (well, now, anyway, anyhow, anyways are mentioned in particular) are “rare outside the conversational genres”. Comparable things have been said about Dutch modal particles, which supposedly occur more in informal than in formal genres. (van der Wouden, 2002) argued that the situation in Dutch may be considerably more complex than that, in the sense that not all particles are equal in this respect. For example, of the almost synonymous focus particles slechts ‘only’ and alleen ‘only’, slechts is felt to be the more formal word by native speakers, and it is found relatively more often in more formal text types (van der Wouden, 2002).6","There is also considerable variation between speakers: e.g. (Miller and Weinert, 1998, 7) observe a major split in their speakers between those that heavily use the discourse marker like and those that do not – all within the same text type. We have the impression that Dutch of zo (literally ‘or so’) closely parallels English like (cf. also (Fleischman, 1999)) in some of its usages:","(2) we we waren were met with uh uh achttien eighteen man men of or zo so we were with like eighteen men Table 5 offers some counts of three particle-like lexical items: the aforementioned of zo, the multifunctional modal particle wel, “a typical Dutch noise with no particular meaning” (Foolen, 1986), and the toch, which has contrastive and modal uses.7","(3) ja yes dat that doe do ’k I wél. PART","‘yes I do do that’ (emphatic use of wel)","(4) dat that vind find ’k I altijd always wel PART leuk. nice","‘I a always sort of like that’ (mitigating use of wel)","(5) en and toch PART moet must Borst Borst doorgaan. continue","‘and yet Borst has to continue’","(6) dan then is is ’t it toch PART helemaal completely niet not goed? good ‘then it is terribly wrong, isn’t it?’","We observe that according to Table 5, the least formal genres have the highest scores for the modal particle wel, which is what we expect. In the case of toch, however, we hardly findany difference between the various subcorpora. And the picture of of zo is particularly noteworthy: parliamentary speech ranks lowest, as expected, but the subcorpus scoring highest is radio, which is completely unexpected on the basis of earlier calculations where we found it to be rather formal. 6 Numbers on differences between slechts and alleen are not","given in Table 5 because CGN in its current form is still too small","for that. 7 In the table, Kword is short for 1000 words.","Quantitative properties of four subcorpora of CGN (N=121468)","interview parliament radio spontaneous words 45502 13850 10144 51972 bytes 251294 81875 62856 285421 bytes/word 5,5 5,9 6,2 5,5 SMAIN 3130 748 666 4083 words/SMAIN 14,5 18,5 15,2 12,7 embedded tensed clauses 1921 809 379 1493 embedded tensed/SMAIN 0,61 1,1 0,57 0,37 Tabel 4: Textual differences between four subcorpora of CGN","More quantitative properties of four subcorpora of CGN (N=121468)","interview parliament radio spontaneous words 45502 13850 10144 51972","N N/Kword N N/Kword N N/Kword N N/Kword wel PART 435 9,6 56 4,0 47 4,6 521 10 toch PART 167 3,7 49 3,5 34 3,4 200 3,9 of zo ‘like’ 30 0,66 0 0 18 1,8 80 1,5 Table 5: Discourse markers in CGN If anything, these preliminary counts seem to justify the","following conclusions:"," not all of Biber’s results with respect to English carry over to Dutch;"," not all parameters order bodies of text in the same way on the same scale – which probably means that text variation is a multidimensional phenomenon (cf. Biber);"," CGN, even in its current uncompleted form, is a useful tool for quantative text variation studies. It goes without saying that statistics could be used to as-sess the validity of the findingspresented, but we leave that for another occasion (cf. e.g. (Grondelaers and Speelman, 2001)). 3.3. Application 3: spoken language phenomena","Spoken Dutch knows a number of constructions that are considered to be unwellformed for written language, which explains why they are seldomly treated in the literature (but cf. (de Vries, 1911; Jansen, 1981; de Vries, 2001), etc.). For example, constituents can be left out for reasons having to do with discourse or performance:","(7) [Dat] [That] Is is goed! good","‘agreed’ (‘topic-drop’: sentence without a subject)","(8) [Dat] [That] doen do we! we","‘agreed, we’ll do that’ (‘topic-drop’: no direct object) On the other hand, one also meets sentences with more than one instance of subject, verbal head, or other constituents:8 8 (Huesken, 2001) speaks of ‘mirror constructions’; one also","findsterms such as ‘repetition’ and ‘anacolouthon’.","(9) ik I ben am eigenlijk actually ben am ik I docente teacher Frans French ‘I am a French teacher, actually’ It is not the task of the CGN syntactic annotation group to judge what is ‘proper Dutch’ and what is not: all utterances in the corpus are considered to be grammatical, in principle (but cf. below), and should therefore get a syntactic analysis. Non-standard sentence types, as exemplified in (7–9), receive a ‘standard’ annotation. And if necessary, this annotation will have two verbal heads, or two subjects, or whatever – or lack such constituents altogether.","Note that these spoken language construction should be distinguished carefully from errors of speech or performance: if speakers obviously repair or correct (part of) their utterance, the corrected part is left out of the syntactic annotation graph.","This approach of annotating all utterances makes it easy to collect examples of these types of constructions for further research. For example: to find sentences of type (9) one simply has to look for clauses (annotation graphs) containing more than one subject node, verbal head node, etcera."]},{"title":"4. Concluding remarks","paragraphs":["In this paper, we have given a brief overview of the Spoken Dutch Corpus CGN. We have discussed details both of the philosophy behind the process of syntactic annotation and of its actual implementation.","After that, we have shown how the CGN can be used to learn things about variation in Dutch we did not know be-fore. Much more can be looked at, of course: (Biber, 1988) counts no less than 67 variables. Some of these searches are still quite tedious, but that will improve with the further development of the CGN exploration tools.","In the last part, we demonstrated how CGN can be used to investigate constructions found in spoken discourse only.","From all this it will be clear, we hope, that the Spoken Dutch Corpus can be a valuable tool for research both into the properties of spoken Dutch in general and into register variation within the language, among many other things."]},{"title":"5.
