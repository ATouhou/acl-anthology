Thai LVCSR corpus project","paragraphs":["Information Research and Development Unit (RD-I) at National Electronics and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC), Thailand, has initiated a project of the first Large Vocabulary Continuous Speech Recognition (LVCSR) corpus for Thai language since October 2000 (Wutiwiwatchai, 1999; Sornlertlamvanich & Thongprasirt 2001). The project is a collaboration among several Thai universities with NECTEC as the host center. The corpus aims for research and development of 5000-vocabulary dictation system. It consists of two sentence sets, a phonetically distributed (PD) set and a 5000-vocabulary coverage set. The PD sentence set must cover all phonemic units occur in the language. It is used for phone model initialization in the speech recognizer. The 5000-vocabulary coverage set contains 3 separated sets, training set (TR), development test set (DT), and evaluation test set (ET). Both sentence sets are carefully distributed for each speaker in recording session as shown in Table1. The speakers are requested to read assigned sentences in both clean and office environment. Full details of this corpus are presented in the proposal provided by Wutiwiwatchai (1999).

Thai language","paragraphs":["Thai writing system is alphabetic-based. There is no space between words and no explicit rule of placing spaces between adjacent sentences. Word segmentation as well as sentence detection become crucial problems for natural language processing. Moreover, the definitions of both word and sentence are not unique especially when applied to different tasks. Thai syllable can be expressed in the form of T/-)(C-V-/C fi , where iC denotes the initial consonant (either single consonant or consonant cluster), V denotes the vowel (either single vowel or diphthong), an optional fC represents the final consonant, and T is the tone mark. More details of Thai phonetics defined in our work are presented in section 3.1."]},{"title":"1.3. Phonetically distributed sentence (PD) set","paragraphs":["This paper focuses on the design of the corpus, selection procedure, and analysis of the final selected PD set. Normally, a set of phonetically balanced sentences (PB) is designed to minimally cover at most possible phonemic units occur in the language, in our case, phoneme pairs (or as called in this paper - biphones). The PD set does not only follow PB criterion, but the distribution of units in the set also corresponds to that of the original text. Due to its compactness and phone coverage property, speech utterances of PD set can be used for phone model initialization as well as for speaker adaptation problem.","The difficulties of Thai writing system as described previously enlarge the error of the grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) module in which its performance strongly depends on word boundaries. ORCHID (Sornlertlamvanich, 1998), a sentence, word, and part-of-speech (POS) tagged corpus that is one of the standard corpus created for POS tagging research, was used as the initial text for PD selection. Section 2 describes an overall selection procedure beginning from the original text, ORCHID, to the final selected sentence sets. The implementation of the selection procedure including the protocol of Thai phonetic transcription, some essential rules of phonetic and the convergence of iterative selection are reported in section 3. Section 4 gives the analysis of the final PB and PD sets. The result is partially compared to the American English TIMIT’s PB set (MIT-450) (Lamel, Kassel, & Seneff, 1986) and the Japanese ATR’s 503 PB sentences (Iso, Watanabe & Kuwabara, 1988). Finally, section 5 summarizes our work.","",""]},{"title":"2.

After screening out the sentences containing English characters in the pre-filtering step, the remaining was processed by the newly improved G2P for Thai language (Tarsaku, Sornlertlamvanich & Thongprasirt, 2001) which has been suitably modified and adopted. Before selection, we got a total of 27,634 sentences denoted as A in Figure 1. The selection of minimal PB and PD sets were conducted with an approach proposed by Shen, et al (1999). To avoid the tiresome work of manual phone correction on all sentences in A, phone correction was performed only on the selected PD sentences. Let’s define S = {PB, PD} as the selected sentence set (PB is always a subset of PD) and }DP,BP{S ′′=′ as the sentences after manual phone correction. )S,S(C ′ , computed from S and S′ , is used for stopping criteria of iterative selection. S′ becomes the final PB and PD set if )S,S(C ′ achieves a set threshold T. Otherwise, A will be replaced by A′ (S is replaced by S′ ) and will be an initial set of the next iteration. In our work",")S,S(C ′ was the different between unique-biphone count of PB and BP ′ sets.","The sub-process of PB and PD selection is illustrated in Figure 2. PB set was collected in advance and became the initial set for the PD set. The unit score in PB selection is a reverse of unit frequency, whereas the unit score in PD selection is a constant subtracted by a unit reduction score multiplied by the number of times it has been selected and included in PD set. The unit reduction score is again the reverse of unit frequency. R as described in the PD selection step is the degree to which the statistical distribution of the units in the selected sentence set is similar to that in the original text. The dot product between the distribution of units in original text and that in the PD set is a good measure for R. More details can be explored in Shen, et al (1999)."]},{"title":"3.

Some important rules as described below are regulated in order to transcribe consistently. 1) The phonemes in some syllables are not corresponding to their graphemes. For example, /th-a:-n-2/ (means “you”) is always distorted to be /th-a-n-2/1","(vowel shortened when read while its grapheme is still presented as long vowel). In this case, we have chosen the shortened pronunciation which is the more natural speaking style.","2) Some abbreviations can be pronounced in either full or abbreviated form. For example, /ph-@:-0/s-@:-4/ (means “B.E.”) is the pronunciation of the abbreviation of /ph-u-t-3/th-a-3/s-a-k-1/k-a-1/r-a:-t-1/ (meant “Buddhist Era”). Thai native people use both pronunciations when read. We consistently assign every abbreviation to be read as its full pronunciation.","3) Nowadays, some word’s pronunciations are not unique such as /ph-a-n-0/j-a:-0/ and /ph-a-n-0/r-a-3/j-a:-0/ (means “wife”). Actually the correct pronunciations of these words have been defined officially, but many people still don’t know which one is correct. In this case, we force every speaker to pronounce uniquely and correctly.","4) Orthographies of some loan words from foreign language are not defined officially. Spelling of these words usually deviate from their pronunciations especially in their tones. We have defined the orthographies and the pronunciations for our corpus specially."]},{"title":"3.2.

Analysis of PB and PD Set","paragraphs":["Some significant statistics of the final PB and PD sentence set compared to the original ORCHID are shown in Table 4. PB sentence sets of other languages have been created and used widely in speech research like in American English (MIT-450) (Lamel, Kassel, & Seneff, 1986) and Japanese (ATR-503) (Iso, Watanabe & Kuwabara, 1988).

ATR-503 sentence set considers the phone-class based triphones in addition to ordinary biphones. The phone-class triphones considered are in forms of /CVC/ and /VCV/ when one or more phones are the specific phone classes such as voiced and semivowel. Monophones defined in MIT-450 is exactly single phoneme, whereas consonant clusters and diphthongs in Thai PB set is defined as monophones. Furthermore, MIT-450 is designed for deeply research of acoustic-phonetic, hence more variations of phonetics for a unique phone are assigned.","A more essential attribute is the coverage of phone units to that exactly occur in the language. Our PD and PB set covers 72 of, overall, 74 monophones (97.3%). However, it can be noted that the monophones disappeared in the corpus are loan phones, which occur only in loan words from foreign language. According to the monophones defined in Table 3, there are 2,568 biphone combinations, in which only 1,792 biphones exist in Thai words. Our sentence set covers 1,628 biphones (90.9%), comparing to the ATR-503 which covers 548 of 625 context-dependent units (87.7%).","Histograms of some common monophones and biphones, occur in the PD set, are shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5 respectively. A linguistic literature (Luksaneeyanawin, 1992) has presented a distribution of Thai vowel phones in a basis of frequency in different phone context. Although the histogram of vowels in our PD set, as shown in Figure 6, illustrates the cumulative count of phone occurrences regardless of its context, they are comparable because our selection approach tries to collect almost minimum number of sentences that cover the desired phonetic units. Since they correlate, the standard of the PD set can be assured. 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 a a: n̂nĝĵs th t̂n @: Monophone No. of occurrances","","Figure 4: Histogram of some common monophones in PD set 0 200 400 600 800","a-j^","a:-n^","k-a: n-a","a:-j^","th-i:","s-a a-m ^ th-a a:-ng^ Biphone No. of occurrances"," Figure 5: Histogram of some common biphones in PD set 0 2000 4000 6000","i, i:","e, e:","x, x:","v, v:","q, q:","a, a:","u, u:","o, o: @, @: Vowel No. of occurrances  Figure 6: Histogram of single vowels in PD set ","Lexical tone in Thai language is the most prominent and interesting characteristic. Since the G2P module also provides 5 tone markers (0-4) in the phonetic transcription, it would enable research on Thai continuous tone processing. In addition, the PD set covers 100% bitones (tone marks of syllable pair) and up to 91.2% tritones when computed on 10 tonal symbols (5 Thai tones, distinguishing between short and long vowels).","",""]},{"title":"5.
