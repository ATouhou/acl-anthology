The system uses a lexical database of French words that is comparable in its size to WordNet and an algorithm that evaluates distances in the semantic graph between hypernyms and hyponyms of the words in the definition. The paper first outlines the structure of the lexical network on which the method is based. It then describes the algorithm. Finally, it concludes with examples of results we have obtained. "]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["Le mot juste the right word consists in finding a word, and sometimes the only one, that describes the most precisely an object, a concept, an action, a feeling, or an idea. It is one of the most delicate aspects of writing. Generations of students, writers, or apprentice authors have probably experienced this. Unfortunately, we must too often content ourselves with approximations and circumlocutions.","The right word is also crucial to formulate accurately the elements of a problem and solve it. Naming a broken or defective part in a car or a bicycle is a challenge to any average driver when confronted with a mechanic. The right word is yet essential to find the part number in a database, order it, and have it replaced. This problem is even more acute when no human help is possible as for some ecommerce applications where access to information is completely automated.","When the adequate vocabulary escapes us, a common remedy is to employ a circumlocution, a description made of more general words. Examples of such circumlocutions are dictionary definitions that conform to the Aristotelian tradition as in une personne qui vend des fleurs (a person that sells flowers) to designate a fleuriste (a florist) or la petite roue dentØe au centre dune roue de vØlo (the small toothed wheel in the center of a bicycle wheel) for pignon (sprocketwheel).","This kind of definitions consists of two parts. A first one relates the object, the idea in question, to a genus to which the object, the idea belong, here personne (person). Then, the second part specifies it with a differentia specifica, a property that makes the object particular, here qui vend des fleurs (who sells flowers). A florist can thus be described as a species within the genus personne, with the differentia specifica qui vend des fleurs.","The description of the florist corresponds closely to its definition in the French Petit Robert dictionary: Personne qui fait le commerce des fleurs (a person who trades in flowers). In the Cambridge International Dictionary of English, the definition is slightly more restrictive: a person who works in a shop which sells cut flowers and plants for inside the house. However, the correspondence between somebodys wording of a concept and the word definition in a dictionary is not always as straightforward."]},{"title":"2. The Lexical Database 2.1. The Integral Dictionary","paragraphs":["The Integral Dictionary TID (see Dutoit (1992) and Dutoit (2000) for details) is a semantic network associated to a lexicon. It is available mainly for French and it is currently being adapted to other languages notably English and German. Its size is comparable to that of major lexical networks available in English such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) or MindNet (Richardson et al. 1998).","A subset of the Integral Dictionary forms the core of the French lexicon in the EuroWordNet database (Vossen 1999). Although the structure of the Integral Dictionary and WordNet do not map exactly, it was possible to derive TID data and feed them in a WordNet compatible structure. In addition, the TID structure will be used in the Balkanet European project to merge the word nets for Balkan languages (Greek, Turkish, Bulgarian, Romanian, Czech, and Serbian) in a single database (Balkanet 2000)."]},{"title":"2.2. The Structure of The Integral Dictionary","paragraphs":["The Integral Dictionary organizes words into varieties of concepts and uses semantic lexical functions. Concept definitions are based on the componential semantic theory (Pottier 1974; Greimas 1986) and the lexical functions are inspired by the Meaning-Text theory (Melcuk 1992).","Both lexical functions and componential semantics can be accessed in the Integral Dictionary using a Java application programming interface (API). There are more than 30 API functions with parameters for seven languages: English, French, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, German, and Portuguese. In this article, we use five functions. 2.2.1. A Graph of Concepts","The basic component of the Integral Dictionary is the concept. The concept has a gloss of few words to identify its content. When the concept is entirely lexicalized, it gives the definition of a word (this case is marked with a particular kind of relation between the concept and the word: Generic). It happens that the concept may be only partially lexicalized. This is a difference with WordNet where synsets group synonyms. In the Integral Dictionary, concepts group words that share a part of a meaning and they are not equivalent to synsets. A graph of concepts forms then a structure around which the words are organized: a kind of small world founded on an idea (Ferrer and SolØ, 2001).","A starting \\ denotes a concept as in \\personne humaine (human being) or \\animal à fourrure (fur animal). Concepts are classified into categories. This paper describes only two main ones: the classes and the themes. Classes form a hierarchy and are annotated with their part of speech such as [\\N] or [\\V]. Themes are concepts that can serve as a predicate to the hierarchies of classes. They are denoted by a [T].","Words in the dictionary appear as terminal nodes in the hierarchical graph of concepts as shown in Figure 1 for the word fleur (flower). Relations annotate arcs between concepts themes and classes and between words and concepts. Major relations are hypernymy (Gen), hyponymy (Spec), various forms of synonymy, ToTheme, and ToClass."," \\Plante [T] ToClassSpec ToTheme"]},{"title":"\\ [\\N] \\ part of the plant Fleur [T] ","paragraphs":["ToClassSpec","ToTheme ToTheme ToTheme "]},{"title":"\\Fleur [\\N] \\Part of the flower [\\N]  \\Fleur [\\V]","paragraphs":["ToClassGeneric"]},{"title":"fleur.n.f.

Vcolloc Vcolloc "]},{"title":"tulipe.n Øtamine.n pistil.n pØtale.n fleurir.v (bloom.v) faner.v (wither.v)","paragraphs":["Figure 1 Graph of concepts for the word fleur.","","The way to organize words and concepts in the Integral Dictionary is a crucial difference with WordNet. In WordNet, concepts are most of the time lexicalized under the form of synonym sets synsets. They are then tied to the words of a specific language, in this case English.","In the Integral Dictionary, Themes and Classes dont depend on the words of a language and it is even possible to create a concept without any words. This is useful, for example, to build a node in the graph and share a semantic feature that is not entirely lexicalized.","A set of French adjectives shares the semantic feature qui a cessØ quelque chose: dŒtre, de subir, de devenir. Cease something: being, suffering, becoming as the words mort dead that is no longer living , dØmodØ old-fashioned, outmoded, that is no longer modern. As it does not exist any French adjective, which means only no longer, it is not possible to create a WordNet synset. In effect, they are based on an optional gloss and an obligatory word that corresponds exactly to the meaning. In the Integral Dictionary, there is no such constrain and it is possible to create a class that is not lexicalized. 2.2.2. The Size of the Integral Dictionary","The Integral Dictionary contains approximately 16,000 themes, 25,000 classes, the equivalent of 12,000 WordNet synsets (with more than one term in the content), and, for French 190,000 words. There is a total of 389,000 arcs in the graph. Table 1 shows the word breakdown according to their category."," Part-of-speech Number Nouns 138,658 Adjectives 20,981 Verbs 21,956 Adverbs 4,287 Table 1 Size of the lexicon broken down by category. 2.2.3. Componential Semantics","Componential semantics corresponds to the decomposition of the words into a set of smaller units of meaning: the semes (Greimas, 1986; Pottier, 1974).","The term seme is not very common in English although this concept can prove very effective and instrumental in the construction of a semantic network. English-speaking linguists prefer the phrases semantic feature or semantic component, which are not exactly equivalent.","Following the French semantic tradition, the interpretation of a text is made possible by the semes distributed amongst the words (Greimas, 1986; Eco, 1979).","The repetition of semes in a text ensures its homogeneity and coherence and forms an isotopy.","One problem raised by the semic approach is the choice of primitives. Although, there is no consensus on this, a wellshared idea is that the primitives should be a small set of symbolic and atomic terms.","This viewpoint may prove too restrictive and misleading in many cases. In effect, there are multiple ways to decompose a word that correspond to its possible paraphrases and to different contexts as for fleuriste/florist:"," Semes(fleuriste) = [personne/person] [vendre/sell]","[fleur/flower] Semes(fleuriste) = [vendeur/seller] [fleur/flower] Semes(fleuriste) = [personne/person] [travailler/work]","[magasin/shop] [vendre/sell] [fleur/flower]","The Integral Dictionary adopts a componentional viewpoint but the decomposition is not limited to a handful of primitives. Any concept is a potential primitive and the possible semes of a word corresponds to the whole set of concepts connected to this word. Word semes can easily be retrieved from the graph of themes and classes. This approach gives more flexibility to the decomposition while retaining the possibility to restrain the seme set to specific concepts (Figure 2).",""]},{"title":"\\Universe [\\T]    \\Personne [\\N] \\Vendre [T] \\Fleur [T]","paragraphs":["ToClassGeneric ToTheme ToTheme ToTheme"]},{"title":"personne.n person.n \\Vendre [\\V] \\Fleur [\\N] \\Person who sells sth.

Lexical Semantic Functions","Lexical semantic functions generate word senses from another word sense given as an input. Functions are divided into subsets. Amongst the most significant ones, a subset, S0, S1, and S2, carries out semantic derivations of verbs. These functions could be compared to nominalization in derivational morphology but they operate in the semantic domain and are applied to a specific verb case:  • S0(acheter/buy.v) = achat (morphological","nominalization) • S1(acheter) = acheteur/buyer (subject nominalization), • S2(acheter) = {achat, marchandise, service}/{purchase,","goods, service} (object nominalization),","","The Integral Dictionary has implemented 66 lexical functions in total. It corresponds to 96,000 links between the words. The links between adjectives and nouns are amongst the most productive ones in the French part of the Integral Dictionary."]},{"title":"3. An Algorithm to Find Words from Definitions","paragraphs":["The algorithm searches words using two main mechanisms. The first one extracts sets of words from the database that delimit the search space. In the definition a person who sells marguerites, the algorithm extracts all the sets of persons.","The second mechanism computes a semantic distance between each candidate word in the person sets and the definition. This distance is asymmetric and is based on the structure of the differentia specifica and the semantic topology of TID.","As we can imagine, such sets can be very large. The sets corresponding to person cover more than 10,000 words in TID. When needed, a third mechanism prunes rapidly the search space (Bertholon 1998)."]},{"title":"3.1. The Semantic Network","paragraphs":["The Integral Dictionary superimposes two graphs. A first one forms an acyclic graph whose terminal nodes are the words, the other nodes are concepts, and where the arcs correspond to relations. A second one connects the words using and lexical functions. Figure 3 shows a simplified picture of this structure. The distance between two words or phrases is derived from the first graph.","  R10 R1 \\Universe \\A \\B \\C W3 W5 R2 R3 R4 R5 R6 R7","R9 \\D \\E \\F W1 W4 R11 W2 R12 R13 R14 R15 R16 LF2LF1 LF3 R8 ","Figure 3.

It has a three children respectively \\A, \\B, and \\C, which can either classes or themes.","Arc labels Rn are relations linking the concepts and LFn are lexical functions. In Figure 3, W3 has two parents connected by arcs representing two different relations: R14(\\E) = W3 and R15(\\F) = W3. LF1 is a lexical function linking W3 to W4: LF1(W3) = W4. Inverse relations and lexical functions are implemented so that a parent can be found from its child.","The average number of parents of a word or a concept in the Integral Dictionary is 2.1. The average depth of the graph from the root is 15. From these numbers, we can evaluate the average number of concepts a word can be member of: 152.1"," = 294."]},{"title":"3.2. A Semantic Distance","paragraphs":["The distance between two words or phrases is derived from the graph topology as shaped by the relations. It is the sum of two terms that we call respectively the semantic activation distance and the semantic proximity distance. We describe here a simplified version of this distance. 3.2.1. The Semantic Activation","The semantic activation of two words, M and N, is defined by their set of least common ancestors (LCA) in the graph (Aho et al, 1973). The semantic activation paths correspond to paths linking both words M and N through each node in the set of least common ancestors.","In Figure 3, we have LCA(W2, W3) = {\\E} and LCA(W3, W4) = {\\A, \\B}. The activation path between W2 and W3 consists of the nodes W2 \\E W3 with the functions R14-1","and R15. The path between W3 and W4 consists of W3 \\E \\A W4 and W3 \\F \\B W4.","We define the semantic activation distance as the number of arcs in theses paths divided by the number of paths.

They enable to extract a search space of potential semes together with a metric. 3.2.2. The Semantic Proximity","The semantic proximity between two words, M and N, uses sets of asymmetric ancestors that we call the Least Asymmetric Ancestors, LAA. LAA(M, N) is the set of nodes that are common ancestors of both words, that are not member of the least common ancestor set (LCA), and where M has a child, which is an ancestor of M and not an ancestor of N. Most of the time, the sets LAA(M, N) and LAA(N, M) are different. This is an essential feature of this metric that reflects a semantic difference.","In Figure 3, the set of the ancestors common to W2 and W3 that are not in the LCA set is {\\A, \\Universe}. \\A has a child \\D that is an ancestor of W2, which is not an ancestor of W3, hence LAA(W2, W3) = {\\A}.

In our case, we obtain 107 LAA from florist.n to flower.n. An automatic examination of the results shows that most of the LAA concepts are obtained through a very small number of classes. To find these classes, we traverse the graph using the LAA (\\Universe [T] in Fig.2) down to the first class above florist.n. We then find where the difference between florist and flower originates: • \\Person [\\N], which mean that flower.n is not a person. • \\Seller [\\N], which means that flower.n has no link with","business.

Extracting a Set of Hyponyms","The sets of words are extracted using a function of a given word that finds all the hyponyms of one of the words hypernyms.

As in the query vendeur de fleurs, we have no seme about the gender of the seller, it will be impossible to make a difference between the two specifics: fleuriste and bouquetiŁre. These two specific terms saturate all the semes of the query vendeur de fleurs. To differentiate between fleuriste and bouquetiŁre, we need to produce the two measures (2): d(fleuriste, vendeur de fleurs) and d(bouquetiŁre, vendeur de fleurs). With this second measure, we obtain that bouquetiŁre has a seme (feminine gender) non saturated by the query. It is not the same for fleuriste, which has no non-saturated seme with this query. To solve our problem (to distinguish the specifics bouquetiŁre and fleuriste from seller of flower), the measure 2 was needed.","As, in the answers seller or shop assistant we have no seme about what is selling, the measure (2) will say that any semes of seller or shop assistant are saturated by the queries seller of flowers.
