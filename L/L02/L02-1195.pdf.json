Translation and Interpreting students at the Universidad de Málaga are offered the possibility to take an English-Spanish Literary Translation module, which epitomises the need for debate in the field of Humanities. Sadly enough, implementation of course methodology is rendered very difficult or impossible owing to time restrictions and overcrowded classrooms.  It is our contention that the setting up of a web site may solve some of these issues. We intend to provide both students and the literary translation-aware Internet audience with an integrated, scalable, multifunctional debate forum. Project contents will include a detailed course description, relevant reference materials and interaction services (mailing list, debate forum and chat rooms). This is obviously without limitation, as the Forum is open to any other contents that users may consider necessary or convenient, with a view to a more interdisciplinary approach, further research on the field of Literary Translation and future developments within the project framework.

Introduction- Why this project","paragraphs":["An introduction is needed to explain the reasons that first led us to tackle this project. First, a quick note on the more specific scope."]},{"title":"Project scope: a Literary Translation module","paragraphs":["The English-Spanish Literary Translation module (hereinafter referred to as ‘the course’) is a non-core module taught in the second semester of the fourth (final) year of the Translation and Interpreting degree at the Universidad de Málaga (UMA). Credit rating is 6 credits (60 hours of lectures).","As to the methodology of the course, we have been implementing a methodology inspired in the social-constructivist approach to learning, directly deriving from John Dewey’s idea of learning by doing. This concept soon found widespread acceptance in the academic environment and has been applied to foreign language teaching (FLT) and the teaching of translation1",". Implementation of the learning by doing premises in the field of FLT is achieved through task-based learning and, more specifically, through the assignment of ‘projects’, or rather ‘tasks’ or ‘task chains’ leading to a general goal which will have been stated beforehand.","In our experience, the best method to articulate such ‘projects’ within the subject matter of Literary Translation is to assimilate all projects to real-world professional situations; in other words, to ask students to deliver mock translation ‘briefs’, i.e., translation proposals or research projects which are done either individually or in groups and more or less under the same circumstances and requirements they are bound to encounter in the market as professional translators2",".","Classes start in late February and translation briefs must be submitted by the end of March, April and May, "]},{"title":"1.2. ","paragraphs":["1 For an in-depth view, see Kiraly (2000). 2 For more details on our approach to course methodology and assessment, see Zaro (2001, 2001). respectively. Briefs are the backbone of student activity during the course, along with translation of a number of proposed texts (coursework dossier) and discussions of translation issues from such texts."]},{"title":"Structural issues on teaching the Literary Translation module","paragraphs":["The course and the related web site project make up a","coherent didactic set3","insofar as the director of the project","is the course convenor, the rest of the project members all","conduct regular research on this domain and have a keen","interest in literary translation. But, more importantly, the","field of Literary Translation epitomises the need for","debate and exchange of opinions in the world of","humanities. Detailed discussions are, however, rendered","very difficult or impossible due to the following","circumstances:","a) The number of students is relatively high (60 to 80 over the last three years, 75 this year). It is indeed an unfortunate but inevitable fact that structural (logistic) restrictions have a strong influence on course activities in the sense that teachers must adapt to overcrowded classrooms and are forced into using a strictly traditional methodology. In these circumstances, it is virtually impossible to monitor the progress of each student. Attempts to implement novel pedagogic techniques (such as project work, see above) will be at odds in the face of excessive student numbers.","b) Time restrictions. As mentioned above, the course covers a total of only 60 hours, with roughly 3-4 sessions a week.","3 In Spain, the professional practice of Literary Translation is also regarded as a coherent and observable field where objective data can be obtained (Escobar 1998), as opposed to the growing liberalisation of the translation market in general (Castro Roig, forthcoming). This will prove decisive in the future, when the time comes to involve publishing houses and professional translators in our project.","For these reasons, we have considered it very convenient for everybody (both teachers and students) to have an additional space for communication where everyone can contact each other in a friendly, relaxed, perchance even entertaining manner and, above all, without any fuss as regards time or actual face-to-face meetings.","It is our contention that the setting up of the UMA’s Literary Translation Interactive Forum at http://www.ieev.uma.es/tradlit will opportunely solve some of the previously outlined issues. For one thing, hypertext is a neural, non-linear space that encourages associative thinking, freedom, a healthy challenge to the concept of the lecturer’s undisputed authority4","... in a word, more open debate. Also, hypertext is an essentially open environment revealing an infinite succession of links that may help the user to understand the nature of human thought. This new dimension of communication is highly valuable (perhaps decisive) in the field of translation studies, a domain where hermeneutics, interpretation and the tasks involving the unravelling of sense and expression are undoubtedly of the utmost importance. This is even more the case when dealing with literary translation, an intersection of the domains of literature and translation.","On a more pragmatic note, we expect the set of resources which are to be described here will, on the one hand, allow us to easily monitor individual students and, on the other hand, offer students a number of tools and instruments. Increasing familiarity with the Internet and its relevant place in our day-to-day activities is resulting in a wealth of new and useful resources5",". These, however, are not, as of today, very much in use by our students."]},{"title":"2. 2.1.

But simplicity and ease of use have been basic premises of the project ever since its inception- an ad hoc didactic project such as this must be simple to be operative, since the idea is not to introduce new and confusing elements (see a discussion of annotated web links below), but to encourage information exchange and interaction through an additional space that proves as uncomplicated and user-friendly as possible.","First of all, statistics typically admit that users will access a maximum of eight consecutive sections in a web site or portal before their level of attention starts to diminish. To ensure that users get optimum results from accessing their web site, webmasters can cut down on contents (as is usually the case with personal sites) or rely on sophisticated management and full-time staff (commercial and institutional sites). Because we are somewhere in the middle of these options, we have tried to go for a solution that is also somewhere in the middle-on the one hand, contents in our Forum are centralised and simply but characteristically organised through a gradual forking design; on the other hand, strict selection criteria are observed to check that all new information is relevant to the field of Literary Translation.","Also for transparency’s sake, and although design and technical issues have not been ignored, we have preferred to devise an elegant but unspectacular design, rather than complicating functionality and jeopardising the operational capacity of the didactic instrument. In other words, it is better to have virtually flawless contents,","however humble, that appear clear, informative and useful","to the users in the first (experimental) stage of the project-","the students taking part in the course.

What is needed is a crystal-clear and properly spelt out point of reference so that users may know where they are going before going there.

A simple web search (for example, “Language today” AND “Logos”) will yield a high number of hits, as many lists of translation resources still refer to this already dead link. Many times the user must take a blind-box approach to web resources-this cannot be the case if we are to create useful reference tools. 7 Honourable exceptions include Kirk McElhearn’s personal pages (http://www.mcelhearn.com/lit.html) and the Pen American Center’s Handbook for Literary Translators (http://www.pen.org/translation/selected.html) debate forum is a completely free and unmoderated8","first-stop space for debates between students. Contents and users will not be screened and everyone will have the opportunity to express their views on any topics, as long as they are in relation (either directly or indirectly) to literary translation, but not necessarily with those aspects that the course deals with.

We expect users themselves to be the best censors of private, trivial and irrelevant contents, as is usually the case with mailing lists (McElhearn, 1996); in any case, webmasters will act as a filter, selecting contents that will permeate from the debate forum to the mailing list in order to enhance quality of debate on the latter. 4.3.2. 4.3.3."]},{"title":"4.4.

We have been aware of this since the very beginning of the project- for example, the fact that the web site is bilingual and directed at both Spanish-speaking and foreign students implied a true localisation of contents to cater for different students’ needs. Since, in our case, contents are dependent on human and educational factors, automatic updating may not always be possible, but we have at least ensured scalability and easy updating (however manual) through the use of a basic frame structure where:","• a top panel gives access to all the first-level sections and all the site services;","• a left panel that makes project members’ contact information available at all times and includes quick access buttons (top of page, choose language, etc.);","• a main content panel allows for quick and easy content update without having to alter the overall structure of the site.","Designing the web site: content integration and","cross-platform compatibility","A great emphasis has been placed on attractive appearance and a common look-and-feel in the site’s interface and with the DEV’s pages. However, web functions that are common to all DEV’s projects have a standard appearance, which we intend to tailor to cater for our needs. Implementation of such changes is not as yet effective, as the setting up of the didactic instrument was a priority, but standardisation of the site’s contents is in the process of being done in the face of students’ comments and interaction results.","The site is currently best viewed with version 5 or later of Internet Explorer and is not fully compatible with Netscape Navigator or Mac. The reasons for this are tow and interlinked:","• A survey among students proved that 100% of","them use this application.","• Because our students are currently our priority","(see 3. above), compatibility issues are not a","source of urgent concern at the moment9",".","Server issues","Some minor technical problems with the UMA’s servers occurred at project start-up. This was a source of worry, as we have opted to encourage students to an active use of the Forum and the Internet in general. As the shift towards a less face-to-face-based learning experience gradually occurs, more and more aspects of course methodology and development will come to depend on e-learning and web services availability. At such point, any web access technical issues will prove tremendously dangerous and difficult to solve, as they may disrupt course activities. It is true, however, that no technical issues have been found to exist either- students have in fact praised the Forum’s ease of access and userfriendliness. At the time of writing, the web site has only been running for two weeks and course lectures have only just started, hence contributions from students so far are logically scarce."]},{"title":"Possible future developments","paragraphs":["We expect to monitor the project’s development by","means of two basic instruments: • Regular meetings between project members and","with student reps • Project evaluation and feedback from students","after the end of the course We also expect to broaden the project’s horizons in the","near future and break fresh ground in the following fields:","9 They will be, however, in the near future, if, as pointed out above, we want the project to become something more than just another useless repository."]},{"title":"6.1. 6.2. 6.3.

Distance- and e-learning have a brilliant future (or rather a brilliant present) and represent a suitable answer to the shortcomings of traditional face-to-face learning.

But there is a further, more complicated issue in connection with the design of syllabi for the teaching of translation workshops via the electronic highways, and with web-based learning in general- the specification guidelines for the writing of on-line course material10",". As pointed out by Balkan (2001:7), ‘It is not just a question of transferring traditional lecture notes to web pages, but a skill in itself. The development costs can be very high, and are usually only justified where there are a large number of students.’ Much research is still to be done in this field, but given its potential value from the point of view of Didactics, we are determined to explore its possible applications in the near future for the creation of digital and on-line courses."]},{"title":"Exploring intersections between Literary Translation and computer technology","paragraphs":["The present project may certainly be a touchstone for future studies on the role of CAT and MT tools for literary translation.

The creation of such research products has already been undertaken by the scholars taking part in this product as a way to provide information that may help us to a better understanding of cultural differences involved in translation and, more specifically, to increase the quality and applications for research and education in an attempt to meet market needs by using the tools at our disposal.

This, however, has not been considered a major issue, as the Forum is still in an experimental stage and shortcomings were to be expected.","Nevertheless, even this first stage the Forum is already, in Dr Juan Jesús Zaro’s (project director and course convenor) words, yielding fruitful results in the sense of greater student involvement on course development at an earlier stage than ever .We expect to gain valuable insights that may allow for a more adequate approach and increase our awareness of course shortcomings and the ways to work around them.","In a more general sense, we must understand that research on e-learning, CALL, CMC and related fields will most of the time be quickly outdated (sometimes even before it is published), owing to the tremendously fast pace of technical resources (r)evolution (McElhearn, 1996; Marcos Marín, 1994).
