F-31058 Toulouse CEDEX 1","Nabil.Hathout@univ-tlse.fr","Abstract Morphological resources such as CELEX do not exist for many languages. NLP and RI systems that operate on texts and documents written in these languages have then to rely on morphological resources acquired from lexica or corpora. These resources usually suffer from a problem of precision because no a priori semantic knowledge is used for their acquisition. The paper proposes a robust and language independent technique to acquire morphological constructional relations from dictionaries of synonyms. The idea is to explore simultaneously synonymy and morphological relations in order to make more accurate prediction. The paper presents an evaluation of the technique and a comparison of the acquired morphological links with the CELEX database."]},{"title":"1. Constructional morphology for NLP and IR","paragraphs":["In the last decade, the interest for morphology and especially constructional1","morphology has been growing in the-oretical linguistics and in computational linguistics, related domains as information retrieval (IR). Some recent experiments in IR (Xu and Croft, 1998; Jacquemin and Tzoukermann, 1999) have shown that constructional morphology can contribute to improve the efficiency of IR systems. For highly inflected languages as French, a proper treatment of infle xional morphology is imperative (Namer, 2000). This is less the case for for poorly inflected languages (Krovetz, 1993).","Word formation is commonly regarded as lexical. For instance, (Bybee, 1988; Bybee, 1995) develops a theory where the lexicon is viewed as a network of lexical items (eg. fully inflected forms) connected to each other by relations set up according to shared semantic and phonological features. From a computational point of view, word formation","can be dealt with in two ways:"," by means of a morphological analyzer such as Englex (Antworth, 1990) for English (based on the two level model) or DeriF (Dal et al., 1999; Namer and Dal, 2000) for French (based on the SILEX model). This solution has many limitations: it is expensive; lot of linguistic knowledge has to be implemented into the morphological analyzers which implies a long and tight collaboration between linguists and programmers; morphological analyzers cannot be easily adapted to other languages; they strongly depend on their underlying linguistic models..."," by means of morphological databases such as CELEX (Baayen et al., 1995). This solution can only be used 1","We adopt the terminology proposed by Danièle Corbin and her team (Corbin, 2001); we prefer the term “constructional” to “deri vational” which does not always imply a single notion. for a very small number of languages: Dutch, English and German. For instance, as far as we know, no such database is available for romance languages. One reason of this lack of morphological databases is that their creation of is quite expensive. However, several methods of supervised and unsupervised acquisition of constructional morphology have been proposed by authors. All of them involves some amount of symbolic or statistical learning. The input may be lexical data: inflected forms as in (Gaussier, 1999) and (Hathout, 2000) or medical nomenclature as in (Grabar and Zweigenbaum, 1999). More often, morphological knowledge is acquired from text corpora as do (Jacquemin, 1997), (Goldsmith, 2001), (Schone and Jurafsky, 2000; Schone and Jurafsky, 2001) or (Déjean, 1998). The learning of constructional morphology relies on a double approximation:","1. Word forms are good approximation of the phonological features.","2. Word forms can be used as approximation of words meaning: word forms that share a long enough substring are associated to lexemes that have good chances to be semantically related. Corpus based methods can be very helpfull for specific NLP and RI tasks. In particular, they can adapt to the vocabulary of the texts. However their results cannot be easily accumulated into databases repositories because most of them do not have a sufficient precision. The problem of precision is common to all methods and tools that do not use a priori linguistic knowledge. While the firstabove approximation is quite satisfactory, the second one is very coarse and cannot be improved without integrating a minimal amount of semantic knowledge in the process. Semantics can be either included in the tools or described in an external resource. The latter option is superior to the for-mer because it preserves the generality of the method and guarantees its independence from individual languages."]},{"title":"2. Combining word formation and synonymy into analogies","paragraphs":["Almost all unsupervised methods that acquire constructional morphology from corpora or lexicons proceed in two steps:","1. they connect word forms by stripping and adding graphemic affixes;","2. the connections are then filtered on the base on various parameters such as the frequency of the stripping/adding patterns, the number of characters stripped/added, the co-occurrence of the words in some segments of text (eg. fixed size windows), the similarity of the words contexts (measured by means of TF","IDF weighting), etc. The weakness of the methods (especially regarding precision) comes from the nature of the information used to de-cide whether the words can be connected or not: either it is statistical or it relies on a priori approximation. This problem may be solved by the use of ressources that contain some semantic knowledge and which have been build or checked by humans.","These ressources include lexical databases like WordNet and machine readable dictionaries (MDRs). Among these, dictionaries of synonyms are perfectly suited for semantic filteringfor at least three reasons: 1. they have a uniform and standard format;","2. most of their information is encoded explicitly (it is made up of binary synonymy relations between entries);","3. synonymy relations is almost exactly the kind of semantic knowledge we are looking for (they precisely hold between words that share semantic features). Dictionaries of synonyms have additional desirable features:2"," they exists (at least in printed form) for a many languages;"," their format does not depend on individual languages;"," they often have a quite small size (they can be made machine readable at a reasonable cost). However, synonymy relations usually hold between words that belong to different constructional families while word formation connect members of the same family. Synonymy relations can be viewed as orthogonal to the constructional ones. Never the less, they can be easily exploited because the relation “share semantic features with” is transitive. More specifically, we aim at filteringthe morphological links predicted on the base of the sharing of a common graphemic substring. For instance, in figure1, abandon/V and abandonment/N are connected because they share the 2 By an abuse of language, we will use the term synonymy for","relations that might be better termed semantic proximity. abandon/V abandonment/N desert/V desertion/N Figure 1: Example of a morpho-synonymy analogy (segment extracted from a proportional series). Nodes are lemmata tagged with categorial labels. Arrows correspond to synonymy relations given by a dictionary. Dashed lines correspond to predicted morphological connections. graphemic prefix abandon and because they match a suffixationpattern (/V:ment/N) which can connect 221 couples of the lexicon lemmata (see §4.). Similarly, the connection of desert/V and desertion/N is predicted on the base of their common graphemic prefixdesert and of the 115 frequency of the pattern they match (/V:ion/N).3","Since words are morphologically connected on the base of their shared phonological and semantic features, the prediction of morphological links between abandon/V and abandonment/N and between desert/V and desertion/N involves a prediction that these pairs of lexemes share an large part of their semantic features. On the other hand, the dictionary of synonyms indicates that synonymy relations hold between abandon/V and desert/V and between abandonment/N and desertion/N and therefore, that the members of each of these pairs share a sizable part of their semantic features.","By using the transitivity of the relation of sharing of semantic features, we can assume that if a word ","is a syn-","onym of abandon/V and a word","is a synonym of aban-","donment/N, then  and","share a part of their semantic","features. If, in addition,  and","can be connected mor-","phologically (on the base of ","and","word forms), then this link has a greater chance to be correct since it has been predicted “independently”. The prediction that are based on transitivity uses only one predicted link. The other two are safer. To summarize, the proposed method combines constructional links and synonymy relations in order to make convergent (and consequently more accurate) predictions.","We call morpho-synonymy analogies the quadruplets as (abandon/V, abandonment/N, desert/V, desertion/N). From the linguistic point of this structure can be seen as a proportional series (Cruse, 1986). In particular, it can be read as “abandonment/N is to abandon/V as desertion/N to desert/V.”"]},{"title":"3. Extraction of dictionary of synonyms from WordNet","paragraphs":["WordNet (Miller et al., 1990; Fellbaum, 1999) is well known lexical database which describes basic semantic relations between word senses such as synonymy, hypernymy, meronymy, antonymy, etc.4","Word senses are represented as synsets that is “sets of synonyms that are inter-3 Both frequencies correspond to patterns have been learned","from the S-dict dictionary made up of WordNet synsets (see § 3.). 4 http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/ changeable in some context.” WordNet is divided in four separate parts, one for each major category (noun; verb; adjective; adverb).","Here, we are only concerned with synonymy relations. WordNet describes three relations of semantic proximity. They can be displayed by wn,5","the command line interface to WordNet when called with the -syns(v|n|a|r) and -coor(v|n) options.","In our experiment, each relation has been listed in a separate dictionary in order to compare the robustness of the proposed method. In all three dictionaries, words are tagged with their category (in other words, the categorial informations are distributed on the WordNet entries). Synsets. The most strong proximity relation is the synonymy relation described by the synsets. For in-stance, abandon/V belongs to five synsets {abandon#1}; {abandon#2, give up#10}; {abandon#3, give up#2}; {vacate#2, empty#3, abandon#4}; {abandon#5, forsake#1, desolate#1, desert#1}. The words that compose the synsets have sense numbers attached to them. We do not use sense numbers in our experiment because only direct “synonymy” links are involved in the search for analogies. Besides, only suffixation relations between “simple” word forms are considered. For example, all synonymy relations that involve give up will not be ignored since this verb form is composed of two distinct words.","The word pairs connected by the strict synonymy relation (defined by the membership of the same synset (eg. abandon/V:desert/V)) have been gathered in a dictionary we called S-dict. Notice that these relation are not directed. Synonymy/immediate hypernymy. The second relation is less tight. It corresponds to the synonymy/immediate hypernymy relation between distinct synsets (eg. the verb synset {abandon, forsake, desolate, desert} has the verb synset {leave} as synonym/immediate hypernym). For adverbs, the synonymy/immediate hypernymy relation is only given for their root adjectives. Synonymy and immediate hypernymy are not distinguished in WordNet. Unlike the previous strict relation, synonymy/immediate hypernymy is directed (eg. the verb synset {leave} is not given as hav-ing {abandon, forsake, desolate, desert} among its synonym/immediate hypernym). This orientation will be preserved in the M-dict dictionary which describes this semantic proximity relation. More specifically, each synonymy/immediate hypernymy link between synsets is de-composed into a set of links between word. S-dict has also been added to M-dict. Coordinate terms. The third relation is the weakest one. It corresponds to the coordinate terms (sisters) relation and is only available noun and verb synsets (eg. the verb synset {abandon, forsake, desolate, desert} has the verb synset {jilt} as a coordinate term). We dealt with this relation as if it was directed: we did not symetricalize it. The coordinate terms (sisters) relation yielded an L-dict similar to M-dict. M-dict has been added to L-dict.","Table 1 presents some statistics on these three dictionaries. The differences in the number of entries come from the fact that only connected words are taken into account. 5 We used WordNet 1.7.","entries(#) links(#) ratio S-dict 42 918 125 754 2.9 M-dict 68 176 306 887 4.5 L-dict 70 170 2 283 679 28.8 Table 1: Size and number of connections of the extracted dictionaries."]},{"title":"4. Computing the morpho-synonymy analogies","paragraphs":["The search for morpho-synonymy analogies relies on the one hand on the synonymy relations described in the dictionaries presented in §3., and on the other on predicted constructional links.6","The computation is independent of the individual dictionaries. Let us suppose we selected X-dict, one of the three previous dictionaries. 4.1. Creating a morphological graph","Morphological links are computed from X-dict word forms by means of a two steps procedure:","In the first step, a set of suffixationpatterns is learned from X-dict word forms by means of a technique presented in (Dal et al., 1999). Patterns learning relies on two as-sumptions:","1. The longer the word, the stronger the correspondence between written form and semantic is. As consequence, if two word forms share a sufficiently long common prefix (or suffix), they are very likely to be semantically connected.","2.

Typing the analogies","paragraphs":["The results presented in table 2 are quite good, especially for S-dict. However, they can be improved significantly by typing the analogies.","We can first divide the analogies into two groups. The first group which we will term strong (S) includes analogies as (transformation/N:transformable/A, transmuta-tion/N:transmutable/A) where both pairs of word forms have the same constructional signature (tion/N:ble/A). The second group which we will term weak (W) includes analogies as (protester/N:protest/N, objector/N:objection/N) where the constructional signature of the first word form pair is (er/N:/N) and the one of the second word form pair is (er/N:ation/N). For now, this typing does not take into account allomorphy. For instance, (ed/A:ation/N) and (ed/A:ion/N) are seen as distinct signatures and an analogy as (deformed/A:deformation/N, distorted/A:distortion/N) is regarded as weak. The typing of the analogies can also be regarded as a typing of their constructional signatures. break/V:breakup/N separate/V:separation/N slight/A:slightly/R slim/A:slimly/R embezzler/N:embezzle/V defalcator/N:defalcate/V clench/V:clenched/A clinch/V:clinched/A bluing/N:bluish/A blue/N:blueish/A trickily/R:trick/V foxily/R:fox/V lumpy/A:lump/V chunky/A:chunk/V thieving/N:thief/N stealing/N:stealer/N unceasing/A:unceasingly/R unending/A:unendingly/R whiskered/A:whiskers/N bearded/A:beard/N Figure 2: Examples of morpho-synonymy analogies.","Two types of morphological links can then be defined relatively to the two types of analogies. A morphological link will be termed strong (S) if its constructional signature belongs to the signature of at least one strong analogy. Morphological links with signatures that only occur in weak analogies will be said to be weak (W). The typing of the morphological links can also be regarded as a typing of their signatures. For instance, in S-dict, (tion/N:ble/A) is a strong signatures while (ry/N:/A) is a weak one. Morphological links such as rivalry/N:rival/A which have that weak signature are also weak.","The two types of morphological links signatures in-duce a sub-typing of the weak analogies. More specifically, weak analogies can be composed of two strong links (eg. (adaptation/N:adapt/V, adjustment/N:adjust/V)) , or two weak links (eg. (acidulate/V:acidulousness/N, acidify/V:acidity/N)) or one strong link and one weak link (eg. (settlement/N:settle/V, resolution/N:resolve/V) with a strong signature (ment/N:/V) and a weak one (ution/N:ve/V)).11 The sub-typing of the weak analogies can be refined further. One may distinguish the weak link signatures than occur in {S,W} analogies from the ones that only occur in {W,W} analogies...12","The typing of the analogies reveals that all four types are not of the same importance. More precisely, strong analogy signatures have 5.2 to 6.9 more instances than weak ones (see tables 3, 4 and 5). The three sub-types of the weak analogy signatures also show sharp differences in their numbers of instances.","The types of analogies can also be used as filtersin order to improve the precision of the morphological links. Table 6 show that the precision varies with the analogy types and with the dictionary.13","Some types concentrate the main part of the incorrect links. Moreover the contrast between the types is more sharp as the dictionaries grow in size and the corresponding semantic proximity relations loosen. In other words, the efficiency of the filtering based on analogy typing increases with the weakening of the semantic relations. However, the growth does not change the relative order of the precision and for all three dictionaries, and {S,S} weak analogies are the most secure ones. This is not an expected result and the fact that strong analogies 11 All three examples are S-dict analogies. 12 {S,W} analogies include the (S,W) and (W,S) ones. 13 The precision have been estimated by checking manually","samples of 100 morphological links. type analogies(#) signatures(#) mean strong 13 652 1 370 9.9 weak 21 392 11 168 1.9 weak {S,S} 12 008 3 492 3.4 weak {S,W} 7 516 5 880 1.2 weak {W,W} 1 868 1 796 1.0 Table 3: Analogies acquired from S-dict.

Conclusion","paragraphs":["We have presented a method that exploit synonyms or semantic proximity relations in order to extract pairs of constructional links that form proportional series, namely morpho-synonymy analogies. The method is very general because it is independent of specificlanguages, all the linguistic knowledge involved in the acquisition is external to the system as it is encoded in the dictionaries of synonyms. A similar experiment carried out on a French dictionary of synonyms is described in (Hathout, 2001). The French results are similar in number and precision to the ones from M-dict.","The method is also very robust and does not require the dictionaries to have specific features. This point is established by repeating the acquisition of morphological links from three dictionaries describing a strict synonymy relation S-dict, a loose one L-dict and an intermediate one M-dict. The only incidence of the loosening of the semantic relation have been a degradation in precision and recall. However, a typing of the analogies signatures has been proposed in order to further filter the acquired morphological links."]},{"title":"8. References","paragraphs":["Evan L. Antworth. 1990.
