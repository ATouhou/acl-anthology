There are several approaches to the analysis of complex words in German. As all of them have theoretical and/or practical drawbacks, we opt for a different approach: Instead of using linking elements, we make use of three different stem types, simplex, derivational, and compounding stems. Candidates for these can be generated automatically using knowledge about linguistic processes in German word formation. Based on the analysis of only a few phenomena we have gathered about 14.000 stems in a short time frame, all of them manually checked. As a result, certain wrong analyses can be avoided and ambiguities can be solved."]},{"title":"1. The Problems","paragraphs":["In this paper, we describe an approach to the efcient semi-automatic acquisition of morphological data of high quality, which we use to enhance the precision and coverage of an analyser of German word formation.","This work is part of a research and development effort devoted to the creation of an analyser for complex words (rule system and lexicon). We intend to show how the choice of appropriate linguistic generalisations, beyond its usefulness for linguistic modelling, also supports an efcient acquisition strategy.","In the remainder of this section we rst sketch the architecture of the analyser for complex words (section 1.1.) and compare it with other, similar tools (section 1.3.), before we describe the linguistic problem underlying the acquisition task. In section 2. we discuss the linguistic generalisations we use, and in section 3. we describe the acquisition scenario, the tools and procedures developed. Finally, section 4. is devoted to the results obtained so far, and in section 5. we discuss avenues for further development. 1.1. Context: DeKo, an Analyser for complex Words","Many word formation processes of German are productive. We understand productivity, here, in the sense of (Baayen 1992; Baayen 2001): using existing stems and existing word formation rules, speakers can build new complex words (often without being conscious at all of their novelty), and hearers can instantly analyse and understand them. Complex words created via productive word formation processes usually have a fully compositional (predictable) meaning, syntax, etc.","Examples include the derived adjective schhaft (sh-like) next to the more frequent items katzenhaft, affenhaft (cat-like, ape-like) etc.; or the compound Kinderbecher (children’s mug) next to Kinderteller (children’s plate). Nominal compounds alone account for about two thirds of the words of a news corpus (cf. (Langer 1998)). Ten percent of the nouns in German newspaper text end in one of the sufxes -ung, -heit, -keit, -schaft, -(i)tt, -ion, which are part of productive derivation.","An analyser for complex words must be able to deal, at least morphologically, with such complex words created via productive processes. The DeKo1","system has been designed for this purpose.","1.2. Resources for analysing complex Words Within the task of constructing an analyser able to han-","dle productively formed complex words, two subtasks con-","cern lexicon building:"," A lexicon of simplex items must be available, support-ing the analysis of the complex items by making base elements available;"," Since German nouns, verbs and (to a minor extent) adjectives vary in form when they occur as elements of complex words, ways must be found to capture this variation and to relate the variant forms to the corresponding lemmas.","Thus, we are confronted with a modeling problem and an acquisition problem at the same time.","Processes like Umlautung of the stem vowel (if it is |a|, |o|, |u|, or the diphtong |au|), the elision of schwa, the insertion of linking elements (e.g. -s-, -er-, -en-, etc.) or combinations of these make it a non-trivial task to divide complex words into their basic (simplex) components.","Compare the compounds Haus","tr (front door) and Huser","meer (lit.: sea of houses): In Haus","tr, the simplex stems Haus (house) and Tr (door) are concatenated without any linking element (we use","to mark the boundary), while in Huser","meer, the linking element -er-is used, and furthermore the vowel |a| is changed to the corresponding umlaut. In the diminuitive form Blm","chen (little ower) of the noun Blume (ower), derivation involves the elision of the nal schwa, and again Umlautung. These processes occur frequently in derivation and compounding (for details see section 4.). 1","DeKo stands for Derivations- und Kompositionsmorphologie des Deutschen. For a general overview of DeKo, see (Schmid et al. 2001). So far, the tool can not yet be tested online. 1.3. Approaches to the Analysis of complex Words","There are different ways to deal with German compounding, and some of them have been implemented.","(a) Complex words found in very large corpora may be listed, and the system only retrieves those items (and their analyses) which are contained in its lexicon (lexicon approach): this approach deliberately ignores productively constructed new items, provid-ing, however, the possibility to produce highest quality output (manually corrected before admitted to the lexicon).","(b) Linking elements, elision and modication operations may be listed, and a rule system may be designed to apply them, possibly in combination. When a previously unseen complex word is encountered, the rules are applied until possible base forms are found (rule approach).","(c) Wherever regular, knowledge about linking elements, as well as about elision and Umlautung may be noted together with paradigms of bases or with afxes (subregularity approach). For example, one may note that -ung takes -s- as a linking element when showing up as non-head of a compound, or that the afx -lich tends in most cases to enforce Umlautung (blau/blulich, blue/bluish).","Table 1 contains analyses of a few complex words, including productively constructed ones which are most likely not attested in corpora (they have English paraphrases in quotes). The analyses come from Gertwol2",", Word Manager3",", and DeKo. They allow us to draw conclusions as to which approach is followed by the systems.","The examples in (1a-d) in Table 1 test for compounds and their linking elements4",". (1b) is not attested but possible, whereas (1d) is impossible, because Hund has never been found with -es- as a linking element (thus the form is not analysed by DeKo). If Lingsoft analyses (1d) as if it were correct, this may be evidence for the rule approach. The examples in (2), (3) and (4) concern derivation, with the (a)-type examples attested and the others being possible words. The unavailability of analyses for (2b), (4b, c), as well as for (1b, c) in WordManager seems to indicate quite clearly the lexicon approach5",".","2","See e.g. (Koskenniemi and Haapalainen 1996); we used the demonstrator at the following URL (as of 20.3.2002): http://www.lingsoft.fi/cgi-bin/gertwol","3","See e.g. (Domenig and ten Hacken 1992); we used the demonstrator at the following URL (as of 20.3.2002): http://www.canoo.com","4","In Table 1, + in a cell indicates that the tool produces the intended analysis; indicates that no analysis is produced. English translations in quotes (...) indicate non-attested items. Note that we use this latter convention throughout the gures.","5","In fact, the public version of WordManager is indeed lexicon-based. It covers over 150.000 lemmas, as found in a very large newspaper corpus; a version which models productive word-formation is available internally (personal communication, Prof. Domenig, Canoo Engineering AG, December 2000).","If the lexicon approach is of limited use for the analysis of productively constructed words, the rule approach, on the other hand, is likely to accept too many, and possibly wrong items (see example 1d) or to lead to wrong analyses (e.g. Bau","erhaltung, building maintenance would receive a second, wrong, analysis as Bauer","haltung (farmer’s posture)). A merely rule-based approach would assign the compound Vergngungs","tempel (amusement hall) two analyses: Vergngung (amusement) + s + Tempel (lit: temple, here: hall), and Vergngung + Stempel (rubber stamp), without any linking element.","The subregularity approach, however, is rather complex and unhandy for both modeling and acquisition, since it relies on subregularities for both stems (and their paradigms) and afxes, both of which have numerous exceptions. -lich, for example, is often a trigger for Umlautung (blau/blulich, see above), but not always: Frau/fraulich (woman/feminine, womanly) without Umlaut, but Jungfrau/jungfrulich/*jungfraulich (virgin/virginal) obligatory with Umlaut.","Instead of the three approaches mentioned above, we have opted for another one, based on Fuhrhop (1998)’s notion of different types of stems."]},{"title":"2. Accounting for Stem Variation in German","paragraphs":["The problems of lexical modelling of the formal variation in German nouns, verbs and adjectives, depending on their use as simplex items or in derivation or compounding seem to be best captured by the notion of stem types in-troduced by Fuhrhop (1998). Following her work, we do not assume the existence of (theoretically not well motivated) linking elements, but we assume that there are different types of stems: next to the simplex stem, there may be separate derivational and/or compounding stems. 2.1. Three Kinds of Stems","The variation between simplex, derivational and compounding stem is encountered with free morphemes as well as with bound morphemes (e.g. afxes, such as -ung, have a form -ungs- when they appear as a non-head element of a compound, see Table 5 below for details). Table 2 shows simplex, derivational and compounding stems, along with examples.","As Table 2 shows, some items (e.g. Hund), but not all have different forms for the three types of stems (e.g. blau). These stems must be listed in the lexicon of the analyser.","This approach does not provide an explanation for the fact that there may be several derivational or compounding stems for one lexeme: Kind has Kinds-, Kinder-and Kindes-, as in Kinds","tod (cot death), Kinder","garten, Kindes","entfhrung (child kidnapping). We classify all three stems as compounding stems (the derivational stem is Kind-, cf. kind","lich, kind","isch, Kind","chen (childlike, childish, little child)). This procedure is sufcient for the purpose of analysis6",". 6","Although it is not for generation; it also accepts ungrammatical forms, such as *Kindes","garten; to avoid this, we may take the compounds with -s- and -es- as lexicalised (listed), only those with the -er- stem being indeed productive.","No. Candidate word EN paraphrase Lingsoft WordMngr DeKo 1a Hundekuchen dog biscuit + + + b Hundetorte dog cake + + c Hundenapf dog’s bowl + + d ","Hundesnapf dog’s bowl + 2a Studentenschaft student body + + + b Maurerschaft bricklayers’ body + 3a katzenhaft cat-like + + + b schhaft sh-like + + 4a lesbar readable + + + b schreibbar writeable + c schmeckbar tasteable + + Table 1: Complex words and their analyses in Gertwol, WordManager and DeKo.","Word formation Category free/ Simplex Comp./Der.

Selectional Properties of Afxes","It is a well established fact that derivational afxes select bases by category: e.g. -bar (-able) combines productively only with (transitive) verbs.","But there are other properties which play a role in the selection behaviour of afxes. One of them is the stem type: the afx -lich, for example, combines with the derivational stem, the same way as -lein, -chen and other afxes do. A few derivational afxes, however, select the compounding stem, the same one as used in compound formation. Examples are -haft, -los or the semi-afxes (-frei, -freudig, . . . ): Bauer/bauern","haft, bauern","los (farmer/farmer-like, free of farmers), with the same stem as Bauern","haus (farmhouse). For each derivational afx, the stem type which it selects can be identied (prominent examples are given in Table 3).","Some afxes in addition select only native (e.g. -lich) or only neoclassical stems (e.g. -abel), whereas others take bases of both types (e.g. -isch)."]},{"title":"3. Acquisition of Stem Data","paragraphs":["In the perspective of a stem-oriented approach to the analysis of complex words, which follows the descriptive work of Fuhrhop (1998), the acquisition problem is reduced to the task of nding, for each noun, verb and adjective lemma, next to the simplex stem also the derivational and compounding stem(s).","Selected Selected Afx Examples","category stem type expl (base/complex word)","noun deriv. -chen","Bauer/Buerchen -lein","Katze/Ktzlein","noun comp. -schaft","Student/Studentenschaft -tum","Bauer/Bauerntum","adjective deriv. -lich","rot/rtlich -eln","schwach/schwcheln","adjective comp. -heit","schwach/Schwachheit","verb deriv. -lich","kaufen/kuich","comp. -willig","kaufen/kaufwillig Table 3: Examples of afxes classied by their selection in terms of category and stem type of the base 3.1. Architecture","The principle of the acquisition architecture is quite simple. The procedures rely on the existing linguistic resources, i.e., a dictionary of about 20.000 simplex lemmas7 and knowledge about morphophonological restrictions for afxes. The tool suite is schematized in Figure 1.","Candidates in our acquisition experiments come from a list of 2.14 million word form types extracted from corpora of news texts totalling about 200 million word forms.","7","The lexicon contains in total about 45.000 lemmas of which a large portion are complex items which are lexicalised and there-fore listed.

Thereafter, the candidates are split into head and non-head, and non-heads are analysed morphophonologically (e.g. to un-do Umlautung), in order to relate them to known simplex stems. This provides tuples of the following:"," corpus word analysed;"," form of the non-head found in the corpus word (i.e., derivation or compounding stem);"," candidate lemma of the non-head as derived by morphophonological rules and cross-checked for category and lemma status in the simplex dictionary. 3.2. Presentation for Manual Checking","The data produced by means of the tool suite shown above are rearranged for manual checking: the material is grouped by lemmas (cf. the two lines for Auto (car),from derived forms with -chen and -lein) and the person in charge of checking only needs to mark wrong stem hypotheses, as shown in Figure 2.","For manual checking of compounding stems, an Emacs mode has been designed. In the upper half of a split screen, the potential stems are displayed with the corpus frequency of their use as non-head in the 200 million word corpus (see Figure 3 for two sample lines with markings9","). The corresponding examples are displayed underneath. For each stem, there are four actions: mark as correct, mark as wrong,or go to next or previous stem. Thus, a large candidate list can be processed in a fast, easy and accurate way.","30.214 stem candidates had to be manually checked. From these, 12.350 have been marked as valid non-heads, whereas 17.864 forms cannot function as compounding stems.","8","The assumption is that compounds behave the same way as their bases with respect to compounding and derivation stems: Buch Bchlein (book, little book) and Sparbuch Sparbchlein (savings book etc.) behave the same way, so Sparbuch can be removed (as redundant) from the candidate list for buch/bch; we are aware that there exist a few exceptions to this heuristic, as Frau fraulich vs. Jungfrau jungfrulich,  jungfraulich indicates.","9","The annotation [p] is provided by the tool to indicate paradigmic forms (plural, genitive, etc.)."]},{"title":"4. Results 4.1. Overview","paragraphs":["We have so far identied about 12.350 compounding stem forms for about 10.000 different noun lemmas, and about 1.800 derivation stem forms. The results were obtained with little effort. More corpora, including terminological ones, will be processed soon.","For example, for the noun Gott, (god) we have three different compounding stems:"," Gott- (as in Gott","vater (godfather)),"," Gottes- (as in Gottes","furcht (godliness)),"," Gtter- (as in Gtter","speise (ambrosia)). In addition, the lexical entry for Gott includes two derivation stems:"," Gott- (as in Gott","heit (deity)),"," Gtt- (as in gtt","lich (divine)).","All stems proposed by the automatic acquisition system have been manually checked; derivational stems are hypothesized with very high accuracy, and the compounding stem candidates are of acceptable quality as well.","In many cases, we get multiple evidence for one stem hypothesis: for example, the derivation stem schwch- for the adjective schwach (weak) is present in schwcheln","(be somewhat weak), schwchen","(weaken), Schwche","(weakness), schwchlich","(somewhat weak). When we have several word types which can be seen as converging evidence for one stem hypothesis, but no evidence of another hypothesis, as in the cases of Vergngungstempel or ","Hundes- discussed above, we have at least good reasons for excluding the non-attested forms. 4.2. Improving Disambiguation Power","On the basis of stem data (and knowledge about the morphological structure of the word in question), false ambiguities at the level of compound components can be solved easily; more examples of the kind of Vergngungstempel are given in Table 4, below. Note that the heads under hypothesis 2 in the table, i.e. Teller (plate), Teig (dough), Samt (velvet), Tat (act), Haltung (posture), Tand (trash) and Aal (eel), are all well-formed Corpus word Proposed analyses Lemma hyp.

In ","Antrags","teller, the compound stem hypothesis is not wrong, as Antrags","formular (application form), Antrags","frist (deadline for application) show. Similarly, Generals- is found in Generals","uniform (general’s uniform), Generals","besprechung (general’s conference). In the case of Kursaal, Kurs- can indeed not be a compound stem of Kur (cure), but it is a compound stem of Kurs (rate). To decide that the second hypothesis for the analysis of the examples (6) to (8) in Table 4 is unacceptable, we need world knowledge rather than linguistic knowledge.","We have extracted noun+noun compounds from a 200 million word corpus with ambiguous analyses in the above-mentioned sense. Among the top 150 ambiguous items, sorted according to their frequency of occurrence in the corpus (these items have a total frequency of 72.795 in 200 million), only 17 ambiguities could not be resolved with the methods described here; thus 88,67 % of the types from this small sample are analysed correctly. 4.3. Improving Generalisation Power","Moreover, we can generalise over large portions of the complex vocabulary, by formulating entries for the derivational and compounding stems of afxes: the stems are in-herited from the afxes (i.e. the derivational heads) to the derived words. Examples of a few frequent afxes are given in Table 5, below, along with the type frequency of the compounds where they occur as non-heads, as well as with the token frequency of the respective compounds, each within our 200 million words news corpus. In addition, we give one example of each type.","These types alone make up for 14 % of all noun+noun compounds in our corpus."]},{"title":"5.

In comparison with the rule approach (cf. section 1.3.), we expect that our approach will considerably reduce the number of ambiguities in the analysis of complex items (cf. Table 4).","It should be noted, however, that the rule approach and the subregularity approach produce at least reasonable results on a large portion of German compounds. From 21.424 compounds analysed with our tools, 43.22 % have a compounding stem which is identical to the simplex stem. Another 54.89 % have one of the nine linking elements -s-, -n-, -en-, -e-, -er-, -es-, -o-, -nen-, -ns-, -ien-, -ens-, and only less than 2% have elision and/or umlaut, possibly with linking elements (there is considerably more Umlautung in derivation). Thus, for a rough rst analysis, a less sophisticated approach may be sufcient.","Our approach has, however, additional potential with respect to the analysis of neoclassical word formation. In line with the stem approach and with Ldeling et al. (2002), we also assume the existence of two (or more) stems (called ‘short’ and ‘long’, for the moment) in neoclassical word formation. Thus, we note the stems demonstr-and demonstrat-, to cover demonstr","ieren, Demonstr","ant, demonstr","abel vs. Demonstrat","ion, demonstrat","iv. Such stems can again be acquired with the same principles and tools as shown, because of the selection preferences of neoclassical afxes.
