Introduction","paragraphs":["One of the purposes of this research is to formalize prototype concepts of a noun by using attributes associated from the noun. We extracted various attributes from nouns by associative experiments and calculated similarity between the nouns and its lower-level concepts. In this paper we formalized an expression of prototype concepts (Rosch,1975) using the similarities. The prototype concepts were verified quantitatively by comparing them with results of questionnaires asking human subjects about prototype concepts from the nouns. The other purpose is to extract concepts representing features of nouns by adjectives or adjective-like words by the associative experiments and to formalize importance values with them(Ando,1999). Results obtained from the research will be applied to information retrieval systems, flexible question-answering systems, or automatic construction systems for concept dictionaries.","Nouns have various attributes as well as their word senses written in linguistic dictionaries. For example, a concept of fruit has attributes such as “food”, “has-seed”, “has-vitamin c” or “delicious”. One of the ways to obtain such attributes is an associative experiment with humans(Okamoto,2001a).","Large-scale association experiments were done to extract attributes from nouns. Stimulus words were consisting of basic nouns that were selected from textbooks used at Japanese elementary schools. Association was done from stimulus words with 7 tasks, generalized concepts, lower-level concepts, part/material concepts, features, synonyms, action concepts and situation concepts.","Similarity was calculated between nouns by using their associated attributes with inner product methods. The nouns were connected in a hierarchical structure using generalized or specific relations obtained by using results of the association experiments. This paper discusses similarity between nouns using their attributes along the hierarchical structure as well as the prototype of Japanese noun concepts. We found that the similarity of attributes of nouns located at lower levels has high score in many cases. Using the similarities, prototype of a concept can be formalized in order to find typical concepts among its lower-level concepts. The results have good correspondence with questionnaires with human subjects."]},{"title":"2. Associative Concept Dictionary","paragraphs":["G. H. Kent and A. J. Rosanoff reported the large-scale study of associative experiments in 1910(Miller,1991). They read aloud a list of 100 stimulus words to a subject who was instructed to give “the first word that occurs to you other than the stimulus word.” The number of the subjects is 1000 men and women and they have different occupations and level of education. As a result most of the associated words can be classified as instances of just four kinds of connotative semantic relations: ","1. Super-ordinate, coordinate, and subordinate terms: terms that arrange things in a taxonomic tree","2. Attributive terms: modifying terms that state the values of attributes of things","3. Part –whole relation: terms that name a part of something, or that name the whole of which something is a part","4. Functional terms: terms that designate the ends that things serve – what things normally do or what is normally done with them ","We carried out associative experiments for the purpose of constructing an associative concept dictionary. The association experiments consist of a set of a stimulus noun and seven tasks. In the total of 1,000 stimulus nouns, about 800 are chosen from \"basic nouns\" in Japanese elementary school textbooks. 200 of the nouns were chosen from basic nouns obtained through the association experiments.","The 7 tasks are generalized concepts, lower-level concepts, part/material concepts, features, synonyms, action-concepts and situation concepts in each stimulus noun.","Current total number of associated words is more than one hundred and twenty three thousand.","Subjects include undergraduate students and master course students at Keio University. Number of subjects for a stimulus word is fifty for this research. Some of the stimulus words have ten subjects but the subject number is now increasing to fifty.","The association experiment is carried out on the computer network in Keio University, Shonan Fujisawa Campus. The procedure of the experiment is as follows. A subject associates to a stimulus word and inputs associated words into the system using a word processor. Then the system calculates an association time, an order of an associated words, and frequency of associated words.","Distance between a stimulus word and its associated word is calculated quantitatively using a linear programming method.","Let the distance, D, between a stimulus word and an associated word be shown in the following linear function: "]},{"title":"D=αF+βS+γT , ","paragraphs":["where 3 parameters T, S and F are defined by "]},{"title":"F = N n, = N 10 1 , S = 1 n si , T = 1 n  ti 60 .

We need δ because the number of the subjects is not fixed and ranged from 10 to 50.","The boundary conditions in the linear programming method are defined in the following two cases.","1.”all of the subjects associate the word”, “the word is associated at first” and “response time is short”","2.”the number of subject that associate the word is only one”, “an association order is low” and “response time is considerably long”","By using the Simplex method, α , β and γ were calculated.

Analysis of Similarity Tendency by Using Inheritance of Attributes","paragraphs":["As for the inheritance of attributes in a hierarchical structure, it is generally said that attributes in higher level concepts are inherited to those of lower level concept.

The number of associated words depends on tasks or the stimulus nouns themselves. We selected the four different types of categories for this research based on average numbers of associated words with a task of lower level concepts.","“Norimono” has many associated words in a task of part/material concepts. ”Fruit” has many associated words in action concepts. “Furniture” and “musical instrument” have little difference on the number of the associated words.","For the sake of convenience, we called the similarity between the highest level concept and the middle level concept as Similarity A. The similarity between the middle level concept and the lowest level concept is Similarity B. Finally, the similarity between the highest level concept and the lowest level concept is Similarity C.

We also found Similarity A is larger than Similarity C.","We found two characteristics of this similarity inheritance. One is that both the averages of similarity A and B have high similarity values such as “norimono” and “fruit”. Similarity A of “norimono” and that of “fruit” are more than 0.7 and Similarity B of these categories has also a high value. On the other hand, the similarity A of categories whose lower level concepts have a variety of features, such as shapes or usages of “furniture” and “musical instrument,” is less than about 0.6 and Similarity B has higher values than those of Similarity A.

Prototype of Category","paragraphs":["One of words in a category can be a prototype and others have less prototypeness..

Questionnaire Experiment of Prototype","paragraphs":["At first, we thought that the words with low distance values in the associative concept dictionary would be prototypes. After watching the dictionary, we found that this is not the case. To get a perspective of prototypes, we made questionnaire experiments. Requests to the subjects to get prototypes for a concept were “please list up three words just like the given concepts.”","Prototypes of categories depend on subject’s situation. For example, robins are familiar in the US and can be typical birds. On the other hand, in Japan robins are not familiar and cannot be a prototype. In the questionnaire experiments, subjects are students at Keio University. The result of our experiments will show prototypes of young Japanese people.","We gave points to the words listed up by the subjects. The point to a word listed at the first position is 3, the second word 2, and the third 1.We arranged the words according to the points by summing up the point with each subject. As a result we find that the questionnaire results differ from that depending on the low distance values of lower-level concepts. In the case of “furniture,” Table 7 shows that the order of lower-level concept differs from the order of questionnaire. In the case of “fruit,” Table 8 shows that the order of lower-level concept and the order of questionnaire are almost same.","We calculated the similarity about part/material concepts, features, and action concepts in associative concept dictionary to extract crucial information to define the prototypes.
