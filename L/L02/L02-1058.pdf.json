Languages covered in this SpeechDat-based project are Cypriote Greek, Turkish, Hebrew, different varieties of Arabic, French, English and German. Within the project’s lifetime of 30 months, starting in September 2001, OrienTel will produce a set of 22 databases, develop dialect adaptation techniques, conduct research into multilingual acoustic modelling and deploy two demonstrators as a proof of concept. "]},{"title":"1. 2.  Introduction and goal of the paper","paragraphs":["Like all other members of the SpeechDat family of data collections, OrienTel is driven by an international industrial and academic consortium.1","This time the coordinator is Philips Speech Processing, the other participants being ELDA, IBM, Knowledge, the University of Patras, Siemens, NSC, Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, and Lucent Technologies. OrienTel resembles previous SpeechDat-like undertakings2","insofar as the recordings are supposed to serve the broadest possible application areas, ranging from simple command and control services to unified messaging, information retrieval, customer care, banking, WAP and service portals. It is different from previous projects, however, as it takes SpeechDat to a variety of non-European languages such as Arabic, Hebrew and Turkish, which require far-reaching adaptations to database design and annotation standards. The aim of the present paper is to introduce the broad setup of OrienTel, give an account of the present status of database design, and to call for a joint effort in producing language resources for the Mediterranean and the Middle East.",""]},{"title":"Commercial and technological settings","paragraphs":["The OrienTel region presents a very heterogeneous picture both from a technological and a commercial point of view. In terms of purchasing power measured in US$ per capita, the potential OrienTel countries range from Yemen's 304 to the United Arab Emirates' 16,800. In"," 1 Thanks go to the European Commission, who are funding OrienTel as an R&D project under the 5th","Framework Programme (Contract IST-2000-28373). 2 Infos on SpeechDat and related projects can be gathered from http://www.speechdat.org . Publications focusing on specific members of the SpeechDat family are, for example, Höge/Tropf 1996 (SpeechDat M), Höge et al. 1999 (SpeechDat II), Pollak et al. 2000 (SpeechDat East), Moreno et al. 2000a (SpeechDat Car), and Moreno et al. 2000b (SALA). terms of the telecommunications infrastructure, the fixed line teledensity ranges again from Yemen's 1.4 per cent coverage to Cyprus' 54 per cent, the number of mobile service subscribers from virtually zero for Syria to 7,871,500 in Egypt (CIT Publications 2000). State of the art technology in many of the Gulf States stands in sharp contrast to the outmoded systems installed in countries such as Yemen or Syria. Largely due to such infrastructural and commercial considerations, the OrienTel consortium chose nine out of a potential set of 19 countries between Morocco in the West and the Gulf States in the East. The countries treated in OrienTel so far are depicted in Table 1:","","Country Partner","UAE Philips","Saudi Arabia Lucent","Israel/Palestine NSC","Egypt IBM","Tunisia UPC/ELDA","Morocco ELDA/UPC","Turkey Siemens","Cyprus Knowledge/Patras Univ. Table 1: OrienTel countries and partners  More countries may follow in case new partners","decide to join the project."]},{"title":"3. Linguistic settings","paragraphs":["From a linguistic point of view, too, the OrienTel region is far more diverse than any region covered in previous projects of a similar scope such as the various members of the SpeechDat-family or SpeeCon (Siemund et al. 2000, cf. also http://www.speecon.com). In order to treat the linguistic peculiarities of the area adequately, OrienTel follows a different strategy than previous SpeechDat projects. As Table 1 shows, each partner in the consortium is not responsible for a single language but for a whole country. The difference is an important one, since, as will be outlined below, in most OrienTel countries everyday-life is governed by more than a single language. One of the first project tasks was therefore to determine the various languages spoken in the OrienTel region, taking into account both linguistic and commercial criteria. From the consortium’s point of view Arabic, Turkish, Hebrew and Cypriote Greek turned out to be of most immediate concern with Farsi being on the wish list for future stages of the project. Furthermore, English and French turned out to be of commercial interest as the dominant business languages in some OrienTel countries and because non-native varieties of European languages constitute a hitherto grossly neglected domain in linguistic research. This is also the reason why OrienTel’s language portfolio is complemented by German as spoken by Turks in Germany, who represent the largest linguistic minority of the country.","The most complex linguistic picture of the OrienTel region, however, is no doubt presented by Arabic and its variants. Arabic of the OrienTel area can be subdivided into four broad dialect regions, as outlined in Table 2:"," Dialect region Countries Mahgreb Arabic Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, parts of","Libya Egyptian Arabic Egypt, parts of Libya Levantine Arabic Syria, Lebanon, Israel + Palestine","Authorities, Jordan Gulf Arabic Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, UAE,","Saudi Arabia, Oman Table 2: Dialect regions of Arabic","","In order to represent all dialect regions adequately, all areas are attended to by at least one partner. In each country, the variety of languages spoken is rather large. In Morocco, for example, the official language is Modern Standard Arabic, the rather formal language of religion, the media and of public institutions. In everyday interaction though, people either tend to speak a local colloquial variant of Arabic that is only remotely related to the Standard (not to mention the various non-Arabic languages such as Berber) or, when it comes to commercial interaction, French as the language inherited from Morocco’s colonial past. All three (or even more) languages have their place in everyday life and userfriendly applications have to take into account each country’s linguistic diversity and its users’ preferences.

Linguistic research and dialect adaptation","paragraphs":["The rather complicated linguistic situation in the OrienTel countries calls for innovative approaches to speech recognition techniques. Thorough research will be conducted into multilingual acoustic modelling and the development of multilingual lexicons, including descriptions of phonetic inventories. An important goal will also be the development of phonetic and orthographic transcription strategies. By default written Arabic and Hebrew orthography depict consonants only. Even though it is possible to render vowels by supra- and supersegmental markers, fluent reading of such \"annotated\" words is awkward even for native speakers. Strategies will therefore be developed to prompt speakers reliably even if the meaning of, for example, a single command word cannot be gathered from the context of whole sentences. The problem of vowels is of particular importance especially since it is largely the vowels on which current Hidden Markov Modelling heavily relies (cf. Rabiner/Juang 1993). Once parts of the various databases become available, it will therefore be one of the main research tasks to assess the linguistic features of dialect clusters and develop techniques of dialect adaptation across the Arabic-speaking world.",""]},{"title":"Foreign accent adaptation","paragraphs":["Apart from the databases representing Standard varieties and local dialects, a separate set of data will be produced for foreign accent adaptation. Due to the OrienTel countries' colonial, protectorate or migration history, the most prominent foreign languages in the region are French, English and, for different reasons, German. On the one hand, collecting data of this kind will ensure true multilinguality of applications in the OrienTel countries. On the other hand, French, English and German services already under operation in the EU can be adapted to foreign accent variation.",""]},{"title":"Demonstrator development","paragraphs":["In order to show that the multilinguality approach taken in OrienTel is feasible, the project will produce two demonstrator applications. The exact kind of services will be specified at a later stage of the project. Considerations will, however, take into account the convergence of internet, WAP and voice for service portals, unified messaging, customer care applications, directory assistance and banking. The two demonstrators will reflect two different types of services and will account for two different linguistic regions.",""]},{"title":"7. 8. 8.1. 8.2. 8.3. 8.4.  Dissemination of information and results","paragraphs":["In order to keep the speech recognition community informed about the OrienTel efforts, the project will contribute to scientific discussions concerning the languages of the OrienTel region at conferences, in publications and through relevant mailing lists. It will furthermore continuously update the project's website with information on OrienTel activities and publish the results (cf. section 9 below). The 22 databases will be made publicly available through the European Language Resources Association (ELRA) in due course after the project has ended.",""]},{"title":"Database specification","paragraphs":["Due to the linguistic heterogeneity of the region, questions of database specification such as corpus composition, orthographic and phonetic transcription strategies constitute a crucial part of the project. Particularly Arabic and Hebrew pose interesting problems for speech recognition that were never tackled in projects of the OrienTel scale before. Cases in point are the rendering of vowels, the right-to-left writing system and the transcription of oral or colloquial speaking styles. While at the time of writing the present paper quite a few design details are still under discussion (the design phase is due for completion before the LREC2002 conference starts), some of the cornerstones can already be reported at the present stage."]},{"title":"Recording scenarios and platforms","paragraphs":["All OrienTel databases will be recorded from fixed and mobile networks via ISDN lines and multiple channels, i.e. either through a Basic Rate Interface or a Primary Rate Interface (cf. Senia 1998). A dialogue will be implemented by the application driving the recordings. The dialogues will be designed to make the caller speak and act comfortably."]},{"title":"Corpus and vocabulary","paragraphs":["Data collections will rely on three separate sets of","prompt sheets, namely one each for  • the ‘foreign’ languages in Arabic-speaking","countries, i.e. English and French, including","Turkish, Greek, Hebrew and German • Modern Standard Arabic • Modern Colloquial Arabic  While the specifications for English, French, Greek","and German are largely based on previous SpeechDat","projects and SpeeCon, the design for Arabic and Turkish","presents a novelty. All three sets of prompt sheets,","however, contain the following items, though in varying","quantities with at least 47 items per sheet:  • isolated digits • digit and number strings • natural numbers • currency amounts • yes/no questions • dates • times • application keywords and phrases • word spotting phrase using embedded application","words • directory assistances names (proper names, place","names, company names) • spellings • phonetically rich words and sentences • spontaneous utterances"]},{"title":"Transcription and annotation","paragraphs":["The OrienTel transcription and annotation conventions are largely based on conventions used by the Linguistic Data Consortium and ARPA in producing the ATIS CD-ROMs3",", and the simplifications made for the SpeechDat-predecessors of this project, and SpeeCon. The goal of the specification document that is currently being drafted is to define a coarse transcription that can be performed quickly, but covers adequately the acoustic events most important for the training and testing of automatic speech recognisers. The transcription is orthographic (cf. the lexicon section below for phonetic renderings) and includes a few markers representing audible acoustic events (speech and non-speech) present in the corresponding waveform files. The phoneme symbol set aims at the localisation of the main acoustic events according to a coarse categorisation rather than a full description of all possible sounds that may appear during a recording. Extra marks contained in the transcription aid in interpreting the text form of the utterance; markers for non-speech acoustic events and distortions have been chosen such that they can be automatically removed or modified to yield the base transcription. The overall aim is to keep as much speech in the corpus as possible and to avoid the need for deleting recordings from the corpus due to some extra noises, disfluencies, etc. All items for all languages covered will be transcribed in standard orthography and will be romanized in the label files. A Sampa transliteration will be generated and discussed with the Department of Phonetics and Linguistics at UCL (cf. http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/sampa/home.htm) if need be. Administrative information on speech files and their properties will be stored in SAM files (cf. http://www.icp.grenet.fr/Relator/standsam.html)."]},{"title":"Specification of speakers","paragraphs":["The number of speakers to be recorded is 2000 per country.

Language-specific cases should be documented in the LSPs.","The specific number of dialects relevant to each country should be discussed in the LSP documentation. The distribution of speakers over dialect regions refers only to the colloquial varieties of the language. Speech should be collected from a minimum of three different dialect regions (if possible), with at least 20 speakers recorded for each defined dialect.","The speaker’s dialectal region is determined by asking the question “in which district did you grow up” or “where did you spend most of your childhood”, not the question “where do you live”. The allocation of city/district names to the corresponding dialect region can be determined according to the information provided by each partner in the LSP documentation.","Distribution of environments","The speaker distribution for the mobile network should be between 65 to 75% of the total number of speakers in the database; e.g., if there are 1000 speakers in the database, between 650 and 750 of them should be recorded through the mobile network.
