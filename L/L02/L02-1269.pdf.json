Introduction","paragraphs":["Within the past project \"SpeechDat Across Latin America\" (SALA) [Moreno 2000], a large number of databases were recorded in Latin America. Databases have 1000-2000 speakers each and were designed to have enough data to train ASR systems for fixed network telephone applications in any Latin American country. The quick development of mobile/cellular telephony makes necessary to extend the ASR systems to mobile networks. There is a lack of public domain databases recorded from mobile telephones in America. CTIMIT is the only one available in the LDC1","and was obtained playing back TIMIT through cellular telephones. In Europe, a set of databases recorded in the framework of the SpeechDat project can be found in the ELRA2 catalogue. The goal of the current project 'SpeechDat across all America' (SALA II) is the collection of a large number of databases in Latin America, US and Canada. The speech databases created in the project cover all dialectal regions of America representing the dialectal variants of English, French, Portuguese and Spanish languages. America is divided in large recording areas where a database is created. Further, a fine dialectal map is defined for each recording area. Each database will be composed by up to 4000 speakers. Utterances will be recorded directly from calls made from cellular telephones and are composed by read text and answers to specific questions. The goal of the project should be reached within the year 2003. The databases are dedicated for training speaker independent speech recognisers applicable for mobile/cellular network telephone applications. Most of the database will be public available through ELRA.","This paper describes the consortium, goals of the project and specifications of the databases. Section II describes the organisation, structure and partners of the  1 http://www.ldc.upenn.edu 2 http://www.icp.grenet.fr/ELRA/home.html SALA II consortium. Sections III and IV describes the recording areas and databases to be produced in the project. Section V describes the specifications and section VI deals with the validation procedure of the databases produced in the consortium."]},{"title":"2. Organization of the SALA II Project","paragraphs":["The SALA II project is founded by an Industrial consortium. Members of the consortium are: Natural Speech Communication (Israel), Siemens AG (Germany), Philips Speech Processing Aachen (Germany), Microsoft Corp, (United States), Telisma (France), Applied Technologies on Language and Speech, S. L. \"ATLAS\" (Spain), Loquendo, (Italy) and Lucent Technologies (United States). All these members produce at least one database in the project. Additionally, two other members compose the consortium: Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya \"UPC\" (Spain), that is the co-ordinator of the project and Speech Processing Expertise Centre \"SPEX\" (Netherlands) that performs the validation of the produced databases.","All industrial members produce a database in Latin America and optionally, a database in US and Canada. The consortium is open to industrial or public members. All members that produce a database in Latin America have access to the databases produced in Latin America. The same criterion applies to the databases produced in US and Canada."]},{"title":"3. Recording areas and databases produced in the project","paragraphs":["As mentioned above, the objective of the SALA II project is to create speech databases to train speech recognition systems for many telephone cellular oriented applications in any American country. The speech databases created in the project cover all dialectal regions of America representing the dialectal variants of the English, French, Portuguese and Spanish languages. For this need America is divided in large recording areas and a set of databases and their corresponding dialectal coverage have been defined and accepted by the consortium. The list is split in two groups, the Latin American group and the US & Canada group.","The Latin America group includes eighth databases, 1000 speakers each, covering the most important Spanish and Portuguese dialectal variants. The definition and partner responsible of the collection is shown in Table 1: Country Partner Brazil Philips Speech.Proc. Mexico NSC Caribbean: Venezuela ATLAS Central America: Costa Rica Telisma Colombia Siemens A.G. Peru Microsoft Corp. Chile Loquendo Argentina Lucent Technologies","Table 1: SALA II databases produced in Latin America and partners","In the US & Canada group up to four databases have been defined to cope with English and Spanish as spoken in USA and French and English as spoken in Canada. Table 2 shows the databases to be produced in US and Canada, the number of speakers to be collected and the partners involved. At the moment of writing this paper, no company is willing to record Canadian English yet.

Dialectal distribution of each database","paragraphs":["It' s necessary that each database produced in the consortium have a good representation of all the dialects spoken in the area is being recorded. In the former SALA project Latin America was divided into eighth large recording areas with similar broad dialect variation. Each area is composed by one or more countries. For each of the Spanish spoken Latin America databases to be produced in the consortium a fine dialectal division was defined [Moreno, 1997], [Moreno 2000]. In the current SALA II project, the same distribution is going to be used.","Concerning Brazil, US Spanish and US English, a similar study has been made. The final distribution for each database is shown below."]},{"title":"4.1. Brazil","paragraphs":["Brazil has a global population of about 159 million inhabitants (1997). Administratively it is divided into 26 states plus a Federal District (capital of the country). The distribution of the population is quite heterogeneous. Excepting the South-East region, that concentrates large population in its interior, people are concentrated in the eastern coast. Additionally, some metropolitan regions group significant part of country’s inhabitants.","From a linguistic point of view, Brazilian Portuguese is more regular in pronunciation than Portuguese language. Up to now there is not sufficient scientific information available about the differences that separate the regional varieties existing in Brazil. Therefore, a detailed classification as for the Portuguese dialects is not possible. Still, it exists a proposal of classification based mainly in differences of pronunciation into five major dialectal regions (macro linguistics regions): South (Paranaense, Catarinense, Gaúcho), São Paulo (Grande São Paulo, Litoral paulista, Centro paulista, Oeste paulista), South-East (Carioca, Mineiro, Capixaba), North-East (Baiano, Pernambucano, Cearense), and North plus Centre-West (Centro-Norte, Amazonense, Centro Oeste). As there were three important migration flows in Brazil in the last 60, there are many dialects spoken in the large regional centres and in the north and Centre-West regions, which are not originals of these places. Any collect made in those regions will include their own dialects as well as dialects of other regions.","Based in the economical importance of each region (measured in this case by its population and telephonic density), and by considering the mix of dialects present in some of them, the target population chosen to represent each region is the following: Region","Population (%)","Target","speakers South 15% 200 São Paulo 23% 225 South-East 21% 225 North-East 25% 275 North & Centre-West 16% 75 Total 100% 1000","Table 3: Brazilian database: dialectal regions, population and target distribution of speakers to be recorded."]},{"title":"4.2. US Spanish","paragraphs":["The total US population in the United States is around 240 millions inhabitants (1990). The total Hispanic population is 22 million inhabitants. Table 4 shows the distribution of the Hispanic US population in terms of their specific origin dialect. In this table, the origin dialects are grouped as defined in [Moreno 1997].","It becomes obvious that most of the Hispanic population is either Mexican 61%, or Caribbean (Puerto Rican, Cuban, Dominican) 19,26 %. Therefore, the recordings concentrate on the first two dialects (Mexican and Caribbean Spanish). The collection will be done where they appear most, that is: California, Texas, New York and Florida. Dialect origin Population % Mexican 61.19 Caribbean 19.26 Central American 5.33 Colombian and Panamanian 2.14 Peruvian and Ecuadorian 1.5 Miscell. Central and South 1.6 Miscellaneous Other 8.98 Total Hispanic 100","Table 4: Relative distribution of Hispanic population in US in terms of their dialectal origin. 4.2.1. Bilingualism","For doing the US_Spanish data collection, the fact of bilingualism Spanish/English in the U.S. has to be considered. Especially younger people who have been growing up in the States will tend to use both languages together, therefore mixing US_Spanish with English and vice versa, also within an application. This means that a certain percentage of Hispano-English has to be covered as well, in order to be able to switch between the two languages while using the recognition system. So approximately 5% of the corpus should be made up by English words, especially names (company, brand, person and city names) and in the phonetically rich sentences.","With this approach, it should be possible to deliver a US_Spanish lexicon while using the US_Spanish phoneme inventory plus a separate Hispanic English lexicon with a US_English phoneme inventory."]},{"title":"4.3. US English","paragraphs":["A database of 4000 speakers will be recorded in","English as spoken in US.

There are two constrains. One affects to the full database as a whole, and the other affects each dialectal region defined in the database. Table 7 shows the distribution of speakers by environment to be applied in each database.

Additionally, some noise marks are added at transcription time: Speaker noise, background or stationary noise, intermittent noise and distortions due to mobile channel such as fading or loss of signal."]},{"title":"5.5.

In such case, analogue lines will be used instead."]},{"title":"6. Validation","paragraphs":["Validation, as the term is used in the area of speech database collection, refers to the quality evaluation of a database against a checklist of relevant criteria. These criteria typically consist of the specifications of the databases, as defined at the start of the project, supplemented by a number of tolerance margins for these specifications (Van den Heuvel, 2000). In a project such as SALA II, it is of utmost importance that the produced collections are of equal quality. This warrants that the exchange of the databases between consortium partners is fair. As in SALA, the Speech Processing Expertise Centre, SPEX, was chosen as the validation centre for the project (Moreno et al., 2000)."]},{"title":"6.1. Validation procedure","paragraphs":["Validation is performed in two steps. In the first step, called “pre-validation”, a complete mini-database of 10 speakers is compiled for each language and checked before substantial parts of the database are recorded. This pre-validation aims at avoiding design errors that may otherwise show up after completion of the database and are irremediable at that time. The second step is final validation that is performed on the completed database. A third step can be necessary, if the database should be rejected after validation. In that case, a corrected version can be offered for re-validation.","The pre-validations of the databases recorded in SALA II are estimated to take place after the summer of this year, whereas the validations of the completed databases are scheduled for year 2003."]},{"title":"6.2. Validation criteria","paragraphs":["The validation checks pertain to the following features of the databases: - information in the documentation files - completeness of the recordings - format of the files - speaker characteristics - recording conditions - acoustic quality of the speech files - transcription - lexicon completeness and phone symbol set The validation criteria are taken from the SpeechDat II","project, more specifically those defined for the mobile","recordings (Van den Heuvel, 1997). Typically new for","SALA II are: - Each application word should appear at least 125","times at orthographic transcription level (=","#speakers/8); - Each phoneme in the phonetically rich sentences","should appear at least 100 times at orthographic","transcription level (= #speakers/10); - Idem for phonetically rich words;","- A maximum of 5% of the speakers may call twice;","- Each dialect in a database should be represented by at least (50 x size of the database/1000) speakers;","- In each dialect at least 20% of the speakers are recorded in the vehicle, public place and street environments;","- In each dialect at least 20% of the speakers are recorded in the home/office environment"]},{"title":"7.
