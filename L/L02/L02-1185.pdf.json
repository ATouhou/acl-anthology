The study of the melody generally includes the analysis of the local melody events relating to the accent and the declination of the global melody contour of an utterance. In this paper, we will present an experimental study of the declination phenomenon concerning the Arabic language. Our observations and results are of a great contribution for the quality of synthesis in our Text-To-Speech system PARADIS (Psola ARAbic DIsyllable Synthesizer). The melodic model that we have integrated in PARADIS is based on the prediction of a declination line on which local melodic events related to stressed syllables would be superimposed. Our study will include the description and the classification of the declination line in a context of isolated sentences. The classification will be established mainly according to the modality and the number of syllables in the sentence. We will also study the phenomenon related to the resetting of F0 value which often affect the declination."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["Our speech synthesis system PARADIS is able to synthesize any completely vowelled Arabic text. It is based on concatenation of disyllables using TD-PSOLA synthesizer (Chenfour et al., 2000). In order to improve the quality of synthesis, it is imperative to incorporate the melodic processing in our system. We then studied the two principal melodic phenomena : the declination that affect the whole sentence and the melodic events generally related to the presence of stressed syllables.","In this paper we are interested only by the declination witch is a universal phenomenon in all languages (Beaugendre, 1994). Modeling the declination in a TTS system makes it possible to increase the naturalness of the synthesis which would be practically absent if no declination is made.","To perform a melodic analysis of the corpus, we realized an analysis system WinF0 based on a short-term temporal algorithm inspired from the AMDF algorithm (Doval, 1994). This system visualize the curves of the temporal signal, energy and F0. It produces the semi-automatic syllables labeling, and also extract all declination information from the signal.","The quantification of the declination will be established by computing the slopes for the top line and the base line of the fundamental frequency. These two lines represent the dynamic of the F0 values from the beginning to the end of the sentence.","The last section in this paper is related to the analysis of another event which often accompanies the declination, namely the F0 reset. We then compute the partial top and base lines on each group of the sentence delimited by an F0 reset occurrence. Moreover, we will study F0 reset for sentences which end with a descending melodic contour and those with an ascending melodic contour."]},{"title":"2. Melodic analysis system","paragraphs":["To establish a melodic model it is necessary to have reliable tools for calculation and treatment of the F0 curve. To this end, we realized an analysis system WinF0 (figure 1).","The system gives possibilities to select a portion or the totality of the speech signal for listening and to perform a semi-automatic labeling. To refine the process of labeling, the knowledge of the signal energy curve is generally very useful. This functionality is also integrated in WinF0.

F0 computing method","paragraphs":["The F0 algorithm integrated in our analysis system is an alternative of the algorithm AMDF (Average Magnitude Function Difference). This algorithm consists in minimizing a function of dissimilarity F(t) which is based on the difference between an extracted frame and a same size frame shifted with t samples on the signal :  s )( n 1i i 1"]},{"title":"∑ ∑","paragraphs":["= = +− = n i tii ss tF","where N represents the size of the frame to be analyzed, (Si)i=1, N represent its samples and (Si+t )i=1, N the samples of a same size frame shifted by t samples number, t ∈ [ 1, N ].","The denominator term normalize the F(t) function in order to make comparisons with an absolute threshold. This threshold is calculated experimentally and allows us to decide for the periodicity (voiced/unvoiced) of the analyzed frame."]},{"title":"2.2. Declination computing method","paragraphs":["There is certainly no method making it possible to quantify in a faithful way the declination line. The majority of the authors define it by a linear factor over the length of the sentence : the declination slope. Consequently, we established in the WinF0 system a method of computing slopes relating to the top and base lines, based on the local F0 extremums. This method is based on the linear regression, which permits to represent the global tendency of a chronological data set by a leastsquares line. The principal informations generated by the system are the equations of the two lines of declination, their slope, the initial and final F0 frequencies (table 1 and figure 2)."]},{"title":"Sentence : « » /eîta ray tut tav ki rah / Number of syllables : 7 Total duration : 1426 ms Initial Frequency : 129 Hz Final Frequency : 83 Hz Top line Base line Equation -30*x+139.245 -20*x+111.867 Slope -0.907 ST/syl -0.727 ST/syl","paragraphs":["Table 1: Slopes of the top and base lines estimated for the declarative sentence \" \"/ eit̂araytu ttavkirah /.

Study of the declination","paragraphs":["The study of the declination is made according to the phrase modality. Therefore, we recorded by three male speakers a corpus of 90 isolated sentences, representing the various phrase modality in Arabic language. The declarative and exclamatory sentences were recorded in a narrative style. On the other hand, imperative, interrogative and call sentences were recorded in a dialogued style.","We will determine the slopes of the top and base lines for each sentence of the corpus. Thus, for each speaker and each phrase modality, we will statistically compute the tendency of the slopes of these lines depending on the number of syllables, then we determine the average tendencies on the three speakers."]},{"title":"3.1. Declarative modality","paragraphs":["For each declarative sentence of the corpus we calculated the values of the slopes for the top and base lines. All the slopes obtained are negative i.e. the top and base lines are decreasing from the start to the end of the sentence. This phenomenon was already observed in many studies for other languages (Beaugendre, 1994). Moreover, the slopes of the long sentences are weaker than those obtained for the short ones.","As an example, we present in the figure 3 a graph of the declination slopes values computed for one speaker. We have represented the values of the slopes in –ST/Syl, so that their decreasing will be quite illustrated. Thus, we can notice that the degree of the slopes of the top and base lines decrease when the number of syllables increases.","This decrease has a tendency curve represented by an equation obtained from the various values of slopes in function of the number of syllables. We found the best approximation for these tendency curves using power functions of general equation : a.Xb","(determination coefficient R2","approaching 1).

Declination reset","paragraphs":["The declination for long sentences (without punctuation), generally declarative, is often accompanied by the phenomenon of F0 reset.

Results were then represented in tendency functions. Those functions allow to determine the declination line slopes of a sentence according to its modality and number of syllables.","We also studied the F0 reset phenomenon that generally accompanies the declination in the case of long sentences.
