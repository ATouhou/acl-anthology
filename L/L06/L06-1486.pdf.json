Introduction","paragraphs":["In the DIALOG1","project (Benzm¤uller et al., 2003a), we are investigating and modeling semantic and pragmatic phenomena in student-tutor dialogs on problem solving skills in mathematics. Our goal is to empirically investigate the use of exible natural language dialog in tutoring mathematics, and to develop a prototype tutoring system gradually embodying the empirical ndings. In (Wolska et al., 2004), we presented an annotated corpus of tutorial dialogs on theorem proving collected in a Wizard-of-Oz setup (Benzm¤uller et al., 2003b) in which subjects interact with a system simulated by a human wizard (Fraser and Gilbert, 1991; Dahlb¤ack et al., 1993; Maulsby et al., 1993). As noted in (Zinn, 2003; Wolska and Kruijff-Korbayov·a, 2004; Horacek and Wolska, 2005), the prominent property of the language of mathematical texts is that it consists of interleaved natural and (semi-) formal language: conventionalized mathematical expressions. Following up on the previous study, we present a new corpus of tutorial dialogs on mathematical theorem proving collected in a recently completed experiment conducted in a similar simulated environment. Our goal was to obtain more data on the kind of mixed-language interaction as discussed in (Horacek and Wolska, 2005). The previous study dealt with the domain of naive set the-ory. For the second experiment, we chose the domain of binary relations. The reason for the choice of a different domain was, among others, to facilitate future investigation the scalability of our input interpretation component. A major difference in the experimental setup was that in the recently completed follow-up experiment we varied the presentation of the study-material with which the subjects","1","The DIALOG project is a collaboration between the Computer Science and Computational Linguistics departments of University of the Saarland as part of the Collaborative Research Center on Resource-Adaptive Cognitive Processes, SFB 378 (http://www. coli.uni- sb.de/sfb378 ). were provided: highly formalized presentation consisting mainly of formulas vs. presentation in natural language. Our aim was to elicit the mixed-language style of informal proofs. The hypothesis was that the language style of the subjects’ interaction with the simulated system will reect the style of presentation of the study-material. In the last section of this paper, we present a preliminary data analysis with respect to this question. Below, we present the setup of the corpus collection experiment, in particular, pointing out differences with respect to the previous study, the corpus itself, and the preliminary quantitative results of a comparative study of the dialogs obtained in the two conditions."]},{"title":"2. The corpus collection experiment","paragraphs":["We invited thirty seven subjects to participate in the experiment. The subjects were Saarland University students of different educational backgrounds. A prerequisite for participation was that the candidate subjects had taken at least one mathematics course at the university level. The subjects were informed that they were interacting with a conversational system with natural language capabilities. We provided the subjects with background reading material for the domain of binary relations (see Section 2.1.) and allowed a study time before starting the tutoring session. Next, we asked the subjects to prove four theorems using the system (R, S, and T are binary relations on a set M ): W. (R S) 1","= S 1","R 1 A. (R [ S) T = (R T ) [ (S T ) B.

Figure 2: Example proof. once solved, they may be used in the subsequent exercises. Exercise W. was a warm-up exercise and exercise E. was presented only to those subjects who had difculties in completing the initial exercise. We instructed the subjects to enter proof steps, rather than complete proofs at once, to encourage dialog with the system, as well as to think aloud while solving the exercises. The language of the dialogs was German. The dialogs were typed using keyboard and/or buttons available on the user interface (see Section 2.2.). Both the wizards and the subjects were free in the way they formulated their turns. 2.1. The study material The subjects were provided with preparatory material (adapted from (Bronstein and Semendjajew, 1991)) review-ing the notions, denitions, and basic theorems in binary relations, and were allowed 25 minutes to revise before starting the tutoring session. They were divided into two groups: a sub-group of twenty subjects was provided with a formalized presentation of the study material, while the other sub-group was presented with material that avoided formalization, and used natural language verbalization in-stead. In Figure 1, we show the denition of a subset as it appeared in both versions to illustrate the difference. The subjects were also provided with an example proof of a simple theorem, shown in Figure 2, that used a mixture of natural language and mathematical expressions. 2.2. The interface The interaction between the subject and the wizard was mediated by a chat environment with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that consisted of a customized version of the TeXmacs 3","editor; a LA","TEX editor operating in the whatyou-see-is-what-you-get mode. The advantage of using TeXmacs was that the subjects were given multiple alternatives for inserting mathematical expressions: traditional GUI buttons with symbols, original LA","TEX commands (e.g. ncup ), as well as German translations of the LA","TEX commands (e.g. nVereinigung for the set union).4","Additionally, the GUI supported copy and paste functionality with which portions of text could be copied from the prior dialog.

The tutors were given general instruction on what constitutes socratic tutoring, but unlike in our previous experiment (Benzm¤uller et al., 2003b), they were not provided with any tutoring algorithm. The tutors were free in formulating their responses using natural language and/or formulas.

Corpus size Overall, the corpus consists of 1917 dialog turns (average of 51 turns per session), of which 980 are wizard and 937 student turns. Table 1 presents the overview of the corpus; the FM and VM sub-totals refer to the subgroups of subjects presented with the Formal and Verbalized material respectively. Analysis of the logs We rst looked at the difference between the number of student turns that contained only symbolic expressions and those that contained no symbolic expressions. Recognition of the symbolic expressions was performed semi-automatically by adapting the mathematical expression tagger developed for the previous corpus to the new domain. Table 2 presents an overview of the results. As mathematical expressions we counted occurrences of formulas, terms, as well as single character tokens intended to represent relation or set symbols. This cursory analysis shows that overall, students tended to use a mixture of symbolic and natural language. However, the group presented with formalized material has a larger number of turns (41% vs. 15% of all turns in the VM-group) consisting of symbolic material alone. Second, we looked at the distribution of the symbolic vs. natural language content per dialog session. Overall, the average number of natural language tokens was 92.95 with 75.90 standard deviation (std) and the average number of symbolic expressions 36.30 (std 19.43). The average formula length6","(f-len) in the dialogs was 16.09 (std 32.48). Table 3 shows the same distribution with respect to the two conditions: minimum (min), maximum (max), mean, median, and standard deviation (std) of natural language tokens (nl), symbolic expressions (math), and length of symbolic expressions (f-len). While there was little difference between the VM- and the FM-group in the number of turns that contained natural language words alone (see Table 2), the average number of natural language words per session was higher in the VM-group. Also, the VM-group tended to use fewer and shorter formulas. The large maximal formula length in both conditions, we believe, might be an artifact of the interface’s copy and paste mechanism. 6","We counted all tokens intended to form a mathematical expression, including punctuation and single character tokens for variables and constants."]},{"title":"1768","paragraphs":["min max mean median std FM nl 49.00 354.00 173.85 158.50 87.53 FM math 0.00 80.00 11.65 4.00 19.24 VM nl 93.00 364.00 209.88 210.00 70.32 VM math 1.00 48.00 16.82 14.00 13.74 Table 4: Distribution of natural language vs. symbolic tokens in the wizard turns per session in the two conditions. Discussion A preliminary analysis of the corpus data reveals differences in the use of natural language vs. formulas. One of the factors contributing to this difference may be the format of the presentation of the study material hav-ing a priming effect. However, other factors may include the wizard’s style of interaction and the alignment effect, or the individual mathematical skills of the student. Table 4 shows the distribution of the natural language vs. symbolic tokens per session in the wizard turns. We do not show the formula length counts because the wizards sometimes copied even lengthy subjects’ formulas into their turns, for instance, while asking clarication questions. Although there is little difference between the two conditions here, a difference may be in the specics of styles of subject-wizard pairs and have to do with the mathematical skills of the student. We plan to investigate this in the future."]},{"title":"4.
