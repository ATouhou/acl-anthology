Introduction","paragraphs":["The Semantic Web is marking a new stage in advanced automated textual analysis, ontologies becoming a key instrument in the development of applications requiring semantic resources, like for example information extraction (IE), knowledge acquisition (KA) and text-based knowledge discovery (KD). Some research projects have already investigated the combination of Semantic web technologies and natural language processing (see for example Ontoweb, Esperonto or Sekt1","), whereas our work is based mainly on results of (Esperonto), and it seems that today the two communities are agreeing on the basic principles for the integration of both kind of technologies for the purpose of semantic annotation (or Knowledge Mark-Up) of textual documents (see for example Workshop, 2003).","But it remains the problem that domain specific ontologies are still missing (or are incomplete) for deployment in real world applications and the design and construction of (domain specific) ontologies is itself a time consuming task, which requires many human resources. Therefore there is need for investigating methods and tools for supporting (supervised) automated ontology building, also from textual documents, as this has already been mentioned in (Maedche & Staab, 2002). In (Esperonto) and (Declerck & Vela, 2005) a methodology for extracting generic ontology relevant semantic relations from linguistically annotated text has been discussed. The linguistic annotation suggested there consists in a combination of structural information and linguistic dependencies, within linguistic fragments (e.g. head-modifier structures within NPs) and between linguistic fragments (Subject, Object etc.). For the time being we identify several linguistic phenomena on which the heuristics for semantic relation extraction can apply. Those phenomena and associated (heuristic) rules will be present in some details later in this paper, after a short presentation of the NLP tool, which is delivering the linguistic annotation for our experiment.","","","  1 URLs of those projects are given in the references."]},{"title":"2. The NLP tools supporting the Extraction of Semantic Relation","paragraphs":["In this section we describe briefly the linguistic tools, called SCHUG (Shallow and Chunk-based Unification Grammar Tools) that have been partially implemented in (Esperonto), and more precisely the recent extensions of those tools that are supporting the shallow ontology building on the basis of the automatically extracted semantic relation.","The NLP tools implement a cascaded chunk parsing up to the level of clausal analysis, including annotation of dependencies. The semantic extraction itself is based on a set of rules that apply to various linguistic phenomena, like adjectival pre-modification, post-nominal genetive and prepositional modification, NP and clausal coordination, etc. Those rules apply bottom up, which means that the relation extraction starts within the phrases and extends then to the relations between linguistic fragments.","The set of rules has been implemented as a Perl module that has been added to the processing chain of SCHUG. This module delivers the extracted semantic relations in the form of a graph. Graphs resulting from various documents can then be merged and so propose a unified structure for the semantic relations extracted from a larger set of linguistically annotated documents.","Below an example of such a graph is shown (figure 2), together with the (bracketed) sentence (figure 1) out of whose subject it has been generated:  [Synovial inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis] [is] [closely related] [to the formation of ectopic lymphoid microstructures] [.] Figure 1: The shallow constituency bracketing above shows a NP, followed by a VG (VerbGroup), an Adjective Phrase and a PP.","In Figure 1, we do not display the dependencies within and between linguistic fragments, but the reader can see in Figure 2 the kind of semantic relations we can automatically extract from those dependencies. "]},{"title":"2353  Figure 2: In this graph the reader can see that the head-modifier relation between “synovial” and “inflammation” leads to a kind of “sub-type” relation between the head noun and the pre-modifying adjectives. And she can also see that a semantic relation can be established between the subject and its predication.","paragraphs":["We consider such semantic relations as a possible starting point for the support of text-based (supervised) ontology building. In our experiment the extracted generic semantic rules are mapped onto UMLS2","relations, on the base of the lexical semantic properties of selected words belonging to distinct POS. The lexical semantic information is taken from both UMLS and EuroWordNet (for English and German). We used for example 24 different classes of adjectives that introduce different relations,","On the base of a first (very limited) evaluation (see Declerck & Vela, 2005), it seems to be that we can claim that linguistic dependencies might really offer appropriate means for extracting shallow semantic relation for supporting the semi-automatic building of ontologies, and that NLP tools when applied to a specialised set of documents can really help in automatizing the procedure of knowledge extraction from text.",""]},{"title":"3. The basic underlying linguistic phenomena","paragraphs":["In the following we list the linguistic phenomena we have been dealing with, with concrete examples, and show the kind of semantic relation we could associate automatically with them, using relation names as stated in UMLS.  2 UMLS (Unified Medical Language System, see http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/) is a set of semantic resources for the medical domain, containing a Metathesaurus, a Semantic Network, a specialised lexicon and lexical programs. See. The mapping to UMLS relation names will allow future extensive comparisons of our work with the UMLS resources and documents manually indexed/annotated with those resources.  "]},{"title":"3.1.

Conclusions and further Work","paragraphs":["On the base of a first (very limited) evaluation (see Declerck & Vela, 2005), it seems to be that we can claim that linguistic dependencies might really offer appropriate means for extracting shallow semantic relation for supporting on building, and that NLP tools when applied to a specialised set of documents can really help in automatizing the procedure of knowledge extraction from text. In future studies we will extend our approach for literature-based scientific discovery from text. We will also have to look for a standardisation of the linguistic output of SCHUG for ensuring large-scale experiments on all kind of know extraction from text.","We will also investigate the use of such semantic extraction methods for supporting semantic based text summarization. In fact, we noticed that our incremental graph building from a corpus dedicated to symptoms of RA allow a very compact representation of the knowledge deposited in various scientific texts. One can see the global graph resulting from the analysis of ten sentences, as displayed in the next page."]},{"title":"5.
