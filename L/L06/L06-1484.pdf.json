Existing corpora available to the community, such as TIMIT and other corpora distributed by LDC and ELDA, do not always meet the requirements of such applications. In such cases, the developers need to create their own corpora. The creation of a highly customized speech corpus, however, could be a very expensive and time-consuming task, especially for small organizations. It requires multidisciplinary expertise in linguistics, management and engineering as it involves subtasks such as the corpus design, human subject recruitment, recording, quality assurance, and in some cases, segmentation, transcription and annotation. This paper describes LDC’s recent involvement in the creation of a low-cost yet highly-customized speech corpus for a commercial organization under a novel data creation and licensing model, which benets both the particular data requester and the general linguistic data user community."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["The Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) is a non-prot organization, whose primary mission is to support education, research and technology development in languagerelated disciplines. LDC creates and disseminates linguistic resources for this mission; it does not create linguistics resources to benet a single organization. There have been, however, strong interests from commercial and non-commercial organizations to subcontract LDC to create customized speech corpora. In response to such data requests from organizations while meeting its mission goals, LDC has created a delayed release model of data creation and licensing. Under this model, the data requester (also the sponsor) subcontracts LDC to create a speech corpus meeting their specications. The data requester funds the creation of the corpus, and in return, benets from a lead time of typically eighteen months, in which the data requester has the exclusive rights to use the data. The corpus is customized to their needs, and the effort of communicating needs to an outside group generally has a clarify-ing effect; in the process, they may learn of approaches or technologies they had not considered. After the lead time, which begins when the corpus is delivered, LDC releases the corpus to LDC members and non-members at a signicantly reduced cost."]},{"title":"2. Speech Controlled Computing Corpus","paragraphs":["The Speech Controlled Computing (SCC) corpus was the rst corpus created at LDC under this model. It was developed for limited-vocabulary speech recognition applications targeting a wide variety of American English speakers. The data requester’s idea was to have a set of recordings of isolated words and short phrases of the kind one would use to control household appliances recorded to be representative of most American speakers. LDC and the data requester agreed to have a pool of speakers that represented each of four regional groups, three age groups and two gender groups. To meet this rst challenge, we conducted a recruitment effort to meet these demographic requirements. In order to ensure that recordings are consistent and of highest possible quality, all recordings were to be done in a recording booth in the LDC suite. This limited the pool of possible participants to Philadelphia-region residents. Another challenge we faced was the paucity of male subjects willing to participate, particularly in the mid and high age groups. One of the most effective solutions to this problem was to recruit subjects who had participated in our previous studies, such as Fisher and Mixer. LDC keeps a database of speakers who participated in the past projects. LDC’s human subject recruitment team contacted possible participants living in the Philadelphia region for each of the 24 demographic groups shown in Table 1.

Prior to the production recordings, we conducted a series of pilot recordings to test whether our recording method met the requirements set by the data requester. A number of microphones, including headset-mounted microphones and stand-mounted microphones, were tested, and sample recordings were sent to the data requester to determine the best recording method for them. In order to facilitate efcient recordings, LDC developed an infrastructure to control and monitor"]},{"title":"653","paragraphs":["recording sessions, the hardware components of which include hard disk-based digital recording with back-up recordings to DAT tapes. A software-based prompter was created to display the word list in a randomized order to speakers, and to control the progress of the recordings.

As the corpus specications required all tokens to be manually reviewed and for the segmentation to be corrected, we created a specialized annotation tool for these purposes. The resulting auditing and segmentation tool utilizes the Annotation Graph Toolkit (AGTK), Snack and WaveSurfer (Sj¤olander and Beskow, 2000). The WaveSurfer module provides the ability to play back audio, display waveforms and compute spectrograms. The spectrograms provide the auditor/segmenter an effective means to judge what is spoken and where each utterance begins and ends. Our experience demonstrates that LDC annotators, even those who are not necessarily trained phoneticians, were able to recognize the key features of spectrograms after a short training period. However, student workers with a strong interest in languages and/or linguistics were particularly well suited for this task."]},{"title":"3. Delayed Release Licensing Model","paragraphs":["The delayed release model used for the SCC corpus benets both the individual data requester and the international user community of linguistic resources. In this model the data requester, who is also the sponsor of the project, receives a lead time of typically 18 months. During this time, the data requester has the exclusive rights to use the data. After this time, the data set is published as an LDC general publication to LDC members and non-members. This is documented in the statement of work, and is agreed upon between the data requester and LDC at the time of the contract. The data set released to the LDC members and non-members is essentially identical to what is delivered to the data requester. In the case of the SCC corpus, only the following changes were made to the general publication:","File names used to identify the names of the subjects were changed to anonymous subject names.","Mentions of sponsor names were removed from the documentation.","The regions of silence before and after each utterance were extended from 10 ms to 100 ms.

Carpooling Philosophy","paragraphs":["The carpooling philosophy here refers to the grouping of potential data requesters/sponsors in order to reduce the cost of customized speech corpus creation. Many speech corpus creation efforts are similar in terms of speaker and recording requirements. For example, if three projects require 50 native speakers of English to be recorded in a sound booth, it is much more cost and time efcient for us to record each subject for all of these projects at the same time, than to have each speaker come in three times. Similarly the corpus design for multiple projects may be very similar so that we can merge multiple data sets into one. This will also signicantly reduce the cost for the data requesters."]},{"title":"5. Solidifying In-house Infrastructure and Knowledge Base 5.1. Overview","paragraphs":["In order for this venture to be successful, LDC will need to solidify its expertise in customized speech corpus creation. LDC’s existing infrastructure and knowledge bases will need constant enhancement and improvement. In the following sections, we discuss not only our current areas of expertise in creating unique speech corpora, but also our plans for strengthening our approaches and methods in this effort. 5.2. Corpus Design The rst step in creating a customized speech corpus is to design the corpus (Gibbon et al., 1997). This should be discussed throughly between the data requester and LDC. While the data requester may or may not be an expert in corpus design methodologies, LDC employs experts in various elds of Linguistics, including Sociolinguistics and Phonetics, as well as experts in Speech Technologies, and can assist the date requester to dene the corpus needs."]},{"title":"654 5.3. Human Subject Recruitment","paragraphs":["In the past, the LDC has recruited human subjects to participate in both telephone conversation recording sessions and in-house recording sessions. The current Mixer study records native speakers of various languages1","(Cieri et al., 2006). The participants in these studies are likely to be interested in participating similar projects. We keep a database of our past participants and inquirers, and expect this database to grow. In addition, LDC, as part of the University of Pennsylvania, has access to student populations from various parts of the country and the world. 5.4. Recording Infrastructure and Methodologies LDC offers an extensive telephone speech collection system, as well as facilities to record subjects in-house. In-house recordings are made in a sound attenuated recording booth. The recording booth is equipped with stand-mounted microphones and headset-mounted microphones as well as a monitor display, which may be used to show software-controlled prompts. The recorded sounds are sent to the monitoring station outside of the booth. The recording and digitization can be made to both a DAT tape and a hard disk drive. LDC has a multi-channel digital recording system that can be used to record multiple speakers simultaneously, or to record a single speaker with multiple microphones. The current setup requires a recording assistant to monitor the recording level and the speaker’s pronunciation. If a particular word or phrase needs to be repeated, the recording assistant operates the prompting software to show the prompt for the same word or phrase again. Some of these tasks, such as monitoring the recording level could be automated. We plan to create an automated real-time quality control system that checks for recording problems. 5.5. Auditing and Annotation LDC has expertise in transcription and annotation of spoken corpora by maintaining a well-training staff of transcribers, annotators and experts in these elds. In addition, LDC has in-house software developers who are well experienced in designing and developing customized annotation tools (Maeda et al., 2006; Bird et al., 2002), such as the auditing and segmentation tool used in the creation of the SCC corpus. The tool displays a spectrogram which allows the auditor to identify words and word boundaries visually, as shown in Figure 2. 5.6. Financial Considerations Recruitment, recording methodologies and annotation are only part of of the picture of speech corpus design. Additionally, LDC must estimate the cost required for a customized speech corpus creation effort. If the cost estimate is too low, LDC will lose money and time of the staff members involved. If the cost estimate is too high, then it may be difcult to attract subcontractors to LDC. It is also important for LDC to compensate the subjects at the right rate. We consider these subjects to be an extremely valuable resource; we hope that the subjects will come back 1 http://mixer.ldc.upenn.edu and participate in future studies. Both undercompensation and overcompensation hurt us in the long run. The experience from the SCC corpus creation as well as from studies, such as Mixer and Fisher, gave us some good ideas about these aspects of speech corpus creation. We will analyze the nancial aspects of each study at various stages, and will incorporate the results into our knowledge base."]},{"title":"6. Commercial Sponsorship and Other Possibilities","paragraphs":["The delayed release licensing model allows LDC to create speech corpora for commercial organizations. This model may also be an attractive option for research and academic organizations who need to create speech corpora for their research. The lead time allows the researchers use the data exclusively and publish the results. The researchers then can cite the LDC data publication as the data used in their study, allowing the readers to access their data."]},{"title":"7. Conclusion","paragraphs":["Speech corpus creation under the new delayed release licensing model presents a number of attractive advantages to the data requester, LDC and the linguistic data user community. The data requester indeed receives the customized corpus they require utilizing LDC’s multidisciplinary expertise in linguistic data creation. LDC, on the other hand, seizes the opportunity to strengthen its expertise, and in some cases to enhance its infrastructure and to add to its subject database, all of which benet its user community including future commercial users. The linguistic data user community, speech technology researchers and linguistic researchers alike, are able to to access the data through LDC publications after the lead time was passed. LDC has created speech corpora of various types, including telephone conversation recordings, meeting recordings, multimodal recordings and other specialized corpora, such as the Emotional Prosody speech corpus, in which actors and actresses simulated various emotional speech. We expect that the new data creation model provides LDC new opportunities to utilize our expertise in creating various speech corpora."]},{"title":"8.
