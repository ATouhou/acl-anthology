By retrieving these keywords it should be possible to highlight the ebb and flow of some thematic topics. The NLP terminological sample derives from a database created for this purpose using the DBT software (Textual Data Base, ILC patent). Scientific presentations at the main conferences of the ‘60s point out a frequent recurrence of expressions such as mécanisation des études lexicologique, les machines à cartes perforées et leurs application lexicologique, which trace back to the origin of electronic processing of linguistic data and to some solutions of linguistic-literary problems, to lexicographic researches, to scientific terminology, to automatic dictionaries, to homographs, synonyms and the possibility of producing indexes and concordances by means of an electronic processor. Terms such as meccanizzazione, mechanical translation, machine à traduire used by experts of the field in the 1950s and 1960s seem to well testify the change, the shift, the beginning and then the final consecration of a rapidly evolving field: Natural Language Processing. "]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["The terms introduced in the first international conferences in the field, those which witnessed the early use of machines in linguistic researches and analyses, are briefly illustrated. Among the conferences, the following have been chosen: Strasbourg 1957; Tübingen 1960; Besançon 1961; Strasbourg 1964; New York 1964; Praga 1966; Grenoble 1967; New York 1964; Pisa 1968. The choice of these specific conferences wants to underline the importance of computer applications to linguistic and literary analysis: the conferences in Strasbourg, Tübingen and Besançon witness the shift from mechanical processes to electronic processing; the 1964 Strasbourg one is relevant for quantitative linguistics; those in Praga and Pisa for lexicography; the one in New York is important for literary studies while the Grenoble one plays an important role for the wide variety of Computational Linguistics issues dealt with. Scientific presentations at the above-mentioned conferences point out a frequent recurrence of expressions such as mécanisation des études lexicologique, les machines à cartes perforées et leurs application lexicologique which trace back to the origin of electronic processing of linguistic data and to some solutions of linguistic-literary problems, to lexicographic researches, to scientific terminology, to automatic dictionaries, to homographs, synonyms and the possibility of producing indexes and concordances by means of an electronic processor: “L’utilisation des machines a introduit dans notre ordre des recherches un bouleversement total. Des travaux des type artisanal, nous passons brutalement aux technique industrielles ...” (Quemada, Besançon, 1961, p.18). A few years before, the expression Mechanical Resolution of Linguistic problem appeared (Booth et al., 1958). Terms such as meccanizzazione, mechanical translation, machine à traduire used by experts of the field in the 1950s and 1960s seem to well testify the change, the shift, the beginning and then the final consecration of a rapidly evolving field: Natural Language Processing (NLP). It is therefore the mechanical or electronic device called “machine” which will be used by NLP pioneers in those years; the noun “computer” will make its appearance later, while we will have to wait until the late ’60s for the use of the adjective “computational”. Data extracted from the Computers and the Humanities journal and from the major international conferences selected for this survey are presented, ie. Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), in particular the ACL Anthology: titles of presentations at the various ACL-related conference have been extracted; European Association for Language Resources and Evaluation (ELRA): titles of presentations at the LREC conferences and workshops have been considered (see Figure 1).  0 500 1000 1500 2000 Wor k shopsTINLPTELRITALNothersNISTNAACLMT-BibLRECKDD HLTFLAIRS EUROSPEECHEACLConLLCOLINGCL JournalCHANLPALLC-ACHACL ","Figure 1: Composition of the Corpus."," Being such a vast field, the authors have selected and limited the data for producing the sample only to the conferences of international Associations, going back in time from the oldest to the most recent ones and thus giving the picture of a resource in constant evolution.

The DBT tool has allowed to organise the material in lists sorted by title, author and year and indexes of terms in various languages; data has then been used for various kinds of statistical searches.

A Brief History of NLP Terms","paragraphs":["NLP can be defined as the entire set of methods and techniques for processing a language by means of a machine. Before the computer age, the manual method for textual processing consisted in the transcription on cards of all single words with their relevant contexts, that is with the sentence they belong to. Then, cards were manually ordered in alphabetical order. Obviously, considering that - on average - for each single word a sentence made up of seven words is quoted, the entire work meant transcribing the whole text seven times. The most relevant change which followed was the possibility of automatically managing the data; the transcription process of every single word of a text was made on special cards called: schede meccanografiche / cartes mécanograpiques / punched card machines. What appeared on these cards was the traditional information of a lexicographic card (lemma, author, work, reference, date) and a context of concordances which could be ‘long’ (or ‘macro-context’) in opposition to the ‘short’ (or ‘micro-context’) one. The essential data were perforated, in order to perform an automatic information extraction for the subsequent creation of indexes. The philological analysis of texts was still entrusted to philologists: on this respect, it is very significant what Louis Delatte stated: “Les machines ne nous mettent pas encore à l’abri des erreurs philologiques. Ce serait trop beau! Mais elles nous épargnent un temps considérable que, sans elles, l’on consacrerait à des besognes purement matérielles. Elles permettent en outre par des séries de tris assez complexes de vérifier si une analyse a été correcte”.1"," The first approach of electronics to linguistics, or rather the applications of computer to linguistic analysis, dates back to the 1950s. Electronic processing of linguistic data inspired the first pioneers and the field of Natural Language Processing rapidly matured, thus providing classical lexicologists with new and unforeseen tools for varied linguistic analysis (literary, stylistic, metrical and quantitative). Gradually, several projects came to life in research centres funded on purpose and their variety and dimension grew 1 In À propos d’une concordance, Les machines dans la linguistique, p.192.  yearly. Most important was the start of projects on historical dictionaries which foresaw textual processing: it was then justified to talk about “the death of the hand-made concordance” (Raben, 1969)2",". The computer was then used in projects pertaining to the creation of lexicons, for studies on terminology through textual processing of the complete works of philosophers and man of letters. In statistical linguistics the computer was immediately used for describing the quantitative features of a text or group of texts; measuring these kind of features was indeed a great help for defining the style of an author and solving problems of various nature (philological, chronological and of attribution). Quantitative studies on languages led to the production of dictionaries for the various languages at the beginning of the ‘70s (see Figure 2). 19 47 1 953 1954 1 955 19 61 1 963 1 967 1973 198 0","1","981 1 982 1 984","1","985 1986 1 987 1988 198 9 1 990 1991 19 92 199 3 1 994 1995 1 996 19 97 19 98 1 999 2000 20 01 2 002 2 003 2004 200 5 Total e 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 ","Figure 2: Occurrence of “Dictionary”"," In the following paragraphs some of the terms most frequently used in those years will be analysed.

Quando l’intreccio d’una vicenda tragica non si scioglieva naturalmente, Euripide faceva scendere su la scena una divinità mediante un congegno di teatro: deus ex machina, theòs apò mechanês. Ma questo è un significato derivato. Mechané è anzitutto la trovata mentale che inventa un congegno o qualsiasi altro mezzo per sottrarsi alle difficoltà della vita”. It is therefore the mechanical or electronic device called machine which the NLP pioneers started using in the ‘50s and ‘60s. The noun “machine” was normally associated with words pertinent with all the computational approaches of the field, as for example ‘machine translation’ (MT): the term stays for a computational system of translation with no human aid. Consequently also the adjective mechanical started to be used, from the Latin ‘mechanicu(m)’ and the Greek ‘mekhanikós’ (‘mekhane’=“machine”); in fact, the expression mechanical translation was used by the pioneers of automatic translation (Bar-Hillel, 1952). The use of machines or data processing systems for processing linguistic data lead to the noun mechanization in Italian 2 In Scholarly Publishing, vol. 1, no. 1 (1969), p. 61. 3 A.

I should like to make a few observations concerning its [CL] content in relation to recent developments in the area of automated language processing (ALP). I use this term rather than computational linguistics as it is far more general in its implications, encompassing all studies, theoretical or applied, on the use of computers or computational techniques in the processing of natural language. I consider computational linguistics to be a subset of ALP, a subset to which I shall refer by the abbreviation CL”. The expression automated language processing (ALP) has been the forerunner of the expression NLP and was commonly used in the whole ‘60s (see Figure 5). In the past, terms such as computational linguistics, mathematical linguistics, algebraic linguistics, have been often been used without distinction, as they were interchangeable: in the past, it happened more often to talk about computational linguistics (CL) in academic contexts, but in reality it is rather a synonym of NLP and of nowadays Language Engineering (LE)4",".  196 1 1 967 1 975 1 980","1982 1 984 19 86 19 88 1 990","1992 1 994 1 996 19 98 2 000 20 02 2 004 LENL P 012345678910111213 LE CL NLP  Figure 3: Comparison "]},{"title":"3.

Conclusions","paragraphs":["The results described in this article show how at dawn NLP used to borrow its terminology from other fields (such as computer science) and to widely adopt adjectives like electronic, automatic, mechanical and cybernetic.
