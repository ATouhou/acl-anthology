To estimate how suitable a document term is as an expansion term, the most popular of them use a measure of the frequency of the co-occurrence of this term with one or several query terms. The benet of the use of the linguistic relations that hold between query terms is often questioned. If a linguistic phenomenon is taken into account, it is the phrase structure or lexical compound. We propose a technique that is based on the restricted lexical cooccurrence (collocation) of query terms. We use the knowledge on collocations formed by query terms for two tasks: (i) document relevance clustering done in the rst stage of local query expansion and (ii) choice of suitable expansion terms from the relevant document cluster. In this paper, we describe the rst task, providing evidence from rst preliminary experiments on Spanish material that local relevance clustering benets largely from knowledge on collocations."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["The performance of an Information Retrieval engine significantly depends on the quality of its query expansion technique. The most popular expansion techniques are based on term co-occurrence: document terms that are found to co-occur signicantly often with query terms are considered suitable expansion terms.1","Depending on the strategy adopted, the query terms are processed in isolation (Sparck Jones, 1971; Sch¤utze and Pedersen, 1994), as a set of terms (Qiu and Frei, 1993; Jing and Croft, 1994; Xu and Croft, 2000), as elements of a phrase (Mitra et al., 1997; De Lima and Pedersen, 1999), or as elements of a compound (Jacquemin and Tzoukermann, 1999; Penas et al., 2002). Linguistically oriented strategies are largely out-numbered by statistical co-occurrence strategies. However, while the usefulness of linguistic information in IR is still questioned by some scholars, evidence is available that the performance of (especially web-based) IR can be improved by using NLP. As suggested above, so far, mainly two types of linguistic information have been used: phrase structures and lexical compounds. The goal of our work is to explore the use of lexically restricted co-occurrence, i.e., collocation, information for local query expansion. Local query expansion techniques search for suitable expansion terms the rst n top-ranked documents retrieved as response to the original user query.","1","Some other techniques involve, e.g., the exploitation of terms in the syntactic context of the query terms found in the document collection (Grefenstette, 1992; Ruge, 1992), or the use of most common terms in the n-top ranked documents obtained for the original query. The use of thesauri and lexica as source of expansion terms (e.g., hyperonyms and synonyms of query terms in the case of a thesaurus, and morphological derivates in the case of lexica) has also been suggested; cf. among others, (Hersh et al., 2000; Woods et al., 2001). Following (Xu and Croft, 2000), we hypothesize that top-ranked documents tend to form two clustersa cluster of documents that are relevant to the query of the user and a cluster of documents that are irrelevant to this query. Our work is thus divided into two stages: (i) relevance clustering of the top-ranked document set; (ii) query expansion using suitable expansion terms from the relevant document cluster. In this paper, we focus on the rst stage. We investigate to what extent collocations that occur in the original user query can be used for the relevance clustering task. The use of collocation information for query expansion is described elsewhere. Our working document collection is the Spanish part of the document collection of the CLEF 2002 competition (Peters, 2002). For our experiments, we use top-ranked document sets retrieved within the CLEF 2002 competition by the COLE IR-system (Vilares et al., 2002). The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2., we introduce the phenomenon of collocation underlying our work. Section 3. provides some evidence for the signicant co-occurrence of collocations in both queries as used within the CLEF competition and the document collection. Section 4. describes the preliminary experiments we carried out so far and their evaluation. Section 5. presents the conclusions."]},{"title":"2. The Phenomenon of Collocation","paragraphs":["A collocation is a term combination t1 + t2 that expresses a concept conguration c1\\b c2 such that t1 (the base of the collocation) is a standard context free option for the expression of c1, while the choice of t2 (the collocate of the collocation) for the expression of c2 depends on the availability of t1. Cf. the concept combinations ‘sanctions’\\b ‘in-stallation’, ‘state of emergency’\\b ‘installation’, and ‘customs duty’\\b ‘installation’. In all three of them, c2 is ‘in-stallation’. However, in connection with sanctions, it is expressed by the term imposition, in the case of state of"]},{"title":"1886","paragraphs":["emergency by declaration and in the case of (customs) duty by putting on. In contrast, in German, in all three combinations, ‘installation’ is expressed by the term: Verh¤angen lit. ‘hanging over’. Collocations reveal the following four main features that are immediately relevant to IR (with respect to both index-ing and query expansion):","They can be classied according to a semantic typology; for instance, pest extermination, overthrowing the government, lift of the embargo, etc. can be viewed as being of the same type , namely ‘putting an end to X’.","Over the semantic collocation typology, a similarity metric can be dened. Two collocation types 1 and 2 can be judged as similar, as, e.g., ‘installation of X’ and ‘continuation of X’ (cf. imposition of the embargo vs. maintain the embargo) or as opposite, as, e.g., ‘in-stallation of X’ and ‘putting an end to X’ (cf. imposition of the embargo vs. lift of the embargo.","The collocate of a collocation cannot be considered as an isolated term since its meaning as an isolated item often deviates from its collocate meaning; cf. disposal in waste disposal vs. disposal in house disposal, raising in fund raising vs. raising in child raising, fall in fall of the regime vs. fall in fall of the stock. Rather, in order to ensure its correct disambiguation, it must be considered as an element of a complex unit.","The base of a collocation may form a collocation of the same meaning with several collocates; e.g., deposition in deposition of the king can be replaced by dethronement or dethroning; overthrowing in overthrowing the regime (in Iraque) can be substituted by bringing down or ousting. The most ne-grained collocation typology available to date is the typology based on lexical functions (LFs) from the Explanatory Combinatorial Lexicology (Mel’cuk, 1996). A lexical function is a (directed) relation with a STANDARD ABSTRACT meaning that associates a lexeme L1 with another lexeme L2.2","‘Standard’ means that this relation applies to a large number of collocations. For instance, the relation that holds between Shah and deposition is the same as the one that holds between government and overthrowing, minister and removal, director and dismissal, and so on. It is the same in the sense that the L2 lexemes provide the same linguistic features (i.e., modications of semantic content and/or syntactic structure) to their respective L1 lexemes. ‘Abstract’ means that the meaning of this relation is sufciently vague and can therefore be exploited for purposes of classication. In total, about 60 simple standard LFs are distinguished. Most common, and for IR most signicant, collocations are (nominalized) verb-noun and noun-adjective collocations. In this paper, we focus on verb-noun collocations. Some of the most common standard verb-noun LFs are (in the examples below, the arguments of the LFs, i.e. the bases, are 2","We consider only the regular standard lexical functions. See (Mel’cuk, 1996) for a comprehensive overview of all types of LFs. written in small capitals, their values, i.e. the collocates, in a slanted font):3","1. ‘perform’, ‘do’; cf. EMBARGO:imposition, MO-TION:proposition [of], support:demonstration [of]","2. ‘cause existence’; cf. CONGRESS:convention, ELECTION:scheduling, OPPOSITION:stir up, FOR-TUNE:accumulation","3. ‘put an end to’; cf. SUPPORT:withdrawal, FIRE:extinguish","4. ‘act accordingly to the situation’; cf. THEOREM:proof [of], LAW:enforcement, RULE:application; RESPONS-IBILITY:acceptance","5. ‘react accordingly to the situation’; cf. OR-DER:execution, EXAM:pass, ACCUSATION:accept Verb-noun LFs can appear in a document as noun-verb, as noun-noun (cf. the illustrations above), and as nounparticiple combinations. In (Wanner, 2004; Wanner et al., in print), we discuss a series of machine learning techniques for the automatic recognition and classication of word bigrams in terms of the LF-typology. These techniques can be applied to the identication and classication of collocations in queries and document collections. As mentioned above, a similarity metric can be dened over the LF-typology. For our purposes, two simple similarity clusters turned out to be already helpful: CL1 := fLF , ‘cause LF ’, ‘begin LF ’, ‘continue LF ’g CL2 := f‘cause end LF ’, ‘end LF ’g with LF 2 f‘perform’, ‘undergo’, . . . g. Elements of CL1 and CL2 are considered to be opposed to each other."]},{"title":"3. Collocation Distribution","paragraphs":["Collocations are a regular phenomenon. In an average text document, a predicative key term is assumed to make part of a collocation in about 50% of its occurrences. Our evaluation shows that in the Spanish part of the CLEF 2002 material, collocations occur signicantly often in both the topic descriptions of the competition (which have commonly been used as (parts of) queries) and the document collection itself. Thus, from 100 randomly chosen topic descriptions, 52 contained at least one collocation. Consider also a fragment of a document from the document collection annotated with Mel’cuk’s labels of LFs.

Collocation elements are enclosed in angle brackets. Elements that form a collocation carry the same number, and the collocate further carries the name of the LF of which it is the value when the LF is applied to the corresponding keyword. Individual terms often occur in different collocations. Table 1 lists the collocates with which the noun CRISIS co-occurs in the document collection and to which type of collocation the collocations formed belong. provocar, plantear, desatar and abrir are values of the same LF. They contribute the same meaning to the collocation in which they participate. ‘intense’ grave, profunda ‘cause existence’ provocar, plantear, desatar,","crear, abrir ‘put an end to’ atajar, combatir, superar, re-","solver, solucionar, poner n, dar","salida, zanjar, salir ‘perform’ sufrir, vivir, pasar, atravesar ‘cause performance’ sumir, llevar ‘end performance’ sacar ‘act appropriately’ hacer frente ‘continue existence’ prolongar ‘intensify’ agravar ‘begin exist’ estallar Table 1: Collocations with CRISIS To estimate the frequency of the occurrence of collocations in the document collection, we selected some key terms from a number of topic descriptions and examined their co-occurrence. Cf., as illustration, the following ve some-what shortened topic descriptions:","1. Francia extradit·o a Teher·an los dos iran·es sospechosos de haber asesinado a Kazem Radjavi en Suiza.","2. La situaci·on pol·tica en Afganist·an que llev·o a la guerra civil tras la deposici·on del l·dercomunista Najibullah.","3.

For each underlined key term, we examined its occurrence in collocations in the rst 100 top-ranked documents retrieved by the COLE-system (Vilares et al., 2002) for the query that contained the topic description in question; cf.

Experiments","paragraphs":["The distribution of collocations in the queries and in the document collection led us to the following two assumptions: (i) if the user uses a collocation Co in a query at least some of the documents that contain Co, will be relevant to this user; (ii) at least some of the documents that do not contain Co, will be irrelevant to the user. We can thus reformulate the hypothesis underlying Local Context Analysis in (Xu and Croft, 2000) as follows: If a user query Q contains an instance I of an LF L, documents that are relevant to Q are likely to contain I or instances of typologically similar LFs applied to the same base as L. But they are unlikely to contain instances of LFs (applied to the same base as L) that are typologically distant to L. In other words, the documents of the top-ranked set can be clustered into relevant and irrelevant subsets, depending on the extent to which they contain the same or similar instances of LFs that occur in Q To verify this hypothesis, we use the metric in (1) that calculates, for a document D, a collocational weight WD. WD reects the degree to which the collocations in D match the collocations in Q. If WD ( being empirically de-termined), D is considered relevant; otherwise it is considered irrelevant. The experiments below have been carried out with = 0:5.

The advantage of an LF-metric over a term co-occurrence metric is its generalization potential: it covers all semantically similar term sequencies rather than only one single term sequence. In a series of preliminary experiments, we clustered a number of 100 top-ranked documents sets returned by the IR-system of the COLE-group of the University of La Coruna.

Conclusions","paragraphs":["We argued that collocation information is an important type of linguistic information that must be taken into account for local document relevance clustering and for query expansion. We presented some initial evidence for the importance of collocations for local document relevance clustering.

A topic we still did not explore so far at all is the role of collocations in indexing."]},{"title":"6. References","paragraphs":["E. De Lima and J. Pedersen. 1999.
