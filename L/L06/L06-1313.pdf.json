The first level is represented by temporal expressions, the second level is represented by different types of entities (i.e. person, organizations, locations and geo-political entities), and the third level is represented by relations between entities (e.g. the affiliation relation connecting a person to an organization). So far I-CAB has been manually annotated with temporal expressions, person entities and organization entities. As we intend I-CAB to become a benchmark for various automatic Information Extraction tasks, we followed a policy of reusing already available markup languages. In particular, we adopted the annotation schemes developed for the ACE Entity Detection and Time Expressions Recognition and Normalization tasks. As the ACE guidelines have originally been developed for English, part of the effort consisted in adapting them to the specific morpho-syntactic features of Italian. Finally, we have extended them to include a wider range of entities, such as conjunctions. "]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["In recent years there have been several initiatives for the realization of annotated resources for different tasks in Natural Language Processing, including Word Sense Disambiguation (e.g. Semcor), parsing (e.g. the PennTreebank) and Named Entity Recognition. More recently, the ACE (Automatic Content Extraction) program started developing a set of annotation schemas for higher level tasks in Information Extraction, addressing Temporal Expressions, mentions of Entities and mentions of Relations among entities. On the basis of the resulting resources a number of evaluation campaigns have been successfully organized (e.g. TERN 2004 and 2005, ACE 2002-2005) for Content Annotation tasks.","While such efforts have stimulated research in Information Extraction for the English language, little has been done for other languages; in particular, there are no content-annotated resources for Italian. This paper presents ongoing work aimed at the realization of I-CAB (Italian Content Annotation Bank), a corpus of semantically annotated documents for Italian containing annotations of PERSON ENTITIES, ORGANIZATION ENTITIES, LOCATION ENTITIES, GEO-POLITICAL ENTITIES and of a number of selected RELATIONS among such entities.","Following a policy of reusing already available markup languages, the annotation activity has been carried out adopting the formalisms developed within the American ACE program1",". However, due to the differences between English and Italian, part of the work has been dedicated to the revision and adaptation to Italian of the annotation guidelines (Lavelli et al. 2005).","The main result of the manual annotation is represented by the first release of the Italian Content Annotation Bank (I-CAB) corpus. I-CAB is an Italian corpus of news stories (around 182,000 words) which at","1 http://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/ace present contains annotations about PERSON ENTITIES and TEMPORAL EXPRESSIONS; it is accessible on the Web through a browser created specifically for this purpose.","The creation of I-CAB is part of the three-year project Ontotext2","funded by the Autonomous Province of Trento. Ontotext focuses on the study and development of innovative knowledge extraction techniques to produce new or less noisy information to be made available for the Semantic Web. Within the new research area of Ontology-Based Knowledge Extraction, Ontotext addresses three key research aspects: annotating documents with semantic and relational information, providing an adequate degree of interoperability of such relational information, and updating and extending the ontologies used for Semantic Web annotation. The concrete evaluation scenario in which algorithms will be tested with a number of large-scale experiments is the automatic acquisition of information about people from newspaper articles.","The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we will present how mark-up languages are used in the framework of the ACE program. In Section 3 we will describe the corpus. In Section 4 and Section 5 we will report on the annotation of TEMPORAL EXPRESSIONS, PERSON ENTITIES and ORGANIZATION ENTITIES. Finally, in Section 6 we will draw some conclusions."]},{"title":"2. Content Mark-up Languages","paragraphs":["The ACE formalisms have been chosen because they represent a flexible mark-up language to identify content information in a given source text, and annotate it with additional metadata providing a semantically rich and normalized description.","The aim of the ACE program is to develop extraction technology to support automatic processing of source language data. In particular ACE annotators tag English,","2 http://ontotext.itc.it"]},{"title":"963","paragraphs":["Chinese and Arabic texts, producing both training and test sets for the evaluation of technologies that automatically detect and characterize the meaning conveyed by the data.","The ACE program is motivated by the same issues as the Message Understanding Conference (MUC) program that preceded it, but represents an evolution in terms of complexity. In particular, in the MUC Name Entity Task three entity types were considered (persons, organizations, and locations) and only proper names and acronyms were markable, while in the MUC Co-reference Task all co-referring expressions, i.e. all mentions of a given entity, were captured and grouped.","ACE modifies the list of entity types dividing locations into geo-political entities and facilities and by adding weapons, substances, and vehicles. Co-reference is preserved but a wider range of markable expressions, including common nouns and pronouns, is taken into account. Finally, two inter-connected levels of annotation are defined: the level of the entity, which provides a representation of an object in the world, and the level of the entity mention, which provides information about any textual references to that object. For instance, if George W. Bush is mentioned in two different sentences of a text as the president of the U.S.A. and as he, these two expressions are considered as two co-referring entity mentions (i.e. two mentions of the same entity).","For our purposes, the ACE standards developed for the Entity Detection and Recognition task and the Time Expression Recognition and Normalization task turned out to be adequate, as they allow for a semantically rich and normalized annotation of: (i) different types of entities (i.e. objects or set of objects in the world), (ii) different types of entity mentions (i.e. any textual reference to an entity), and (iii) different types of temporal expressions (e.g. absolute expressions, such as “Sunday, March 13 2005”, and implicit expressions, such as “three days later”).","We also follow the guidelines provided by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) that develops linguistic resources to support the ACE program. In 2004 LDC distributed samples of ALF (the “ACE LDC Format”), that is the style of annotation they proposed for the ACE program. It differs from APF (the “ACE Program Format”) by adding a number of new mention types to those proposed in APF."]},{"title":"3.

The selected news stories belong to four different days (September, 7th and 8th 2004 and October, 7th and 8th 2004) and are grouped into five categories: News Stories, Cultural News, Economic News, Sports News and Local News (see Table 1).","3 http://www.ladige.it/  09/07 09/08 10/07 10/08 Total News 23 25 18 21 87 Culture 20 18 16 18 72 Economy 13 15 12 14 54 Sport 29 41 27 26 123 Local 46 43 49 51 189 TOTAL 131 142 122 130 525","Table 1: Number of news stories per category","","I-CAB is further divided into the training and the test sections, which contain 335 and 190 documents respectively. In total, I-CAB consists of around 182,500 words: 113,500 in the training part (the average length of a news story is around 339 words) and 69,000 words in the test part (with an average of 363 words per news stories).","The annotation of I-CAB is being carried out manually, as we intend I-CAB to become a benchmark for various automatic Information Extraction tasks, including recognition and normalization of TEMPORAL EXPRESSIONS, ENTITIES and RELATIONS between entities (e.g. the relation affiliation connecting a person to the organization with which he or she is affiliated).","The annotation of I-CAB is work in progress. So far, the whole corpus has been annotated with TEMPORAL EXPRESSIONS and PERSON ENTITIES, while only I-CAB Training has been annotated with ORGANIZATION ENTITIES (see Table 2).

It supports linguistic annotation of textual sources for any Unicode-supported language and accepts files encoded as UTF-8, US-ASCII and several other character encodings. Callisto is written in Java, taking advantage of its portability and language support; it has been built with a modular design and utilizes standoff-annotation, allowing for unique tag-set definitions and domain dependent interfaces. Stand-off annotation support allows for many different annotation tasks to be represented. For the annotation of TEMPORAL EXPRESSIONS we have used the TIMEX2 task, whereas for the annotation of ENTITIES we are using the ACE2004 task.","All data annotated with Callisto are saved in the Atlas Interchange Format (AIF). The TIMEX2 task also allows exporting annotated files from the AIF into the SGML","4 http://callisto.mitre.org"]},{"title":"964","paragraphs":["format, whereas the ACE2004 task does not allow it. In I-CAB, the manual annotation of the corpus is merged with automatic annotation of lower linguistic levels (tokenization, lemma, PoS, multi-words). All the different levels of annotations are delivered in the Meaning Annotation Format, an XCES and TEI conformant scheme which was developed within the EU-funded MEANING project (Bentivogli et al., 2003) and has now been extended to represent TEMPORAL EXPRESSIONS and ENTITIES.","The Meaning Annotation Format (MAF) is a stand-off XML-based annotation scheme. Different representation levels are contained in separate documents, or document sections. Annotation levels are related to each other following a hierarchy of annotation levels: first, the orthographic annotation level, representing tokens, is implemented with pointers to the character positions in the hub corpus; second, the morpho-syntactic level contains pointers to the tokens; third, the multiword level points to the words described at morpho-syntactic level. According to this hierarchical approach, temporal expressions and entity mentions are represented with pointers to morpho-syntactic level entities and entities are represented with pointers to entity mentions (Pianta et al., 2006).","Unlike temporal expressions and entity mentions in MAF, all the annotations produced by Callisto in the AIF format point to character positions; as a consequence of this, in the transformation from AIF to MAF, pointers to character positions have been substituted with pointers to morpho-syntactic objects."]},{"title":"4. Time Expression Recognition and Normalization","paragraphs":["For the annotation of TEMPORAL EXPRESSIONS (TEs) we have followed the TIMEX2 mark-up standard (Ferro et al. 2004), according to which markable expressions include both time durations (e.g. three years) and points (e.g. July 17th","1999, today). Time points can be either absolute expressions (e.g. the 17th","of July, 1999) or relative, i.e. anaphoric expressions (e.g. today). Also markable are event anchored expressions (e.g. two days before the departure) and sets of times (e.g. every month).","The standards developed for the Time Expressions Recognition and Normalization tasks allow for a semantically rich and normalized annotation. TEs Recognition refers to the task of finding the TEs within a text (detection) and determining their extension (bracketing). TEs Normalization refers to the task of interpreting the TEs by assigning values to pre-defined normalization attributes.","Normalization attributes are described as follows: - VAL: contains the value of a TE (e.g.","VAL=“2004-05-06” for the date <6 maggio 2004>/May","6th",", 2004 and VAL=“P6D” for the period <sei","giorni>/six days); no VAL is attributed to underspecified","TEs (e.g. <per lungo tempo>/for a long time); - MOD: captures temporal modifiers. Possible values are","APPROX (<verso mezzanotte>/around midnight),","MORE THAN (e.g. <più di 3 ore>/more than 3 hours)","and START (e.g. <i primi anni ‘70>/the early 70s); - ANCHOR VAL: contains a normalized form of an","anchoring date/time and appears in combination with","ANCHOR_DIR; - ANCHOR DIR: captures the direction of a TE, e.g.","AFTER and BEFORE. For instance, assuming May 6th",",","2004 as the reference time, the TE in <sarò in vacanza","per due mesi>/I will be on holiday for two months is","normalized as: VAL=“P2M” ANCHOR_VAL=","“2004-05-06” and ANCHOR DIR=“AFTER” (as the","period of two months is after the reference date); - SET: identifies expressions denoting sets of time. E.g.","<ogni anno>/every year is annotated with SET=“YES”.","The adaptation of the TIMEX2 annotation scheme to the annotation of Italian texts required some extensions (Lavelli et al., 2005). In particular, as a consequence of the specific features of Italian, which has a far richer morphology than English, we have introduced some changes concerning the extension of TEMPORAL EXPRESSIONS. According to the guidelines, definite and indefinite articles are considered as part of their textual realization, while prepositions are not (e.g. at <the end of March>). As the annotation is word-based, this does not account for Italian articulated prepositions, where a definite article and a preposition are merged, as in alla (a+la) fine di marzo/at the end of March. We have decided that this type of preposition should be included, so as to consistently include all the articles (e.g. <alla fine di marzo>/at <the end of March>); the same criteria have been adopted for the annotation of entities (see Section 5).","As shown in Table 3, the total number of annotated TEMPORAL EXPRESSIONS is around 4,550 (2,901 and 1,652 in the training and test sections respectively); in both sections of the corpus, the number of time points is slightly higher that the number of time durations.","As to the normalization of TEs, the combination ANCHOR_DIR and ANCHOR_VAL is the most frequently used attribute, as about 23% of the TEs in the corpus are anchored durations (see Table 4).","","Training Test Total Points 1553 53.5% 796 48.2% 2349 51.6% Durations 1207 41.6% 738 44.7% 1945 42.7% Underspec. 141 4.9% 118 7.1% 259 5.7% TOTAL 2901 1652 4553 Table 3: Occurrences and percentage of points, durations","and TEMPORAL EXPRESSIONS with no value ","Attribute Training Test Total VAL 2760 95,1% 1534 92,9% 4294 94,3% ANCH._VAL 696 24% 362 21.9% 1058 23.2% ANCH._DIR 696 24% 362 21.9% 1058 23.2% MOD 112 3.9% 76 4.6% 188 4.1% SET 121 4.2% 51 3.1% 172 3.8%","Table 4: Occurrences (in absolute numbers and","percentages) of normalization attributes  Inter-annotator agreement has been evaluated on the","dual annotation of a corpus of ten randomly chosen news"]},{"title":"965","paragraphs":["stories, for a total of about 5,204 words.","The most commonly used measure to characterize inter-annotator agreement is the kappa statistic (Cohen 1960), which measures pairwise agreement among a set of coders making category judgments taking into consideration agreement obtained by chance. In the case of TEs (and ENTITIES), however, annotators can theoretically choose to tag any sequence of adjacent tokens in a sentence. This makes it necessary to consider every possible sequence as a candidate, which would give exceedingly low results in terms of kappa, as annotation would become a binary categorization problem with an extremely skewed distribution (only a minimum number of the candidate sequences, in fact, are TEs).","For this reason we have used the kappa statistic to simply measure the agreement in determining whether each token is or is not part of any TE, and we have obtained k=0.958. However, this measure does not take into account the extent of the annotated TEs, so we have also compared the two annotated versions using the Dice coefficient. The Dice coefficient is computed as in [1], where C is the number of common annotations, while A and B are respectively the number of annotations provided by the first and the second annotator.","[1] Dice=2C/(A+B) 5","","The Dice coefficient is 0.955 for TE detection and 0.931 for TE bracketing.
