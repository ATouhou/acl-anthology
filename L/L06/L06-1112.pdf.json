Previous experiments on the basis of the manual analysis lead the authors to implement an automatic query strategy combining the term candidates proposed by an extractor together with a list of verbal syntactic patterns used for the relations refinement. Next step on the research will be the integration of the results into the term extractor in order to attain more restrictive pieces of information directly reused for the ontology building task. "]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["In this paper the authors show a strategy planned to obtain specialised knowledge fragments containing terms together with the conceptual relations among them, that is, the skeleton of a text that could be schematised by means of a concept map and hopefully reused in order to enrich a domain dependant ontology. These terms and relations will be detected in written texts from the genomics domain. The results presented in this paper have been obtained for the Catalan language but we are already working on the implementation of the same working methodology for specialised texts in Spanish and English will be also considered in a near future. Roughly speaking, our proposal shows one of the methodologies used for the achievement of conceptual mapping from texts and it includes two different and complementary strategies: On the one hand, we have used a term extractor (YATE) in order to obtain the term candidates in genomics domain texts. YATE has been tuned to cover the working specialised field by means of the enlargement and refinement of some domain dependant information. And, at the same time, the improvement of YATE has contributed to the enlargement of EuroWordNet (a widecoverage general-purpose lexico-semantic ontology) with new synsets. On the other hand, we have reviewed the traditional conceptual relations classification from the point of view of different (but closely related) disciplines, such as terminology, linguistics, ontologies and lexical semantics. After a validated experiment, we have proposed a closed typology of conceptual relations including seven main types of links that may relate the terms used in any domain, therefore also in genomics. These conceptual relations are reflected, in terms of language, by means of verbal markers usually accompanied with prepositions among other language specific mechanisms not used in our experiments. This patterns have been applied in order to compare the information contained between two different terms and to tag specialised knowledge fragments. In this paper after a brief state-of-the-art about conceptual relations, and the automatic detection strategies of these links, it is included the preliminary analysis of the verbal markers concerning precision and noise. Manually detected patterns from a sample corpus have allowed the authors to explore and implement an automatic query system which has been progressively refined. Some illustrating and relevant contexts are highlighted in the results section indicating some figures concerning precision for each verbal pattern conveying a particular conceptual relation. It is worth mentioning that the integration into YATE of the obtained results using a kwic query interface is described in the future research lines before briefly concluding the paper."]},{"title":"2 State of the art","paragraphs":["This section includes a brief state-of-the-art about conceptual relations, focusing on the point of view of the terminology contributions in this issue, and also some comments on recent advances in the automatic detection of some of these types of links."]},{"title":"2.1 Terminology","paragraphs":["Concepts and conceptual relations are essential items of the cognitive structure concerning specialised knowledge. In specialised texts, concepts are expressed by terms and conceptual relations become the so-called semantic relations when trying to identify them using different linguistic expressions It is assumed that each terminological unit corresponds to a cognitive node in a specialised domain and the whole of these nodes are linked by means of particular conceptual relations. The number and typology of conceptual relations considered by the traditional approach to terminology are not representative enough in order to account for the real links established among terms in a specialised text (Cabré, 1999; Feliu et al., 2002). The abstraction about this primary issue in Terminology proposed by Wüster and some of his followers (Felber, 1984; Felber et al., 1984) becomes excessively restrictive in order to give account of the real connections found in specialised texts. Although the hierarchical and non-hierarchical taxonomy of conceptual relations (followed by ISO standards) has been useful in the classical terminographical vocabularies, later research shows the need for an enlargement of the number and the subespecification of conceptual relations. Just to mention a few, there have been interesting contributions on concrete types of relations (Winston et al., for the meronymy relation; Marshman et al., in the case of causality). After having reviewed and compared these"]},{"title":"2377","paragraphs":["proposals with the typology of relations included in different well-known ontologies (EWN, MikroKosmos among others) we have set a clear-cut definition of conceptual relation and we have proposed an integrating typology of this key element in terminology. Following Otman (1996), we define a conceptual relation as a binary link, between at least two terms, which has a semantic content itself; in other words, that it transfers a particular information and it allows to configure a specific predication among the terms it relates. Considering the potential recursivity of a conceptual relation, it can be represented by the following formula: <a R b, n>. The variables a and b represent the two minimum terms that have to appear between a conceptual relation, R represents the relation expressed by a linguistic marker and n foresees the possibility of some other terms to appear linked by that conceptual relation. Notice the following example for illustrating the above mentioned definition of conceptual relation: 34% of [human genes]a [are located in]R [L1]b and [L2 isochores]n. Where: a: \"human genes\" R: \"are located in\" (sequenciality-place) b: \"L1 (isochore)\" n: \"L2 isochore\". As already mentioned, the traditional typology of conceptual relations repetitively used in terminology has to be reconsidered when working with corpora. Our theoretical review, together with two experiments on specialized texts on medicine and genetics, carried us to set the following typology of conceptual relations1","(Feliu, 2004): a) Similarity positive: ser semblant a [be similar to]. negative: ser diferent de [be different from]. b) Inclusion Class inclusion or hyponimy (is-a relation): ser (un tipus) de [to be (a kind of)/is a]. c) Sequenciality place: ser en / ser davant / ser darrere / anar de x a y [to be in/in front of/behind, to go from x to y]. time: ser simultani / anterior / posterior a [to be simultaneous/previous/later to]. d) Causality causal: causar / ser la causa de / ser l’efecte de / produir / fer que [to cause/to be the cause of/to be the effect of/produce/make]. e) Instrument: servir per a / fer-se amb [to be useful for/to use/to be done with]. f) Meronymy: ser una part / element de; tenir + SN / estar format / fet per; incloure; constar de / pertànyer a [to be part/element of; have + SN, to be constituted of; to include] g) Association general: correlacionar-se amb; mostrar [to be related with / to show]. specialised: manifestar; determinar [to manifest / to determine].   1 It is worth mentioning that, as a working methodology, we established, for each conceptual relation, its corresponding prototype linguistic expression in order to tag the relations appearing in our corpus [an approximate Englisht translation is provided in square brackets]. This classification will become one of the essential items in the working methodology followed in order to attain the main goal of this research."]},{"title":"2.2 Automatic learning of semantic relations","paragraphs":["There is a number of applications in NLP where conceptual hierarchies are used as a background knowledge for carrying out a given task. These resources are important because they allow to structure information into categories, thus encouraging its search and reuse. Further, they allow to formulate rules as well as relations in an abstract and concise way, facilitating the development, refinement and reuse of a knowledge base. Further, the fact that they allow to generalize over words has shown to provide benefits in a number of applications2"," such as text classification (Bloehdorn et al., 2004) word sense disambiguation (Agirre et al., 2004) and term extraction (Vivaldi et al., 2002). However, it is well known that the development of an ontology represents a major bottleneck for any of the above mentioned NLP applications. Such difficulty arises because current methods for compiling an ontology relies on a manual enumeration of concepts and relations resulting in a high resources consuming task. Therefore, some effort has been done to overcome this issue by automatically acquiring ontological knowledge from domain-specific natural language texts. Most of the researchers in this area only considered to learn taxonomic relations. To mention but a few, we refer to some fairly recent work, e.g., by Hahn & Schnattinger (Hahn & Schnattinger, 1998) and Morin (Morin, 1999) who used lexico-syntactic patterns with and without background knowledge, respectively, in order to acquire taxonomic knowledge. Although taxonomic relations are of major significance some effort must be done to non taxonomic relations also. As a matter of fact, this is an issue not considered since recently. As an example, the user can /query an important ontology like EuroWordNet (or WordNet, its counterpart) to check that these kind of relationships are missing. A basic and largely exploited idea is the heuristic, reported in Hearst (1992), that certain patterns in texts induce a hyponym relation between words. The following are some examples of such patterns:","- NP0 such as {NPn,}n>0* (or | and) NP","- NP {, NP}*{,} or other NP","- etc. An interesting approach that combine different sources of evidences is presented in Cimiano et al. (2004). Here the authors basically apply the Hearst patterns to a corpus, the World Wide Web, WordNet and knowledge obtained from complex terms. A complete platform for semiautomatic acquisition of conceptual relations is proposed in Maedche et al. (2000). The authors perform an extensive and detailed linguistic analysis to the text chosen by an ontology engineer to learn from. Then the system applies a learning algorithm to find association rules among pairs of concepts. This system was tested in the tourism domain."," 2 In http://mira.csci.unt.edu/~wordnet/ it is possible to check an extensive bibliography about WordNet and its applications to many areas of NLP."]},{"title":"2378","paragraphs":["In Missikoff et al.

We have applied to the corpus a list of 55 verbal markers (manually validated in a previous research) using a term detector called Mercedes. This tool works on the basis of the comparison of the terms appearing in the texts with a set of terminological units contained in a predefined dictionary (see Araya et al, 2004, for details). The integration of the list of verbs to the terminological units detecting system have resulted into more than three thousand contexts including, in the sentence framework, at least one terminological unit and the verb itself which is potentially expressing a conceptual relation. Next step on the corpus analysis has consisted in the manual validation of the retrieved contexts. Figures on relevance, precision and noise are shown on Table 1.  Verbal marker Occ.

Additionally it was decided to use YATE in order to facilitate the validation process. For such purpose we have designed a system that has the architecture shown Figure 1. This system, applies the term extractor to the same texts used in the previous experiment and then, the resulting terms are used to query the full genomic corpus looking for sentences where a pattern like <term><verb+prep> applies. The second part of the pattern corresponds to the sequences containing the verb plus preposition pre-defined in section 3. Figure 1. Query environment In this context, the idea is to extract from the corpus only those sentences that are the best candidates to provide interesting information regarding the concepts transfered by means of the terms appearing in the texts. Most of the systems already proposed for a similar task have a simplistic strategy for detecting the terms present in a given text. Here we propose to use YATE, a hybrid term extractor developed for the Medical domain that combines the results obtained by a set of term analyzers described briefly as follows (see Vivaldi, 2001 for details): - domain coefficient: it uses the EWN ontology to sort the term candidate. - context: it evaluates each candidate using other candidates present in its sentence context. - classic forms: it tries to decompose the lexical units in their formants, taking into account the formal characteristics of many terms in the domain. - collocational method: it evaluates multiword candidates according to its mutual information. The results obtained by this set of heterogeneous methods are combined using two different methods: voting and boosting. In the former each single term analyzer reports a term/no term status while the latter makes use of a well-known method originated in the machine learning area."]},{"title":"5 Results","paragraphs":["The results obtained from applying the above mentioned methodology are depicted in Table 3. It shows that the number of the specialized knowledge fragments retained by the resource is quite impressive. In terms of system evaluation, figures indicate a (relatively) high precision concerning the fine tagging of the contexts containing clear terms and one single type of conceptual relation.

Obtained results A close examination of the results in the previous table shows that for some non-ambiguous relations (general association, specialised association, causality, instrumentality, meronymy and sequenciality-place loc.) the performance reached is pretty good. On the contrary, some other relations like inclusion/meronymy and specialised association/sequenciality place loc., are ambiguous and therefore they require manual validation. In some cases, the number of textual fragments retained is too low and for this reason the results concerning these cases are not significant. A separate comment on the inclusion relation expressed by the is-a marker should be done. In this case, the precision is quite low (nearly 40%) mainly due to the fact that the second term in the relation is not detected. When this position is occupied by words expressing exemplification, case or results among others, the inclusion and the localization relations do not apply. Also, when the word expresses cause or consequence the meaning of the marker itself changes to causality. Conversely, the best results have been obtained with the causality and meronymy relations (about 90% and 97% of precision, respectively), although the former is much more frequent. The following two fragments show examples where these relations are correctly detected:  - causality: La #malaltia# de Gaucher és un trastorn","degut a la disfunció del sistema lisosòmic.

Our model is based upon a previous work on the definition of a typology of conceptual relations and some experimentation using this set of markers. As a result of this experimentation it was decided to attach a specific preposition to every verb in order to refine the results and to avoid ambiguity derived from polysemous markers. A new experiment was designed introducing the use of a term extractor together with a corpus query program. The result of this new experiment is very encouraging because an interesting number of text fragments can be considered as correctly detected concerning specialised knowledge retrieval. This result encourage us to go further in the integration of the proposed methodology with a term extractor. To sum up, we conclude that the specialised knowledge retrieval using terminological information in order to get a semiautomatic ontology and term database enlargement may be possible with the use of the techniques that we have presented in this paper."]},{"title":"8 References ","paragraphs":["Agirre E., Martinez, D.
