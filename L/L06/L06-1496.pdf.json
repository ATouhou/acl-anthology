SpaceBank is the spatial counterpart of TimeBank, an electronic resource for temporal semantics and reasoning. The paper focuses on building an ontology of lexicalized spatial concepts. The textual occurrences of the concepts in this ontology will be annotated using the SpaceML language, briefly described here. SpaceBank is designed to be integrated with TimeBank, for a spatio-temporal model of the textual information."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["Most entities, relations, events or situtations that populate any fragment of text or speech are related to time and space. Most mental and computational world models include, or are based on, a spatio-temporal component. Therefore, capturing the spatial and temporal information is a key step in building such models from text, in content-based text processing tasks such as Information Extraction or Question Answering. The temporal aspect of the problem has received much attention from the NLP community in recent years, one notable result being the creation of TimeBank (Hobbs and Pan 2004). TimeBank is an integrated electronic resource based on the DAML-Time temporal ontology and a linguistic corpus. The occurrences of the ontology concepts as parts of larger events in the corpus are annotated using a specification language called TimeML. This resource is currently used in temporal inference tasks. In contrast, the spatial aspect of the problem has received much less attention. There are multiple projects and resources which consider this domain among other domains. They are surveyed in section 2 of this paper. Their value and limitations for the spatial content-based text processing are the object of Section 2, and Section 3.1 shows that the spatial domain still needs an integrated resource similar to TimeBank. This paper attempts to fill that niche by introducing SpaceBank, which is also designed to integrate with TimeBank for a spatio-temporal model of the world. Sections 3.2 and 3.3 describe the construction of a spatial ontology. Section 4 gives a brief specification of the SpaceML language, and Section 5 draws the conclusions."]},{"title":"2. Previous work","paragraphs":["This section surveys the existing research tasks and resources that are relevant to this paper. They are grouped in three categories: hierarchies, ontologies and linguistic corpora. The first two attempt to organize the spatial concepts that populate certain areas of human cognition. The third attempts to annotate the occurrence of such concepts in texts. 2.1. Hierarchies of Spatial Concepts A hierarchy covers a certain subdomain of language or cognition. For example, Named Entity Recognition (NER) systems such as (Bikel et al.1999) recognize locations, among other named entities. All kinds of locations are tagged simply as LOCATION. Only a few NER systems are able to distinguish subclasses of locations such as cities and countries. These systems are based on Extended Named Entity Hierarchies, which function as shallow ontologies. Geographical Information Systems 1","(GIS) need to recognize a large variety of geographical and geopolitical units. Most units form a hierarchy of containment, which is a funda-mental spatial relation. 2.2. Spatial Ontologies OpenCyc 2","is a large-scale ontology that includes the spatial domain, represented by complex hierarchies of spatial relations 3",", movements 4",", geographical entities 5",", paths and traversals 6","and transportation 7",". Smaller ontologies covering the spatial domain, among other domains, include the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO, (Grenon and Smith 2004)), the Suggested Upper Merged Ontology (SUMO, (Nills and Pease 2001) and the Region Connection Calculus (RCC, (Cohn et al.1999)). A comprehensive and general ontology is WordNet (Fellbaum 1998), which groups semantically synonymous words in sets called synsets and organizes them according to the ISA (hypernymy) and other semantic relations. Significant parts of WordNet’s hierarchies are made of spatial concepts. WordNet is the base of our ontology, as shown in Section 3.3. 2.3. Spatial Linguistic Corpora PropBank (Kingsbury et al.2001) annotates predicates and their arguments, which designate the objects of predicates and the modifiers of the entire predication. The locative modifiers represent the spatial information that apply to the predication. PropBank does not distinguish subclasses of locative modifiers, and it is thus of limited use to a study of the spatial domain of English. However, there are many shallow semantic parsers trained on PropBank, and one of 1 http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/giswww.html 2 http://www.opencyc.org/ 3 http://www.cyc.com/cycdoc/vocab/spatial-vocab.html 4 http://www.cyc.com/cycdoc/vocab/movement-vocab.html 5 http://www.cyc.com/cycdoc/vocab/geography-vocab.html 6 http://www.cyc.com/cycdoc/vocab/path-traversal-vocab.html 7 http://www.cyc.com/cycdoc/vocab/transportation-vocab.html"]},{"title":"2315","paragraphs":["their most difficult tasks is recognizing locative adjuncts, as shown in Table 1 8",".

In the first example, the expression under the Brady Plan is synonymous to the expression according to the Brady Plan, which clearly is not a locative, despite using the under preposition. This serves as a simple example of spatial vocabulary borrowed by non-spatial domains. In the third example, the word here in the expression Here she delivers, is not a locative either. Therefore, PropBank annotations of locative adjuncts may be too shallow to be included in a study of the spatial language. The Automatic Content Extraction 10","(ACE-2004,2005) evaluations annotate the text occurrences of three types of spatial relations (Located, Near and Part-whole). These are relations between pairs of entities (e.g., a GeoPoliti-cal Entity and an ORGanization), and thus differ from the relations between locative adjuncts and their predications in PropBank. Figure 2 presents an example annotation for each of the three relation types mentioned. 11 Our analysis indicates that the ACE annotation does not suffer from the problems reported above for PropBank. 8 http://www.lsi.upc.edu/s̃rlconll/st04/slides/intro.pdf 9 http://www.cs.rochester.edu/g̃ildea/Verbs/ 10 http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/894.01/tests/ace/ 11 Examples are taken from ACE-2004 data.

However, the ACE corpus has its own limitations with respect to the spatial language. The most important limitation is that only three types of spatial relations are annotated, and even they are restricted to few classes of arguments. We built a simple recognizer for all ACE relations, based on 13 features an the J48 classifier in WEKA, which was empirically observed to obtain good results on this problem, compared to other algorithms implemented in the same data mining library.

Each frame contains several frame elements, which encode the participants and the properties of the event or state defined by the frame. FrameNet annotates spatial information both in the form of frames and in the form of frame elements. Table 4 lists the 112 frames, out of the 609, that we consider relevant for the spatial linguistic domain. Figure 3 illustrates the FrameNet annotation of the Emptying, Departing, and Attaching frames. In these examples, each annotated instance of a spatial frame has at least two conveyors of spatial information: the verb and one spatial frame element.

We include here the work by (Setzer 2001), (Pustejovsky et al.2005) and (Hobbs and Pan 2004) in temporal semantics and reasoning. They argue that events are temporally anchored in the narrative, and this anchorage forms the foundation of our reasoning about how the world changes. To facilitate the automatic recognition and reasoning about events as a means of performing content-based (as opposed to keyword-based) text processing, they developed three resources: (1) TimeML, a specification language for annotating temporal entities and events in free text; (2) DAML-Time, an ontology for temporal concepts, designed for the temporal contents of Web pages and services; and (3) TimeBank, a corpus annotated with TimeML. We borrowed this architecture for SpaceBank."]},{"title":"3. Building a Lexicalized Spatial Ontology 3.1. The need for a new spatial ontology","paragraphs":["The resources and ideas surveyed in the previous section cover a wide range of aspects of the spatial language and teach us valuable lessons. PropBank and FrameNet evidence the pervasiveness of space in event semantics and at the syntax-semantics interface. While PropBank labels all types of spatial information with the same label, FrameNet differentiates among 112 frames, as well as among 73 frame elements. This brings forward the granularity problem, since, for example, in the spatial domain it is not important whether Robert sits on a chair (the Posture and Placing frames) or he is tied to the chair (the Attaching frame). FrameNet also shows that not all the entities that play spatial roles are overt. The confusion matrix obtained for the ACE corpus, indicates that different spatial relations may have very similar linguistic representations,"]},{"title":"2317","paragraphs":["which make them difficult to discriminate based on surface features alone. These resources also have important (and sometimes inherent) limitations in the spatial domain: (1) None of them is dedicated to spatial language, thus none can be expected to be either optimal or comprehensive in this area; (2) They are difficult to integrate, since each is underlied by a different theory and operates at a different linguistic level; (3) Typical ontologies mentioned in the previous section organize concepts to allow logical inference, but they do not offer an annotated corpus for training. Linguistic corpora have the opposite problem. The spatial domain needs a resource that combines an ontology and an annotated corpus. This is the main purpose of SpaceBank.. It is also designed to be integrated with TimeBank, to produce a spatio-temporal world representation which combines the features of both components. To this end, SpaceBank uses the same linguistic corpus as TimeBank. The specification language, named SpaceML, is designed as an extension to TimeML. The spatial ontology, called DAML-Space, follows the steps of DAML-Time. Among the problems that the design of a spatial ontology must solve, we mention the potential difference between the ontological type of an entity (e.g., ORGANIZATION) and its spatial function (e.g., DESTINATION, such as Oracle in the sentence Bill Gates visited Oracle today.). There is a many-to-many mapping between concepts and spatial functions. As a real world example to illustrate the spatial concepts in a text that would need to be included in a spatial ontology, we take the first sentence of an Associated Press newswire article from Oct 20, 2005: Hurricane Wilma’s outer edge battered Cancun’s white-sand beaches Thursday as officials ordered hotel guests to evacuate, tourists jockeyed for spots on the last flights out, and tens of thousands of people fled from Honduras to the Florida Keys. There are several spatial concepts and relations in this sentence: (1) A special part-whole relation between Hurricane Wilma and its outer edge, invoked by the genitive construction. The relation is special because the edge is not a real part of the hurricane, but rather a property.; (2) A typical part-whole relation between the city of Cancun and its beaches, invoked by the genitive; (3) A destination relation between Hurricane’s edge and the beaches, invoked by the semantic frame (i.e., Cause harm)oftheverbbatter. Note that the beaches are the Victim frame element, thus there are frame elements that have a spatial function which is not their main function (and, consequently, they are not listed in Table 5); (4) An origin relation between the hotel and the guests’ evacuation, invoked by the semantic frame (i.e., Escaping)oftheverbevacuate. The hotel is the Undesirable location frame element, whose main function is spatial, and thus it is listed in Table 5; (5) A destination relation between tourists and the spots in the last flights out, invoked by the verb jockey (note that the spots is a spatial metaphor for airplane seats and flights out also invokes a spatial relation of origin between the flights and the city; (6) An origin relation betwen tens of thousands of people and Honduras, and a destination relation between the same people and Florida Keys, both relations invoked by the verb flee. Since Honduras is a different location from Cancun, establishing a causal link between the Hurricane’s presence in the latter location and tourists’ fleeing the former location is a matter of extralinguistic spatial knowledge about the proximity of the two locations and the typical size of a Hurricane. 3.2. Primitives for a Spatial Ontology (Gambarotto 2003) notes that identifying the ontological primitives of the spatial domain assumes the isolation of the basic objects of the geometry of our perception of the world. Note that the argument operates with the geometry of our perception, rather than the geometry of the world itself. This fact is the object of a general agreement in the cognitive literature, which uses the terms psychologi-cal space or mental space to designate the space we are talking or writing about, as opposed to the physical space we know from Geometry or Physics. Summarizing another general agreement in cognition, (Levinson 1996) states that the main difference between the mental space and the physical space is that the former is relative, whereas the latter is absolute. The relative space is anchored in the places occupied by physical objects around us and the relations between them. The linguistic counterparts of these cognitive arguments come from (Svorou 1994) and (Vandeloise 1991), among others. Svorou notes that we reason and talk about space in ways that reveal our beliefs rather than our scientific knowledge on the subject. Vandeloise argues for the inadequacy of both the geometric models and the logic models for the semantics of spatial prepositions in French. To isolate the basic objects of the geometry of our perception, and thus to identify the ontological primitives, cross-linguistic studies propose three ontological topics, or types of concepts: (1) Topology, which refers to inclusion and contact; (2) Orientation; and (3) Distance. The ontological problem is to choose the primitive concepts, or objects, that populate these topics. At this point, we distinguish between primitives that are abstract concepts such as points or vectors, which make use of our knowledge in the Euclidean geometry to code both the orientation and the distance in the relative space, and regions of space corresponding to physical objects. (Setzer 2001) mentioned temporal ontologies based on points only, as well as temporal ontologies based on intervals only. Each has advantages and drawbacks. A particular approach is to use the intervals defined in (Allen 1983) for the temporal domain. (Gambarotto 2003) notes that using Allen’s relations requires the approximation of physical objects by parallelepipedic shapes. Hobbs 14","proposes an extended list of spatial ontological topics, which are listed in Table 6 next to their temporal counterparts. The topology includes points, arcs, surfaces, volumes, connectedness and boundaries. The dimension and orientation include direction, path, conversions between different coordinate systems and the frame of reference. The Shape includes various 2D and 3D shapes, and the symmetry. The subtopics of size include length, area, volume, precise and uncertain measures. The geopolitical divisions were those occurring in FrameNet and ACE corpora, including country, state, county, city and continent.

This flexibility must be provided by the design of the entire ontology. 3.3. Our Lexicalized Spatial Ontology Our main purpose in building a new spatial ontology is to facilitate the automatic recognition of spatial concepts and relations in newswire text, and to enable the automatic logic inference in the spatial domain. As such, we focus on lexicalized concepts that have clearly identifiable spatial characteristics 15",", rather than abstract concepts that attempt to organize the entire spatial domain. For these reasons, rather than taking the rationalistic top-down way of fixing some primitives and then trying to fit all the textual spatial items into their bounds, we decided to follow a more empirical path. Namely, we start with a comprehensive semantic resource for English and then follow the bottom-up path to the primitives. As such, we decided to start the ontology construction from WordNet. We identified the WordNet synsets corresponding to the nominal topics and concepts proposed by Hobbs. From these starting points, we explored the WordNet noun hierarchy both top-down and bottom-up. The bottom-up search always stops at the {entity} synset, which is the root of the hierarchy. The top-down search, which is initiated from every synset that we reach during the search, follows only the hyponymy and instance links that lead to spatial synsets and stops when it reaches a synset that has only spatial hyponyms and instances. Figure 5 illustrates the part of the top level ontology that subsumes the physical object hierarchy. The entire nominal ontology has 11,452 word-sense pairs, which represent 7.9% of the 145,104 nominal word-sense pairs in WordNet 2.1. We computed the polysemy frequencies to evaluate the need for Word Sense Disambiguation when recognizing in text concepts from our ontology. Table 7 presents the results. The average polysemy is 1.68, which is larger than 1.23, the average polysemy of the entire WordNet nominal hierarchy. The spatial language is ambiguous, therefore Word Sense Disambiguation is required. P 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 11 28 F 3932 1750 726 244 79 40 16 10 1 1 Table 7: Polysemy in the nominal spatial ontology.

SPACEX is used to mark up explicit spatial expressions such as geopolitical entities, postal addresses, latitude and longitude and distances. The spatial expressions may be (a) Fully specified, such as 2601 North Floyd Rd, Richardson, TX 75080; (b) Underspecified expressions, such as the next block; and (c) Directions, Paths, Shapes and Orientations, e.g., towards the White House. The at-tributes of the SPACEX tag mirror those of TIMEX3. The SIGNALS tag annotates sections of text, typically function words, that indicate how spatial objects are to be related to each other. SIGNALS marks up several types of indicators: (1) Prepositions that have spatial meanings (among others): on, in, at, to, between, above, in front of and outside of. (2) Nominalizations such as entrance, transportation and connection; (3) Motion verbs such as exit, advance and move; and (4) Dimensional adjectives such as high, short and thick, as well as their nominalizations: height, shortness and thickness. The LINKS tag encodes spatial relations, which can relate two events, two entities or an event to an entity. Entities may or may not be locative. The LINKS tag does not include subordinate and aspectual links as does the temporal LINK tag, but it accounts for the frame of reference, which is the origin of the coordinate system in which the spatial relation is to be interpreted. Specifying the frame of reference disambiguates expressions like on the left sidewalk, in front of the tree, and behind the door. We distinguish frames of reference centered on a person (usually the speaker), the earth (invoked by expressinons such as the northwest corner), and on the carrier or thedriving force in case of a motion event. Besides the frame of reference, the LINKS tag marks up the class of spatial relation, e.g. location, part-whole, near and containment."]},{"title":"5.
