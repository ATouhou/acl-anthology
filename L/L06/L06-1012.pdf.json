Introduction","paragraphs":["\\tutomatic speech recognition applications are \\fecoming increasing popular. However, as automatic speech recognition matured, speech recognition performance on non-native speakers is still low. Non-native speakers are often given a second class treatment in term of speech recognition services. \\ts the world \\fecome more glo\\falize, non-native speakers are not a minority group anymore. International spoken languages for instance English and French are taught as a second language at schools and universities in most countries in the world. In addition, people who are on vacation in some foreign country also often learn up some common phrases, with the help of Internet or travel \\fooks that can \\fe easily found nowadays.","Research in non-native speech recognition is \\fecoming more active since the late 90s, although there are still not many compare to the works in other areas of speech recognition. \\t classical study on non-native speech recognition is done \\fy (Ue\\fler and Boros, 1999). Works in non-native speech recognition try to take into account of the way non-native speakers speak. \\bost of the works focus in acoustic model adaptation and dictionary improvement. In non-native acoustic model adaptation, among the pioneers are Witt and Young (1999) and Tomokiyo (2000). \\tdaptation method either use speaker’s native language (Witt and Young, 1999), small amount of non-native language (Wang and Schultz, 2003) or the speech from the target language itself (Steidl et al., 2004). On the other hand, the work in dictionary adaptation can \\fe found in (Goronzy, 2002, Livescu and Glass, 2000).","Speech corpora are very important components for the research and development in automatic speech recognition. It is also important to give researchers a way to compare and examine their results in a more meaningful way. However, only a few speech corpora are constructed \\fy putting non-native speakers in mind. For instance, we can only cite non-native German corpus B\\tS Strange Corpus 11","and Ver\\fmo\\fil Denglish2","which is non-native English corpus from German speakers which are pu\\flicly availa\\fle.

However, a more practical target will \\fe to provide enough non-native speech samples for evaluation and research purposes. \\ts a lot of speech corpora consist only of native speech, it is important that we integrate non-native speech with it, therefore making them more complete for non-native speech recognition evaluation and research.

It is also interesting to note that for phoneme /p/ which exists in French and Vietnamese (exists only as a word final unreleased stop /p/ in Vietnamese), Vietnamese variant of /t/ was recognized instead for three of the five speakers.
