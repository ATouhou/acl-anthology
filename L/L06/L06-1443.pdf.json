Abstract","paragraphs":["In this paper, we describe a formal constraint mechanism, which we label Conceptual Constraint Variables (CCVs), introduced to restrict surface patterns during automated text analysis with the objective of increasing precision in the representation of informational contents. We briefly present, and exemplify, the various types of CCVs applicable to the English texts of our corpora, and show how these constraints allow us to resolve some of the problems inherent to surface pattern recognition, more specifically, those related to the resolution of conceptual or syntactic ambiguities introduced by the most frequent English prepositions."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["In recent years, a number of teams have worked on defining models for the automatic extraction of terminology (Daille, 1994; Bourigault, 1994; Jacquemin, 2001) and conceptual relations (Meyer & al., 1999; Morin, 1999; Condamines & Rebeyrolle, 2001; Marshman et L’Homme, 2005) in order to build knowledge bases that can be used for various applications: information retrieval, ontology building, terminology work, etc. The domain of intellectual property, particularly the description of wares and services, tends to show characteristics that would make it a good candidate for natural language processing (NLP). In this project, NLP is used for (1) automatic classification of wares and services within the Nice classification (www.wipo.int), (2) computer-assisted translation of the descriptions of wares and services as well as (3) filtering techniques applied to information retrieval in the domain of trademark searching.","The aim of this study is to provide an effective method for the automatic extraction of terms and conceptual relations between terms in this domain in order to gain access to the informative content of texts. The corpus used for the experiments is built using a sample of documents taken from the Canadian Trademark Register (roughly 12 million words) describing wares and services covered by trademarks. Our hypothesis is the following: descriptions can be analysed and processed as a sublanguage. Based on that assumption, we can propose a methodology for extracting uniterms, multiterms and conceptual relations specific to the area of wares and services of trademarks. In order to achieve this, we use a hybrid technique of linguistic features combined with statistical and corpus-based tools. Candidate terms are extracted using standard statistical methods like bigrams, log-likelihood and mutual information. The results of the statistical processing are filtered using a combined term formation pattern technique (Frantzi & Ananiadou, 1997; Drouin, 2003) and term frontier approach (Bourigault, 1994). Conceptual relations are identified using lexical-syntactic patterns that were collected and formalized following a thorough manual analysis of the sublanguage being processed. The tool identifies, amongst others, the following major relations: HYPONYMY (... footwear namely running shoes, hiking boots...), FUNCTION (...electrical apparatus for recording, reproducing, amplifying and processing sound...), COMPOSITION (...a decorative device consisting of a base which contains electronic apparatus...), DOMAIN (...software and users manuals sold therewith , for use in the fields of call management , contact management...), USER (...message pads for use by pharmacists...) and NEGATION (... knit goods , except hats and caps...). Patterns are represented using a tripartite label containing the following elements: <HEAD_SUB_REL, FORM, RELATION> where HEAD_SUB_REL is syntactic relation between head and subordinated terms, RELATION is the conceptual relation and FORM is a lexical-syntactic pattern. The output of the analysis is a tagged version of the input text where all relations are encoded with such triple tags and followed by the scope of the relation, as in the example below1",": (1) source: ...containers made of plastic materials for use by pharmacists in the dispensing of pills , tablets , capsules , liquids and other forms of medication...  output: containers [COMPLEMENT/MADEOF/COMPOSITION] made of [/COMPLEMENT]","[C0--] plastic materials [--C0] [COMPLEMENT/USEBY/USERS] for use by [/COMPLEMENT]","[C2--] pharmacists [--C2] [COMPLEMENT/IN/FUNCTION] in [/COMPLEMENT] [C3--] the dispensing","[PREPOSITION/OF/SPEC] of [/PREPOSITION]","[P4--] pills [COMMA],[/COMMA] tablets","[COMMA],[/COMMA] capsules [COMMA],[/COMMA]","liquids","[CHARNIERE/TYPEOF/HYPONYM] and other forms of","[/CHARNIERE] [H5--] medication [--H5]","[--P4] [--C3]"]},{"title":"2.

They are designed to increase the granularity of the analysis, to enable a finer definition of the conceptual 1 For the purpose at hand, it is sufficient to define the scope of a conceptual marker as the segment of text located to its right that is semantically or conceptually dependent on it."]},{"title":"591","paragraphs":["content in the analyzed texts. CCVs fall into different categories and can be defined along two major axis, the first one concerning the formal aspect of the constraint, the second having to do with its function. CCVs can thus be lexical (composed of one or many lexical elements), syntactic (relating to word order and/or parts-of -peech), or morpho-syntactic in nature (going beyond part-of-speech to include phonological or orthographical aspects of words). Functionally speaking, CCVs are defined as endomorphic if they participate in defining the formal content of a conceptual marker, and contextual if they restrict the application of a marker by specifying elements outside the marker’s boundaries. In the examples to follow, we use what we consider to be variants of the marker FOR to exemplify all 6 flavors of CCVs."]},{"title":"2.1 Lexical Constraints","paragraphs":["Lexical constraints are simply composed of a list of words, or even a single word. The only obligatory element of our marker FOR can actually be defined as an endomorphic lexical CCV, as shown in the example below, where the boldface element is simply a label for the CCV and the element “Lex:” introduces its lexical content.","(2) ccv1: FOR { Lex: for } The same marker can also involve lexical CCV containing lexical items that can only optionally be found within its boundaries, as with the expressions <designed for>, <especially for>, etc., which are, within the limits of our sublanguage, equivalent to the bare preposition. Two of these endomorphic lexical CCV are given below. Their actual use and their respective positions within the marker will be discussed in section 3. (3) ccv2: ESPECIALLY { Lex: especially | specifically | primarily | essentially } ccv3: DESIGNED { Lex: designed | adapted | constructed | made | fitted }"]},{"title":"2.2 Syntactic constraints","paragraphs":["Syntactic CCVs only refer to the linear position of an expression and/or to the part-of-speech of adjacent lexical items. The default, and least precise interpretation of our marker FOR, which we call “specifier”, or SPEC, is a simple restriction on the reference of the preceding element. It is found in phrases like : wires for computers, food for cats, etc. and can in part be defined using a syntactic CCV that restricts the following word to a plural noun. Here the element “Syn:” denotes the syntactic nature of the restriction, NNS is the plural noun POS-tag used in the Penn Tree Bank.

For example, the next two CCVs require a singular noun whose ending is either –ion or –ment, or a noun or gerund (VBG) ending in –ing. Both CCVs are useful in determining whether the scope of a given FOR marker denotes the function of the preceding element. We discuss these two CCVs further in the next sections.

CCVs can also contain information found on more than one level of representation, much as what we find in auto-modular theories of grammar (Sadock, 1991, for example). Furthermore, CCVs can call upon one another in their definition. A syntactic CCV, for example, can specify that the lexical element in a given position must match the specifications of another lexical or morpho-syntactic CCV, as in the example below. (6) ccv7: FOLLOWED_BY_ACTION M-Syn: X = ION/MENT | ING Syn: __ DET? X OF? NP  CCV7 indicates that the following element corresponds to the morpho-syntactic patterns defined in the two CCVs in (5), followed by an optional of and a noun phrase. Similarly, two of the following three CCVs are defined using the lexical pattern of the first one. (Question marks indicate optional elements, AP and NP respectively stand for adjectival phrase and nominal phrase.) (7) ccv8: LEX_DOMAIN { Lex: field | domain | sector | industry } ccv9: DOMAIN_OF Lex: X = LEX_DOMAIN Y = OF Syn: __ DET? X Y NP ccv10: X_DOMAIN M-Syn: X = LEX_DOMAIN Syn: __ DET? (AP | NP ) X  CCV8 is a list of lexical items having to do with domains of application; CCV9 indicates that the following phrase must have the form: the (optional) (field | domain | sector | industry) of, followed by a noun phrase; and CCV10 basically requires a noun phrase that ends with one of the lexical items of LEX_DOMAIN."]},{"title":"2.5 Endomorphic and Contextual Constraints","paragraphs":["Going back to our marker FOR, its various conceptual interpretations can be defined using lexical, syntactic or morphosyntactic CCVs, some of which described in the previous sub-sections. In other words, a Conceptual Constraint Pattern (CCP), that is to say a surface pattern associated with a precise conceptual interpretation, can be exhaustively defined as a set of Conceptual Constraint Variables2",". These CCVs can be used to specify elements that are included in the marker itself, we refer to such 2 A Conceptual Constraint pattern defined by multiple CCVs is thus a Complex Conceptual Constraint Pattern, or CCCP, which represents Unambiguous Surface Semantic Restrictions, or USSR."]},{"title":"592","paragraphs":["constraints as endomorphic (or more precisely endomorphic to a given conceptual constraint pattern). Conversely, a CCV can be used to specify the context, be it syntactic, lexical, or morpho-syntactic, in which a marker receives a given interpretation. The marker FOR can be interpreted as introducing either a FUNCTION of the preceding item, its DOMAIN of application, its USERS, etc. Each of these interpretations corresponds to a conceptual pattern exhaustively composed of CCVs. For example, the triple tag <COMPLEMENT/FOR/FUNCTION> (FOR denoting the function of the item that precedes it) is triggered by the conceptual pattern in (8) and covers expressions such as those found in (9)3",": (the CCV labeled USEIN refers to the word use followed by the word in.)

Context : FOLLOWED_BY_ACTION  (9) apparatus <for> cleaning carpets apparatus <designed for> the treatment of cancer apparatus <especially designed for use in> polishing floors  The endomorphic portion of the pattern indicates what must or may appear inside the marker itself, and the contextual part specifies that this pattern must immediately precede the pattern described by the CCV FOLLOWED_BY_ACTION, i.e. a word ending in –ing, -ion or – ment and belonging to specific morpho-syntactic categories. Similarly, FOR will be interpreted as introducing the DOMAIN of application of the preceding item when it matches one of the conceptual patterns in (10) and covers expressions such as those found in (11).

DOMAIN_OF Context : NP","(11) a) apparatus <for> the dairy industry apparatus <adapted for use in> the scientific fields b) apparatus <for the field of> science apparatus <adapted for use in the domain of> mining  Both conceptual patterns are composed of CCVs described earlier. It is interesting to note that linearity imposes a different structure to conceptual patterns covering very similar expressions. Pattern #2, covers expressions in which words like domain or field, covered by CCV LEX_DOMAIN, are followed by a prepositional phrase. The word included in LEX_DOMAIN and the following preposition can therefore be included inside the boundaries of the marker since they do not add any 3 Obviously, the patterns defined in these examples, as well as the CCVs we describe are somewhat simplified versions of their actual self. A complete definition using the actual CCVs used in our application would introduce a level of complexity that is unnecessary given our current purposes. information. Pattern #1, on the other hand, matches expressions in which the word included in LEX_DOMAIN is the head of its noun phrase and, thus, to the right of the relevant words. It can therefore not be included inside the marker and must be part of the contextual portion of the pattern rather than in its endomorphic section. The marker FOR can also be interpreted as introducing a USER, the type of individuals for whom the element to the left is intended. Three additional CCVs are necessary to define the relevant Conceptual Constraint Patterns. (12) ccv11: LEX_USER { Lex: men | women | children | pharmacists | etc.} ccv12: FOLLOWED_BY_USER Lex: X = LEX_USER Syn: __ X ccv13: USEBY Lex: X = use ; Y = by Syn: __ X Y (13) <COMPLEMENT/FOR/USERS > #1 Endo : ESPECIALLY?

FOR Context : FOLLOWED_BY_USER  A given instance of the marker FOR is thus interpreted as introducing a USER if it includes the segment “for use by” followed by a plural noun; or if FOR is immediately followed by a lexical element included in LEX_USER. The CCPs in (13) covers examples such as (14): (14) footwear <for>men, women and children apparatus< especially designed for> children apparatus < intended for use by> pharmacists  A summary of the various CCPs included under the label FOR is provided in Table 1."]},{"title":"3. Results and Evaluation","paragraphs":["The manual evaluation of the results obtained using this technique indicates a high degree precision of the analysis without significant impact on recall and performance of the overall process. Of the various interpretations of the marker FOR, FUNCTION is by far the most frequent, followed by SPEC, DOMAIN, and finally USER. 97% of tokens received the correct interpretation and 7 tokens were interpreted incorrectly. Of those 7, 1 is a false positive for the FUNCTION interpretation, the rest are all cases in which the marker received the SPEC interpretation instead of FUNCTION or USER. Since SPEC (see definition in Table 1) is the least precise and the default interpretation of the marker FOR, it is easy to understand why almost all interpretation errors are included under this label. If, for example, the lexical item accountant is not included in the CCV labeled LEX_USER, the software simply cannot distinguish between the phrases software for accountants and software for nuclear reactors and both expressions will receive the SPEC interpretation. Furthermore, the extremely low frequency of the USER interpretation has"]},{"title":"593","paragraphs":["made the creation of a somewhat thorough lexical set for LEX_USER rather difficult, hence the very low recall of the USER interpretation.

Conclusion","paragraphs":["The use of CCVs in the analysis of text yields a granularity in the analysis that is sufficient for the extraction and interpretation of information contained in descriptions of wares and services. The increase in precision resulting from the technique allows us to reuse the output for further NLP processing such as the development of a specialized knowledge base, the building of an ontology, computer-assisted translation and the expansion of a translation memory with increased reliability. The advantages of the mechanisms we propose are twofold. First, the use of CCVs in the analysis of text describing wares and services obviously increases the precision of the analysis when compared to a scenario in which every instance of the marker is given the same vague interpretation. Second, the use of CCVs allows us to process relatively complex linguistic structures using extremely simple mechanisms. It allows us to use only information contained in the text without recourse to complex representational schemes, unification grammars, or dictionaries or thesaurus containing conceptual or semantic information. On the other hand, it seems clear that an approach such as ours can only be realistically implemented when dealing with a specific sub-language characterized by a limited number of structures and conceptual relations. The efficiency of the analysis is also proportional to one’s knowledge of the sub-language in question, and presupposes a detailed examination of the data. Given the size of the corpora, it is often difficult to achieve an exhaustive analysis of a given pattern, especially when the CCVs that define that pattern are lexical in nature."]},{"title":"5.
