This corpus has been orthographically transcribed and annotated in terms of SpecificEntities and Topics. Twelve main topics have been chosen. They are refinedinto 22 sub-topics. The SpecificEntities are from five categories and cover Named Entities, linguistic entities, topic-defining entities, general entities and extended entities. The corpus contains 582 dialogs for 6 hours of user speech."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["The Ritel project aims at integrating a spoken language dialog system and an open-domain information retrieval system to allow a human to ask a general question (f.i. \"Who is currently presiding the Senate?” or \"How did the price of gas change for the last ten years?”) and refine his research interactively. This project is at the junction of several distinct research communities (information retrieval, spoken language dialog systems, natural language generation) and is not only about integrating existing tools but also and mainly about studiying a newly created, emerging object, a new kind of human-computer dialog. In particular it includes collaborative information search and dynamic co-building of semantics and interaction domain. One of the first step of this project was to collect a corpus of spoken queries. In this paper we will present the methodology used to collect and to annotate the corpus. This corpus should eventually be available to the community. We developped a first platform (Galibert et al., 2005) to collect data. The main components of the Ritel system are the speech recognizer, the entities tagger, the dialog manager, the question-answering system, the natural language generation system and the Text-To-Speech synthetizer. They communicate through a message-passing in-frastructure. The dialog manager controls and organises the interaction. It manages the entities tagger and the information passed through to the QA system. An overview of the spoken dialog system architecture is shown in Figure 1. The dialog manager was designed to incite people to talk as much as possible, to reformulate their requests in many ways, and refining their question while keeping a reasonably natural interaction. It can hence be considered an Eliza variation (Weizenbaum, 1966). Moreover it allows searching of information in databases as appropriate. Each semantic frame sent by the specific entity detector is analyzed in context, i.e. taking into account the history of the interaction. The new, in-context frame is sent to the decision module which rewrites it again, this time using both a dialog model (how interactions go in general, whatever the subject) and a task model (how the specific request for information and refinement of the request occurs). If according to these models the current request is considered to be of the kind that can be answered factually by searching # dial. duration of # user queries # user words","user speech 582 6h 5360 60k # distinct # user’s queries mean duration of user’s words per dial. user’s speech/dial","2876 9 33s. # Topics # Sub-Topics 1171 4761","# dist. topics # dist.subtopics","12 22 # Entities # Distinct entities 10378 63 Table 1: Summary of the RITEL corpus in one of the available databases, the search module extracts the relevant keys and does the search. Otherwise the incitation module isolates the topic of the request in order to generate an answer which, while not actually answering the question, shows that the system has understood something and urges the user to refine or reformulate the question. These two modules generate new semantic frames that are sent to the natural language generation (NLG) module. Current searches can only be done in fixed databases, but a full-blown QA system is in the process of being connected to the dialog manager."]},{"title":"2. Corpus description","paragraphs":["The corpus was collected between September 2004 and February 2005. 13 persons called the Ritel system. Each subject had received a list of 300 possible questions. They were told to feel free to ask the system whatever they want however they want. Of the 6 hours of user speech one hour has been set aside for development (dev) and one hour for testing (test) purposes. The total corpus contains 6 hours of user speech, 5360 user queries in 582 dialogs. Table 1 gives an overview of the corpus. All the corpus has been orthographically transcribed and annotated in terms of topic and specific entities.

Topic annotation The topic are hierarchically organized. There are 12 main topics (such as animal, arts, music, sciences etc.). These main topics are subdivided into 22 sub-topics (such as vocabulary, biology, law etc.). 536 utterances received a null topic, 4824 one main-topic and 63 two main-topics. In all of the dual-topic queries, the first topic reference is a rejec-tion by the user of a misunderstanding of the system and the second the real object of the query. Additionally, 1171 sub-topics have been annotated. Table 7 shows examples for each main-topic. Each topic can be refined with one or more sub-topics which have grown from the actual contents of the corpus. Table 2 show the 10 most present full topic classifications found in the corpus.

Conclusion","paragraphs":["This corpus is a real (as opposed to Wizard-of-Oz) Human-Computer QA-oriented spoken dialog corpus. The user utterances have been fully transcribed and annotated and we working towards its free distribution to the community. Some, but by no means all, of the expected uses for it are:","Dialog System development. The data is usable as-is for both the speech recognition side (acoustic and language models) and the dialog management side (automatic understanding)","Natural Language Question Answering. A number of user strategies towards interactive information retrieval can be seen through the corpus, including question explanations and reformulations.
