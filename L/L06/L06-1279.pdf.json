The tool is aimed at manipulating heterogeneous lexical resources, and the need for such a tool came from the large volume of resources the Group has developed in the course of many years and within different projects. The tool handles morphological dictionaries, wordnets, aligned texts and transducers equally and has already proved very useful for various tasks. Although it has so far been used mainly for Serbian, WS4LR is not language dependent and can be successfully used for resources in other languages provided that they follow the described formats and methodologies. The tool operates on the .NET platform and runs on a personal computer under Windows 2000/XP/2003 operating system with at least 256MB of internal memory. "]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["The Human Language Technology group at the Faculty of Mathematics has been developing various lexical resources over quite a long period, reaching a considerable volume to date. Given the fact that these resources have been developed for many years, they have naturally been conceived within different projects and frameworks, both from the conceptual and the technological point of view. Although the HLT group made every reasonable effort to keep the ever growing pool of resources as coherent and standardized as possible, a certain level of heterogeneity was inevitable. Hence, due to the growth of the volume of resources as well as their heterogeneity, there was a rising need for developing a tool that would facilitate the maintenance, exploitation and integration of available resources as well as their further development. Embarking on this task, the HLT group has recently produced an integrated and easily adjustable tool, a workstation for language resources, labeled WS4LR, which greatly enhances the potentials of manipulating each particular resource as well as several resources simultaneously. The paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we describe the lexical resources that can be handled by WS4LR, in section 3 we present the WS4LR modules and their functions, in section 4 some software consideration are given, and section 5 offers some conclusions and ideas for further work."]},{"title":"2. Overview of Resources","paragraphs":["Various lexical resources that can be produced and handled by WS4LR are briefly described in this section."]},{"title":"2.1 Morphological Dictionaries","paragraphs":["Morphological dictionaries of simple words and compounds1","in LADL format (Courtois & Silberztein, 1990) exist for many languages, including French, English, Greek, Portuguese, Russian, Thai, Korean, Italian, Spanish, Norwegian, Arabic, German, Polish, Bulgarian, and Serbian. The Intex2",", Unitex3","and Nooj4"," systems for natural language processing based on linguistic resources provide for text processing using this type of dictionaries, but offer no facilities for dictionary development and management. WS4LR enables manipulation of dictionaries both of lemmas and of inflected forms.","In LADL format, all the entries in the dictionary of simple word lemmas, the so called DELAS, have the following form:","lemma.Knnn [+SinSem]* where lemma is the simple word, in general in the form usually used in traditional dictionaries, K is the part of speech mark, nnn is the number denoting the class of lemmas that all share the same inflectional properties described by the appropriate transducer Knnn, and +SinSem is the freely attached marker that describes the syntactic, semantic, derivational, or other properties of a lemma. A part of speech code and an inflectional class code uniquely determine the finite transducer that generates all the forms in a lemma paradigm. A finite transducer, being capable of producing the output, adds to all these forms their possible grammatical categories. The DELAS dictionary and the set of transducers describing inflectional properties are used to produce the morphological dictionary of word forms, the so called DELAF. All the entries in this dictionary have the following form:","form,lemma[:categories]* where form is a simple word form of a lemma that is represented by its DELAS entry form, and :categories are  1 Term multi-word unit is sometimes used. 2 Intex homepage: http://msh.univ-fcomte.fr/intex/ 3 Unitex homepage: http://www-igm.univ-mlv.fr/~unitex/ 4 Nooj homepage: http://www.nooj4nlp.net"]},{"title":"1692","paragraphs":["the possible grammatical categories of the word form, each category represented by a single character code. Morphological dictionaries of compound lemmas and word forms, named DELAC and DELACF, follow a similar format, except that both lemma and form can contain non-alphabetic characters – blank, hyphen, apostrophe, and alike. There is, however, one substantial difference. The inflection of compounds is more complex: in order to obtain all forms of a compound two different types of information are necessary. The first one deals with the inflection of simple lemmas that constitute a compound, while the other governs how these inflected forms combine in order to obtain the inflected form of a compound by taking into consideration grammatical agreement, word order, omissions, etc. The entry in DELAC is therefore accordingly more complex:","c-lemma.Cnnn [+SinSem]* where c-lemma is a list of constituents in the form of entries of the DELAF dictionary of simple word forms:","c-lemma=lemma1.Nnnn[:categories],","lemma2.Nnnn[:categories],","lemma3.Nnnn[:categories],... The code Cnnn identifies a new type of transducer responsible for the inflection of compounds, described in (Savary, 2005). Examples of entries in these dictionaries are given in Appendix A."]},{"title":"2.2 Wordnets","paragraphs":["Roughly speaking, a wordnet, such as the Princeton WordNet (PWN) is composed of synsets, or sets of synonymous words representing a concept, with basic semantic relations between them forming a semantic network (Fellbaum, 1998). Each synset word or “literal” is denoted by a “literal string” followed by a “sense tag” which represents the specific sense of the literal string in that synset, pretty much as in any explanatory dictionary, where an entry corresponding to a word is followed by number of its possible meanings. Following the basic principles set by PWN, wordnets for many other languages were developed, some in the scope of international projects, others independently. An important impact to the wordnet development came from the EuroWordnet project (Vossen, 1998) where the idea of an Interlingual index (ILI) has been introduced that enables the connection of the same concepts in different languages. The usage of ILI was further explored in the scope of the Balkanet project (Stamou, 2002) where all wordnets were synchronously developed on the basis of PWN. Within this project an implicit wordnet XML scheme was developed and further used in a number of software tools for wordnet management, such as VidDic (Horák, 2004). The underlying XML format is illustrated in Appendix B."]},{"title":"2.3 Aligned Texts","paragraphs":["A pair of semantically equivalent texts in different langauges, such as an original text and its translation, that are and aligned on a structural level (paragraph, sentence, phrase, etc.) is known as an aligned text or bitext. Aligned texts are usually constructed in two main steps: in the first step, the texts to be aligned are segmented into equivalent units, and in the second step the correspondence between these units is established. The equivalent units are usually sentences, but the units can be larger, as well as smaller.","The standard method for representing aligned texts is the Translation Memory eXchange format (TMX) that is XML-compliant 5",". The alignment itself can be performed by different methods and tools (Veronis, 2000). Of particular interest are programs that use XML tagged input texts and produce the result also as an XML document. Such is the case with XAlign6",". In Appendix C short examples of input and output to XAlign, as well as the corresponding TMX format are given."]},{"title":"2.4 Finite Transducers","paragraphs":["As described in section 2.1, inflectional paradigms are represented by appropriate finite state transducers usually produced by the graph management tool in Intex/Unitex environment. The produced graphs are in the form of standard textual files that can easily be generated or managed independently of these systems and their respective graph management tools. The same is true for other types of graphs produced and used within Intex/Unitex."]},{"title":"2.5 Bilingual Lists","paragraphs":["As a result of a various translation and lexicographic projects various unstructured bilingual wordlists from various domains were produced. An excerpt from one such list is presented in Appendix E."]},{"title":"3. WS4LR Organization","paragraphs":["WS4LR is organized in modules which perform different functions as depicted in Figure 1.

The user can choose a conversion Perl or awk script suitable for the specific file type, or produce his/her own script easily.","This module makes switching between Intex and Unitex easy.

To that end the HLT group produces resources for Serbian in a special encoding that uses the ASCII character set and that can be unambiguously transformed into Serbian Latin or Serbian Cyrillic alphabet. As noted before, WS4LR offers to the user the option to apply the transformation only to a part of the file, such as an XML file where only the text should be converted while the XML tags shouldn’t be altered. Similarly, when a DELAS or DELAF type file is transformed, only lemmas and word forms are converted, not the part of speech and grammatical codes."]},{"title":"3.2 Dictionary Management","paragraphs":["This module enables concurrent manipulation of a set of dictionaries of lemmas, simple words or compounds, distributed in several files. Working with DELAF type files is not directly supported since this type of files should in general be produced automatically from DELAS by applying the appropriate transducers. The organization of dictionaries in separate files is important from the practical point of view since smaller files are easier to manipulate. An even more important reason is the fact that in text recognition by Intex/Unitex the usage of all dictionaries is not always necessary, or even recommended. For example, dictionaries of English personal names transcribed according to Serbian orthography should not be applied to a text that makes no reference to such persons, since that could only unnecessarily add to text ambiguity.","An important feature of this module is the ability of retrieving efficiently a subset of lemmas by matching the lemmas, their Part-of-Speech, inflectional class code, syntactic and semantic markers or their Boolean combination. For instance, one can look for all the dictionary entries starting or ending with a search string. The later option illustrated in Figure 2 is particularly useful when the inflectional code of a new lemma is being established, since it depends on its ending."," Figure 2. Retrieval of all verbs ending with sxetati: they all belong to two main inflectional groups: V1 and V74.","","This module enables the user to modify or delete all the information attached to a lemma, or the lemma itself, as well as to add new entries. A new entry can be generated from scratch or by copying an existing lemma, which in some cases facilitates the work. The regular expression or FSA graph describing the inflectional properties of the selected lemma can be inspected and corrected if found inadequate.","The handling of dictionaries of compound lemmas is similar, though with some important differences. For instance, the search by the entry ending is not supported, since it does not make sense in this case. The form for new entries is more complex since more information need to be supplied. In the upper part of the form the information pertaining to the entry as a whole is displayed or typed, while in the lower part the information associated to the compound lemma constituents is entered (Figure 3). For inflected compound constituents additional information is needed: the lemma, its inflection class, as well as the list of grammatical categories of the form that appears in the compound lemma. For example, in the compound turska kafa (Engl. Turkish coffee), the lemma for the constituent form turska is turski. The form of this adjective in the compound lemma is inflected in order to agree in gender with the noun kafa. "," Figure 3. The form for compound entries"]},{"title":"3.3 Wordnet Manipulation","paragraphs":["This module supports the manipulation of wordnets. The user can work with one wordnet only, or with two wordnets, which can then be synchronized using ILI. The user can navigate through wordnets by following hypernym/hyponym relations. Synsets can be retrieved using various methods, from simple string matching to complex Xpath expressions, either predefined or specified by the user. For instance, by means of the Xpath expression “//SYNSET[DOMAIN='geology']” the user can retrieve all synsets from the working wordnet that belong to the domain of geology, or more precisely, that contain the element <DOMAIN> with the content “geology”. New synsets can be added to wordnets using predefined forms. If working simultaneously with two wordnets, the user can copy a synset form one wordnet to another thus synchronizing them automatically via the ILI. Unstructured bilingual lists may be used to suggest possible candidates for a synset. The module also performs various consistency checks on wordnets such as detecting dangling relations."]},{"title":"1694","paragraphs":["A particularly interesting feature of this tool is that it enables the exchange of information between wordnets and morphological dictionaries. Namely, morphosyntactic information from dictionaries can be attached to synset literals. The tool searches for the wordnet literal in dictionaries of simple or compound lemmas, and it retrieves from them its inflectional class code. If more lemmas of the same form exist, they are all offered to the user to choose the appropriate one. Conversely, semantic marks of synset literals can be assigned to dictionary entries (Krstev & al., 2004). For instance, the mark +Comm can be added to all communicative verbs, that is, all literals belonging to the synsets that are hyponyms of the synset <communicate:2, intercommunicate:2> can obtain this mark in the morphological dictionary. The module enables easy production of Intex/Unitex graphs that locate all literals from a chosen synset in a text, with or without synset hypernyms."]},{"title":"3.4 Working with Aligned Texts","paragraphs":["The module uses texts which have previously been aligned using Xalign as an alignment tool and converts them to TMX format, or texts that are already in that format. By choosing the appropriate XSLT stylesheet various visualizations can be obtained, in HTML or other formats.","Powerful linguistic tools such as Intex/Unitex, though inherently multilingual since resources for them have been developed for many languages, presently do not support simultaneous work with different languages. With WS4LR we have tried to, at least partially, overcome this shortcoming and enable better exploitation of aligned texts as resources of great value. This is achieved by an integration of all the resources supported by WS4LR. It may best be illustrated by concordance production using various search criteria such as simple strings, lemmas (with all their inflectional forms) or concepts (all or some literals from chosen synsets and/or their hypernyms) (Figure 4). In aligned segments retrieved, occurrences that correspond to search criteria in the source language are highlighted (Figure 5).",""," Figure 4. The form for expansion of the search criteria","","The user can also use the translation equivalence option which is aimed at locating equivalences in target language for occurrences found in the source language. This is done on the basis of data from wordnets for corresponding languages. This option can be particularly useful in further development of wordnets, since aligned segments where a translation equivalent could not be located potentially contain a concept not yet covered by the corresponding wordnet.","","","Figure 5.
