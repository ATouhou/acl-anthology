In our approach to multimodal dialogue systems providing question answering functionality (SMARTWEB), the ontological infrastructure is essential. We aim at an integrated approach in which all knowledge-aware system modules are based on interoperating ontologies in a common data model. The discourse ontology is meant to provide the necessary dialogue- and HCI concepts. We present the ontological syntactic structure of multimodal question answering results as part of this discourse ontology which extends the W3C EMMA annotation framework and uses MPEG-7 annotations. In addition, we describe an extension to ontological result structures where automatic and context-based sorting mechanisms can be naturally incorporated."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["Integrating ontologies means to allow for transformations between generated ontologies and the already existing ones as Semantic Web artefacts available at the start of a Semantic Web project. General ontologies such as SUMO (Niles and Pease, 2001) and DOLCE (Gangemi et al., 2002) exist to be used and exploited as general purpose conceptual terminologies. The use of different ontologies in a unique application assumes the presence of a upper model ontology dening base-concepts and relations to be inherited from the subordinate domain ontologies, providing suitability for fast reasoning and consistent representation. For SMARTWEB1","SUMO and DOLCE have been merged. The SMARTWEB foundational ontology (Cimiano et al., 2004) brings together the conceptual clarity of DOLCE, due to the Ontoclean(Guarino and Welty, 2004) methodology used to model it, and the accessibility of SUMO. Connecting and merging different data- and knowledge sources representing knowledge of special domains like football or chemistry is a difcult task, even if such upper level ontology models exist. Although difcult to establish, an integrated data approach is the key for functionalities such as query decomposition, ontological inference, and at least trust and transparency in the results obtained. Therefore, all knowledge-intensive sub-modules of a Semantic Web application should themselves be represented by an ontological infrastructure, e.g. RDF-based data exchange2 (Randal, 1998) which we used nally. With the help of our discourse ontology (DISCONTO) the","1","SMARTWEB (Wahlster, 2004; Reithinger et al., 2005) aims at developing a context-aware, mobile and multimodal interface to the Semantic Web. In the main scenario, the user carries a smartphone and is able to pose multimodal open-domain questions using speech, pen, and gesture among other input modalities. The user input is transmitted via UMTS or WLAN to a backend server, where the multimodal recogniser, the Semantic Web access sub-systems and the dialogue manager for result generation resist.","2","http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-primer/ pertinent concepts and relations for content-based fusion of input modalities, semantic-based interpretation of user input (query template lling) for ontology-based similarity search, and multimodal output ltering, aggregation, and generation can be modelled concurrently. What follows in section 2. is a brief introduction of the SMARTWEB ontological framework, focusing on a specic branch of the discourse ontology, the concepts for representing multimedia results syntactically, with content-based semantic annotations. In the question answering (QA) scenario as metaphorical basis of the user-system interaction, the presentation of multimodal results is very important, which is reected in the detailed ontologicial description for this data types. Nonetheless the integration of dialogue- and QA-based concepts into the upper model ontology is a difcult task, since the conceptual clarity of the upper model must not become blurred. In addition, specic domain- and task-oriented ontologies like ontologies for dialogue and discourse processing must not present a narrow-sighted view on the relevant concepts and relations. In the remainder of this text, we present our approach to in-tegrate question answering and multimodal dialogue concepts into the ontological frame, focusing on concept for result presentation. Group (list) results and sorting criteria for QA results are presented in detail."]},{"title":"2. Ontological Framework","paragraphs":["SMARTWEB joins together multimodal and mobile user interface technology with question answering technology. The dialogue functionality of Smartweb can basically be summarised as a question answer game; the user can ask constituent interrogative questions and refer to objects previously mentioned in the dialogue. Most prominent are single instance questions of semantic classes such as persons, locations, and dates. The application we describe is a dialogue system, where the user can ask questions about a specic domain (football) as well as open domain questions. In addition, the input and output is multimodal, which on the one hand increases naturalness in query formulation, but on"]},{"title":"511","paragraphs":["the other hand restricts the usability of a textual question answering system. Example questions for single instance constituents are the following: Who was world champion in 1990? Show me the goal of Alexandersson. Show me the world cup mascot 2006. Where is Brandenburg Gate located? What is the capital of Germany? When does the next football match take place? Example questions for enumeration of constituents are the following: Show me the World Cup mascot. When was Italy world champion? Who was world champion for more than three times? And between 1970 and 1980? Which games had more than 100000 spectators? Which games took place in Stuttgart? Who scored in the nal match Germany vs. Brasil? To reach the goal to correctly answer the questions we combine different kinds of domain ontologies into an integrated and modular knowledge base. For this purpose we dened an upper model ontology based on SUMO and DOLCE and integrated each domain ontology in it. This way we could guarantee interoperability and modelling consistency between the different ontologies. A domain-ontology is the primary knowledge server for answering question. This offers great opportunity for more specic questions in a dialogical interaction, on the other hand the difculties in speech recognition, language understanding and information coverage uncover the demand for open-domain QA functionality (Neumann and Sacaleanu, 2005) obvious, which does not necessarily require complex syntactic/semantic question parsing, and may use answer redundancy as a surrogate for semantic understanding of questions (Lin, 2002). However, for particular question types, i.e. enumeration questions, ontology-based systems outperform standard open-domain QA system for the following two reasons: (1) Redundancy information 3","often does not help very much for list questions, (2) ontological representation of multimodal list result allow for deeper structuring, ltering, and sorting. We present a multimodal ontological result structure where automatic and context-based sorting mechanism can be naturally incorporated. 3","The more frequently an answer appears in a document corpus, the easier it is to nd and hence expected to be correct. Confer e.g. (Breck et al., 2001) 2.1. The Upper Model Ontology Over the DISCONTO we link concepts of the domain specic ontologies to a media representation ontology SMARTMEDIA that provides concepts for multimodal presentation. The SMARTWEB upper model ontology basically proposes the upper-level concepts of DOLCE with the distinction between endurant, perdurant, abstract and qualities, and the adoption of several concepts from SUMO adding rich taxonomies which feature specic concepts such as Hotel or Organization which we use as semantic answer types. The upper model (SmartSUMO) was modelled in three steps:","Dene relevant concepts from the DOLCE ontology (SmartDOLCE). Dene relevant concepts from the SUMO ontology.","Align SUMO concepts in the DOLCE superstructure (SmartSUMO). The SmartDOLCE ontology includes a relevant module (sub-ontology) of DOLCE called Descriptions & Situations (D&S) (Gangemi and Mika, 2003) to standardise a variety of reied contexts and states of affairs. We use this module for representing contexts for sorting criteria on group results (section 2.6.). 2.2. The Discourse Ontology The DISCONTO discourse ontology is meant to provide concepts for dialogical interaction with the user (HCI) and the interaction with the Semantic Web access sub-systems, which are based on the ontological infrastructure. We identied the following top-level constructs of the DISCONTO ontology: (1) dialogue acts, (2) dialogue memory, dialogue model, (3) lexical rules for syntactic/semantic mapping, and (4) concepts for multimodal results to be presented to the user which incorporate concepts for question answering as a sub-category. User interaction is modelled in a generic way in the discourse ontology. As opposed to other contributes like in (Peger et al., 2003) where a three layer model (linguistic, discourse and dialog layer) is used, or (Niekrasz and Purver, 2005), a semiotic approach to discourse, in our approach we concentrate on discourse interactions within a question answering scenario. The DISCONTO (Smartweb Discourse Ontology) divides dialogue acts in Queries and Results concepts. Specic discourse phenomena like ellipsis or anaphora are resolved in a dedicated multimodal fusion and discourse processing module (Peger, 2005). 2.2.1. Concepts for Multimedia Results The discourse ontology branch describing the multimodal interaction is based on the W3C EMMA standard4",". EMMA was primarily designed to code interpretations of multimodal input devices such as the output of a speech recogniser. We extended the EMMA language to meet the requirements of representing special multimodal answer 4 http://www.w3.org/TR/emma/"]},{"title":"512","paragraphs":["Figure 1: Graphical representation of the swemma:Result class as EMMA extension. GroupResult groups several results in a linked list structure. IncrementalResult provides an incremental result structure, according to different time constraints during the Semantic Web lookup. types in the context of the ontological infrastructure. What we present here, is the ontological representation of multimodal result objects which serve as the answers obtained from the Semantic Web information retrieval step. We provide a new namespace swemma for our extensions to the emma:container and emma:interpretation classes. One of these extensions is the swemma:Result class, extended by disconto:GroupResult, and disconto:IncrementalResult. Figure 1 shows the ontological structure. 5","We focus on the answerTypes slot of the Result base class. Answer types are multimodal, hierarchical dialogue concepts of the results to be presented to the user. To ensure full coverage of all forms of multiple answers, and to be able to factor in deviations and special requirements, a typology is being developed. More general answer types should be overwritten by more specic ones, if possible. (See e.g. (Eduard Hovy and Ravichandran, 2001) for similar approaches for a uni-modal textual context. This taxonomy consists of mainly semantic answer types6",". The result structure as a whole combines semantic answer types with a syntactic result structure by the GroupResult concept. We exemplify the modelling of results by discussing an actual result instance. 2.3. An MPEG-7 Ontology We represent output results with a MPEG-7-based media annotation ontology named SMARTMEDIA. MPEG-77","is conceived for describing multimedia content 5 The inherited classes of swemma:Result have the disconto","namespace, because this guaranties access to list concepts of the","upper level ontology, due to technical reasons. 6 Semantic answer types are semantic named entity classes","such as Location and Person in the multimodal context, e.g. music","in a disco location or portraits of persons. They can be both open","classes (e.g. Person) or closed classes (e.g. Nationality). 7 http://www.chiariglione.org/mpeg/standards/mpeg-7/mpeg-data. Primarily the concepts mpeg7:MediaFormat for le format and the coding parameters, mpeg7:MediaProle for coding schemes like resolution, compression, and mpeg7:SegmentDecomposition for decompositions of the audio, visual, textual segments in space, time, and frequency are imported into SMARTMEDIA following the approach in (Hunter, 2001) restricting the number of the modelled concepts to those that t well to the project. Concept instances (ContentAnswer) of the SMARTMEDIA ontology are linked to the result instances by the discourse:answerTypes slot in the representation of results as shown in gure 2. The important thing to notice is that all answer types refer to media types as multimodal SMARTMEDIA concepts imported into our upper layer ontology with namespaces smartmedia and mpeg7. In this way we bridge the discourse ontology with the extended SUMO ontology to arrive at a common data model. 2.4. SmartWeb Integrated Ontology (SWINTO) The concepts of the DISCONTO have been aligned to the SMARTWEB integrated ontology (SWINTO). The EMMA derived concepts inherit from smartsumo:Software. Dialog acts have been mapped as intentional processes to smartsumo:Communication. The discourse:Query concept relates to the domain specic concepts over a discourse:content relation dening a partially instantiated instance used as search pattern for the semantic knowledge base (ontobroker)(Decker et al., 1999), and the discourse:focus relation expresses which part of the content represents the knowledge base instance or atomic value the user asks for.

This concept directly relates to the top level concept smartdolce:entity and to the higher concept in the smartmedia taxonomy smartmedia:ContentOrSegment. Over this concept a medium instance (e.g. video, picture, text) is associated with domain specic concepts.","2.5. Dening and Declaring Sort Criteria for Group Results In order to properly sort results for presentation purpose, we realised a context sensitive mechanism for determining parameters of an arbitrary sorting function. We observe by inspecting different list results, that correct sorting of results for presentations heavily depends on user expectations, similar to answer types. Those expectation can be partly deduced from context information. For example, if a user asks for nearby cities where a football match takes place, he expects the cities to be ordered with respect to the distance from the place he is situated. We adopted the approach of ontological patterns for modelling schematic knowledge of the pragmatics of spatial navigation. as described in (Loos and Porzel, 2005). In our approach we use ontological pattern to generate a description for an ordering function in a situative context. The description of SortResults would sequences a SortGroupResults use roles - such as discourse:SortCriterion played by smartsumo:City and a parameter such as smartsumo:Nation, which follow the constraints in D&S, for which roles are played by endurants, parameterized by regions. 2.6. Declaring a Sort Function We presented a multimodal ontological result structure where automatic and context-based sorting mechanism can be naturally incorporated. In this section we focus on the sorting aspect. Expressive power of logic-based ontology languages can be measures using a so-called bisimulation (Blackburn et al., 2001). The expressive power of the RDF-based ontological representation is quite low, on the other hand allows for decidable and fast inferences in the knowledge base (ONTOBROKER)(Decker et al., 1999) as well as for similar representations among different components, such as a dialogue system and the backend server (Reithinger et al., 2005)(Reithinger and Sonntag, 2005). On interest-ing research question is how to boost expressiveness of ontological languages by adding additional operators and relations in addition to subsumptions. Unfortunately, description languages do not offer the necessary expressiveness for arbitrary (semantic) sorting criteria we would like to use. Driven by pragmatic issues, and algorithmic concerns, we do not attempt to extend the expressive power of the ontology for Group Results. Instead, we use the JENA-Java framework (McBride, 2001) to implement arbitrary sorting functions on instance lists. Since the JENA-Java framework uses the same terminological box (T-Box) and assertion box (A-Box) as the reasoning mechanism of the ontology, a type-save but rather independent bridge to object-oriented programming can be established. The sorting functions can thus be implemented in an arbitrary fashion, and can be executed on deeper structured ontological group result instances. Hence al relevant phenomena and contextual factors that have to be taken into account for sorting QA results for presentation can be taken into account without the need for a direct representation within the ontological framework."]},{"title":"3. Conclusion","paragraphs":["In project SMARTWEB, the ontology serves as a basis for dening the semantics and the content of information exchanged between various system modules so that modules only receive messages whose content is congruent to the terminological and structural distinctions of the ontology. This serves as communication interfaces between NLP components. The natural extension is an ontological framework towards QA result design. Our multimodal result structure extends the W3C EMMA annotation framework (for syntactic) and uses MPEG7 an-notations (for semantic) ontological QA result representations. We made the domain assumptions more explicit and operational by linking the Sorting Criteria ontology concepts towards a JENA-Java framework to write and execute arbitrary (semantic) sorting functions."]},{"title":"4.
