Introduction 2.","paragraphs":["1 Ramón y Cajal Program of the Spanish Ministerio de Educación y Ciencia. 2 Supported by the Spanish Ministerio de Educación y Ciencia and Fondo Social Europeo, PTA-CTE/1370/2003 3 Juan de la Cierva Program of the Spanish Ministerio de Educación y Ciencia. 4 AAILE stands for Automatic Acquisition of Lexical Information, the project funded by the Spanish Ministerio de Educación y Ciencia (HUM2004-05111-C02-01/FILO) that has partially supported the development of the work presented here.","The encoding of lexical units for a computational grammar is a complex task. It is difficult for humans because it demands to be both exhaustive and consistent. With large corpora available for lexicographers to look into real data, one could think that the exhaustiveness problem, at least, was solved. Different tools and platforms, mainly based on concordances, have been offered to lexicon developers to inspect, sum up and select data. But, no human can easily cope with the direct examination of, for instance, the 2,988 occurrences that an adjective like clinical has in the 3.7 million word corpus on medicine.","We present here a set of new tools, the AAILE platform, devised specifically for lexicographers working on the encoding of computational lexica. These tools allow, on the one hand, the easy inspection and visualization of the syntactic information contained in concordances, and, on the other hand, the computation of specific comparison and prediction functions. These functions are a further attempt to contribute to the solution of the problem of lexical coverage of deep analysis computational grammars (Marimon & Bel 2004).","The basis for AAILE tools is the mapping of the textual contexts into vector spaces such that syntactic information can be handled quantitatively. This projection is the necessary step for computing similarity measures, applying clustering techniques, and predicting the assignment of syntactic features by pattern classification techniques.","Furthermore, a vector representation also becomes a complete and compact representation for human inspection of linguistic data. To have the means to visualize actual syntactic contexts in a more compact way than the commonly used made of word and tag strings facilitates a quick verification of the lexicographer expectations.","The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the process for mapping textual concordances into ‘bag of features’ vectors. Section 3 presents how AAILE displays data. First, we supply a short overview of the compact representation, where the feature vectors are just listed offering a summary of the data. Later, the graphical view is introduced, together with an explanation of how a similarity measure based on the cosine distance between two vectors is used for plotting vectors in a 2-D space. Section 4 presents how the mapping of textual information into such a mathematical object allows for further manipulation and inference of new linguistic information. This information, clustering and confidence measures, is supplied to lexicographers to assist them in the process of encoding lexical entries. The following section briefly accounts for the intended use of AAILE platform. And, finally Section 6 supplies with the most technical details of the platform."]},{"title":"Vectors representing word occurrences","paragraphs":["Vector spaces for representing textual data were first used in Information Retrieval. Vector representation is very convenient as it allows the use of mathematical techniques, in our case measuring similarity between different instances, clustering of occurrences and Bayes based pattern classification, as we will see below.","In order to represent word occurrences as vectors, we use Regular Expressions (RE’s) that search for local syntactic information –sequences of tags– in a part of speech tagged corpus. In designing the particular RE’s, we follow linguistic criteria to identify those linguistic cues that are considered to play a role on the characterization of the syntactic properties of the grammatical category –part of speech– under consideration.","Different RE’s are used to check whether a number n of particular cues are found in each occurrence of a word in a corpus. The positive or negative results of each checking are stored as binary values of n dimension vectors. Thus, we create a ‘bag of features’ representation (Rosenfeld, 1997) for each occurrence.","Nevertheless, in order to have a complete picture of a word’s behavior, one has to see the characteristics of all its occurrences in a representative corpus (Bel, 2004) to judge whether certain context is more or less frequent,"]},{"title":"1362","paragraphs":["whether there are particular cues that are constant in more or less occurrences, etc.","AAILE’s aim is to help the lexicographer to generalize and abstract from the characteristics of particular occurrences into the characteristics of the whole set of occurrences. A word’s signature σ is the set of vectors resulting of the transformation from all its occurrences in a corpus and it represents the complete syntactic behavior of that particular word, more technically of that lemma-category pair.","Table 1 shows the signature of the adjective adjacent, the vectors resulting of applying 14 RE’s to every occurrence of this adjective in a corpus of 5 million words (Corpus Tècnic de l’IULA, Cabré et al. 2000). Each RE checks whether a particular context is displayed in the occurrence. All occurrences are inspected by the whole collection of RE’s."," #occ. lc1 lc2 lc3 lc4 lc5 lc6 lc7 lc8 lc9 lc10 lc11 lc12 lc13 lc14 124 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 34 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 23 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 12 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Table 1.

The","RE's have check for the following linguistic cues: lc1, whether the item is located before a noun; lc2, whether the item is located after a noun; lc3, if the item is located after a copulative verb; lc4 after a gradual adverb, and from lc5 to lc14, whether the item is before a particular preposition.","","For the example shown in Table 1, the RE’s have check for the following linguistic cues: lc1 whether the item is located before a noun; lc2 whether the item is located after a noun; lc3 if the item is located after a copulative verb; lc4 after a gradual adverb and lc5- lc14 whether the item is located before a particular preposition.","Additionally, the first column in Table 1 refers to the number of times that the resulting vectors turn to be the same. We will call profile to a particular vector configuration when it is the very same results of the fourteen RE’s checking for different occurrences. Hence, the first column refers to the absolute frequency of a profile in a signature.","In the example of Table 1, the most frequent profile (124) corresponds to the occurrences where the only observed cue is its being in pre-nominal position, marked in column lc1. The positive values in columns lc2 and lc3 show that in other profiles there were occurrences displaying post-nominal and predicative positions, respectively. And lc13 shows the number of times that this adjective was found immediately before the preposition to. The invariance of one of the linguistic cues across different profiles will be crucially used when computing the assignment of syntactic features to signatures. In short, we take for granted that it is very likely that the preposition to, which appears in three of the seven profiles, has to be considered a bound preposition of that adjective.","Table 2 and Table 3 show, for the same linguistic cues than in Table 1, the signatures of two other adjectives, countless and adhesive, that display different results. For instance, adhesive has been found in a predicative position, but not countless."," #occ. lc1 lc2 lc3 lc4 lc5 lc6 lc7 lc8 lc9 lc10 lc11 lc12 lc13 lc14 16 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0","Table 2.

AAILE compact format ","paragraphs":["AAILE’s goal is to assist lexicographers in the analysis of corpus data for deciding on the encoding of lexical items according to a particular linguistic classification. AAILE wants to offer an easy inspecting and compact view of the linguistic cues that the lexicographer wants to take into account for assigning such classes.","For example, adjacent should be given the class transitive because this class is the one assigned to adjectives that show the following syntactic characteristics: (i) they are to be found in pre-nominal, post-nominal and predicative positions, and (ii) they have a prepositional complement, in this particular case, headed by to. This is the information that the signature of adjacent should contain and that must show up clearly in the compact vector representation.5","","Thus, in the AAILE platform, signatures are shown in tables that display the profiles of the vectors they are made of. Each profile is informed with its absolute and relative frequency information, as shown in Figure 2.","","Figure 2: Profile information for the English adjective blind.

For easy interpreting the different components of each one, the keyword referring to the linguistic cues can be retrieved by clicking on each components value.","At the left hand side column of the profile compact representation, there is the information about similarity between different profiles. It offers a quantitative measure of the number of linguistic cues, that is components, shared by two vectors.

The x axis is for the profiles whose cosine distance to the one chosen for reference is 0. The profiles that are similar in some measure to the reference are plotted accordingly. Arrow’s length represents frequency information. In case of resulting in equal similarity measures, the profiles are plotted sequentially, but in different green colored vectors.","The user can change the profile used as point of reference. the one shown in y axis. Thus, by clicking at the Cent sign (in the compact view) of another profile, the whole is re-calculated and plotted again. In Figure 4 we show the graphical display for the signature of blind again, but with the profile showing a pre-nominal location as the point of reference for similarity calculations. A comparison of the graphic displays allows to see quickly that there is more variance in the case of the predicative position.","In Figure 2 we can see that some invariant positive components, such as the one referring to its being after a predicative component and appearing together with the preposition to, indicates a consistent pattern that should be  6 The closer to 0, the more significantly different, the closer to 1, the more similar.

Additional information in AAILE Syntactic Features assessment ","paragraphs":["AAILE incorporates a Knowledge Module (KM) that evaluates the syntactic behavior displayed in a word’s signature on the light of the possible syntactic features it can be said to hold. By syntactic features we refer to the linguistic generalizations that can be drawn over the distributional characteristics a part of speech, that is, the potential contexts where a word can appear according to its grammatical category. This distributional information is the basis for deciding on the encoding of such a word, the goal of the lexicographer who has to compare empirical evidences, the linguistic cues with the syntactic features that a given class is supposed to display.","The quantitative information supplied by AAILE is intended to help the lexicographer to assess the degree of confidence that the information brought by linguistic cues deserves. It is beyond the scope of this paper to present how the KM works in detail, but we will explain now how it proceeds in a very intuitive way.","KM module calculates, on the basis of the linguistic cues captured, to what extent the behavior displayed in the signature corresponds to the one expected if the word could be said to hold a particular syntactic feature. For instance, the system can assess that the adjective blind, that displays the behavior reported in Figure 2, can be said to be predicative with enough confidence because there were linguistic cues confirming that feature. However, for the adjective countless, following the data in Table 2, should be considered no predicative, there are no cues that support such a consideration for countless.","In Figure 5, we show the assessment of all linguistic cues for the adjective blind as currently displayed in AAILE. We see how KM returns a value for each linguistic cue and possible value yes and no. The indicator, that computes the conditional probability of the linguistic cues ones depending on the others, is also sensitive to the invariant cues in different profiles.

Using AAILE platform for lexical encoding","paragraphs":["Along the preceding sections, we have provided details on how the system has been designed to assist the lexicographer when taking decisions about what are the relevant characteristics of a word. We should see now how is the intended use of the platform.","The lexicographer using AAILE has been asked to relate lemmas belonging to a particular grammatical category and the lexical classes defined on linguistic grounds, for instance for the use by Natural Processing Tools (Lenci et al. 2000.) The lexicographer should, instead of looking at texts, receive enough analytical information to determine the class of the word under study.","A typical encoding exercise is based on the observation of the profiles that conform a signature, their frequency and the selection of profiles that correspond to a given class. Figure 7: AAILE main window. At the left-bottom corner the lexicographer is assisted with completive writing for","consistency encoding","","Figure 7 shows, at the bottom left hand corner, the encoding section of the AAILE main view. The lexicographer should use it when entering the class or classes assigned. The system asks the lexicographer to mark (in the Figure, in green color) those profiles that are related to the class selected. The system allows to create two different lexical entries out of a unique signature. This could be the case when encoding different bound prepositions, for instance.","The lexicographer enters the selected lexical class help by AAILE that shows him or her the possible classes with a completive writing facility.","In the most simple case, the encoding exercise should take just few minutes. Analytical information is mostly required when dealing with high frequency words, that present a large number of profiles, with high variation in the linguistic cues shown. Then the lexicographer might find useful to check whether there is a particular profile that shows to be a better point of reference because it creates a big distance between two groups of profiles, for instance. This could be a sign that there is more than one lexical entry in the signature.","An example of such a case is the adjective consistent, where we could identify the consistent-with reading and the be-consistent one. Figure 8 shows the main view for consistent."," Figure 8: AAILE view for consistent","","The most significant information comes from the clean cut between the three profiles with 0.5 distance, and the others going directly to 0. This is a sign that it is worth considering two different entries.","As already mentioned, invariant components across different signatures are very informative, specially for bound prepositions. We see in the example of Figure 8 that with is present in 3 profiles, while other prepositions like in or from are present only in 1. AAILE can also supply the lexicographer with a confidence measure on what are the relevant characteristics of the signature to classify the lexical entry.
