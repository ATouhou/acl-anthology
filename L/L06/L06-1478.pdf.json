Introuction","paragraphs":["Infomation extaction (IE) is the task of identifing eleant fagments of text in documents. Examples of IE tasks include identifing the speake featued in a talk announcement o finding the poteins mentioned in a biomedical jounal aticle. In ecent eas thee has been a gowing inteest in claifing the pocess of Infomation Extaction (IE) fom documents, paticulal when coupled with Machine Leaning. In a citical sue, Laelli et al. concluded that, in most papes, the desciption of the methodolog used to ealuate the IE sstem is unclea o incomplete, making it impossible to eplicate expeiments and, hence, compae esults. We claim that the same kind of citicism can be made about the desciption of the undeling epesentation of the infomation in IE sstems. As matte of fact, the epesentation is neal nee descibed in the papes.","A fist attempt to claif the IE pocess was made in the intenational PASCAL Challenge “Ealuating Machine Leaning fo Infomation Extaction” (Ieson et al. 05), whee a numbe of IE sstems wee ealuated. The challenged aimed at ealuating the machine-leaning component of the IE sstems onl. To that end, it ensued that all paticipants would use, as input to thei sstems, the same infomation (e.g. pat-of-speech, othogaph), but wee fee to use an leaning algoithm. Futhemoe, thee was anothe cucial aspect left fo the paticipants to decide about - the wa infomation was modeled and epesented so as to be used b the leaning algoithm. We claim that the epesentation of data is one of the paametes to take into account and to tune when ealuating an IE sstem. The expessieness (and complexit) of the data epesentation e often depends on the application at hand and the tpe of leaning task equied. Repesentations emploed in IE ange in complexit fom flat token-centic epesentations (Finn and Kushmeick 2004) to tee-based (Zelenko 2003) to gaphical epesentations (Suzuki 2004). Fo example, (Gisham 2003) adopts a chaacte-leel model of Chinese text; (Suzuki 2004) adopts a hieachical diected gaph model of English text integating pase and anaphoa data; (Ciaegna 2001) equies a minimalistic token-centic epesentation of text in ode to scale to lage amounts of data; man othe sstems hae diffeent application equiements.","We beliee that a fundamental step fowad in claifing the IE pocess would be to be able to pefom compaatie ealuations on the use of diffeent epesentations. Howee, this is difficult because most of the time the wa infomation is epesented is too tightl coupled with the algoithm at an implementation leel, making it impossible to a epesentation while keeping the algoithm constant.","A futhe motiation behind ou wok is to educe the complexit of designing, deeloping and testing IE sstems. Een though in ecent eas the deelopment of this kind of sstems has become simple due to aailabilit of off-the-shelf tools such as natual language pocessing tools and machine leaning tools, thee ae still no equialent off-the-shelf solutions fo seeal othe fundamental pats of a complete IE sstem. In paticula, we hae found that thee is no eadil aailable tool that focus on how to epesent language esouces taking into account often changing equiements. Besides using eadil aailable pat-of-speech tagges, pases, suppotecto machines, and so on, IE sstems would benefit fom an off-the-shelf tool fo handling the epesentation of language esouces.","The majo contibution of ou wok is in defining a methodolog and poiding a softwae infastuctue fo epesenting language esouces independentl of the algoithm, mainl fo Infomation Extaction but with application in othe fields - we ae cuentl ealuating its use fo ontolog leaning and document classification.","In this pape we pesent a methodolog fo flexible and efficient epesentation of language esouces fo machine leaning-based Infomation Extaction sstems."]},{"title":"103","paragraphs":["We also descibe the softwae famewok that implements the methodolog, which has been successfull used in the implementation of a numbe of statistical and ule induction methods descibed in the IE liteatue (Ciaegna 2001)(Finn 2004)(Yaoong 2005), as well as ou own methods.

Runestone","paragraphs":["The descibed methodolog has been full implemented in a softwae famewok called Runestone1",". Amongst the distinctie chaacteistics of Runestone ae a clea sepaation between data epesentation and leaning algoithm, complete paametization aailable to use in a declaatie wa, in paticula a use customizable epesentation model, and explicit mechanisms to adjust the memo/speed tade-off. The implementation satisfies the afoementioned equiements fo the methodolog. Thus, the tool poides the necessa means fo assessing the impact of the chosen epesentation on the esults obtained b the IE sstem, independentl of algoithm adopted. The following details the cuent implementation.","In Runestone, the epesentation model is specified b means of a RDFS ontolog. The intepetation of the ontolog is staightfowad: classes ae node tpes in the epesentation; popeties ae edge tpes in the epesentation. The epesentation itself is implemented as a memo-optimized diected gaph stuctue, as IE applications tend to equie a lot of memo. Ee node/elation in the gaph is tped b one of the RDF classes/popeties defined in the ontolog that specifies the epesentation model.","Content nodes ae uniquel identifiable b an URI that consists of a pefix that is the URI of its tpe appended b the content the stoe. Content nodes can theefoe be etieed ia thei unique identifie. Stuctue nodes hae no such identifie fo efficienc easons – the can onl be accessed ia the content nodes the elate to using gaph walks.","Runestone implements a plug-in achitectue. Plug-ins, called “Runes”, wap existing tools to poide the data to instantiate the epesentation gien the model. Cuentl we hae implemented “NLP Runes”, a set of wappes to commonl used NLP tools. 1 Aailable fo download at http://wit.shef.ac.uk/unestone","In Runestone, gaph walks ae implemented as a composition of sub-walks and canonical edge taesal opeatos. Figue 2 shows the gamma used to pase gaph walk expessions which can be declaatiel specified b the use to access the epesentation. Opeatos include set intesection (AND opeato “&”) and set union (OR opeato “|”) of output nodes, node set eplacement (REPLACE opeato “>”) and augmentation (AUGMENT opeato “>>”), and subwalk epetition (NUMBER opeato). Thee is also a eese taesal opeato (TILDE opeato “~”) which allows the use to specif diected edges that ae to be taesed in the opposite diection. The special kewod start ealuates to the set of input nodes to the walk. Fo example, let token be a token tpe and token_previous and token_next be two associated edge tpes defined in the epesentation model. The expession start >> ( >> tke__ext | >> tke_pre_vius) will etun a window of ten tokens aound a node of tpe token when it is gien as input. The kewod start ealuates to the input node, which will be augmented with the esult of ealuating the subwalk that follows. That esult will effectiel be the set union of the esult of ealuating two othe subwalks. The fist follows the token_next elation fie times, augmentation the set of intemediate nodes gatheed as it taeses the gaph; the second pefoms the exactl same opeation but taesing token_previous elation instead."]},{"title":"4.
