The project focused on identifying the state of the art of LRs in the region, assessing priority requirements through consultations with language industry and communication players, and establishing a protocol for developing and identifying a Basic Language Resource Kit (BLARK) for Arabic, and to assess first priority requirements. The BLARK is defined as the minimal set of language resources that is necessary to do any pre-competitive research and education, in addition to the development of crucial components for any future NLP industry. Following the identification of high priority resources the NEMLAR partners agreed to focus on, and produce three main resources, which are: 1) Annotated Arabic written corpus of about 500 K words, 2) Arabic speech corpus for TTS applications of 2x5 hours, and 3) Arabic broadcast news speech corpus of 40 hours Modern Standard Arabic. For each of the resources underlying linguistic models and assumptions of the corpus, technical specifications, methodologies for the collection and building of the resources, validation and verification mechanisms were put and applied for the three LRs. "]},{"title":"1. Introduction & Background","paragraphs":["Human Language Technologies (HLT) are centrally used in modern information technologies allowing humans to interact with computers in a more natural way and in their own language and facilitating the humanmachine-human communication. For business as well as for government administration and for the everyday tasks, it is important to be able to produce text efficiently, to translate, to retrieve information, both in written and spoken form. Therefore, to have a full access to the information technologies in different parts of the world it is crucial to build HLT resources in the used languages. Moreover, the availability of adequate LRs for as many languages as possible and, in particular, of multilingual LRs, is a pre-requisite for the development of a truly multilingual Information Society. By creating a network of qualified Euro-Mediterranean partners NEMLAR succeeded to specify and support the development of high priority Language Resources (LRs) for Arabic in a systematic, standards-driven, collaborative learning context Maegaard et al (2002). The project focuses on identifying the state of the art of LRs in the region, assessing priority requirements through consultations with language industry and communication players, and establishing a protocol for developing a Basic Language Resource Kit (BLARK), which constitutes a must for each and all languages, to allow for automatic processing of the language for the major forms of the region’s predominant language – the Arabic. ELRA and ELSNET have been promoting this concept for different European languages. This concept proved to be very helpful for the Arabic language with its variety of forms Krauwer et al. (2004).","NEMLAR has identified the BLARK for Arabic and it assessed first priority requirements, a review of existing resources that would match the defined requirements and priorities has taken place. These resources have been identified through a survey; the list of resources was tested for fitness for the specified purposes. The project worked out a clear roadmap to fulfill the requirements identified, and to provide and build many of the missing resources.","Language Resources (LRs) are recognised as a central component of the linguistic infrastructure, necessary for the development of Human Language Technologies (HLT), and therefore for industrial development. Other"]},{"title":"533","paragraphs":["purposes may be served by the availability of LRs such as content industry, cultural heritage safeguarding, etc.","The issue of HLT based on and/or devoted to the Arabic language is now getting prominent; the lack, on the one hand, of resources, and, on the other hand, of realworld applications, highlights the need for improving R&D in this area and for promoting the use of HLT among the potential partners.","Many applications were identified as potential candidates that need annotated corpora, among those are:","Morphological Analysis and Composition (inflection, derivation, stemming, ...etc.), PoS disambiguator/ tagger, Diacritizer, Sentence Boundary Detection (punctuation), Statistical approach in Named Entity Recognition, Word Sense Disambiguation, Term Extraction, Statistical Approach in Shallow Parsing Applications, Potentially could be used for Syntactic analysis but will be useful if the Statistical approach is used, Sentence Synthesis and Generation, and Proper Names Recognition, Speech Recognition, Broadcast News Transcription.","","Following the work carried out within the NEMLAR project it was agreed to focus on three main resources:","Written corpus: 500K words of annotated, including vowelized corpus taken from news sites, covering a variety of categories, fully packaged both the annotated and unannotated parts.","Speech corpus for TTS applications: Recordings/ segmentation/ etc. of 10 hours (2x5 hours) for speech synthesis, 5 hours of a male speaker and 5 hours of a female speaker.","Broadcast news: The data consist of about 40 hours of Arabic data (mainly Standard Arabic from a number of broadcast companies); Transcriptions followed the Transcribers conventions as used by ELDA and focused on the orthographic, named entities, speaker/turn segmentation levels, with no phonetic transcription/ segmentation.","The choice and parameters of the three corpora were motivated by the urgent needs for such resources for research and development in the Arabic HLT and the available resources within the project to accomplish the building task.","For each of the resources, the underlying linguistic models and assumptions are defined and the structure of the produced LR is dissected. Next, the production process covering all aspects especially the source text or speech acquisition, the deployed annotation tools, the work teams and workload distribution among the concerned partners was set up, coordination procedures were established to harmonize the work under consideration and to guarantee consistency, and revision processes for all details were carried out. The validation criteria, process, and results for all of the three resources are then manifested."]},{"title":"2. Annotated Arabic Written Corpus","paragraphs":["The Arabic written corpus (WC) was implemented by a joint team of The Engineering Company for the Development of Computer Systems (RDI) in Egypt, and Amman University (AU) in Jordan. Data validation was conducted by ELDA in France with the support of CST, University of Copenhagen Denmark, Utrecht University (Netherlands) and University of Balamand (UoB) in Lebanon. The raw textual data was obtained from Media International the operator of the famous web portal www.IslamOnLine.net (75%), RDI internal documents (20%), Annahar Lebanese news paper (3%), and other free sources (2%). All sources generously provided IPR clearance letters to the consortium. The Arabic NLP visual annotation tool, along with training and final packaging was provided by RDI."]},{"title":"2.1. Corpus Design","paragraphs":["The corpus design of the resource is a function of three criteria; sampling strategy, definition of the annotation types, and size.","Sampling parameters that were taken into considerations are: • Time span (mostly recent; i.e. late 1990’s till","2005) • Only Standard Arabic is considered as it is the","most commonly accepted variant throughout the","native Arabic speakers, and also due to its","regularity that can be consistently modelled by the","available tools. • Miscellaneous domains (political, scientific ...) are","represented according to their importance weights","in potential applications.","The following table represents the size of each of the categories in the selected corpora:","Domain Size % of total size General news 100,000 20.0% Dictionary entries explanation 52,000 10.4% Political news 51,000 10.2% Scientific press 50,000 10.0% Sports press 50,000 10.0% Interviews 49,000 9.8% Political debate 35,000 7.0% Arabic literature 31,000 6.2% Islamic topics 29,000 5.8% IT Business & management 20,000 4.0% Legal domain text 20,000 4.0% Text taken from Broadcast News 8,500 1.7% Phrases of common words 5,500 1.1%","Total: 500K words 100% ","In addition to the categorization of un-annotated text; these criteria led to the following types of text annotation: • Arabic lexical analysis. • Arabic Part-of-Speech (PoS) tagging. • Arabic phonetic transcription (i.e. vowelization).","These annotation types applied in this corpus were determined in light of: • The availability of reliable annotation tools. • The availability of know-how as well as the","manpower for the annotation process. • The preference of fundamental annotations to","higher level ones which fits the BLARK concept.","","The third parameter of size was mainly constrained by the budget and time allocated for this task in the project. It corresponded to about 25 man-months for the development of this language resource. With the production process described in the next sub-section, these 25 man-months limited the corpus size to 500,000 words. Given more budget in the future, the corpus can be easily expanded to much more size."]},{"title":"534 2.2. Corpus Production Process","paragraphs":["The production process goes briefly as follows; Arabic linguists run a visual Arabic annotation tool provided by RDI; called Fassieh©","where they initiate a book project and feed to it their plain text files where each file is considered a logical page. Then, an NLP engine is run automatically on the text of each page with an accuracy of around 93%.","To raise the accuracy to 99%+, trained linguists use the visual revision mode of Fassieh©","where all the possible analyses of each word are displayed in ranking order, the linguist then has to either approve the 1st","most likely analysis (in most of the cases) or might select another one from the list if it is more suitable and fits better, this happens in the about 7% of the cases."]},{"title":"2.3.

This also entails that the documentation must have a manageable size.","The three classes of information are Administrative Information, for instance contact person; owner; producer; distributor; IPR/copyright statement; etc., Technical Information, for instance read-me file; structure, naming and size of discs, directories and files; format of data and annotation files; associated tools; etc., and Content Information, which is corpus specific.","For the formal validation, the criteria address whether the corpus package as such complies with the technical specifications made in the documentation. Formal validation is made on the entire dataset.","For the content validation, the criteria address both the compliance with the documentation and the linguistic correctness of the annotations. The content checks were made manually on samples of approximately 5,000 words. The criteria were Fragmentation and Integrity of the Material (number of fragmented phrases, number of phrases containing offending material), Lexical Analysis (correctness and consistency of lexical analysis), Vowelization (rate and accuracy of vowelization), and PoS Tagging (correctness and completeness in assignment of PoS tags). 2.4.2. The validation results","The validation report recommended to the producer to make some easy improvements in the documentation.","As a result of the formal validation some technical repairs were recommended.

TTS speech corpus specifications","paragraphs":["The specification of language resources for speech synthesis has been addressed by various authors. According to these specifications language resources have been built for European languages. The aim of this resource was to come up with specifications on language resources (LR) for speech synthesis based on which LRs in a variety of languages can be produced and is intended to serve as a basis for other projects like ECESS (www.ecess.org) that aims at establishing standards for TTS. As a first attempt for Arabic and in the context of NEMLAR the LR should be suitable to build the most advanced state-of-the-art TTS systems (at least for concatenative speech synthesis).","The creation of voices for TTS systems will be based on read speech. For this issue, text corpora were specified which have to be read by two selected speakers.","The main issue in synthesizing speech is to achieve a good coverage on speech segments used in a given language. In order to achieve more or less ‘perfect’ coverage on a variety of different domains a sub corpus called ‘frequent used phrases’ was specified. Linguistic structures found in text (e.g. as found in a newspaper) differ from those found in speech. For this purpose text derived from ‘written text’ and text derived from ‘transcribed speech’ - i.e. from utterances of speech corpora converted to text – were also included. To increase the prosodic coverage of the segments with respect to their position at the beginning and the end of a sentence, a corpus on written text containing many short sentences was also included in the corpus.","The NEMLAR TTS speech corpus is composed of the following three sub-corpora:","Sub-corpus Tokens/Speaker Hours C1_T: transcribed speech 6600 1.0 C2_T: written text 16500 2.5 C3_T: constructed phrases; consists of: 10100 1.5 • C3.1_T: frequent phrases 3500 • C3.2_T: missing & rare diphones 6600","The selection of the speakers was done very carefully. Selection criteria are pleasantness of the voice and the suitability for speech synthesis based on concatenation and pitch synchronous manipulation. One male and one female native professional speaker with an age between 22 and 50 were selected. Each speaker recorded the full corpus of 5 hours.","Ideally the recordings should cover different speaking modes and the speech segments should cover all phonetic variations as well as all prosodic variations and all kinds of speaking modes.","All the recordings were made in a studio and comprise two synchronized channels with speech and laryngograph signals respectively. In addition the speech signals had to fulfill the following criteria: • 96kHz sampling rate • 24 bit precision • SNR > 40 dBA • RT60 < 0.3 s • Bandwidth: at least 40 – 20’000 Hz Furthermore, annotation is based on those rules: • All speech recordings are transliterated in","normalized text form using Arabic vowelized","scripts. • All speech transcriptions are tagged (PoS) and","annotated with specific markers (e.g. noise,","unintelligible words, etc)."]},{"title":"536","paragraphs":["• All speech recordings have to be marked prosodically.","• For the baseline voices, speech recordings are phonetically transcribed, pitch marked and checked manually.
