Taking this into account, we launched a project to automatically translate the Princeton WordNet into Japanese by a method of unsupervised word-sense disambiguation using bilingual comparable corpora. The method we propose aligns English word associations with those in Japanese and iteratively calculates a correlation matrix of Japanese translations of an English word versus its associated words. It then determines the Japanese translation for the English word in a synset by calculating scores for translation candidates according to the correlation matrix and the associated words appearing in the gloss appended to the synset. This method is not robust because a gloss only contains a few associated words. To overcome this difficulty, we extended the method so that it retrieves texts by using the gloss as a query and uses the retrieved texts as well as the gloss to calculate scores for translation candidates. A preliminary experiment using Wall Street Journal and Nihon Keizai Shimbun corpora demonstrated that the proposed method is promising for constructing a Japanese WordNet. "]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["The WordNet (Miller, 1990) has become the de facto standard lexical database. A family of WordNets has been developed for a number of European languages as well as a few Asian languages and these will be linked to form a multilingual lexical database. However, no attempts to develop a WordNet for the Japanese language have been reported. Although a few lexical databases including the EDR concept dictionary (Yokoi, 1995) are available for Japanese, their architecture is different from that of the WordNet. Taking into account the importance of linking lexical databases across languages, we launched a project to develop a Japanese WordNet.","A number of automatic methods were proposed for the EuroWordNet project (Vossen, 1998) to help to develop WordNets for new languages (Farreres, et al., 1998). However, because of the immature technologies and the limited availability of language resources, WordNets have mainly been developed manually. Current corpus-based natural language processing technologies have made a great deal of progress. Consequently, we took the approach of automatically translating the Princeton WordNet into Japanese. This paper describes the method we propose along with a preliminary experiment, which has proved that our approach is promising for constructing a Japanese WordNet."]},{"title":"2 Approach","paragraphs":["A WordNet consists of synsets, i.e., synonym sets, which define word senses, and inter-synset relations such as hypernyms, hyponyms, and others. Therefore, translating a WordNet means translating synsets. Our problem is how to determine appropriate translations for a word depending on the synsets to which it belongs. We focused on the gloss appended to each synset, which provides clues to determine the translations of the words belonging to the synset. We adopted a method of unsupervised word-sense disambiguation using bilingual comparable corpora (Kaji and Morimoto, 2002; 2005) to translate words belonging to a synset. This method, in which each sense of a first-language word is defined by a set consisting of second-language translations, can directly be applied to translation tasks. We assumed that translation candidates for a word would represent different senses.","Our method calculates the correlations between Japanese translations of an English word and its associated words by aligning English word associations with those in Japanese, where English and Japanese word associations are extracted from the corpora of both languages (See solid arrows in Fig. 1). Given an English word in a synset, it calculates the score for each of its Japanese translation candidates according to the gloss appended to the synset; the score is defined as the sum of correlations between the translation candidate and the associated words appearing in the gloss (See dotted arrows in Fig. 1).","It should be noted that the proposed method does not require parallel corpora, whose availability is limited. The method can be applied to a pair of weakly comparable corpora in English and Japanese, e.g., the Wall Street Journal and the Nihon Keizai Shimbun. In addition, it is fully unsupervised; it does not require any manual input such as sense-tagging on the training corpora. It thus has the potential for allowing a large number of English synsets to be automatically translated into Japanese.","However, the method has inherent weaknesses in that it lacks robustness because a gloss only contains a few associated words. To overcome this difficulty, we extended it so that it retrieves texts by using a gloss as a query and uses associated words contained in the retrieved texts to determine the translations for the words in the synset to which the gloss is appended (See dashed arrows in Fig. 1)."]},{"title":"3 Correlation Matrix of Translations versus Associated Words 3.1 Outline","paragraphs":["The proposed method is based on the assumption that the translations of associated words are also associated (Rapp, 1995). The alignment of word associations across languages can reveal which associated word of a target word suggests which of its translations. For example, the alignment of an English word association (tank, soldier) with its Japanese counterpart (戦車<SENSHA>, 兵士<HEISHI>) reveals that, for the target word “tank,” its associated word “soldier” suggests its translation “ 戦車<SENSHA>.” Naive word-association alignment methods, however, are not effective when using non-parallel bilingual corpora. They suffer"]},{"title":"1262 ","paragraphs":["from failed alignments due to topical-coverage disparity between the corpora of two languages as well as ambiguity in alignment. To overcome these difficulties, our method defines a correlation between a translation and an associated word by using correlations between the translation and other associated words.","The method consists of the following steps (See Fig. 1). First, word associations are extracted from the corpus of both languages by setting a threshold for mutual information between words. Second, word associations are aligned across languages with the assistance of a bilingual dictionary. Third, pairwise correlation between the Japanese translations of an English word and its associated words is calculated iteratively."]},{"title":"3.2 Extraction of word associations","paragraphs":["The mutual information, MI(x, x′), of a pair of words x and x′ is defined by"]},{"title":")()( )( )( 'xPrxPr 'x,xPr log'x,xMI ⋅ =","paragraphs":[", where Pr(x) is the occurrence probability for x, and Pr(x, x′) is the co-occurrence probability for x and x′ (Church and Hanks, 1990).

A medium-sized window is used to count co-occurrence frequencies; in the experiments described in the following sections, the window covered 12 content words on each side of the target word.","A word association is a pair of words with mutual information larger than a threshold, θ.

A number of typical polysemous words were translated by using the glosses and the translation-vs.-associated-word correlation matrices. Table 2 lists the results.","The experimental results reveal that the method is not robust; glosses are very short, and a few associated words determine the translation of a word in a synset. In addition, it suffers from the following limitations.","First, its resolution is low. For example, it can distinguish between the first sense of “bill” (politics) and the second and third senses (economy), but it fails to distinguish between the second and third senses. This is because the method relies on “topically” associated words. This problem may be overcome by combining the translation results for all the words belonging to a synset; although “bill” in the third synset {bill, note, government note, bank bill, banker’s bill, bank note, Federal Reserve note, greenback} is incorrectly translated into “請求書 <SEIKYUUSHO>,” other words belonging to the synset are not translated into “請求書<SEIKYUUSHO>.”","Second, the method often fails to translate a synset whose gloss explains the sense mainly using verbs, because word associations are limited to those between nouns. For example, “trial” in a synset {test, trial, run}, to which the gloss “the act of testing something” is appended, cannot be translated. However, it would successfully have been translated into “試 験<SHIKEN>” if the verb “test” appearing in the gloss had been regarded as being the same as the associated noun “test.”","Third, the method sometimes does erroneous translations due to discrepancies between glosses and general texts. For example, “plant” in the second synset {plant, flora, plant life} is erroneously translated into “設備<SETSUBI>” due to the associated word “power” appearing in the gloss “a living organism lacking the power of locomotion.” Note that “plant” representing the flora sense scarcely co-occurs with “power” in general texts.
