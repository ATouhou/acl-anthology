The difficulties that I encountered in the production of this treebank demonstrate some of the peculiarities of Chinese syntax. A noteworthy syntactic property is that some serial verb constructions tend to be used as if they were compound verbs.

Introduction","paragraphs":["While Chinese part-of-speech tagging (Zhang & Sheng, 1997) and word segmentation (Sun et al., 2000) have been the subject of concerted research for many years, the syntactic annotation of Chinese corpora is a comparatively new field. Although much treebanking of English has occurred, relatively little of such work has been done on Asian languages, Chinese included (cf. Han et al., 2002).","Treebanks are simply corpora in which syntactic constituent structure is made explicit by a process of corpus annotation (Leech & Garside, 1991, p. 15; Abeillé, 2003, p. xiv). My major concern here is not with software to achieve this annotation automatically (as at the time of writing, there are no effective available parsers designed for the Chinese language), but with the establishment of a parsing scheme and its manual application to written Chinese corpus data.","More specifically, the approach taken here is inspired by the skeleton parsing approach (Eyes & Leech, 1993; Garside, 1993; Black et al., 1996; Leech & Eyes, 1997). Skeleton parsing seeks to produce simplified constituent-structure annotations. I do not intend to go into a deep or logical annotation which would apply functional labels for constituents (e.g. subject, object, etc.) as traditional reference grammar books do (Quirk et al., 1985). Rather, I will focus on categorial labels such as noun phrase, prepositional phrase, adverb phrase, etc. The reason why I use categorial labels rather than functional labels is that the complexity involved in tagging syntactic functions would inevitably require automation or partial automation followed by manual post-editing. However, before the process of automation can be carried out, a clearly-defined parsing scheme should be made available and be applied manually to real-life language data to assess the viability of the annotation scheme.","In this paper, I will describe how to produce a skeleton treebank by using a sample text of approximately 100,000 word tokens (amounting to about 2,500 Chinese sentences). A clearly-defined parsing scheme will be given, which comprises 17 constituent labels and 11 textual markers, followed by a set of parsing guidelines. Some syntactic properties of the Chinese language found in the sample skeleton treebank will also be discussed. Finally, the sample skeleton treebank will be evaluated against some quality-control criteria."]},{"title":"2. PFR Sample Skeleton Treebank: Text Selection","paragraphs":["The Chinese language data used in this paper is taken from the PFR (Peita-Fujitsu-Renmin Ribao) People’s Daily POS Tagged Chinese Corpus (abbreviated to PFR Chinese Corpus hereafter) Release 1.0 (http://www.ling.lancs.ac.uk/corplang/pdcorpus/pdcorpus. htm). From the PFR Chinese Corpus, a sample text of some 100,000 word tokens, yielding approximately 2,500 sentences, was chosen for the production of my treebank."]},{"title":"3. Parsing Schemes","paragraphs":["As Sampson (1995, p. 2ff) puts it, the process of parsing refers to the ability to extract from a linear sequence of words the underlying hierarchical grammatical structure, and thus a parsing scheme ‘is a set of categories and notational conventions allowing the grammatical properties of a text to be made explicit’. In other words, it is a guideline document which helps the human analyst parse sentences (Leech & Garside, 1991, p. 15-16). A clearly defined parsing scheme is essential for the production of a satisfactorily parsed text."]},{"title":"3.1. UCREL Skeleton Parsing Annotation Scheme","paragraphs":["As most of the existing treebanks are primarily based upon English texts, it does not come as a surprise that the annotation schemes used on those treebanks chiefly reflect the syntactic categories which are directly relevant to English grammar. A case in point is the UCREL skeleton parsing scheme, as illustrated in Table 1.1","","","","  1 The table was adapted from UCREL (University Centre for Computer Corpus Research on Language)’s website http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/computing/research/ucrel/skeletont ags.html."]},{"title":"1815 UCREL Skeleton Parsing Annotation Scheme","paragraphs":["Fa Adverbial Clause Fc Comparative Clause Fn Noun Clause Fr Relative Clause G Genitive J Adjective Phrase (predicative) N Noun Phrase Nr Adverbial Noun Phrase (temporal) Nv Adverbial Noun Phrase (non-temporal)","(not in AP or SEC corpora) P Prepositional Phrase S Sentence (used eg in quoted speech,","also with + and & as co-ordinates) Tg -ing Clause Ti Infinitive Clause Tn Past Participle Clause V Verb Phrase (null) Unlabelled Constituent","Table 1: The UCREL annotation scheme"]},{"title":"3.2.

Annotation Guidelines","paragraphs":["It is advisable, as Kahrel et al. (1997, p. 241ff) note, to document explicitly all of the decisions taken in the development of an annotation scheme, as well as its application so that future users can apply the scheme in a manner consistent with that of the originators of the scheme. My documented parsing guidelines include","practical issues related to map any parses on to sentences","in the application of the parsing scheme. The following","issues will be discussed: a) Underspecification – Use of unlabelled","bracketings; b) Bracketing of multi-word constituents; c) Bracketing of single-word constituents; d) Punctuation; e) Ambiguity."]},{"title":"4.1. Underspecification – Use of Unlabelled Bracketings","paragraphs":["Brackets may be left unlabelled in cases where a particular grouped sequence of words cannot fit in to any of the existing phrase or clause categories. Examples of constituents enclosed in unlabelled brackets are given below from (a) to (e). (a) Multi-word premodifiers of noun phrases marked by","the particle de; e.g. <N>< _n _r _u> _n</N> <N><quanguo_n gezu_r de_u> renmin_n</N> ‘people from different ethnic groups throughout the country’.","Those grammatical constructions marked by the particle de are highly controversial: some scholars refer to them as relative clauses (e.g. Li & Thompson, 1989, p. 579ff; Aoun & Li, 1993; Chiu, 1993; Wu, 2000; Xue et al., 2000) or appositive clauses (Chu & Chi, 1999, p. 26), while others do not agree with either approach (e.g. Chao, 1968; Zhu, 1982, 2000; Liu, 2003). Moreover, using some catch-all label, such as ‘de constructions’, does not help either because the particle de in itself is vague in its functions: it can be a genitive marker, a marker of nominalisation and an adjectival marker. It is therefore not easy to agree upon how the de constructions are defined and instantiated in texts. Having considered that there is to date no consensus on this issue of how de constructions should be analysed, and any invented label that attempts to refer to them will act as a locus of controversy and disagreement, I decided not to set up a new label for them in my parsing scheme and thus these constructions were enclosed by unlabelled brackets in the treebank. (b) Serial verb constructions which are used as if they were compound verbs (see also section 5.1.1):","e.g. < _v _v> <jianchi_v fengxing_v> ‘insist on following’;","e.g. < _v _v> <zhihui_v yanzou_v>","‘lead and perform’;","e.g. < _v _v> <kanwang_v weiwen_v>","‘visit and send regards to ...’. (c) Serial adjective constructions:","e.g. < _a _a> <tuanjie_a yizhi_a> ‘be united together’;","e.g. < _a _a> <yuanman_a chenggong_a> ‘perfectly successful’. (d) Idioms/set phrases which are used idiosyncratically as if they were single-word nouns or verbs (see also section 5.1.2):","e.g. < _i _w _l>","<dashisuoqu _i _w minxinsuoxiang_l>","‘urged by the trend, supported by general","public’;"]},{"title":"1816","paragraphs":["e.g. < _i _w _i>","<diqibangbo _i _w bolanzhuangkuo_i>","‘powerful wind, fierce waves’;","e.g. < _l _w _i>","<liuguangyicai _l _w huoshuyinhua_i>","‘filled with colourful lights, magnificent’.","Idioms or set phrases can function as predicate in a sentence. However, even if context is taken into consideration, it is not obvious whether these idiomatic expressions function as a nominal predicate or a verbal predicate, both of which are allowed in the Chinese syntax (Chao, 1968, p. 90). They were thus not enclosed in the <V> element nor <N> element in the treebank and left unlabelled instead. (e) Coordinated verbs with shared direct object:","e.g. <V>< _v _w _v _c _v>","<N> _a _n</N></V>","<V><zhuanzhong _v _w renshi_v he_c","zhangwo_v> <N>keguan_a guilü_n</N></V>","‘respect, understand and master what we learn","in our daily life’.","Two or more transitive verbs in coordination share the same direct object. The coordinated verbs (except the last one) are not constituent-like in the sense that they do not constitute a complete verb phrase structure because the following shared object does not come immediately after them. I did not therefore apply the usual practice of marking conjuncts by enclosing them in the <V&> and <V+> elements, which are only used for coordinated verbs or verb phrases with complete verb phrase structure. Since it is also not worthwhile to set up a new parsing label to mark such a non-frequent phenomenon, I decided to put these verbal segments into unlabelled brackets."]},{"title":"4.2. Bracketing of Multi-word Constituents","paragraphs":["The unlabelled bracketing facility evidently has its uses in skeleton parsing as it allows analysis to proceed where labelling decisions are not obvious or straightforward. Nevertheless, for some multi-word adverb phrases containing two adverbs (e.g. <R> _d _d</R> <R>hai_d bu_d</R> ‘not...though’;","<R> _d _d</R> <R>yongyuan_d buzai_d</R> ‘never forever’; <R> _d _d</R> <R>yizhi_d dou_d</R> ‘constantly’), and multi-word attributive adjectival phrases containing an adjective premodified by at least one adverb (e.g. <J> _d _a _u</J> <J>feichang_d zhongyao_a de_u</J> ‘very important’;","<J> _d _d _a _u</J> <J>hen_d bu_d pingfan_a de_u</J> ‘very extraordinary; <J> _m _a</J> <J>shifen_m gaoxing_a</J> ‘very happy’), though Eyes & Leech (1993, p. 53) chose to put them into unlabelled brackets, they were labelled in my treebank. The reason for this is that their internal structure is clear, having a head (adjective or adverb) being modified by another adverb."]},{"title":"4.3. Bracketing of Single-word Constituents","paragraphs":["As suggested in the EAGLES Recommendations for the Syntactic Annotation of Corpora, Version of 11th March 1996 (Leech et al., 1996), it is considered preferable to bracket single-word constituents where they show their phrasal status by the possibility of adding modifiers or replacing them by a multi-word phrase, or where they are in coordination with other multi-word constituents."]},{"title":"4.4. Punctuation","paragraphs":["Generally speaking, I included punctuation within the bracketing. As for phrase/sentence-initial and phrase/sentence-final punctuations, I enclosed them within the parsing bracketing. As regards medial punctuation marks, typically commas, I attached them to the highest available node in the parse tree, thus these punctuation marks can be used as delimiters of major constituents."]},{"title":"4.5. Ambiguity","paragraphs":["Linguistic forms are often ambiguous. My annotation scheme, however, did not contain any notation for representing ambiguity explicitly with which the human analyst selects one possible sense for a form and represents it. I decided not to explicitly mark an ambiguous form because even if a given item has more than one reading, the human analyst will not recognise this in the course of parsing and just annotate the item with the interpretation that seems initially most plausible. In fact, similar problems were encountered in the production of the Penn Chinese Treebank and the annotators of the treebank did not annotate ambiguities either (Xue et al., 2000:, p. 73-178). They believed that in each case one of these ambiguous readings was unlikely and thus they annotated assuming the more plausible reading. In this regard, my treebank may appear unsatisfactory in connection with research on different kinds of ambiguity."]},{"title":"5. The Process of Skeleton Parsing","paragraphs":["The basic idea of skeleton parsing, as Garside &","McEnery (1993, p. 19) demonstrate, is that the treebanker","marks only those syntactic structures which seem","‘intuitively obvious’, rather than keeping track of a","particular reference grammar. In the course of skeleton","parsing, I inserted a nested set of brackets around a","sequence of word tokens which appeared to be intuitively","correct to group as a single unit. I then assigned to each of","these units (i.e. sentence constituents) a label from the set","of categories specified in my parsing scheme. An excerpt","of the PFR skeleton-parsed treebank is given in Figure 1.               Figure 1: An excerpt of the PFR skeleton-parsed","sample treebank                 "]},{"title":"1817 5.1. Difficulties in Skeleton Parsing Chinese text","paragraphs":["It is noteworthy here to discuss the major difficulties that I encountered in the course of skeleton parsing a sample text taken from my corpus, as this illuminates some of the peculiarities of the Chinese language. 5.1.1. Serial Verb Constructions","Serial verb constructions in Chinese increase the complexity of parsing. There is an immense literature on Chinese serial verb constructions (see, for instance, Li & Thompson, 1989, p. 594ff; Lin & Soo, 1994; Liu, 1996). Generally speaking, a serial verb construction refers to a succession of two or more actions that share the same subject, as illustrated in the following concocted example. (1) <N> </N> <V> <N> </N></V>","<V> <N> </N></V>","<N>wo</N> <V>qu <N>pengyou jia</N></V>","I go.to friend home","<V>chi <N>wanfan</N></V>","eat dinner","‘I went to my friend’s house to have dinner.’ ","However, some of the serial verb constructions in my treebank do not conform to this general pattern of two successive verbs, each of which has a different direct object. Unlike ordinary serial verbs, the serial verbs, as shown in (2) and (3), do not take a direct object separately. They are more like compound verbs than serial verbs, though it is not clear that they can be fully assimilated to the former category. Evidence in support of this analysis comes from the fact that these verbs (i.e. _v _v zhihui yanzou ‘lead and perform’ as in","(2), and _v _v jianchi fengxing ‘insist and follow’ as in (3)), functioning as if they were a single unit, take the same object, i.e. the following noun phrase.  (2) <V>< _v _v> _u <N> _m _q","_j _n</N></V>","<V><zhihui_v yanzou_v> le_u <N>yi_m pi_q","lead perform PERF one CL","zhongwai_j mingqu_n</N></V>","Chinese.and.Western popular.songs","‘led and performed a variety of Chinese and western","popular songs’","","(3) < _v _v> <N> _l _u _n _n _n</N> <jianchi_v fengxing_v> <N>dulizizhu_l de_u insist.on follow independent DE heping_n waijiao_n zhengce_n</N> peace diplomatic policy ‘insist on adopting an independent diplomatic policy in maintaining peace’ ","Besides sharing the same direct object, another clue that tends to prove that the two verbs are actually used as a compound verb is the suffixation of the morpheme - le, as highlighted in (2). The verbal -le has generally been taken as an aspect marker, indicating completion (Norman, 1988, p. 163; Xiao, 2002), and it is attached to verbs and not to the objects of verbs (Chao, 1968, p. 247), excluding the possibility that the first verb takes the second verb (and the following noun phrase) as its object. Further research on clarifying their subcategorisation (whether they are serial or compound verbs) ought to be done in order to give a more precise parse.","5.1.2. Idioms and Set Phrases The use of idioms (tagged ‘i’) or set phrases (tagged","‘l’) as if they were nouns and verbs is also problematic.","Noun-like idioms and set phrases are illustrated in","example (4) and verb-like set phrases in example (5). To","my knowledge, the grammatical categories of this kind of","idiomatic expressions have not been documented so far.","","(4) <N> _t _u _ns</N> < _l _w _i> <N>jinwan_t de_u Changanjie_ns</N> tonight DE Changan.Street <liuguangyicai _l _w filled.with.colourful.lights huoshuyinhua_i> bright.red.trees.with.silver.flowers ‘Tonight the Changan Street was filled with colourful lights and really looked magnificent.’","","(5) <N> _n</N> < _l> <N>guominjingji_n</N> <wenzhongqiujin_l> national.economy steadily.progress ‘The national economy is progressing steadily.’ ","That they can be used rather idiosyncratically as a noun or a verb makes it almost impossible for even a human analyst to determine the phrasal category of a given idiomatic expression: whether it is a noun phrase or a verb phrase. As in the above two examples, it is unclear whether the idiom/set phrase placed after the subject noun phrase is intended to function as a nominal expression or a verbal one. Unlike English, in which the subject must be followed by a verbal predicate, a Chinese predicate can be a verbal predicate, an adjectival predicate or a nominal predicate (Chao, 1968, p. 90). In the absence of further evidence of the categorial status of such segments, those idioms and set phrases occurring in the predicate position were left unlabelled in my treebank."]},{"title":"6. Quality Control","paragraphs":["In evaluating the success of an annotation project, Eyes & Leech (1993, p. 37-42) provide six essential criteria that can be used for evaluating my skeleton parsing scheme. (a) Consensual categories: The linguistic categories that were employed in my parsing scheme represent grammatical features largely agreed upon by linguists, rather than features which are theory-specific or deeply controversial. (b) Overall coverage: My sample treebank represents a reasonable length of text (comprising about 100,000 word tokens or 2,500 sentences) to be manually parsed and could be re-used in future research. (c) Productivity: Productivity (i.e. the number of word tokens parsed within a reasonable length of time) was satisfactory with the simplified syntactic analysis provided by skeleton parsing."]},{"title":"1818","paragraphs":["(d) Accuracy: The output of the parsed sentences was cross-checked by several posteditors with a background in linguistics. While one can never guarantee 100% accuracy, I believe the sample treebank to be highly accurate. (e) Uniformity of analysis: To demonstrate consistency of","analysis, a concordance of the verb yao ‘need’ was drawn from my skeleton treebank. This verb always takes a verbal object, i.e. a verb functioning as the direct object of another verb, which is represented as Vo in my parsing scheme and is distinct from V, which stands for an independent verb phrase. There are 252 instances of the verb yao in my treebank. In each case, it is followed by a verbal object consistently marked as Vo not V, as highlighted in Figure 2.                 ","Figure 2: A concordance of the verb yao"," (f) Linguistic validity: One of the possible uses of the skeleton parsing on a sample text of the PFR Chinese Corpus is that it could be used to gain a better understanding of how to precisely locate adverbial clauses in a piece of POS tagged text; in written Chinese, adverbial clauses are typically overtly marked by subordinating conjunctions (or subordinators) of various sorts."]},{"title":"7. Concluding Remarks","paragraphs":["In my skeleton treebank, functional labels were put aside in order to give a consistent and accurate manual parsing. However, the annotation of syntactic functions may throw up interesting results regarding the range of functions that a phrasal category can take within a sentence; a phrasal category may assume a syntactic function that is not conventionally associated with it.","It is expected that more large-scale treebanks with expanded size and coverage will be built in the near future (cf. Han et al., 2002). It is also hoped that further research could look into the possibility of automating the parsing so that more data could be treebanked and used in various sorts of linguistic analyses and beyond."]},{"title":"8.
