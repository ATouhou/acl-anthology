An affective hierarchy as an extension of the WORDNET-AFFECT lexical database was developed in the rst place. The second phase was the development of a semantic similarity function, acquired automatically in an unsupervised way from a large corpus of texts, which allows us to put into relation concepts and emotional categories. The integration of the two components is a key element for several applications."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["All words can potentially convey affective meaning. Each of them, even those more apparently neutral, can evoke pleasant or painful experiences. While some words have emotional meaning with respect to the individual story, for many others the affective power is part of the collective imagination (e.g. words mum, ghost, war etc.). Therefore, it is interesting to individuate a way to measure the affective meaning of a generic term. To this aim, we studied the use of words in textual productions, and in particular their co-occurrences with the words in which the affective meaning is explicit. As claimed by Ortony et al. (Ortony et al., 1987), we have to distinguish between words directly referring to emotional states (e.g. fear, cheerful)and those having only an indirect reference that depends on the context (e.g. words that indicate possible emotional causes as monster or emotional responses as cry). We call the former direct affective words and the latter indirect affective words. The main contributions of this work consist on (i) the or-ganization of the direct affective words and synsets inside WORDNET-AFFECT, an affective lexical resource based on an extension of WORDNET, and on (ii) a selection function (named affective weight) based on a semantic similarity mechanism automatically acquired in an unsupervised way from a large corpus of texts (100 millions of words), in order to individuate the indirect affective lexicon. Applied to a concept (e.g. a WORDNET synset) and an emotional category, this function returns a value representing the semantic afnity with that emotion. In this way it is possible to assign a value to the concept with respect to each emotional category, and eventually select the emotion with the highest value. Applied to a set of concepts that are semantically similar, this function selects subsets characterized by some given affective constraints (e.g. referring to a particular emotional category or valence). As we will see, we are able to focus selectively on positive, negative, ambiguous or neutral types of emotions. For example, given difculty as input term, the system suggests as related emotions: IDENTIFICATION, NEGATIVE-CONCERN, AMBIGUOUS-EXPECTATION, APATHY. Moreover, given an input word (e.g. university) and the indication of an emotional valence (e.g. positive), the system suggests a set of related words through some positive emotional category (e.g. professor scholarship achievement) found through the emotions ENTHUSIASM, SYMPATHY, DEVOTION, ENCOURAGEMENT. These ne-grained kinds of affective lexicon selection can open up new possibilities in many applications that exploit verbal communication of emotions."]},{"title":"2. WORDNET-AFFECT and the Emotional Categories","paragraphs":["WORDNET-AFFECT is an extension of WordNet database (Fellbaum, 1998), including a subset of synsets suitable to represent affective concepts. Similarly to our method for domain labels (Magnini and Cavaglia, 2000), we assigned to a number of WordNet synsets one or more affective labels (a-labels). In particular, the affective concepts representing emotional state are individuated by synsets marked with the a-label EMOTION. There are also other a-labels for those concepts representing moods, situations eliciting emotions, or emotional responses. WORDNET-AFFECT is freely available for research purpose at http://wndomains.itc.it. See (Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004) for a complete description of the resource.","# Synsets # Words # Senses Nouns 280 539 564","Adjectives 342 601 951 Verbs 142 294 430 Adverbs 154 203 270 Total 918 1637 2215 Table 2: Number of elements in the emotional hierarchy. Recently, we extended WORDNET-AFFECT with a set of additional a-labels (i.e. the emotional categories), hierarchically organized, in order to specialize synsets with a-label EMOTION. In a second stage, we introduced some modications, in order to distinguish synsets according to emotional valence. We dened four addictional a-labels: POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, AMBIGUOUS, NEUTRAL. The rst one corresponds to positive emotions, dened as emotional states characterized by the presence of positive edonic signals (or pleasure). It includes synsets such as joy#1 or enthusiasm#1. Similarly the NEGATIVE a-label identies negative emotions characterized by negative edonic signals (or pain), for example anger#1 or"]},{"title":"423","paragraphs":["A-Labels Valence Examples of word senses JOY positive noun joy#1, adjective elated#2, verb gladden#2, adverb gleefully#1 LOVE positive noun love#1, adjective loving#1, verb love#1, adverb fondly#1 APPREHENSION negative noun apprehension#1, adjective apprehensive#3, adverb anxiously#1 SADNESS negative noun sadness#1, adjective unhappy#1, verb sadden#1, adverb deplorably#1 SURPRISE ambiguous noun surprise#1, adjective surprised#1, verb surprise#1 APATHY neutral noun apathy#1, adjective apathetic#1, adverb apathetically#1 NEGATIVE-FEAR negative noun scare#2, adjective afraid#1, verb frighten#1, adverb horryfyingly#1 POSITIVE-FEAR positive noun frisson#1 POSITIVE-EXPECTATION positive noun anticipation#1, adjective cliff-hanging#1, verb anticipate#1 Table 1: Some of emotional categories in WORDNET-AFFECT and some corresponding word senses sadness#1. Synsets representing affective states whose valence depends on semantic context (e.g. surprise#1) were marked with the tag AMBIGUOUS.

An other important property for affective lexicon concern-ing mainly adjectival interpretation is the stative/causative dimension (Goy, 2000). An emotional adjective is said causative if it refers to some emotion that is caused by the entity represented by the modied noun (e.g. amus-ing movie). In a similar way, an emotional adjective is said stative if it refers to the emotion owned or felt by the subject denoted by the modied noun (e.g. cheerful/happy boy)."]},{"title":"3. Affective Semantic Similarity","paragraphs":["A crucial issue is to have a mechanism for evaluating the similarity among generic terms and affective lexical concepts. To this aim we estimated term similarity from a large scale corpus. In particular we implemented a variation of Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) in order to obtain a vector representation for words, texts and synsets. In LSA (Deerwester et al., 1990), term co-occurrences in the documents of the corpus are captured by means of a dimensionality reduction operated by a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on the term-by-document matrix. For the experiments reported in this paper, we run the SVD operation on the British National Corpus1",". The resulting LSA vectors can be exploited to estimate both term and document similarity. Regarding document similarity, Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) is a technique that allows us to represent a document by means of a LSA vector. In particular, we used a variation of the pseudo-document methodology described in (Berry, 1992). This variation takes into account also a tf-idf weighting schema 1","The British National Corpus is a very large (over 100 million words) corpus of modern English, both spoken and written (BNC-Consortium, 2000). (see (Gliozzo and Strapparava, 2005) for more details). Each document can be represented in the LSA space by summing up the normalized LSA vectors of all the terms contained in it. Also a synset in WORDNET (and then an emotional category) can be represent in the LSA space, performing the pseudo-document technique on all the words contained in the synset. Thus it is possible to have a vectorial representation of each emotional category in the LSA space (i.e. the emotional vectors). With an appropriate metric (e.g. cosine), we can compute a similarity measure among terms and affective categories. We dened the affective weight as the similarity value between an emotional vector and an input term vector. For example, the term sex shows high similarity with respect to the positive emotional category AMOROUS-NESS, with the negative category MISOGYNY, and with the ambiguous valence tagged category AMBIGU-OUS EXPECTATION. The noun gift is highly related to the emotional categories: LOVE (with positive valence), COMPASSION (with negative valence), SURPRISE (with ambiguous valence), and INDIFFERENCE (with neutral valence)."]},{"title":"4. Examples of Usage","paragraphs":["In the previous section, we have seen that the vectorial representation in the Latent Semantic Space allows us to represent in a uniform way emotional categories, terms, concepts and possibly full documents. The affective weight function can be used in order to select the emotional categories that can best express or evoke valenced emotional states with respect to input term. Moreover, it allows us to individuate a set of terms that are semantically similar to the input term and that share with it the same affective constraints (e.g. emotional categories with the same value of valence). For example, given the noun university as input-term, it is possible to ask the system for related terms that have a positive affective valence, possibly focussing only to some specic emotional categories (e.g. SYMPATHY). On the other hand given two terms, it is possible to check whether they are semantically related, and with respect to which emotional category. Table 4 shows a portion of affective lexicon related to university with some emotional categories grouped by valence. In addition we also implemented a procedure for the automated generation of evaluative expressions. These expressions are composed by a part referring to the evaluated"]},{"title":"424","paragraphs":["Related Emotional Term Positive Emotional Category Emotional Weight university ENTHUSIASM 0.36 professor SYMPATHY 0.56 scholarship DEVOTION 0.72 achievement ENCOURAGEMENT 0.76","Negative Emotional Category university DOWNHEARTEDNESS 0.33 professor ANTIPATHY 0.46 study ISOLATION 0.49 scholarship MELANCHOLY 0.53","Ambiguous Emotional Category university AMBIGUOUS-HOPE 0.25 career EARNESTNESS 0.59 rector REVERENCE 0.57 scholar REVERENCE 0.67","Neutral Emotional Category university WITHDRAWAL 0.12 faculty APATHY 0.13 admission WITHDRAWAL 0.31 academic DISTANCE 0.35 Table 4: Some terms related to university through some emotional categories object (i.e. target) and a part expressing the affective evaluation on it. For example, the target can be represented by a noun and the evaluation by a causative adjective (see Section 2.), generating an expression consisting of a noun phrase. The procedure gets in input a generic term and a xed value of valence and creates the corresponding LSA-vector. Then, the system selects the emotional category with the input valence and the maximum value of affective weight. Finally, depending on the type of required expression, target-term and and evaluative-term are selected and the corresponding expression is composed. For example, if we give in input the verb shoot with negative valence, the system individuates the emotional category HORROR. Then, it extracts the noun gun (similar to shoot) and the causative evaluative adjective frighteningand nally generates noun phrase frightening gun."]},{"title":"5. Possible Applications","paragraphs":["Computer Assisted Creativity. WORDNET-AFFECT and the affective-weight function can be useful for computer assisted creativity. The automated generation of evaluative expressions with a bias on some valence orientation are at the basis of various possible applications such as automatic personalized advertisement, computational humor (Stock and Strapparava, 2003) and persuasive communication.","Verbal Expressivity of Embodied Conversational Agents. Emotions expression by synthetic characters is considered now a key element for their believability. Intelligent dynamic words selection is crucial for realizing appropriate and expressive conversations.","Sentiment Analysis. The emotional weight function can be employed in text analysis as a sentiment analysis technique (e.g. text categorization according to affective relevance, opinion exploration for market analysis, etc.)"]},{"title":"6. Conclusions","paragraphs":["In this work, we continued with the activity of organiza-tion of an affective lexicon, started with the development of WORDNET-AFFECT. In particular, we considered subset of senses tagged by EMOTION label. The additional annotation allows us to distinguish emotional senses by valence and causative/stative type. Then we used Latent Semantic Analysis to represent the emotional categories in vectorial form and to realize the affective weight function, through which characterize the affective meaning of a generic term."]},{"title":"Acknowledgement","paragraphs":["This work was developed in the context of HUMAINE Net-work of Excellence."]},{"title":"7.
