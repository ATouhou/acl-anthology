A promising approach to build Web corpora is to run automated queries to search engines and download pages found in this way. This makes it possible to build corpora rapidly and economically, but we cannot control what are contained in resulting corpora. Under these circumstances, it is important to verify the general nature of Web corpora. This study, in particular, investigated effects of two essential factors on three Japanese corpora that we built: seed terms used for queries; and time interval between different corpus construction sessions, which measures the stability of query results over time. We evaluated the corpora qualitatively, in terms of domains, genres and typical lexical items. Results show these two patterns: 1) both seed selection and time interval affect the distribution of text and lexicon; 2) the effect of seed selection is much stronger. The prominent effect of seed selection suggests that a good understanding of the cause-and-effect relation between seeds and retrieved documents is an important step to gain some control over the characteristics of Web corpora, in particular, for the construction of general corpora meant to represent a language as a whole."]},{"title":"1. Introduction 1.1. Automated methods to construct Web corpora","paragraphs":["A considerable amount of work has been conducted on the use of the Web as a linguistic data source for various tasks (e.g., Kilgarriff and Grefenstette, 2003). A promising approach is to build corpora by running automated queries to search engines and post-processing the retrieved pages. This approach differs from the traditional method of corpus construction, where one needs to spend considerable time collecting the texts to include, but having good control on corpus contents. In contrast, the automated approach, despite the absence of quality control, makes it possible to construct corpora quickly and economically. This is good news for researchers in urgent need of large-scale balanced corpora for the language of their interest, but with no access to such corpora. This is the case for researchers working on the majority of the world’s languages, including Japanese. The pioneering work in the automatic construction of Web corpora has been done by the CorpusBuilder project (e.g., Ghani et al., 2003). Baroni and Bernardini (2004) introduced the BootCaT tools, a free suite of Perl scripts for the automated construction of corpora via Google queries. The BootCaT tools were used for developing general corpora by Baroni and Ueyama (2004), Ueyama and Baroni (2005) and Sharoff (2006). Despite a considerable amount of work on ways to use the Web as a linguistic data source, only few studies have evaluated Web corpora qualitatively. Fletcher (2004) found his English Web corpus to be characterized by a more interactive style, and to be more varied in comparison with the British National Corpus (henceforth BNC; Aston and Burnard, 1998). Sharoff (2006) adapted the BootCaT tools to build Web corpora including English, finding his English Web corpus to be richer in topic domains than the BNC. The findings of both studies challenge the view that Web corpora are not fit for linguistic research. In our last study (Ueyama and Baroni, 2005), we qualitatively evaluated two Japanese Web corpora built with the the BootCaT tools. On the basis of our manual classification data, we found in both corpora many documents to be produced by non-professional writers and characterized by everyday life topics and high occurrences of an informal, spontaneous, interactive style. This confirms the findings of Fletcher and Sharoff. We also found that this type of text was more dominant in our Japanese corpora than in any of Sharoff’s corpora. This difference may be due to differences in seed choice. Many of our seeds pertain to everyday life, while this is not the case of Sharoff’s seeds selected from existing traditional corpora (e.g. BNC). 1.2. Goals of the study The difference between Sharoff’s and our results leads us to the first goal of the study: investigate how different seed selection strategies affect the nature of resulting Web corpora. We conduct a qualitative investigation, analyz-ing two Japanese Web corpora that we built with seeds extracted from a basic Japanese vocabulary list and also from Sharoff’s BNC-based English word list translated into Japanese. Another essential factor that possibly affects Web corpus construction is time interval. Search engine indexing continuously changes, which is expected to strongly affect query results, and, consequently, resulting Web corpora. Our second goal is to examine the effect of time interval in attempt to tackle the issue of how “stable” the results of search engine queries are over time. For this purpose, we compare two Japanese Web corpora that we built at 10 months’ distance from each other (in July 2004 and April 2005, respectively) with the same procedure and seeds. To investigate the effects of these two factors, we analyze the distributions of domains, genres and typical lexical items in each corpus. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In section 2., we present the procedure used to build our three Japanese corpora and describe the characteristics of each corpus. In section 3., we describe our corpus clas-"]},{"title":"1965","paragraphs":["sification methods and present our results, while section 4. presents the evaluation of typical lexical items of each corpus.

Corpus construction","paragraphs":["We built the Genki 2004 and 2005 corpora with the same procedure and seeds, but at two different times: July 2004 and April 2005, respectively (also analyzed in Ueyama and Baroni, 2005). The BNC-web 2005 corpus was built in August 2005, using the same procedure but different seeds. 2.1. Automated url search For the two Genki corpora, to look for pages reasonably varied and not excessively technical, we decided to query a search engine (Google in our case) for words belonging to a basic Japanese vocabulary. Thus, we randomly picked 100 words from the word list of a Japanese Textbook, Genki (Banno et al., 1999). For the BNC-web 2005 corpus, we randomly selected 100 from Sharoff’s (2006) list of 500 seeds extracted from the BNC (available at http://corpus.leeds.ac. uk/internet/seeds-en), and translated those in Japanese. Reflecting the nature of the BNC, seeds for the BNC-web 2005 corpus vary more in topics than the ones for the two Genki corpora. All the three corpora were built with the BootCaT tools (Baroni and Bernardini, 2004). We randomly combined the 100 seeds into 100 triplets, and used each triplet for an automated query to Google via the Google APIs (http: //www.google.com/apis). The rationale for combining the words was that in this way we were more likely to find pages with connected text (that contain at least 3 un-related content words). We used the same triplets to build the two Genki corpora, while we created and used a new set of 100 triplets in for the BNC-web 2005 corpus. For each query, we retrieved maximally 10 urls from Google, and discarded duplicate urls. This gave us a total of 894 unique urls, 993, and 908 for Genki 2004, Genki 2005 and BNC-web 2005, respectively. Notice that, while for the purposes of this study we are satisfied with these sizes, the same procedure could be used to build larger corpora. To find the number of common urls, we compared the two Genki corpora and found 187 urls in common, leaving 707 and 806 urls in the Genki 2004 only and in the Genki 2005 only, respectively. With respect to the Genki 2005 url list, the overlap is of less than 20%. To see if those urls were identical in contents, we randomly picked 20 out of the 187 common urls and examined the text, finding only 13 of the 20 urls (65%) to be identical. The overlap decreases even more between Genki 2005 and BNC-web 2005: only 11 urls (1% overlap with respect to the Genki 2005 url list). 2.2. Retrieving and post-processing text The web page correponding to each url was automatically retrieved and formatted as text by removing “boilerplate” such as the HTML tags (using Perl’s HTML::TreeBuilder as text function and simple regular expressions). Since Japanese pages can be encoded in different character sets","total total average error","documents tokens size rate Genki 2004 894 3,473,451 3,885 5% Genki 2005 993 4,468,689 4,500 6% BNC-web 2005 908 5,732,080 6,313 5% Table 1: Total documents, total tokens, average size, and error rate of the Genki 2004, Genki 2005, and BNC-web 2005 corpora (e.g., shift-jis, euc-jp, utf-8), our script detects the character set of the page, using the HTML code, and converts that into utf-8. The ChaSen tool (Matsumoto at al, 2000) was used to tokenize the text. ChaSen expects input and outpu to be coded in euc-jp, while our text-processing scripts are designed for utf-8 input. We converted text back and forth between utf-8 and euc-jp with the recode tool (http://recode.progiciels-bpi.ca/). The tokenization results are shown in table 1. Comparing the two Genki corpora, we noticed that in Genki 2005 not only more and different urls but also urls with more text were retrieved, as indicated by the increased average document size. BNC-web 2005, in turn, shows an increase of the total tokens of about 27%, and an increase of average document size of about 40% with respect to Genki 2005, although the total document count decreases. Finally, we found that some pages did not contain any substantial text: e.g., the ones not decoded properly. The ratio of such pages was about 5% for all the corpora. We believe that this error rate is tolerable in the sense that the great majority of text is usable."]},{"title":"3. Corpus classification","paragraphs":["We manually classified all 894 pages of Genki 2004, and 300 randomly picked from each of Genki and BNC-web 2005, in terms of domains and genres. For the domain analysis, we adopted Sharoff’s (2006) BNC-based classification system, so that we can compare our results directly with his. We used the nine categories listed in table 2. For the genre analysis, we first went through a good amount of the Web pages to have a general idea about genre distributions, and selected 27 types (see table 3). We split each of info and essay into sub-categories depending on rhetorical types (i.e., argumentative, instructional...). We also distinguished journalistic from non-journalistic news (news and njnews), and academic from non-academic reports (acreport and report). Note the difference between info and report: the former pertains to information about a certain topic, e.g., concert information (the time and place of the event, etc.), while the latter presents contents relevant to the topic, e.g., a report about the experience of going to the concert. 3.1. Results: domains 3.1.1. Effects of time interval Since we built the two Genki corpora with the same procedure and seeds, but at different times, the comparison of this pair allows us to examine how time inverval affects domain distributions.

The percentage values are also plotted in figure 1. In both corpora, life, business and leisure are the three major domains, and in Genki 2005 there is an increase in life and leisure that both contain ” personal intrest” pages. The other domains are distributed in a similar way. Despite some differences, we conclude that the effect of time interval is not very strong, since the two corpora share a major characeristic, i.e., the dominance of “personal interest” and commercial pages. In comparison with Sharoff’s (2006) results for corpora in English, Russian, German, the total percentage of socsci and politics is only about 10% in our Genki corpora, while his corpora show higher percentages, ranging from 15% to 29% in the three languages. Another difference is that in our corpora the sum of life and leisure is higher than 50%, while in Sharoff’s corpora the value ranges from 25% (English) to 51% (Russian).

Most of our seeds are related to everyday life, whereas Sharoff’s seeds tend to reflect some of the “higher” domains attested in his corpora. 3.1.2. Effects of seed selection To investigate seed selection effects on domain distributions, we compared Genki and BNC-web 2005. Results are summarized in table 5, and the percentage values are plotted in figure 2. Genki and BNC-web 2005 show more dramatic differences than the two Genki corpora. BNC-web 2005 shows higher proportions of appsci, business, natsci, politics, and socsci, and a decrease in leisure and life. These cue two changes that are likely to be caused by the change of seeds: an increase in scientific and socio-political pages, and a decrease in “personal interest” pages. Strictly speak-ing, the comparison of these two corpora is not ideal to find seed selection effects by excluding time interval effects, since they were not built at the same time. However, considering the greater differences between these two (at a 4-month interval) than those between the two Genki corpora (at a 10-month interval), it seems to be OK to conclude that the domain distribution depends more on seed selection than on time interval. Comparing BNC-web 2005 with Sharoff’s (2006) English Web corpus is appropriate to examine differences between English and Japanese in domain distributions. The two corpora were built with more or less the same automated procedure and with the similar seeds (our seeds were picked"]},{"title":"1967","paragraphs":["Genki 2005 BNC-web 2005","# avg. # avg.","of docs size of docs size appsci 8 (2.7%) 3914 17 (5.7%) 3702 arts 14 (4.7%) 3167 15 (5%) 8469 business 53 (17.7%) 2245 75 (25%) 2465 error 18 (6%) 13396 15 (5%) 4480 leisure 68 (22.7%) 3557 36 (8.7%) 7684 life 109 (36.3%) 4611 30 (10%) 6813 natsci 1 (0.3%) 1640 21 (7%) 2957 politics 1 (0.3%) 1573 65 (21.7%) 6037 socsci 28 (9.3%) 8564 36 (12%) 7103 total 300 (100%) 4744 300 (100%) 5188 Table 5: Distribution of topic domains in the Genki 2005 and BNC-web 2005 corpora Figure 2: Percentage distribution of topic domains in the Genki 2005 and BNC-web 2005 corpora. from his seed list), although not constructed at the same time. The domain distribution is plotted for our BNC-web 2005 corpus and his English corpus (I-EN) in figure 3. We find two main differences. First, two major domains in BNC-web 2005 are business and politics, while appsci and socsci in I-EN. Second, in I-EN, most pages of socsci are legal texts, but there is almost no case of this text type in BNC-web 2005, where the majority of sosci pages be-long to other subdomains, e.g., sociology or education. For the other domains, we found no obvious difference. These results suggest that Web documents in different languages can vary in domain distirubtions. 3.2. Results: genres 3.2.1. Effects of time interval The genre distributions in the two Genki corpora are presented in table 6, and the percentage values are plotted in figure 4. In both corpora, a good portion of the distribution is occupied by the genres typical of personal prose, i.e., BBS, blog, diary, essay and personal pages. The sum of these genres is 39.9% in Genki 2004 and 49% in Genki 2005. This indicates that the web corpora are likely to in-clude a good amount of spontaneous prose composed by non-professional writers. This pattern matches with the dominance of “personal interest” pages in the results of the domain analysis of the Genki corpora. Since this text type is not available in traditional corpora, web corpora can be a very precious new linguistic resource. We also notice a Figure 3: Percentage distribution of domain types in our Japanese corpus (BNC2005) and Sharoff’s English corpus (I-EN). Figure 4: Percentage distribution of genre types in the Genki 2004 and 2005 corpora. sharp increase in the overall ratio of these genres between 2004 and 2005, suggesting the possibility that the Japanese Web is becoming richer in personal prose. Another prominent genre is commerinfo: 18.6% in 2004 and 14% of documents in 2005. The sum of all these genres is 58.5% in 2004 and 63% in 2005, which indicates the dominacne of personal and commercial genres. In contrast, the ratio of news is very low, and there is no single case of acreport (academic research reports) in either corpus. This may again be caused by our seed selection, as was probably the case for the low proportion of politics and socsci in the results of the domain analysis of the Genki corpora. The genres with almost no good chunk of prose, such as links, top and list have a relatively low ratio, which is good news. 3.2.2.

Discussion and conclusion","paragraphs":["The qualitative evaluation of our Japanese Web corpora coherently shows the following: 1) both seed selection and time interval affect the nature of the resulting Web corpus; 2) the effect of seed selection is much stronger than that of time interval. The difference between the two examined factors may be partly explained in the following way. Seed selection directly pertains to the way of sampling documents from the Web, but this is not the case for time interval. Time interval rather relates to changes in extrinsic factors of Web documents, such as indexing and ranking of Web documents by search engines, web-page updates, and so on. Such extrinsic factors largely characterize the dynamic nature of Web documents, but they impact on the overall distribution of the resulting Web corpora much less than seed selection. It may be interesting to observe chronological changes by repeatedly constructing Web corpora with a certain fixed time interval and the same procedure used to build Genki 2004 and 2005. The prominent effect of seed selection suggests that a good understanding of the cause-and-effect relation between seeds and retrieved documents is an important step to gain some control over the nature of Web corpora, particularly, for constructing general balanced corpora meant to represent a language as a whole. This boils down to a need to understand distributional properties of Web documents and then find a good method to randomly sample a set of documents that represent those properties with minimal bias toward certain domains, and seed selection is a crucial part of this process. As far as we know, this line of research has not been widely pursued yet, except for the preliminary study by Ciaramita and Baroni (2006). They propose and test an automated, quantitative, knowledge-poor method to evaluate the randomness of a Web corpus, and their results indicate that medium frequency seeds might lead to a less biased corpus than either high frequency terms or terms selected from the whole frequency range. We are interested in further testing the effect of different seed sets picked on the basis of frequencies and topic domains, to see how the properties of seed sets correlate with the distributional properties of the resulting corpus."]},{"title":"6.
