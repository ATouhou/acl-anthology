Introductions","paragraphs":["To achieve the supporting environment for the natural and smooth multilingual communication, the studies on the simultaneous machine interpreting has been conducted at several institutions (Matsubara 1997, Mima 1998). In order to develop the simultaneous interpretation system with high performance, it is important to observe how professional interpreters generate simultaneous interpretation and to make use of their techniques. Their skills are acquired by tremendous mount of training over many years (Korrnakov 2000, Osaka 2003). Since there exited no large-scale data on the English-Japanese simultaneous interpretation, the study which theorized the English-Japanese simultaneous interpretation based on the actual data is yet to be done. Therefore, it is actually indispensable for us to collect various interpreting patterns by observing thoroughly a large-scale interpretation data.","In this paper, the manual quantitative analysis of CIAIR simultaneous interpretation corpus and the collection of interpreting patterns are described. 4,578 pairs of English-Japanese aligned utterances in the corpus were used (Matsubara 2002).

The contents of speeches are economics, history, and, culture, etc. Moreover, each monologue speech is interpreted by two or four professional interpreters. The flexibility of a corpus is raised by using four interpreters. Therefore, it becomes possible to compare two or more interpretation examples in a sample of utterances. The speech was recorded for about 10 minutes per lecture.","In this research, 4,578 pairs of English-Japanese aligned utterances in the corpus were used.

For a detailed analysis of interpreters’ speech, such as extraction of temporal characteristics of interpretation, the acquisition of interpreting patterns, the detection of translation units, the database consists of relatively small units of the utterances of speakers and interpreters collected manually. Additionally, we developed a time chart for corpus analysis in order to support the practical use of the database. Figure 2 shows a sample of the time-chart. It visualizes simultaneous interpreting aspect. They have been developed as software which can be performed on the Web server, and a user can refer to the corpus easily by using a browser.

English-Japanese Simultaneous Interpretation 3.1 Issue in English-Japanese Simultaneous Interpretation","paragraphs":["Simultaneous interpretation is one of the advanced language processing activities by humans (Mizuno 2005). One important characteristic of simultaneous interpretation is that the translation begins along the way of the speaker utterance. As for English and Japanese, there is a considerable difference in sentence structure. In linguistic typology, while English has a sentence structure of subject-verb-object (SVO), Japanese has that of subject-object-verb (SOV). If an object of the English speaker's utterance has a long passage, the interpreter has to wait and begin his/her interpretation until the English speaker finishes the utterance of its object. There is also a case that the postmodification clause in an English sentence is translated as the premodification clause in the Japanese sentence. The similar cases, which are difficult to be translated into Japanese, will be the obstacle for the English-Japanese simultaneous interpretation.

Thus, we collected the interpreters’ translation techniques from the large-scale simultaneous interpretation corpus. Those techniques would enable the speech translation systems to interpret the original speech more simultaneously. The interpreting pattern collection by people is necessary for designing the system that collects those patterns automatically. "]},{"title":"4.2 Translation Techniques Examined","paragraphs":["In this research, the complex sentence and the passive construction were focused. The reason why those sentences were focused was that complex sentences are usually long and the passive constructions in the original English sentences have to be translated as the active sentences in Japanese. And this linguistic difference between English and Japanese is the obstacle for the simultaneous machine translation because it is hard for the system to determine translation units and translation timing. Therefore, we paid attention to interpreter’s technique such as when and how they translate the speaker’s utterances and how they omit unnecessary words and phrases.
