Introduction","paragraphs":["Recent surveys that have taken stock of the availability of basic language resources for the Dutch language have identified the need for a large corpus of written Dutch. Daelemans and Strik (2002) observe that, compared to other languages, Dutch is lagging behind. Therefore, the construction of a multi-purpose corpus tailored to the needs of the scientific research as well as commercial development communities was identified as a top priority in the creation of an infrastructure for R&D in Dutch HLT.","On the surface, all stakeholders agree that a large reference corpus of written Dutch would be invaluable for linguistic research and the development of profitable services that require advanced language technology. However, as soon as one starts making preparations for the collection of the text, and the definition of the minimal set of meta-data and annotation layers, it appears that different purposes may very well translate into very different requirements. A very large, balanced, richly annotated multi-purpose reference corpus is very different from the task-specific corpora that have been built in –for example- DARPA programmes and the European CLEF programme. What is more, while some of the stakeholders (e.g. linguists, application developers and system integrators) may be able to formulate requirements and desires in the terms of their own disciplines and business areas, it is not straightforward to translate these formulations into technical requirements for a reference corpus. This is one of the reasons why the Dutch-Flemish STEVIN programme initiated the Dutch Language Corpus Initiative (D-Coi) project.1","","The aim of the D-Coi project is to specify the design of a 500-million-word reference corpus of written Dutch, and to put the tools and procedures in place that are needed to actually construct such a corpus.2","It is envisaged that the reference corpus will contribute to the creation of a Dutch HLT infrastructure that is no longer in a position where it is lagging behind, but instead is at the forefront internationally. One of the tasks in the 14-month D-Coi project, therefore, is to conduct a user requirements study that should provide the basis for the eventual design of the reference corpus. The present paper outlines the user requirements analysis and the first results obtained.  1 See D’Halleweyn et al. (2006). 2 More information about the project can be found on http://lands.let.ru.nl/projects/d-coi."]},{"title":"2. User requirement study","paragraphs":["Although there are as yet no examples of the type of reference corpus that STEVIN is aiming at, it is, of course, possible to derive boundary conditions from experience with existing corpora and the major trends in the development of linguistics and language technology.3"," Thus, a modern reference corpus should not only sample texts from conventional media such as books and newspapers, but also from electronic media, such as web pages, chat boxes, e-mail, etc. It is evident that inclusion of texts from these sources will pose new problems related to IPR, and that they will require the development of novel tools for the detection and annotation of typos, non-words, and similar phenomena that are less important in well-edited texts from the conventional printed media. Another area where the design of a reference corpus of written Dutch can profit from previous experience is the impact that the British National Corpus has had on courses of English as a second and foreign language. However, it is less clear how these boundary conditions and trends translate into the specification of a reference corpus that will meet with general appreciation in several independent communities. Therefore, we decided to follow several parallel paths to complete the user requirements analysis.","First, we defined several different target populations, viz. academic and industrial research in language technology, academic linguists who are studying Dutch as their object language, system integrators and developers of applications relying on language technology, and finally prospective users of products and services that we think would profit from the application of language technology. Next, we developed a web questionnaire in order to elicit from potential users and other interested parties, opinions about several aspects relating to corpus design and annotation. The results were then used in the specification of a provisional design which will be discussed in focus groups that will be conducted shortly and which will involve the different target populations mentioned above. The focus group discussions will also be used to address any issues that remained after the information obtained through the questionnaire had been processed. The insights gained in the process will be cast into a final, detailed specification of the design of the corpus and the annotations to be associated with it.  3 The American National Corpus is probably closest to what is envisaged for the Dutch reference corpus as it also includes data from electronic media."]},{"title":"1206 3. Questionnaire 3.1. Aims and set up","paragraphs":["At the start of the D-Coi project, a website was created that should inform people about the aims of the project and the progress that was being made. For the user requirements study we decided to make use of the website by putting a questionnaire online and invite visitors to the site (interested parties and stakeholders alike) to fill in the form.4","The questionnaire was set up linearly: questions simply followed one after the other and could be answered – or skipped – independently. There was no obligation to provide an answer to all questions.","In order to promote the project and draw attention to the user requirements study, a presentation was held at the yearly CLIN conference which is attended specifically by computational linguists and language and speech technologists from the Dutch speaking language area. The follow up was done in the form of a mailing through the NTU HLT Newsletter which reaches most people in academia and industry active in the field of Dutch HLT. Several linguists in departments of Dutch, Germanic languages, business communication, and linguistics were approached separately by e-mail.","The first draft (on paper) of the questionnaire was given to two colleagues for feedback on the presentation and nature of the questions. The second, revised version (still on paper) was then used with a small number of potential users who were asked to actually fill in the questionnaire. While the latter group was explicitly told to make suggestions that would improve the questionnaire, no such feedback was given. The questionnaire was then cast into a web form and placed online."]},{"title":"3.2. Aspects targeted","paragraphs":["The questionnaire addresses several aspects that relate","to corpus design and annotation, as well to the use to","which the corpus data is going to be put. More","specifically, questions are directed at three areas:","1. who are the respondents: Dutch or Flemish; from academia or industry; active in research and/or teaching; linguists, language and/or speech technologists, etc.; acquainted with the use of corpus data or not?","2. which corpora are currently being used and for what purpose; what is missing?","3. what specific ideas/wishes are there with regard to the design and annotation of a 500-million-word reference corpus of written Dutch? More specifically, • what texts ought be included: fiction and/or non-","fiction, from what time period and what media,","which text types, genres and topics should be","represented and by what amount of text, at what","audience should texts be targeted, etc. • which parts of a text should be included: table of","contents, illustrations, captions, running titles,","notes, etc.?  4 The questionnaire (in Dutch) can be found at http://lands.let.ru.nl/projects/d-coi under ‘user requirements study. • which text units should one be able to address","(chapters, sections, paragraphs, lists, sentences,","words)? • what annotations are needed? • what metadata are required?","It is obvious that the questionnaire emphasized data much","more than tools. At the end of the questionnaire, people","could volunteer any information they wanted to share."]},{"title":"4. Results","paragraphs":["The fact that people were free to answer or skip a question explains why not in all cases an answer was obtained. In the discussion of the results below, therefore, the number of respondents for each question will be indicated separately.","The results as reported in this paper are based on the questionnaires completed by the end of February 2006. They can also be found on the project’s website. However, as the questionnaire will remain online for the duration of the D-Coi project, we intend to publish updates of the results at regular intervals.5",""]},{"title":"4.1. Respondents","paragraphs":["The questionnaire was completed by 36 respondents.","While it is impossible to know how many people can be","expected to give an informed opinion about matters","relating to corpus design and therefore also what can be","considered to be a reasonable number of respondents, we","can say that where we aimed to elicit the opinions held by","people representing various user groups in both Flanders","and the Netherlands, we were quite successful:6","","• 29 respondents were Dutch and 7 were Flemish","• 30 were from academia vs 6 from industry","• 8 respondents were professors, 16 senior researchers, 7 junior researchers and 5 other","• 18 people were involved in teaching and 34 in research","• 17 were active in the field of linguistics (incl. descriptive linguistics, sociolinguistics, and psycholinguistics), 13 in language- and/or speech technology, 2 in translation studies, while the remaining 4 are concerned with lexicography, communication studies, eHumanities and logic","• the range of topics addressed by the respondents is wide and highly varied; topics include spelling, morphology, syntax, semantics, discourse, conversation analysis, L2 acquisition, IR, document classification, machine translation, sociolinguistic variation, machine learning, authorship attribution, data mining and shallow parsing  The fact that the majority of the respondents are Dutch academics reflects the difficulty in involving industrial in medium-term activities, as well as the bigger number of persons active in the field in the Netherlands.  5 See http://lands.let.ru.nl/projects/d-coi. 6 By comparison: the survey that Bouma and Schuurman (1998) conducted investigating the availability of and need for resources for Dutch was based on information obtained from 40 people, including people from the Dutch Research Foundation, government policy makers and the Dutch Institute for Lexicology. With 32 people interviews were conducted. The group of interviewees then and the respondents of our questionnaire overlap by three people."]},{"title":"1207 4.2. Use of corpus data so far","paragraphs":["In the questionnaire a number of questions related to the use of corpus data in research and teaching. From the answers that were obtained, the following picture emerged: a relative large number (27) of respondents use corpus data in their research. Those who are involved in research and do not use corpus data, all except one intend to do so in the future. Rather different is the situation with regard teaching: eight of the 18 respondents that are involved in teaching find that corpus data are irrelevant to the subject matter they teach.","Since we wanted to know what corpora are already being used and also what their strengths and weaknesses are as experienced by users, the respondents were presented with a list (cf. Table 1) comprising most of the corpora more or less publicly available for Dutch and then asked to indicate which corpora they used in their research and/or their teaching. In case respondents used other corpora or data collections, they could list these separately.7","An overview of the Dutch corpora that respondents use in research (R) and teaching (T) is given in Table 1. Corpus R T Corpus Uit den Boogaart 7 5 38 MW Corpus INL 7 2 Parole Corpus 3 3 CLEF data collection 2 – Twente News Corpus (TwNC) 5 2 Mediargus/KNAC 1 1 CONDIV 5 – CoGen 2 – CGN 20 10 Other 18 6","Table 1: Corpora in use in research (R) and teaching (T)","As it turned out, quite many respondents said that they used private collections or data made available to them by the content owners for use within a specific project. Of course where highly specific data are required (as e.g. in the case of a study of L2 acquisition by Turkish and Moroccan learners of Dutch), this can be expected. However, as respondents indicated, the creation of private collections has often been triggered by the fact that they were not satisfied by what available corpora had to offer. 17 of the respondents who use corpora for research purposes found that the available corpora fall short when it comes to (a) the amount of data, (b) the quality of the data, and/or (c) the (quality or availability of) annotations.8","Similar findings hold with regard to the use of corpora in teaching."," Information need","In order to elicit information as to what it is that people using corpora are looking for, respondents were presented a list of possibilities (cf. Table 2). In the case of  7 These have been included under ‘other’ in Table 1. 8 ‘Quality of the data’ generally refers to the fact that the corpora often include data from a very limited number of text types. derived information, i.e. frequency and distribution information, respondents were asked to specify their information need. The majority of respondents here indicated the need for frequency information about basically everything: words (types, tokens), lemmata, compounds, multi-word expressions, word class membership, spelling errors, etc. Some also explicitly indicated the need for sub-word level information (incl. morphemes, syllables, letters but also stress). Typically, technologists brought to bear the need for n-gram information.

Design ","paragraphs":["Nature of the data","Respondents were asked to indicate whether in their opinion the corpus should comprise fiction and/or non-fiction texts. Moreover, in the latter case they should specify which of the types listed (informative, persuasive, instructive texts) should be included. Respondents could also enter non-listed alternatives. The responses are summarized in Table 3.

(max N=35)","Most respondents agree on the inclusion of non-fiction texts. Remarkable was the fact that some people (typically language and speech technologists) explicitly indicated not to see any use for including fiction. Suggestions were made to include also private texts, texts produced by L2 learners of Dutch and texts produced by bilingual writers.  Time period","In response to the question from what time period texts should be collected, the respondents appear to be divided. While the majority of respondents indicated that they prefer texts from 1980 onwards, there are also quite a number of people who would like to see texts included dating from 1950 onwards. There appears to be a tendency for technologists to prefer more recent material as opposed to linguists who, on the whole, are in favour of including texts from a wider time span.  9 N or max N indicates the number of respondents that answered the question."]},{"title":"1208 Time period Fiction Non-fiction","paragraphs":["1950 - present 8 7 1960 - present 2 2 1970 - present 0 4 1980 - present 5 7 1990 - present 10 11 other 10 4","Table 4: Time period from which to collect texts (N=35)","Note that in the case of fiction, the number of ‘other’ is accounted for by respondents (with the exception of one) who do not see the need to include fiction. In the case of non-fiction, three respondents argued the need for including diachronic data.10","One respondent explicitly suggested focussing on the same period represented in the spoken Dutch Corpus (CGN).  Media","The questionnaire explicitly addressed the question whether the corpus should include texts from both conventional and newer, electronic media. Inclusion of texts from conventional media appears beyond dispute. A vast majority of respondents (28 out of 34) were also in favour of including texts from newer media. Interestingly, here some respondents make of point of stating that it is not just any text type available though the newer media that should be included.11","Other remarks offered by the respondents suggested the inclusion of Dutch learner data, essays and other writing products of students and pupils and elicited data.  Text types","In order to elicit ideas of what text types should be incorporated, respondents were presented with a list of various text types (cf. Table 5). They were asked to indicate which of these they deemed desirable and also what they thought were minimum quantities that were required. Only 13 respondents gave a full answer addressing both aspects.12","Nine respondents failed to provide an answer, some of them stating that they found the question too difficult and had no idea whatsoever. Another 14 respondents only completed the question in so far as it related to the text types to be included; they were not able to specify any quantities. Table 5 lists the text types and the number of respondents favouring their inclusion.","As the figures in Table 5 show, there is little agreement as to what text types from the newer media should be included. There appears to be a tendency for linguists (as opposed to technologists) to be in favour of including highly informal text types such as e-mail, msn, and sms.","With regard to the minimum number of words that are required for a given text type, opinions were highly divided. Whereas technologists suggested amounts in the ranges of several up to 50 million words, linguists were thinking of 50,000-500,000 words.  10 One respondent suggested to include even older texts. 11 The issue came up again as the respondents were asked to indicate what text types should be included. See under text types. 12 Nine of these were language- and/or speech technologists, 4 were linguists.

This would allow for a fair number of full texts to be included. However, if we are looking for balance, it might well be that the inclusion of only full texts is not the best option. We therefore asked respondents which they thought was the better option: (a) always include full texts (regardless its length), or (b) in the case of shorter texts, always include the full text and in the case of longer texts select a sample (comprising e.g. the first n chapters, an x number of words). We also invited other suggestions. Unfortunately, due to a technical error no responses were logged for this question.  Audience targeted","There were two questions in the questionnaire that related to the audience targeted. Thus, respondents were asked to indicate what proportion of texts should be directed at what age groups (adults, teenagers, children). A second question asked whether texts to be included should be directed at (a) the general public, (b) peers and colleagues, (c) students and pupils, (d) clients, and (e) some other audience (to be specified).","For the first question, 28 respondents provided an answer. Five of these opt for only texts directed at adults, excluding texts directed at teenagers and children. Thirteen respondents opt for over 70% of adult texts, eight for 50-60%, and two for 33 and 25% resp. Eight respondents are in favour of excluding texts directed at teenagers, while nine do so for texts directed at children. Proportions suggested for texts directed at teenagers range between 5 and 25% (with one exception: 33%). The same holds for texts directed at children.","The second question was answered by 33 respondents. They appeared to be divided as to what readership the texts should be targeted at. While some respondents appear to be fervently in favour of including only texts directed at a general public, others are interested in texts for specific groups of readers only. Preferences cannot be generalized over either linguists or technologists as a group.",""]},{"title":"1209 Readership # times mentioned","paragraphs":["General public 20 Peers, colleagues 14 Students, pupils 14 Clients 14 Other13","1 Table 6: Targeted readership (max N=33) Genres and topics","Respondents proved very reluctant in putting forward their ideas with regard to the specific genres or topics they thought the corpus should feature. There were some suggestions to include texts from the medical, legal and science domains, and also to include professional language. On the other hand, some respondents also made it clear that they would rather not include texts containing a lot of jargon.  Text elements","We presented respondents with a list of text elements (incl. titles of chapters and (sub)sections, preface, table of contents, index(es), bibliography, illustrations, notes, captions and running titles) and asked them to indicate which of these should be included. Most of the 29 respondents who gave an answer were in favour of including the titles of chapters and sections and the preface of text. Only 14 indicated that in their opinion notes and captions should also be included. None of the other elements were deemed essential.

Conclusion","paragraphs":["The user requirement study constitutes a crucial step in the process of designing a Dutch reference corpus. The inventory of the needs and desires of linguists and members of the Dutch HLT community made by means of the web questionnaire, followed by consultation of the different user communities in focus groups should help us decide on the priorities that should be set. Through the involvement of (potential) future users in this early stage we expect to avoid oversights and shortcomings that could easily result from too narrow a view on design issues and a limited awareness of existing needs. Equally important, user involvement throughout the design stages of corpus creation contributes to generate the necessary support for such an undertaking and knowledge transfer.","As experiences with the questionnaire show, it is not easy to elicit views on the composition of a corpus yet to be designed. Apparently, for the user in general the distance between actual use of the corpus on the one hand, and its design on the other hand, is rather, if not too big. Where the designer is concerned with and distinguishes between requirements with regard to more specifically the raw data, mark-up, annotations, and metadata, much of this appears to escape the user. Yet, to conclude on a more positive note, the questionnaire has proven to be extremely helpful in identifying the issues that require further attention. We expect that discussions in focus groups can be conducted in such a fashion that conclusive arguments for or against a particular line of action will emerge."]},{"title":"8.
