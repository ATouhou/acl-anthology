The demonstration program has traditionally been an important component of the HLT conference, and the addition of EMNLP this year creates a new opportunity for interaction among researchers coming from a variety of methodological perspectives. The demonstration program allows researchers the opportunity to showcase new and innovative technology, to update the research community on ongoing projects, and to show software tools developed for corpus development or other research aids to the users they were designed to assist. Demo technologies included in the program were selected based on their potential appeal to the HLT/EMNLP audience, technical and innovative merit, and completeness as a stand-alone demo. Out of 31 demonstration proposals submitted for review, 20 were selected for inclusion at the conference, representing 32 institutions from Asia, North America, and Europe.","We would like to acknowledge Google, Inc. for their generous support of the conference and the demo session. We are also grateful to our reviewers for spending time to help us select a set of demonstrations that together compose a high-quality and informative demo program. We would also like to thank the HLT/EMNLP-2005 conference organizers for their assistance in setting up the program, and Priscilla Rasmussen for local organization.
