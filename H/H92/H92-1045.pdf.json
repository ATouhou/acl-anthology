ABSTRACT","paragraphs":["It is well-known that there are polysemous words like sentence whose \"meaning\" or \"sense\" depends on the context of use. We have recently reported on two new word-sense disambiguation systems, one trained on bilingual material (the Canadian Hansards) and the other trained on monolingual material (Roget's Thesaurus and Grolier's Encyclopedia). As this work was nearing completion, we observed a very strong discourse effect. That is, if a polysemous word such as sentence appears two or more times in a well-written discourse, it is extremely likely that they will all share the same sense. This paper describes an experiment which confirmed this hypothesis and found that the tendency to share sense in the same discourse is extremely strong (98%). This result can be used as an additional source of constraint for improving the performance of the word-sense disambiguation algorithm. In addition, it could also be used to help evaluate disambiguation algorithms that did not make use of the discourse constraint."]},{"title":"2. OUR PREVIOUS WORK ON WORD-SENSE DISAMBIGUATION 2.1. Data Deprivation","paragraphs":["Although there has been a long history of work on word-sense disambiguation, much of the work has been stymied by difficulties in acquiring appropriate testing and training materials. AI approaches have tended to focus on \"toy\" domains because of the difficulty in acquiring large lexicons. So too, statistical approaches, e.g., Kelly and Stone (1975), Black (1988), have tended to focus on a relatively small set of polysemous words because they have depended on extremely scarce hand-tagged materials for use in testing and training. We have achieved considerable progress recently by using a new source of testing and training materials and the application of Bayesian discrimination methods. Rather than depending on small amounts of hand-tagged text, we have been making use of relatively large amounts of parallel text, text such as the Canadian Hansards, which are available in multiple languages. The translation can often be used in lieu of hand-labeling. For example, consider the polysemous word sentence, which has two major senses: (1) a judicial sentence, and (2), a syntactic sentence. We can collect a number of sense (1) examples by extracting instances that are translated as peine, and we can collect a number of sense (2) examples by extracting instances that are translated as phrase. In this way, we have been able to acquire a considerable amount of testing and training material for developing and testing our disambiguation algorithms. The use of bilingual materials for discrimination decisions in machine tranlation has been discussed by Brown and others (1991), and by Dagan, Itai, and Schwall (1991). The use of bilingual materials for an essentially monolingual purpose, sense disambiguation, is similar in method, but differs in purpose."]},{"title":"2.2. Bayesian Discrimination","paragraphs":["Surprisingly good results can be achieved using Bayesian discrimination methods which have been used very successfully in many other applications, especially author identification (Mosteller and Wallace, 1964) and information retrieval (IR) (Salton, 1989, section 10.3).

In contrast, we use much larger contexts (e.g., 100 words). Although people may be able to make do with much less context, we believe the machine needs all the help it can get, and we have found that the larger context makes the task much easier. In fact, we have been able to measure information at extremely large distances (10,000 words away from the polysemous word in question), though obviously most of the useful information appears relatively near the polysemous word (e.g., within the first 100 words or so). Needless to say, our 100-word contexts are considerably larger than the smaller 5-word windows that one normally finds in the literature. 233 Author Identification:"]},{"title":"Pr(w[authorl) rI Pr(wlauthor2)","paragraphs":["w in doe Word-Sense Disambiguation:"]},{"title":"Pr(wlsensel) ~I Pr(wlsense2)","paragraphs":["w in contest This model treats the context as a bag of words and ignores a number of important linguistic factors such as word order and collocations (correlations among words in the context).

It is a non-trivial task to estimate such a large number of parameters, especially given the sparseness of the training data. The training material typically consists of approximately 12,000 words of text (100 words words of context for 60 instances of each of two senses).

We seek to determine the relevance of the larger corpus to the conditional sample in order to find the optimal trade-off between bias and measurement error. The interpolation procedure makes use of a prior expectation of how much we expect the local probabilities to differ from the global probabilities. In their author identification work Mosteller and Wallace \"expect[ed] both authors to have nearly identical rates for almost any word\" (p. 61). In fact, just as they had anticipated, we have found that only 2% of the vocabulary in the Federalist corpus has significantly different probabilities depending on the author. In contrast, we expect fairly large differences in the sense disambiguation application. Approximately 20% of the vocabulary in the Hansards has a local probability that is significantly different from its global probability. Since the prior expectation depends so much on the application, we set the prior for a particular application by estimating the fraction of the vocabulary whose local probabilities differ significantly from the global probabilities."]},{"title":"2.4.

Moreover, the assumption that differences in translation correspond to differences in word-sense has always been somewhat suspect. Recently, Yarowsky (1991) has found a way to train on the Roget's Thesaurus (Chapman, 1977) and Grolier's Encyclopedia (1991) instead of the Hansards, thus circumventing many of the objections to our use of the Hansards.

A HYPOTHESIS: ONE SENSE PER DISCOURSE","paragraphs":["As this work was nearing completion, we observed that senses tend to appear in clumps.

A panel of three judges (the authors of this paper) were given 100 sets of concordance lines. Each set showed all of the instances of one of the test words in a particular Grolier's article. The judges were asked to in-dicate if the set of concordance lines used the same sense or not. Only 6 of 300 w,-ticle-judgements were judged to contain multiple senses of one of the test words. All three judges were convinced after grading 100 articles that there was considerable validity to the hypothesis. With this promising preliminary verification, the following blind test was devised. Five subjects (the three authors and two of their colleagues) were given a questionnaire starting with a set of definitions selected from OALD (Crowie"]},{"title":"et al.,","paragraphs":["1989) and followed by a number of pairs of concordance lines, randomly selected from Grolier's Encyclopedia (1991).

The remaining 28 pairs were introduced as a control to force the judges to say that some pairs were different; they were selected from different discourses, and were checked by hand as an attempt to assure that they did not happen to use the same sense. The judges found it quite easy to decide whether the pair used the same sense or not. Table 4 shows that there was very high agreement among the judges. With the exception of judge 2, all of the judges agreed with the majority opinion in all but one or two of the 82 cases. The agreement rate was 96.8%, averaged over all judges, or 99.1%, averaged over the four best judges.","Table 4: Strong Agreement","Judge n % 1 82 100.0% 2 72 87.8% 3 81 98.7% 4 82 100.0% 5 80 97.6%","Average 96.8%","Average (without Judge 2) 99.1% As we had hoped, the experiment did, in fact, confirm the one-sense-per-discourse hypothesis.

In fact, the experiment tested a particularly difficult case, since it did not include any unambiguous words. If we assume a mixture of 60% unambiguous words and 40% polysemous words, then the probability moves from 94% to 100% x .60 + 94% x .40 98%. In other words, there is a very strong tendency (98%) for multiple uses of a word to share the same sense in well-written coherent discourse. One might ask if this result is specific to Grolier's or to good writing or some other factor. The first author looked at the usage of these same nine words in the Brown Corpus, which is believed to be a more balanced sample of general language and which is also more widely available than Grolier's and is therefore more amenable to replication. The Brown Corpus consists of 500 discourse fragments of 2000 words, each.

IMPLICATIONS There seem to be two applications for the one-sense-per-discourse observation: first it can be used as an additional source of constraint for improving the performance of the word-sense disambiguation algorithm, and","3In contrast, of the 28 control pairs, the majority opinion found that only 1 share the same sense, and 27 did not. 236 secondly, it could be used to help evaluate disambiguation algorithms that did not make use of the discourse constraint. Thus far, we have been more interested in the second use: establishing a group of examples for which we had an approximate ground truth. Rather than tag-ging each instance of a polysemous word one-by-one, we can select discourses with large numbers of the polysemous word of interest and tag all of the instances in one fell swoop. Admittedly, this procedure will introduce a small error rate since the one-sense-per-discourse tendency is not quite perfect, but thus far, the error rate has not been much of a problem. This procedure has enabled us to tag a much larger test set than we would have been able to do otherwise. Having tagged as many words as we have (all instances of 97 words in the Grolier's Encyclopedia), we are now in a position to question some widely held assumptions about the distribution of polysemy. In particular, it is commonly believed that most words are highly polysemous, but in fact, most words (both by token and by type) have only one sense, as indicated in Table 5 below.
