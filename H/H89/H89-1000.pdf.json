The workshop dealt with all aspects of the DARPA speech and natural language programs, placing special emphasis on spoken language understanding. It was the first time that representatives of all the DARPA-sponsored groups met together, and a special effort was made to cross-educate the two communities. The workshop was quite successful along a number of dimensions. Over 120 people participated. In addition to the DARPA contractors, representatives of AT&T and IBM attended, making important contributions. Much progress was reported, many new ideas were surfaced, and a great deal of cross-fertilization occurred both in and outside the sessions. It was especially encouraging to see the speech and natural language communities talking to one another. This Proceedings begins with an overview of the workshop, a copy of the agenda, summaries of the various sessions by their respective chairs, and two tutorial papers. The bulk of the Proceedings consists of many of the technical papers presented during the workshop. (Papers being published elsewhere are not included.) A brief summary of each contractor's program appears before the papers from that contractor. Many people contributed to the success of the workshop. Special recognition should go to Lynette Hirschman of Unisys, who served as General Chair, and Mary Sullivan of SAIC, who worked tirelessly to make it all run smoothly. Charles L.
