Case studies include French, Chinese, Czech and Spanish.","Existing text analysis tools for English are applied to bilingual text corpora and their output projected onto the second language via statistically derived word alignments. Simple direct annotation projection is quite noisy, however, even with optimal alignments. Thus this paper presents noise-robust tagger, bracketer and lemmatizer training procedures capable of accurate system bootstrapping from noisy and incomplete initial projections.","Performance of the induced stand-alone part-of-speech tagger applied to French achieves 96% core part-of-speech (POS) tag accuracy, and the corresponding induced noun-phrase bracketer exceeds 91% F-measure. The induced morphological analyzer achieves over 99% lemmatization accuracy on the complete French verbal system.","This achievement is particularly noteworthy in that it required absolutely no hand-annotated training data in the given language, and virtually no language-specific knowledge or resources beyond raw text. Performance also significantly exceeds that obtained by direct annotation projection."]},{"title":"Keywords","paragraphs":["multilingual, text analysis, part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase bracketing, named entity, morphology, lemmatization, parallel corpora"]},{"title":"1.

These bedrock tools are important components of the","language analysis pipelines for many applications, and their low cost extension to new languages, as described here, can serve as a broadly useful enabling resource."]},{"title":"2. BACKGROUND","paragraphs":["Previous research on the word alignment of parallel corpora has tended to focus on their use in translation model training for MT rather than on monolingual applications. One exception is bilingual parsing. Wu (1995, 1997) investigated the use of concurrent parsing of parallel corpora in a transduction inversion framework, helping to resolve attachment ambiguities in one language by the coupled parsing state in the second language. Jones and Havrilla (1998) utilized similar joint parsing techniques (twisted-pair grammars) for word reordering in target language generation.","However, with these exceptions in the field of parsing, to our knowledge no one has previously used linguistic annotation projection via aligned bilingual corpora to induce traditional stand-alone monolingual text analyzers in other languages. Thus both our proposed projection and induction methods, and their applica-tion to multilingual POS tagging, named-entity classification and morphological analysis induction, appears to be highly novel."]},{"title":"3. DATA RESOURCES","paragraphs":["The data sets used in these experiments included the English-French Canadian Hansards, the English-Chinese Hong Kong Hansards, and parallel Czech-English Reader’s Digest collection. In addition, multiple versions of the Bible were used, including the French Douay-Rheims Bible, Spanish Reina Valera Bible, and three English Bible Versions (King James, New International and Revised Standard), automatically verse-aligned in multiple pairings. All corpora were automatically word-aligned by the now publicly available EGYPT system (Al-Onaizan et al., 1999), based on IBM’s Model 3 statistical MT formalism (Brown et al., 1990). The tagging and bracketing tasks utilized approximately 2 million words in each language, with the sample sizes for morphology induction given in Table 3. All word alignments utilized strictly raw-word-based model variants for English/French/Spanish/Czech and character-based model variants for Chinese, with no use of morphological analysis or stemming, POS-tagging, bracketing or dictionary resources."]},{"title":"4. PART-OF-SPEECH TAGGER INDUCTION","paragraphs":["Part-of-speech tagging is the first of four applications covered in this paper. The goal of this work is to project POS analysis capabilities from one language to another via word-aligned parallel bilingual corpora. To do so, we use an existing POS tagger (e.g. Brill, 1995) to annotate the English side of the parallel corpus. Then, as illustrated in Figure 1 for Chinese and French, the raw tags are transferred via the word alignments, yielding an extremely noisy initial training set for the 2nd language. The third crucial step is to generalize from these noisy projected annotations in a robust way, yielding a stand-alone POS tagger for the new language that is considerably more accurate than the initial projected tags.","Additional details of this algorithm are given in Yarowsky and Ngai (2001). Due to lack of space, the following sections will serve primarily as an overview of the algorithm and its salient issues."]},{"title":"4.1 Part-of-speech Projection Issues","paragraphs":["First, because of considerable cross-language differences in finegrained tag set inventories, this work focuses on accurately assign-ing core POS categories (e.g. noun, verb, adverb, adjective, etc.), with additional distinctions in verb tense, noun number and pro-noun type as captured in the English tagset inventory. Although impoverished relative to some languages, and incapable of resolv-ing details such as grammatical gender, this Brown-corpus-based tagset granularity is sufficient for many applications. Furthermore, many finer-grained part-of-speech distinctions are resolved primarily by morphology, as handled in Section 7. Finally, if one desires to induce a finer-grained tagging capability for case, for example, one should project from a reference language such as Czech, where case is lexically marked.","Figure 3 illustrates six scenarios encountered when projecting POS tags from English to a language such as French. The first two show straightforward 1-to-1 projections, which are encountered in roughly two-thirds of English words. Phrasal (1-to-N) alignments offer greater challenges, as typically only a subset of the aligned words accept the English tag. To distinguish these cases, we initially assign position-sensitive phrasal parts-of-speech via subscripting (e.g. Les/NNS","lois/NNS","), and subsequently learn a probablistic mapping to core, non-phrasal parts of speech (e.g. P","DT","NNS",") that is used along with tag sequence and lexical prior models to re-tag these phrasal POS projections.

Part of this deficiency is due to word-alignment error; when word alignments were manually corrected, direct projection core-tag accuracy increased to 85%. Also, standard bigram taggers trained on the automatically projected data achieve only modest success at generalization (86% when reapplied to the noisy training data). More highly lexicalized learning algorithms exhibit even greater potential for overmodeling the specific projection errors of this data.","Thus our research has focused on noise-robust techniques for distilling a conservative but effective tagger from this challenging raw projection data. In particular, we modify standard n-gram modeling to separate the training of the tag sequence model","from the lexical prior models","",", and apply different confidence weighting and signal amplification techniques to both."]},{"title":"4.2.1 Lexical Prior Estimation","paragraphs":["Figure 4 illustrates the process of hierarchically smoothing the","lexical prior model","","",".

Signal amplification and noise reduction techniques yield a 71% error reduction, achieving a core tagset accuracy of 96%, closely approaching the upper-bound 97% performance of an equivalent bigram model trained directly on an 80% subset of the hand-tagged evaluation set (using 5-fold cross-validation).

NOUN PHRASE BRACKETER INDUCTION","paragraphs":["Our empirical studies show that there is a very strong tendency for noun phrases to cohere as a unit when translated between languages, even when undergoing significant internal re-ordering. This strong noun-phrase cohesion even tends to hold for relatively free word order languages such as Czech, where both native speakers and parallel corpus data indicate that nominal modifiers tend to re-main in the same contiguous chunk as the nouns they modify.

Thus sentences with the lowest 25% of model-3 alignment scores were excluded from training, as were sentences where projected bracketings overlapped and conflicted (also an indicator of alignment errors). Data with lower-confidence POS tagging were not filtered,","however, as this filtering reduces robustness when the stand-alone bracketers are applied to noisy tagger output. Additional details are provided in Yarowsky and Ngai (2001).","Current efforts to further improve the quality of the training data include use of iterative EM bootstrapping techniques. Separate projection of bracketings from aligned parallel data with a 3rd language also shows promise for providing independent supervision, which can further help distinguish consensus signal from noise."]},{"title":"5.3 BaseNP Projection Evaluation","paragraphs":["Because no bracketed evaluation data were available to us for French or Chinese, a third party fluent in these languages handbracketed a small, held-out 40-sentence evaluation set in both languages, using a set of bracketing conventions that they felt were appropriate for the languages.

Since the translingual projections are essentially unsupervised and have no data on which to mimic arbitrary conventions, it is also reasonable to evaluate the degree to which the induced bracketings are deemed acceptable and consistent with the arbitrary goldstandard (e.g. no crossing brackets). To this end, an additional pool of 3 judges were asked to further adjudicate the differences between the goldstandard and the projection output, annotating such situations as either acceptable/compatible or unacceptable/incompatible.","Overall, these translingual projection results are quite encourag-ing. For the Chinese, they are similar to Wu’s 78% precision re-sult for translingual-grammar-based NP bracketing, and especially promising given that no word segmentation (only raw characters) were used. For French, the increase from 59% to 91% F-measure for the stand-alone induced bracketer shows that the training algorithm is able to generalize successfully from the noisy raw projection data, distilling a reasonably accurate (and transferable) model of baseNP structure from this high degree of noise."]},{"title":"6.

Notably, most of its observed errors can be traced to entity classification errors from the original English tagger. In fact, when evaluated on the English translation of the French test data set, the English tagger only achieved 86% classification accuracy on this directly comparable data set.

As shown in Table 3, using the previously analyzed French Bible as a bridge for Spanish achieves performance (97.4% precision) comparable to the use of 3 parallel English Bible versions.","","   ","","  ","",""," ",""," believebelievingbelieved BELIEVE English Bridge Lemmas","  ","","   French Bridge Lemmas Spanish Inflections Spanish Roots croirecroyaientCROIRE creyeron creia creer crear  Figure 11: Use of bridges in multiple languages."]},{"title":"7.3 Morphology Induction: Observations","paragraphs":["This section includes additional detail regarding the morphology induction experiments, supplementing the previous details and analyses given in Section 7 and Table 3."," Performance induction using the French Bible as the bridge source is evaluated using the full test verb set extracted from the French Hansards. The strong performance when trained only using the Bible illustrates that even a small single text in a very different genre can provide effective transfer to modern (conversational) French. While the observed genre and topic-sensitive vocabulary differs substantially between the Bible and Hansards, the observed inventories of stem changes and suffixation actually have large overlap, as do the set of observed high-frequency irregular verbs. Thus the inventory of morphological phenomena seem to translate better across genre than do lexical choice and collocation models."," Over 60% of errors are due to gaps in the candidate rootlists. Currently the candidate rootlists are derived automatically by applying the projected POS models and selecting any word with the probability of being an uninflected verb greater than a generous threshold and also ending in a canonical verb suffix. False positives are easily tolerated (less than 5% of errors are due to spurious non-root competitors), but with missing roots the algorithms are forced either to propose previously unseen roots or align to the closest previously observed root candidate. Thus while no non-English dictionary was used in the computation of these results, it would substantially improve performance to have a dictionary-based inventory of potential roots, increasing coverage and decreasing noise from competing non-roots and spelling errors."," Performance in all languages has been significnatly hindered by low-accuracy parallel-corpus word-alignments using the original Model-3 GIZA tools. Use of Och and Ney’s re-cently released and enhanced GIZA++ word-alignment models (Och and Ney, 2000) should improve performance for all of the applications studied in this paper, as would iterative re-alignments using richer alignment features (including lemma and part-of-speech) derived from this research."," The current somewhat lower performance on Czech is due to several factors. They include (a) very low accuracy initial word-alignments due to often non-parallel translations of the Reader’s Digest sample and the failure of the initial word-alignment models to handle the highly inflected Czech morphology. (b) the small size of the Czech parallel corpus (less than twice the length of the Bible). (c) the common occurrence in Czech of two very similar perfective and non-perfective root variants (e.g. odolávat and odolat, both of which mean to resist). A simple monolingual dictionary-derived list of canonical roots would resolve ambiguity regarding which is the appropriate target."," Many of the errors are due to all (or most) inflections of a single verb mapping to the same incorrect root. But for many applications where the function of lemmatization is to cluster equivalent words (e.g. stemming for information retrieval), the choice of label for the lemma is less important than correctly linking the members of the lemma. .005 .01 Error Rate .001 .002 .02 .05 120 K 300 K 1.2 M 12 M Size of Aligned Corpus (words) .10 (by type) (by token)French Bible French Bible (Error rate by TOKEN)French Hansards (Error rate by TYPE)French Hansards Figure 12: Learning Curves for French Morphology"," The learning curves in Figure 12 show the strong correlation between performance and size of the aligned corpus. Given that large quantities of parallel text currently exist in translation bureau archives and OCR-able books, not to mention the increasing online availability of bitext on the web, the natural growth of available bitext quantities should continue to support performance improvement."," The system analysis examples shown in Table 4 are representative of model performance and are selected to illustrate the range of encountered phenomena. All system evaluation is based on the task of selecting the correct root for a given inflection (which has a long lexicography-based consensus regarding the “truth”). In contrast, the descriptive analysis of any such pairing is very theory dependent without standard consensus. The “TopBridge” column shows the strongest English bridge lemma utilized in mapping (typically one of many potential bridge lemmas).","These results are quite impressive in that they are based on essentially no language-specific knowledge of French, Spanish or Czech. In addition, the multilingual bridge algorithm is surface-form independent, and can just as readily handle obscure infixational or reduplicative morphological processes."]},{"title":"8. CONCLUSION","paragraphs":["This paper has presented a detailed survey of original algorithms for cross-language annotation projection and noise-robust tagger induction, evaluated on four diverse applications. It shows how previous major investments in English annotated corpora and tool development can be effectively leveraged across languages, achieving accurate stand-alone tool development in other languages without comparable human annotation efforts. Collectively this work is the most comprehensive existing exploration of a very promising new paradigm","for cross-language resource projection."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["This research has been partially supported by NSF grant IIS-9985033 and ONR/MURI contract N00014-01-1-0685.
