The overall objectives of ESPRIT are civilian and oriented towards the industrial sector. The cliche of a successful ESPRIT project is one which will lead, after its completion, to the development of successful commercial products by the industrial participants in the project.","At the level of individual projects, each ESPRIT project is contracted to a consortium of organisations, with a minimum of two partners from different member states; projects are typically contracted to 4 to 8 partners. A major difference for the participants is also that the Community supports 50% of the project budget, as opposed to 100% with DARPA. The other 50% contributions come from the organisations themselves and somehow guarantee that the project is of genuine interest to the industrial organisations involved. At the end of the project, the property rights remain with the project participants. Eligibility for participation in an ESPRIT project requires that the organisation be incorporated in one of the 12 member states, namely Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Greece, France, Italy, Ireland, Luxemburg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom. The participation has also been extended to organisations incorporated in one of the \"EFTA countries\", namely Austria, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland; however, in that case, the Community does not contribute to the costs of the EFTA organisation(s)."]},{"title":"OVERVIEW OF THE ESPRIT PROGRAMME","paragraphs":["The following material is taken from the Information Package for Proposers, 1989. ESPRIT, the European Strategic Programme for Research and Development in Information Technology, has the following objectives:","• To provide European industry with the basic technologies to meet the competitive requirements of the 1990s.","• To promote European industrial cooperation in pre-competitive R&D in information technology (IT). • To pave the way for internationally accepted standards. ESPRIT addresses three major 1T sectors: • Microelectronics to improve the technological capabilities of the microelectronics sector and to strengthen its interaction with the microelectronics users sector so as to enable Community IT industry as a whole to draw maximum benefits from state-of-the-art semiconductor technology. • Information Processing Systems to bring together tools and technologies for hardware and software domains required to meet the competitive requirements of the 1990s. Special emphasis will be put on systems design technology, parallel computer architectures and knowledge engineering. • Applications to improve the ability to use and integrate IT, and to encourage rapid transfer of IT innovations to selected areas of applications. Special emphasis will be put on computer integrated manufacturing and on office an business systems.","ESPRIT is implemented through pre-competitive R&D projects. The topics which projects address are described in the ESPRIT Workprogramme, which also describes the strategy, objectives and technical aspects of the work of the programme. The Workprogramme is updated regularly in consultation with the European IT community. Calls for Proposals are published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.","ESPRIT projects are carried out under shared-costs contracts by consortia which must include at least two industrial partners from different Member States of the Community. In addition to industrial R&D projects, the programme includes actions in Basic Research."]},{"title":"THE MOTIVATION FOR THE ESPRIT PROGRAMME","paragraphs":["The following material is taken from European File, \"ESPRIT: key to the technological awakening of Europe.\" In seizing the opportunities offered by information technology, Europe was initially handicapped by its own inherited structures. The problem was not any lack of scientific and technological skills, but the partitioning of the market into distinct national entities, so that potential was also fragmented. European industry could not achieve a 'critical mass' and benefit from the same economies of scale as its direct competitors - American, Japanese and, more recently, South-East Asian industry. Although its own internal market represents a substantial segment of world demand, the European electronics industry has lost considerable ground over the past decade. In 1975, the Community had a positive balance of trade in information technology, amounting to some ECU 1.7 billion. Since then, however, it has been in the red, with a deficit of almost ECU 22 billion in 1988. 34","Only a far-reaching, Community-level initiative could halt this deterioration. It was a question of accepting an economic challenge of vital importance for Europe - and of ensuring the continent's independence in making the technological choices for its future, in an area which influences the entire development of society. From the start of the 1980s, the Commission of the European Communities therefore undertook, in close consultation with industries in this sector, and with scientific circles and the national authorities of the Member States, an assessment of the particular handicaps to be overcome and the action to be taken. The following points emerged:","• The necessity to combat the scattering of research and development efforts, by strengthening in particular cooperation between industry and the universities.","• The need for a new European dimension, to be achieved by widening the market (notably by ending the old reflex of 'national preferences'), but also by seeking a larger optimal size for competitive companies and therefore a rationalization of the sector.","This is the context in which Esprit was bern. Following a short pilot phase, the programme was effectively launched in February 1984 for a 10.year period. Designed to mobilize both Community and private resources on a larger scale,"]},{"title":"it","paragraphs":["has three basic objectives:","• To promote cooperation in the information technology field between industries, universities and European research bodies, on research and development projects up to pre-competitive level (prior to the development of commercial products).","• To provide European industry with the basic technologies necessary to meet the competitive requirements of the international market in the 1990s.","• To contribute to the development and international recognition of technical standards essential for the development of information technology.","The core of the Esprit programme is a work programme which established an overall framework as well as various objectives in the main basic areas of information technology. The programme enables research and development projects to be carried out, involving at least two industrial concerns from two different Member states, with or without participation of one or more universities or research institutes.","• The Esprit workprograrnme, which is revised and adjusted annually, is drawn up following consultation and dialogue with several hundred experts of different backgrounds. This approach enables the European Commission to identify the lines of action corresponding to the needs actually expressed by industrialists and scientists.","• The Commission then proceeds each year with a public 'call for proposals'. The would-be participants define, in complete independence, the aims, scope and methods of their research. The projects, which are selected on the basis of an assessment by a group of independent experts, are supported financially by the Community. The Community is responsible for half the agreed costs, the other half is supplied by the participants themselves.

The objective of SUNSTAR is to show the benefits and enhancements that human computer interfaces can offer when they are based on speech input/output. The project will demonstrate this by realising prototypes in two fields of speech application which represent market sectors of rapidly growing importance: • a professional, office-type environment • a public telephone network environment.","The project is application-drivan in the sense that it concentrates on the integration of speech functions into demonstrator systems rather than on fundamental research issues of speech recognition and speech output.","Dialogue design and the associated ergonomle aspects are of high importance to the project, in order to gain wider acceptability for speech interfaces in real-world applications. Another key issue is the integration of speech technology with other input/output devices.","Exploitation.

The objective of ARS is to develop improved algorithms for speech recognition in the presence of noise, and to build a real-time demonstrator. The demonstrator will verify algorithm performance and address the problem of speech-based man-machine dialogue as a system interface in practical applications.","Two application environments have been chosen, namely vehicles and factories. The system will have a vocabulary in the order of 100-500 words, chosen by each national group of partners and tailored to the specific application environment. 35 Advances will be made in:","• reduction of the effects of noise on speech signals by signal preprocessing • feature extraction aimed to improve noise robustness","• study and refinement of algorithms for speech pattern matching in noisy environments • speaker adaptation","• dynamic system adjustment to user feedback and the development of error correction strategies in the human interface","• development of system prototypes (hardware and firmware) for real-time speech recognition.","The real-time demonstrator will be based on a general-purpose DSP chip attached to a personal computer or a standalone system. In the development system, the signal processor will be connected to a host which will provide for development support of software algorithms and for fileserver function to the databases required. Performance evaluations will first be made in the leboratory using suitable databases collected in noisy environments and by measuring the resulting rate of correct recognition. Performance under field conditions will then be assessed from a prototype fitted in a vehicle and a laboratory system installed in a factory.","The project will liaise with DRIVE research programme projects dealing with vehicle applications, and with other European projects on speech recognition.","Progress and Results. After the first year of the project, a multilingual database collected in noisy environments was made available among the partners and was used for the evaluation of their baseline systems. These baseline systems were realised according to a common standard suitable for exchanging the software modules of the algorithms (studies of which are presently in progress) among partners.","The hardware structure of the final real-time demonstrator has been defined.","Exploitation.

The goal of POLYGLOT is to demonstrate the feasibility of multi-language voice input/output for a number of commercially promising applications. The objective is to integrate phonetic, lexical, and syntactic knowledge common to text-to-speech and speech-to-text conversion, providing greater generality, lower cost, and easier extensions. A set of technologies and working prototypes is planned:","• Very large vocabulary (tens of thousands of words), isolated words, speaker-adaptive speech recognition on a PC, for speech-to-text conversion in six European languages, will be implemented and tested. Continuous speech recognition will be addressed as well, but only to the stage of producing a strategy for implementation on a PC.","• High quality, language-sensitive, unrestricted vocabulary, text-to-speech conversion in six European languages.","• Tools for easy extension of both the recognition and synthesis technologies to additional languages.","• Application development tools for recognition and synthesis.","• Development of demonstrators for language teaching, voice feedback for a blind typist, remote access to an electronic mailbox, access to a mail directory, and natural language access to a database.","The project is based on the results of ESPRIT project 860. An existing isolated-word speech recognition system which was developed by one of the partners will be extended, under this project, to six other languages.","Progress and Results. Detailed speech database specifications have been completed for isolated word recognition, continuous speech recognition and text-to-speech. Full specifications of the POLYGLOT common hardware and software are also available. A tool for the acquisition and hand segmentation or labelling of speech, SAMBA, has been implemented on a PC. A modular architecture for \"time delay neural networks\" has also been completed.","The first half-year's work on text-to-speech has mainly been preparatory and theoretical in nature. However, specifications of the following are now available: system 36 architecture; automatic language identification; voice source and vocal tract model; analysis and development tools; prosody and intonation; working environment for synthesis rule development.","Exploitation. So far, the acceptance of speech recognition and synthesis systems on the market has been marginal due to unsatisfactory performance, high purchase costs, and the lack of application development tools. The project aims to establish the technology for a wide variety of modular, multi-lingual, speech input/output systems, mostly based on personal computers. Such a range of applications promises a high-volume market for products aimed at end-users and small system houses. These systems are believed to provide an important contribution to the development of market demand for an even wider range of speech technology products. Contact Point: Mr. V. ING. C. OLIVETTI & C.

The main technologies to be developed will be continuous speech recognition and understanding, and oral dialogue modelling and management.","Speech input will be sentences of naturally spoken utterances of telephone quality with a vocabulary of the order of 1000-2000 words for each of the applications. The grammar will be based on a subset of the four partners' languages (English, French, German and Italian). The project has commenced with speaker-independent recognition of sub-word units; however, the second phase will consider automatic on-line speaker adaptation with a view to improving performance. The dialogue manager will allow users to express themselves in a restricted natural language.","Prototypes will demonstrate the technology for three main information service applications: intercity train timetables (German), flight enquiries and reservations (English and French) and a hotel database (Italian). The spoken language phenomena to be covered will be determined from analysis of both human-human corpora of dialogues as well as human-machine simulations. Each demonstration system will be evaluated through extensive user trials.","For all demonstrators, the project has to define a common general architecture, common formalisms for grammar representation across languages, and common semantic representations for dialogue management and message generation.","Progress and Results. The project started with a number of definition studies for the general architecture and studies of application scenarios. A common architecture has been defined, together with the interfaces between the major modules; this will facilitate comparative evaluation and exchange between partners.","A small vocabulary for the telephone speaker-independent recogniser has been developed with a vocabulary of 50 words, suitable for a banking-by-phone application. Tests on the recogniser using the Recogniser Sensitivity Analysis (RSA) technique (being developed in project 2589, SAM - see page 106) have shown 95.6% correct recognition (+/- 0.7% at the 95% confidence level) on the RSA 31-word vocabulary.","Preliminary results for the acoustic-phonetic decoding module show that continuous density HMMs (CDHMM) achieve 77.6% word accuracy on sentences compared to 68.5% for discrete density HMMs using 275 phonetic units for the Italian language and a near 1000-word vocabulary. These results are for speaker-independent recognition of telephone quality sentences, but do not take into account the effect of the linguistic processing module on sentence understanding performance.","Results for the English language using CDHMM show that phoneme recognition accuracy on the DARPA TIMIT database is comparable to that achieved by Kai-Fu Lee in the Carnegie Mellon SPHINX system.","A common dialogue manager architecture has been defined and work is in progress on its implementation.","The first full working prototype oral dialogue system is on target for completion by July 1991.","Exploitation. SUNDIAL is targeted at natural-language oral dialogues, particularly for information services. This technology will find its prime application in telephone-based services, i.e. when other terminals are not available. Applications range from business-related services (e.g. calling the company computer through a telephone), to services aimed at the general user, such as banking-by-phone, which is now becoming quite common in Europe. Most of these applications are currently dominated by technology from the USA.

The activities in the present, main phase of the project focus around three major areas:","• Speech Input assessment: including the setting up of tests, their scoring, and the delineation of performance factors; for example, recogniser tests have been defined and run on the project's standard PC-based workstations, SESAM, using standardised scoring software. Cross-language work is also being directed towards the definition of recogniser sensitive speech dimensions.","• Speech Output assessment: both objective and subjective, including for example, standard multi-language tests for evaluation at the segment and suprasegmental level that have been developed to run on the workstation, using automatic response-scoring procedures, together with overall quality measures.","• Enabling Technologies: the specification of speech databases across all the project languages; the definition of uniform protocols for collection and management of speech databases in a standard format and the introduction of agreed methods for multilingual annotation are all examples of work in this area.

PLUS aims to achieve robustness in natural language understanding by treating natural language as a communicative activity whose essential characteristic is 38 to convey a meaning that is both appropriate and contextually relevant.","Since the intention of a human user of natural language is to convey a message, and since all messages occur in some context, it is crucially important to exploit this context in the derivation of the intended interpretation. This contrasts with other approaches to the problem of robustness, which can be classified as low-level (spelling correctors, online lexical acquisition, domain-dependent constraints, semantic grammars, and so on). These low-level techniques miss the heart of the problem, which is to react appropriately in a context created or updated by the fact that a user has typed something at a keyboard with the express purpose of communicating a message.","The key issue will be the exploitation of both pragmatic and linguistic phenomena (such as interpretation with respect to context and inference tools derived from non-linguistic problems) in order to provide reasoning-based robustness in natural language understanding by integrating these two areas. The consortium believe this to be the most important neglected area in current work on natural language understanding.","The development work to be carried out in the PLUS project will produce an environment for developing intelligent natural language interfaces to interactive computing environments (both information-seeking dialogue system~ and problem-solving environments). A first demonstrator, interactive Yellow Pages, will be developed, but the modular architecture with a replaceable application model will enable new applications to be produced with relatively little effort.","The emphasis on the primacy of pragmatics and language-independent reasoning, and the resulting simplification of the language-specific knowledge-bases, will also facilitate the adaptation of the system to new languages or multilingual use.

The three main research themes are: the theoretical study of discourse for conversational control in didactic situations; the experimental study of optimal explanatory strategies and media; and the creation of a computational architecture of models and processes to retrieve domain knowledge and control explanatory conversations.","Alms. The IDEAL Action aims to answer the following questions:","• How can theoretical discourse models of explanatory situations be used for the contextually appropriate control of human/computer interaction?","• What are the optimal choices of media for explaining different types of knowledge?","• How can visual media be used with explanatory discourse?","• How are user requests for information analysed in a conversational context of discourse focus?","• How is the appropriate domain knowledge retrieved in order to satisfy requests?","Approach and Methods. The results of three theoretical and empirical themes feed into a fourth theme, computational modelling:","1. Theory of explanatory discourse and dialogue modelling (linguistic theme) will create a theory of explanatory discourse linking speech acts, topic focus, and planning, based on situation semantics and functional discourse theories. The theory, empirically validated by analysis of a corpus of natural explanations, will contribute to the development of computational models for query analysis, discourse focus maintenance, and the planning of explanations.","2. Experimental studies of dialogue styles and presentation media investigates the effectiveness of different styles (e.g. active/passive expert, etc.) and presentation media on learning. These experiments on acquisition, conceptualisation and structuring of knowledge during explanation will create guidelines for the best strategies to follow according to the educational situation.","3. Knowledge representation, retrieval and management concerns the representation of domain knowledge and researches mechanisms for retrieving appropriate domain knowledge.

DYANA Action aims to answer the following questions:","• What declarative theory of grammar (extending from phonetics to discourse) would best support incremental interpretation and top-down information flow?","• How can existing unification-based grammar formalisms be developed so as to increase their ability to express high-level generalisations, while retaining a clear semantics and computational interpretation?","• How is the informational content of an utterance integrated into the current discourse context? •","What formal models can adequately capture the defeasibility and non-monotonic character of human reasoning?","• To what extent is it possible to synthesise the formal methods used for modelling partial information in speech, grammar, semantics and reasoning?","Approach and Methods. The work is divided into three inter-dependent themes:","• Grammar development, speech and prosody, emphasising the development of formal models, the abstract specification and parametric variation of linguistic structure, the incorporation of intonational structure into the representation of utterances, and the investigation of the interplay of intelligibility, predictability and discourse context in speech recognition and production.","• Meaning, discourse and reasoning, addressing the further development of the dynamic and partial models of meaning that have been emerging in the past decade. In addition, non-monotonic logic will be used, taking into account conditional reasoning and infeasibility in lexical concept combination, and to formalise forms of default interpretation that play a role in various aspects of linguistic structures.","• Logic and computation, directed towards the development of formal mathematical and computationally tractable models of natural language, encompassing recent extensions of unification formalisms.

Based on research into peripheral auditory processing and cognitive research on speech perception and memory, the primary goal is to develop a recognition system that benefits from the preprocessing embodied in current models of the human auditory system. Alms. The key research questions explored are:","• How can auditory processing performed in the cochlea be simulated?","• How can the transient information concerning the onsets and offsets of parts of speech be extracted from an early stage of the auditory processing chain?","• How can existing connectionist recognisers be developed to perform vowel recognition using the cochlea simulation as a front-end ?","• How can training techniques for connectionist recognisers be improved?","• How do humans perform on a phoneme recognition task in the absence of lexieal and contextual constraints?","Approach and Methods. The goal is to construct a recognition system involving (a) a high-resolution front-end processor based on current models of the human auditory system, and (b) a word-recognition system based on abstract phonological representations and a phonological buffer store. The three parallel research streams aim to:","• Develop a detailed but efficient functional model of human hearing in five stages: spectral analysis, neural transduction, phase alignment, pitch extraction and timbre stabilisation. Feature extraction mechanisms used in the model will be developed in line with psychological research.","• Compare cormectionist recogniser performance using auditory preprocessing with conventional spectrographic preprocessing.","• Develop new recogniser architectures and training algorithms in line with psycholinguistie research.","Work is also directed towards developing user documentation for the cochlea simulation software, establishing base-line performance for phoneme recognition using both traditional and auditory front-ends, feature extraction software, and an efficient parallel implementation of a connectionist recogniser.

A cross-language study of coarticulation identifies the major language- independent universal regularities of the phenomenon and how they interact with language-specific factors. Investigations of coarticulatory regularities are integrated with new and improved ways of exploiting these regularities in deriving articulatory representations from the acoustic analysis of speech.","Alms. Recent theoretical and experimental work on speech production strongly indicates the need for a comprehensive cross-language programme of basic research to expand knowledge of the language-specific and language-independent regularities involved. For many applications in speech technology the availability of an articulatory representation of speech utterances would mean substantial progress. For example, in the automatic recognition of continuous speech one of the major barriers to robust speaker-independent systems has been the great variability in the relationship between the acoustic level of representation and the phonological structure of a given utterance.","However, the variability can itself become a productive source of information if the underlying physiological and linguistic constraints of the dynamics of articulation can be modelled, and this is the goal of the ACCOR Action. The main source of systematic variability at the segmental level is undoubtedly coarfieulation, the main focus of the work.","Approach and Methods. A cross-language approach is adopted in the ACCOR Action as a means of identifying the major language-independent universal regularities of the phenomenon (aspects such as mass, inertia and elasticity of the speech organs, the mechanical linkages between them and the neuromuscular complexities of the cranial nervous system), and how they interact with language-specific factors such as the phonological rules of the languages concerned.","Work began by examining the activities of the major physiological systems underlying speech production: the respiratory system (producing a flow of air), the laryngeal system (modifying the airflow by the valving mechanism of the vocal folds), and the complex supraglottal structures in the mouth and nose (such as the tongue, lips, jaw and soft palate, which shape the vocal tract into different resonating cavities).","In addition, by examining the details of a given articulatory process for a number of different languages, ACCOR aims to determine how such processes differ according to different phonological systems, and thus to be in a position to investigate interactions between the two sources of variation. A common methodology, standardised investigation tools and measurement procedures at specified locations in the speech signal have been adopted.","Progress and Results. Deliverab~es and papers cover the following areas:","• Hardware and software development for digital recording of articulatory and acoustic data. A PC-based prototype of a multichannel speech workstation has been designed.","• Research into the instrumental investigation of articulatory activity.","• Review of connected speech processes in English, French, German and Italian.","• A core lexicon for English, French, German, Italian, Spanish and Swedish has been established, consisting of consonant-vowel-consonant nonsense words; real words matching the phonetic structure of the nonsense words as closely as possible; and sentences illustrating the main connected speech processes in different languages. A complete set of recordings is available for 5 speakers of each language.","• A common methodology has been adopted for segmenting and labelling the data. It is based on a non-linear and independent annotation of the articulatory and acoustic events.","• The interpretation of articulatory and acoustic data in terms of a production model is in progress.","Potential. This Action integrates investigations into coarticulatory regularities with research into new and improved ways of exploiting these regularities in deriving articulatory representations through the acoustic analysis of speech. The knowledge gained will show the most promising paths to follow in many speech technology applications, particularly in the development of more robust speech recognition systems.
