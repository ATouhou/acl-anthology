It has now been adopted by the UK Alvey Programme and is both kept as an on-line document undergoing constant revision and refinement, and published as a paperback by Springer Verlag.

The catalogue entries are intended to be non-technical and brief, but with a literature reference. The reference might not be the \"classic\" one. It will often be to a textbook or survey article. The border between AI and non-Al techniques is fuzzy. Since the catalogue is to promote interaction some techniques are included because they are vital parts of many AI programs, even though they did not originate in AI.","We have not included in the catalogue separate entries for each slight variation of a technique, nor have we included descriptions of AI programs tied to a particular application, nor of descriptions of work in progress. The catalogue is not intended to be a dictionary of AI terminology, nor to include definitions of AI problems, nor to include descriptions of paradigm examples.","Entries are short (abstract length) descriptions of a technique. They include: a title, list of aliases, contributor's name, paragraph of description, and references. The contributor's name is that of the original author of the entry. Only occasionally is the contributor of the entry also the inventor of the technique. The reference is a better guide to the identity of the inventor. Some entries have been subsequently modified by the referees and/or editorial team, and these modifications have not always been checked with the original contributor, so (s)he should not always be held morally responsible, and should never be held legally responsible.","The original version of the catalogue was called"]},{"title":"The Catalogue of Artificial Intelligence Tools","paragraphs":["and also contained descriptions of portable software, e.g., expert systems shells and knowledge representation systems. Unfortunately, we found it impossible to maintain a comprehensive coverage of either all or only the best such software.

It would also have required a much more frequent reprinting of the catalogue than either the publishers, editors, or readers could afford. Also, expert systems shells threatened to swamp the other entries. We have, therefore, decided to omit software entries from future editions and rename the catalogue to reflect this. The only exception to this is programming languages, for which we will provide generic entries.
