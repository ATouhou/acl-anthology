{"sections":[{"title":"BOOK REVIEWS THE WORDTREE Â® Henry G. Burger (author, compiler, and editor)","paragraphs":["Merriam, Kansas: The Wordtree, 1984, 380 pp. $149.00 The Wordtree is a combination of a knowledge representation system and a thesaurus. Although it claims that it is \"the word system for solving physical and social problems branch by branch,\" it appears to be primarily an organization of English words, plus some rare and made-up words, according to actions. A complete hierarchy, starting with create, is defined for 20,000 transitive verbs. Every transitive verb is defined by giving two other verbs: one which is more general, and the other which when combined with the more general term selects the particular word being defined. Thus each node in the hierarchy is a particular verb; its parent is a more general verb, which is related to the node in question by combination with another specific verb. From each node you can find a more general verb (except, of course, for the root); or, by looking underneath the node, you can find a list of more specific verbs. Noun-like concepts are indexed into the verbs that produce them. For many verbs, suitable nouns to act as instrumentalities or objects are given.","For example, suppose one wishes to use The Wordtree to produce world peace (the book claims \"to maneuver or change the world, use the Wordtree\"). You look up peace, and it tells you that it is produced by pacify and negotiate. How do you do either of those things? You look them up and it refers you to pacify at number 17477, a subclass of emotionize distinguished by please, i.e., to pacify people or things, you should simultaneously emotionize them and please them. Similarly, negotiate (9191) is the combination of maneuver and effect. Strings like emotionize, which are not common English, appear frequently: this one is in the hierarchy as brain and ekphore, where ekphore is the negative of excess and louden. The message then, is that one can pacify by communicating quietly and pleasantly; one can negotiate by maneuvering with effect. Or, to quote Teddy Roosevelt, \"speak softly and carry a big stick.\"","The reduction of all concepts to a hierarchical structure, with the expectation of great benefits, has been tried before. John Wilkins wrote in 1668, \"the reducing of all things and notions, to such kind of Tables, as are here proposed (were it as compleatly done as it might be) would prove the shortest and plainest way for the attainment of real Knowledge, that hath been yet offered to the World.\" This is from the introduction to his Essay Towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language (reprinted by Scolar Press Ltd, 1968). Wilkins used a two-dimensional tabular representation of his hierarchy. Compared to the linearized hierarchy printed in The Wordtree, Wilkins's table is much easier to scan. Also, Wilkins's book is printed in upper and lower case and in a large type size; Burger uses a tiny, upper-case only, six-column format that is hard to read (in fairness, as a result his book is much easier to carry). The Wordtree is also made less accessible by the rare or made-up words; I open at random to page 128 and find items like zipcodesequence, enmagazine, satevepost, bodge, encist, ecphorize, and vorlauf. Burger's linearization of the hierarchy also produces some strange results; for page after page, for example, the chemical elements, listed in order, are interleaved with parts of the world. On page 114, as an example, one finds the following \"words\" in the following order: scotchify, promethiate, hispaniolize, gaelicize, samariate, westindianize, europiate, gadolinate (where europiate is from the chemical element europium, and is to be distinguished from europeanize). Yes, the hierarchical relations, if you track the numbers, are keeping the lists of elements and of countries distinct; but the result is that The Wordtree is hard to browse, requiring constant references to the category numbers and/or the index to find things.","I tried a sample word problem. A friend asked over lunch for an alternative to represent in contexts similar to \"In electronic mail anger is sometimes represented by capital letters.\" I thought offhand of manifest and then returned to look this up. A conventional Roget's Thesaurus gave almost immediately such words as indicate, illuminate, emphasize, show, brandish, disclose, flaunt, dramatize, reflect, feature, demonstrate, symbolize, evidence, personify, highlight, express, formulate under the heading for manifest that included represent. In The Wordtree I find manifest (5611) as show and unclose. Under it are activate, feature, landmark and other less relevant words. Above manifest I track back through the sequence show (5179), reveal (4792), illuminate (4440), luminate (4075), lumine (3727), light (3354) [at this point, thinking of Genesis 1:3 I hoped I was near the beginning of the hierarchy, but no such luck], ir (3104), microwave (2909), shortwave (2708), radio (2567), heat (2352), warm (1990), tepefy (1482), thermalize (990), agitate (718), alternate (456), interchange (251), mutualize (151), affect (95), change (54), and create (1). Above represent the sequence goes through intend, halfintend, mind, perceive, sense, morse [as in Morse code], encode, cipher, substitute, favor, like, aestheticize, acculturate, accustom, habituate, characterize, pattern, model, represent and we have reached a circularity (noted in the book).
