These \"adages\" capture in a neat saying the point of the story. They are in effect macros representing a particular goals-events interaction. But it is unclear whether recognition of the appropriate adage (e.g., \"Too many cooks spoil the broth\") triggers the setting up of a pattern of abstract goals and events against which to match the events of the story, or vice-versa. If the former, one wonders how the appropriate adage is picked out in the first place. If the latter, then the use of adages would seem to be no more than a gimmick, or more charitably an initially interesting but quickly tiresome, expository device. The question of just how the more intricate details of the stories are to be understood is more pressing. On the other hand, as part of a cognitive theory of story understanding, the idea of relating stories with similar structures is probably right, though there is also the important point that stories are only interesting insofar as they take an unexpected turn, as Dyer correctly notes: \"It is the unusual and unexpected events, including the mistakes and failures of the characters which often make a story memorable. By their very nature, such events cannot be predicted in a top-down manner\" (p. 17).","As well as TAUs, the discussion of which continues for an excessive 75 pages, Dyer introduces the notion of AFFECTs, which are knowledge structures relating the emotional reactions of participants. These are important in indicating which TAU is present, and in answering questions about the narrative.","The second part of this book concerns the control, coordination, and interaction of various processes, viz., parsing for comprehension, retrieval for question answering, and memory modification in both. Dyer's claim is that these interactions are a key element of the integrated narrative comprehension system, one of whose features is the ability to understand and answer questions without parsing them fully or even completely understanding them. The system, called BORIS, uses \"demons\", a type of production system similar to, but more general than, Riesbeck and Schank's \"requests\", which undertake a wide variety of tasks involving various types of knowledge structure. The knowledge structures used by BORIS are firmly founded in the Yale tradition, a feature that extends in Part III to the use of \"l-links\" (goal-planevent dependencies not unlike those discussed in Wilensky's book), MOPs (interconnectable script-like structures which will be familiar to followers of the Yale School), and so on.","The final part of the book, not including a number of appendices, contains a highly detailed worked example which will be of great interest to anyone thinking of simulating the model, and which is of value in that it brings together and focuses the preceding discussion, as well as clarifying some peripheral questions, especially concerning the basic parsing strategies used. The book ends with a retro- and prospective view of the general approach, highlighting some of the theoretical discoveries that arose from the computer implementation, and looking forward to future work in the field.","As mentioned above, Dyer's book is long and thorough: while this is an advantage for readers who wish to immerse themselves in the model and get an exhaustive view of it, for the more casual reader it is a difficult book to get a lot out of despite the author's guide to \"skimming\". In some respects i,t is more overtly relevant to Computational Linguistics than Wilensky's book, especially in being more explicit about formalisms and fine detail, and in dealing with run-time questions: Wilensky only really underlines the relationship between planning and understanding in his final chapter, whereas the Dyer book makes this more explicit throughout.","Finally, one thing that both books are able to make quite clear even to the most optimistic reader is that the whole question of understanding and modelling actors' motives even in relatively banal stories is extremely complex, and worthy of all the attention it is given.
