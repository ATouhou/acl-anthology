It brings together current and classic resources in the field and provides a unique, interactive forum for scholars, students, and professionals. Currently under development, MIT CogNet is a free service through August 31, 2000, and welcomes charter members during this period. Services of MIT CogNet TM include a searchable, full-text library with a growing collection of books, journals, and reference works; an academic almanac of cognitive science programs; HotScience editorials by invited scientists on groundbreaking or controversial aspects of their research; job listings; CV and bibliography utilities; virtual poster sessions; threaded discussion groups; a seminar manager with information about current seminars and lecture series at participating academic institutions; community member profiles; and more. MIT CogNet TM offers the latest research, reference, and professional tools for those working in the cognitive and brain sciences. Visit the site today and let us know what you think. Charter members who contribute content or comments on the site's functionality during the prototype phase will earn discounts on MIT Press books -- and on the subscription fee for MIT CogNet when it is officially launched (September 1, 2000)."]},{"title":"Usage-Based Models of Language Michael Barlow and Suzanne Kemmer,","paragraphs":["Editors This book brings together papers by the fore-most representatives of a range of theoretical and empirical approaches converging on a common goal: to account for language use, or how speakers actually speak and understand language. Crucial to a usage-based approach are frequency, statistical patterns, and, most generally, linguistic experience. Approaches represented here include Cognitive Grammar, the Lexical Network Model, Competition Model, Relational Network Model, and Accessibility Theory.

The paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must be written in English. Contact the editor regarding the possibility of electronic submission. Submissions may be made in any of the following categories: Papers: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in computational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The length of a paper depends on its content, but it is suggested that manuscripts be limited to forty double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of thirty journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed by three or four experts in the field. Manuscripts may also be submitted electronically; consult http://www.aclweb.org/cl/submit.txt for instructions and pointers to the I6TEX style files. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the author certifies the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publication to another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Editor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the case of a \"work for hire,\" by.the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978 U.S. Copyright law. Letters to the Editor: This category includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluafe the appropriateness of these contributions for inclusion. Five copies of papers or three copies of letters should be sent to: Julia Hirschberg, CL Editor AT&T Labs-Research, Room B223 180 Park Avenue Florham Park, NJ 07932-0971 (+1 973) 360~8330; acl@research.att.com Squibs and Discussions: This category includes short articles reporting technical results, discussions Of results, algorithms, or new computational linguistic data or tools of interest to the journal readership. Submission format is the same as for regular papers, but the length should in no case exceed eight journal pages.

A European chapter was established in 1982. Besides publishing Computational Linguistics, the ACL holds infernational meetings (annually in North America, biennially in Europe) where the state-of-the-art in natural language processing research and development is presented. Recently, special interest groups on the Mathematics of Language, the Lexicon, Parsing, Generation,• Computational Phonology, Multimedia Language Processing, and Very Large Corpora have been formed; others are likely to be added.
