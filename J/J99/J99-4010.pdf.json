This provides the possibility of improved system maintainability and effectiveness. If such systems are to begin to challenge conventional methods for documentation, then it is essential that they provide integrated and well-chosen examples.","This book looks at how examples can be selected within a system to generate natural language descriptions. This builds on the work of the Explainable Expert Systems project (Swartout, Paris, and Moore 1992) and many of the examples illustrate a plan language used in that project. The book is based on the author's Ph.D. thesis and in-cludes an interesting review of work on the use of examples, taken from several disciplines, some conclusions and illustrations from a corpus analysis of instructional texts, and a detailed description of an implemented system.","The book highlights many of the issues that need to be addressed when generating examples that are based on some underlying specification. A particular contribution is highlighting that the use (and categorization) of examples should depend on any surrounding textual explanation.","Given the range of interesting issues discussed, the actual system description is a little disappointing.

The first half discusses how a concordance, simple counting programs, and a corpus can be used to identify differences in the rate of occurrence of a linguistic feature across different registers or conditioned on another linguistic feature. The second, technically more elaborate, half discusses factor analysis as a means for combining such counts across multiple features and arriving at more concise descriptors of differences across registers. Both questions are rephrased several times in different forms, involving lexical, syntactic, or discourse features and contrasts between speech and written text, between native and ESL speakers, and across different types of scientific writings, to name a few. In each case, the methodology behind corpus selection, feature identification, calculation of the results with a computer, manual editing, and interpretation of the results is explained in sufficient detail. There is a collection of highly readable, if somewhat short, essays on methodological issues at the end of the book; these range from corpus design to tagging to (very briefly) statistical interpretation. There is also a substantial bibliography on the subject (up to 1996).","The book appears to be aimed at undergraduates in linguistics with no experience of corpus linguistics; even moderately technical linguistic terms are explained upon first mention. It will also be useful to those the-oretical linguists who have managed to remain unaware of quantitative methods during the past ten years. Each analysis is presented very clearly, and can be replicated by the reader (the authors provide an extensive list of easily accessible corpora and concordancing tools), enhancing the book's value for the classroom. The authors make a particular effort to avoid intimidating the reader with computer terminology or program listings; not a single line of code appears in the book.","However, the book's scope is narrow.

There is no discussion of predictive methods or of statistical models of language, both of which this reviewer would consider appropriate for a volume titled \"Corpus Linguistics.\" Even in the area that the book does cover, several important issues receive inadequate treatment. There is only brief discussion and no detailed calculations of statistical tests of significance, so the (presumably inexperienced) reader has no means of deciding when the corpus and the feature counts are large enough. Even though factor analysis is the centerpiece of the second half of the book, there is no explanation of how the factors and their loadings might be obtained in practice. These omissions become more apparent because of the book's one shortcoming in presentation: although the authors are lucid, they tend to be repetitive as they detail only superficially dissimilar studies. The reader tends to search for nonexistent differences in methodology, and, after a few sections, is tempted to jump to the study's results and summary, which do make for interesting reading.","This book could be used as part of the curriculum for an introductory corpus linguistics class, especially for students with a humanities background.

The thrust of this book is to provide a model of lexical relations which reconciles the lexicon's idiosyncratic and productive aspects. Building on work in Headdriven Phrase-Structure Grammar, an organization of lexical knowledge---called the Type Underspecified Hierarchical Lexicon--is proposed, through which partial regularities, medium-size generalization, and truly productive processes receive a unified model. Its basic thesis is that all lexical relations reduce to categorization (the membership of the two related lexemes in a common category) and that category intersection is the only mechanism needed to model lexical processes provided lexical items can be stored partially underspecified as to their category membership. Aside from the conceptual simplifica-tion that results from this move, the book demonstrates that several empirical and the-oretical benefits accrue to this architecture; in particular, many salient properties of morphological processes are shown to reduce to inherent, formal properties of the organiza-tion of the lexicon.'--From the publisher's an-nouncement"]},{"title":"Semantics and Syntax in Lexical Functional Grammar: The Resource Logic Approach Mary Dalrymple (editor)","paragraphs":["(Xerox Palo Alto Research Center) Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press (Language, speech, and communication series), x+399 pp; hardbound, ISBN 0-262-04171-5, $40.00 \"A new, deductive approach to the syntax-semantics interface integrates two mature and successful lines of research: logical deduction for semantic composition and the Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) approach to the analysis of linguistic structure.
