The university is about 25 minutes drive from both the San Francisco International and the San Jose Municipal Airports. Take the Bayshore Freeway (Route 101) to the University Avenue exit in Palo Alto. University Avenue will take you through downtown Palo Alto, and be-come Palm Drive after crossing over an underpass at the entrance to the Stanford Campus. At the first stop sign (not a stop light) after the underpass, turn right onto Campus Drive. Where Campus Drive ends, turn left onto Panama Street. Where Panama Street ends, turn right onto Sam Morris Way, then left onto Santa Teresa Street. Make an immediate right into Roble Drive. Roble Hall will be in front of you; Terman Engineering Center will be behind you.","Limousine service ($16.75) is available from both airports, and Van service ($8.00) is available from San Francisco; advance reservations are advisable through Airport Limousine Service, (415) 595-3636.
