These ideas include new models for grammars and new strategies for parsing, motivated by the goal of relating grammatical competence and performance in a principled way. People from both linguistics and computational linguistics are becoming conversant with augmented transition networks, lexical functional grammars, phrase structure grammars, Montague grammars, and transformational grammars, and beginning to explore their implications for each other.","To further this dialogue, the ACL, with the cooperation of the LSA, is soliciting two sessions of contributed papers and planning a panel session on the computer modeling of linguistic theory. To submit a paper for consideration in the contributed paper sessions, send abstracts of .two to eight pages by August 21 to either: Stan Petrick IBM T.J. Watson Research Center P.O.

This Autumn school is designed for both industrial and academic participants. Industrial participants will have the opportunity to acquire the skills associated with applying AI techniques to real world-problems. Academic research scientists will be able to learn about recent AI developments and enhance their programming and communication skills. The school will have places for 55 residential participants and will provide lectures, tutorials, workshops and 24-hour access to computing facilities.","Lecture topics will include computer vision, computational linguistics, expert systems, robotics, AI programming languages, hardware for AI, and psychological modelling. Late-night programming classes will be conducted for novices with little or no programming experience, and experts who wish to extend their LISP or PROLOG skills. There will be a set of workshops for industrial participants focussing on case studies of AI applications. A parallel series of workshops on research methods will cover experimental design, paper and thesis writing, and seminar presentation skills.","For further information, contact: Mrs. Olwyn Wilson AISB School Administrator Institute of Educational Technology Open University Walton Hall Milton Keynes, MK7 6AA, ENGLAND NATO Symposium on Artificial and Human Intelligence","A Symposium on Artificial and Human Intelligence, sponsored by the Human Factors Subcommittee of NATO, will be held at the Chateau de Chapeau Cornu near Lyon, France, October 26-30, 1981. The two major topic areas to be addressed are: (1) the structure of memory, the representation of the problem, and the knowledge and belief base available to the problem-solver -- key issues in both human and machine intelligence; and (2) the structure of language and the role that languages play in problem solving. Other areas of interest include inductive, deductive, and analog thinking, roles in research of expert systems, benchmarks and yardstick problems, constraints of complexity and computability, and priorities in AI research.","Further information may be obtained from the","conference director: Dr. Alick Elithorn The Royal Free Hospital Pond Street London NW3 2QG, ENGLAND Cognitive Studies at Essex","The University of Essex has founded a Cognitive Studies Centre to encourage joint research between the Departments of Computer Science, Electrical Engineering Science, Language and Linguistics, Mathematics and Philosophy.

Damerau Mathematical Sciences Department IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center Yorktown Heights, New York 10598 Research Report RC 8287, May 1980.","This paper sketches the structure of the TQA system with some examples, discusses some of the results of running the system in a user site during the year 1978, and outlines a few of the implications of a natural language query system for larger and more diverse data bases. It is apparent that a number of problems remain to be solved, but it also seems likely that a useful system can be constructed for some domains. Design for an Intelligent Office System Janet L. Kolodner Department of Computer Science Yale University New Haven, Connecticut 06520 IBM Research Report RC 8385, July 1980.","This paper addresses the problem of designing an intelligent office system to help principals (managerial, administrative, or professional level office workers) with their work. A system is described which would use normative models of semi-routine office procedures to anticipate the user's next steps, to provide him automatically with files, documents, and forms he needs to complete a task, and to perform automated subtasks at the correct times. A number of intelligent functions that would perform some of the tasks secretaries generally do (scheduling, reminding, filing) are described, along with the knowledge necessary for performing those functions. In addition, an approach to building a more intelligent system which would understand natural language commands given by the user and understand and deal with routine mail is presented.
