The NCC is sponsored by AFIPS and four of its constituent societies: the Association for Computing Machinery, the Data Processing Management Association, the IEEE Computer Society, and the Society for Computer Simulation.","At this year's NCC, more than 600 firms will display the latest advances in computer hardware, software, and services. They will occupy some 325,00 net square feet of exhibit space, up 95,000 net square feet from NCC '81. In addition, a technical program will focus on \"Advancing Professionalism.\" Its aim is to emphasize the fact that even as systems become in-creasingly ubiquitous through office automation and home computing, there are methods for building them to be usable, reliable, and efficient.","The two ACL-sponsored sessions are scheduled for Wednesday, June 9, and will address the topics of machine-readable dictionaries and natural language help systems.

This special conference will focus on the use of computational linguistic techniques in solving real world problems, and will be limited to 300 participants. Original papers on the use of computational linguistic techniques are being solicited in the areas of: • data, information and knowledge management • training and education • language translation technology • speech recognition and synthesis technology The papers should discuss applications, evaluations, limitations, and general tools and techniques. Papers describing end-users' experience with these technologies are especially welcome.
