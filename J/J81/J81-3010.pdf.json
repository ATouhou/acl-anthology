The three principal extensions introduced are the QUA and VIZ links, and augmented event transition networks. The former permit us to partition the attribute space of conceptual entities in accordance with the defining roles played by these entities in certain kinds of sociolegal interactions. We use an event transition network to represent the value-class of so-called \"dynamic attributes\" in order to define all (and only all) the possible event sequences which the associated entity can participate in relative to the given attribute and still remain itself. The basic concept of simple succession of events in the transition network is then augmented by conditions on dependency relations which may exist across events among various roles (including bounds on the amount of time that can elapse between successive events). Since such event transition nets are themselves concepts within the KNET formalism, they can be placed along a specialization/generaliza-tion hierarchy. We show how these KNET extensions provide an extremely flexible basis for maintaining data base integrity and consistency, determining rollback dependencies during error recovery or historical perspectives, signalling possible irregularities in the attempted recording of new events which violate the legal event sequences defined by the net, as well as for generating derivative sets and mutually non-exclusive stative attribute values and associated interpretations for the wide range of ways this opens up for referenc-ing such concepts in natural language.

The information to be acquired is that needed to support question-answering activities. The basic acquisition approach is \"learning by being told.\" We have been especially interested in exploring the notion of simultaneously learning not only new concepts, but also the linguistic constructions used to express those concepts. As a research vehicle we have developed a system that is preprogrammed with deductive algorithms and a fixed set of syntactic/semantic rules covering a small subset of English. It has been endowed with sufficient seed concepts and seed vocabulary to support effective tutorial interaction. Furthermore, the system is capable of learning new concepts and vocabulary, and can apply its acquired knowledge in a prescribed range of problem-solving situations.

Narrative Text Summarization Wendy Lehnert Department of Computer Science Box 2158 Yale Station Yale University New Haven, Connecticut 06520 Proc. 1980 AAAI Conf., August 1980, 337-339.","In order to summarize a story it is necessary to access a high level analysis that highlights the story's central concepts. A technique of memory representation based on affect units appears to provide the necessary foundation for such an analysis. Affect units are conceptual structures that overlap with each other when a narrative is cohesive. When overlapping inter-sections are interpreted as arcs in a graph of affect units, the resulting graph encodes the plot of the story. Structural features of the graph then reveal which concepts are central to the story. Affect unit analysis is currently being investigated as a processing strategy for narrative summarization. Meta-Planning Robert Wilensky Electronics Research Laboratory Computer Science Division Department of EECS University of California, Berkeley Berkeley, California 94720 Proc. 1980 AAAI Conf., August 1980, 334-336.","This paper is concerned with the problems of planning and understanding. These problems are related because a natural language understander must apply knowledge about people's goals and plans in order to make the inferences necessary to explain the behavior of a character in a story. Thus while a story understander is not a planner, it must embody a theory of planning knowledge. I have developed such a theory in the construction of PAM (Plan Applier Mechanism), a story understanding program. This paper is concerned not with the understanding mechanism itself, but that part of its planning knowledge which is independent of whether that knowledge is used to explain someone's behavior or to generate a plan for one's own use.

These are divided into three categories: conceptual coverage, linguistic coverage, and implementation issues. The section on conceptual coverage discusses the use of a domain expert, which understands what the user is saying even though the system to which the front-end is interfaced might not be able to properly do what the user wants. The section on linguistic coverage discusses attempts to allow a natural language interface to handle natural, interactive human communication. Two solutions are explored: first, the design of a robust natural language understanding system composed of many experts that know about some aspect of the organization of language is considered; second, because the design of a robust system is a large task, the intermediate goal of limiting the vocabulary and constructions that can be used while retaining all the user-oriented benefits of natural language is considered. The implementation issues considered are the design of a system in which the grammar and the domain of discourse can be easily extended and which can be used for more than one domain without extensive rewriting.

Yet important practical considerations do arise when writing programs to understand one aspect or another of natural language utterances. Where, for example, a theorist will characterize a parsing strategy according to its space and/or time requirements in attempting to analyze the worst possible input according to an arbitrary grammar strictly limited in expressive power, the researcher studying natural language processing can be justified in concerning himself more with issues of practical performance in parsing sentences encountered in language as humans actually use it, using a grammar expressed in a form convenient to the human linguist who is writing it.","This paper has two purposes. One is to report an evaluation of the performance of several parsing strategies in a real-world setting, pointing out practical problems in making the attempt, indicating which of the strategies is superior to the others in which situations, and most of all determining the reasons why the best strategy outclasses its competition in order to stimulate and direct the design of improvements. The other, more important purpose is to assist in establish-ing such evaluation as a meaningful and valuable en-terprise that contributes to the evolution of natural language processing from an art form into an empirical science. That is, our concern for parsing efficiency transcends the issue of mere practicality.","In this paper we detail our experimental setting and approach, present the results, discuss the implications of those results, and conclude with some remarks on what has been learned. Computational Complexity and Lexical Functional Grammar Robert C. Berwick AI Laboratory Massachusetts Institute of Technology 545 Technology Square Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139 Proc. 19th Annua/ ACL Conf., June 1981, 7-12.","Recently, a new theory of grammar has been advanced with the explicitly stated aim of meeting the dual demands of learnability and parsability -- the Lexical Functional Grammars (LFGs) of Bresnan. The theory of Lexical Functional Grammars is claimed to have all the descriptive merits of transformational grammar, but none of its computational unruliness. In LFG, there are no transformations (as classically described); the work formerly ascribed to transformations such as \"passive\" is shouldered by information stored in lexical entries associated with lexical items. The elimination of transformational power naturally gives rise to the hope that a lexically-based system would be computationally simpler than a transformational one.","The main result of this paper is to show that certain Lexical Functional Grammars can generate languages whose recognition time is very likely computationally intractable, at least according to our current understanding of what is or is not rapidly solvable. Briefly, the demonstration proceeds by showing how a problem that is widely conjectured to be computationally difficult -- namely, whether there exists an assignment of l's and O's (or \"T's and \"F's) to the literals of a Boolean formula in conjunctive normal form that makes the formula evaluate to \"1\" (or \"true\") -- can be re-expressed as the problem of recognizing whether a particular string is or is not a mem-American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 7, Number 3, July-September 1981 189 The FINITE STRING Newsletter Abstracts of Current Literature ber of the language generated by a certain lexical functional grammar.","This paper also discusses the relevance of this technical result for more down-to-earth computational linguistics."]},{"title":"Corepresentational Grammar and Parsing English Comparatives Karen Ryan Linguistics Department","paragraphs":["142 Klaeber Court University of Minnesota Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455 Proc. 19th Annual ACL Conf., June 1981, 13-18.","Marcus (1980) notes that the syntax of English comparative constructions is highly complex, and claims that both syntactic and semantic information must be available for them to be parsed. This paper argues that comparatives can be structurally analyzed on the basis of syntactic information alone via a strictly surface-based grammar. Such a grammar is given in Ryan (1981), based on the corepresentational model of Kac (1978). While the grammar does not define a parsing algorithm per se, it nonetheless expresses regularities of surface organization and its relationship to semantic interpretation that an adequate parser would be expected to incorporate. The central problem in parsing comparatives involves identifying the arguments of comparative predicates, and the relations borne by these arguments to such predicates. A corepresentational grammar is explicitly designed to assign predicate-argument structure to sentences on the basis of their surface syntactic organization.

Furthermore, comparison of the output speech from two complete systems may not always provide a good test of the performance of the corresponding component algorithms in the two systems, because radical performance differences in other components can obscure small differences in the components of interest.

People's spontaneous use of analogies provides insight into their implicit evaluation procedures for analogies. The treatment here, therefore, reveals aspects of analogical processing that are somewhat more difficult to see in an experimental context. The work involves explicit treatment of the discourse context in which analogy occurs. A major focus here is the formalization of the effects of analogy on discourse development. There is much rule-like behavior in this process, both in underlying thematic development of the discourse and in the surface linguistic forms used in this development. Both these forms of regular behavior are discussed in terms of a hierarchical structuring of a discourse into distinct, but related and linked, context spaces.

Rather than concentrating on how actions are performed, as is done in the problem-solving literature, it examines the set of conditions under which an action can be said to have occurred. In other words, if one is told that action A occurred, what can be inferred about the state of the world? In particular, if the representation can define such conditions, it must have good models of time, belief, and intention. This paper discusses these issues and suggests a formalism in which general actions and events can be defined. Throughout, the action of hiding a book from someone is used as a motivating example.

A search strategy dictates the order in which candidates are evaluated, but has no machinery for carrying out the evaluation.

A formalism which allows models to contain incomplete knowledge and to which knowledge can be added has been developed. Some Computational Aspects of Situation Semantics Jon Barwise Department of Philosophy Stanford University Stanford, California 94305 Proc. 19th Annual ACL Conf., June 1981, 109-111. 192 American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 7, Number 3, July-September 1981 The FINITE STRING Newsletter Abstracts of Current Literature","Can a realist model theory of natural language be computationally plausible? Or, to put it another way, is the view of linguistic meaning as a relation between expressions of natural language and things (objects, properties, etc.) in the world, as opposed to a relation between expressions and procedures in the head, consistent with a computational approach to understanding natural language? The model theorist must either claim that the answer is yes, or be willing to admit that humans transcend the computationally feasible in their use of language.","Until recently the only model theory of natural language that was at all well developed was Montague Grammar. Unfortunately, it was based on the primi-tive notion of \"possible world\" and so was not a realist theory, unless you are prepared to grant that all possible worlds are real. Montague Grammar is also computationally intractable, for reasons discussed in the paper.","John Perry and I have developed a somewhat different approach to the model theory of natural language, a theory we call \"Situation Semantics\". Since one of my own motivations in the early days of this project was to use the insights of generalized recursion theory to find a computationally plausible alternative to Montague Grammar, it seems fitting to give a progress report here. A Situation Semantics Approach to the Analysis of Speech Acts David Andreoff Evans Stanford University Stanford, California 94305 Proc. 19th Annual ACL Conf., June 1981, 113-116.","During the past two decades, much work in linguistics has focused on sentences as minimal units of communication, and the project of rigorously characteriz-ing the structure of sentences in natural language has met with some success. Not surprisingly, however, sentence grammars have contributed little to the analysis of discourse. Human discourse consists not just of words in sequences directed by a speaker to an addressee, used to represent situations and to reveal intentions. Only when the addressee has apprehended both these aspects of the message communicated can the message be interpreted. The analysis of discourse that emerges from Austin's work, grounded in a theory of action, takes this view as central, and the concept of the speech act follows naturally. This paper describes a situation semantics approach to the analysis of speech acts. Problems in Logical Form Robert C. Moore Artificial Intelligence Center SRI International 333 Ravenswood Avenue Menlo Park, California 94025 Proc. 19th Annual ACL Conf., June 1981, 117-124.","This paper surveys what we at SRI view as some of the key problems encountered in defining a system of representation for the logical forms of English sentences, and suggests possible approaches to their solution. We first look at some general issues related to the notion of logical form, and then discuss a number of problems associated with the way information involving certain key concepts is expressed in English. Although our main concern here is with theoretical issues rather than with system performance, this paper is not merely speculative. The DIALOGIC system currently under development in the SRI Artificial Intelligence Center parses English sentences and translates them into logical forms embodying many of the ideas presented here. A Case for Rule-Driven Semantic Processing Martha Palmer Computer and Information Science Moore School of Electrical Engineering D2 University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104 Proc. 19th Annual ACL Conf.. June 1981. 125-131.","The primary task of semantic processing is to provide an appropriate mapping between the syntactic constituents of a parsed sentence and the arguments of the semantic predicates implied by the verb. This is known as the Alignment Problem. Section One of this paper gives an overview of a generally accepted approach to semantic processing that goes through several levels of representation to achieve this mapping. Although somewhat inflexible and cumbersome, the different levels succeed in preserving the context sensitive information provided by verb semantics. Section Two presents the author's rule-driven approach which is more uniform and flexible yet still accommodates context sensitive constraints. This approach is based on general underlying principles for syntactic methods of introducing semantic arguments and has interesting implications for linguistic theories about case. These implications are discussed in Section Three. A system that implements this approach has been designed for and tested on pulley problem statements gathered from several physics text books.

Amsler Artificial Intelligence Center SRI International 333 Ravenswood Avenue Menlo Park, California 94025 Proc. 19th Annual ACL Conf., June 1981, 133-138.","The definition texts of a machine-readable pocket dictionary were analyzed to determine the disambiguated word sense of the kernel terms of each word sense being defined. The resultant sets of word pairs of defined and defining words were then computationally connected into two taxonomic semi-lattices (\"tangled hierarchies\") representing some 24,000 noun nodes and 11,000 verb nodes. The study of the nature of the \"topmost\" nodes in these hierarchies and the structure of the trees reveal information about the nature of the dictionary's organization of the language, the concept of semantic primitives and other aspects of lexical semantics. The data proves that the dictionary offers a fundamentally consistent description of word meaning and may provide the basis for future research and applications in computational linguistic systems. Interpreting Natural Language Database Updates S. Jerrold Kaplan and Jim Davidson Department of Computer Science Stanford University Stanford, California 94305 Proc. 19th Annual ACL Conf., June 1981, 139-141. Although the problem of"]},{"title":"querying","paragraphs":["a database in natural language has been studied extensively, there has been relatively little work on processing database"]},{"title":"updates","paragraphs":["expressed in natural language. To interpret update requests, several linguistic issues must be addressed that do not typically pose difficulties when dealing exclusively with queries. The primary difficulty with interpreting natural language updates is that there may be several ways in which a particular update can be performed in the underlying database. Many of these options, while literally correct and semantical-ly meaningful, may correspond to bizarre interpretations of the request. While human speakers would intuitively reject these unusual readings, a computer program may be unable to distinguish them from more appropriate ones. If carried out, they often have undesirable side effects on the database. Our approach to this problem is to generate a limited set of \"candidate\" updates, rank them according to a set of domain-independent heuristics that reflect general properties of \"reasonable\" updates, and either perform the update or present the highest ranked options to the user for selection. This paper briefly examines some of the linguistic problems encountered, and describes an implemented system that performs simple natural language database updates. Dynamic Strategy Selection in Flexible Parsing Jaime G. Carbonell and Philip J. Hayes Department of Computer Science Carnegie-Mellon University Schenley Park Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213 Proc. 19th Annual ACL Conf., June 1981, 143-147.","Robust natural language interpretation requires strong semantic domain models, \"fail-soft\" recovery heuristics, and very flexible control structures. Although single-strategy parsers have met with a measure of success, a multi-strategy approach is shown to provide a much higher degree of flexibility, redundancy, and ability to bring task-specific domain knowledge (in addition to general linguistic knowledge) to bear on both grammatical and ungrammatical input. A parsing algorithm is presented that integrates several different parsing strategies, with case-frame instantia-tion dominating. Each of these parsing strategies exploits different types of knowledge; and their combination provides a strong framework in which to process conjunctions, fragmentary input, and ungrammatical structures, as well as less exotic, grammatically correct input. Several specific heuristics for handling ungrammatical input are presented within this multi-strategy framework. A Construction-Specific Approach to Focused Interaction in Flexible Parsing Philip J. Hayes Department of Computer Science Carnegie-Mellon University Schenley Park Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213 Proc. 19th Annual ACL Conf., June 1981, 149-152.","A flexible parser can deal with input that deviates from its grammar, in addition to input that conforms to it. Ideally, such a parser will correct the deviant input; sometimes, it will be unable to correct it at all; at other times, correction will be possible, but only to within a range of ambiguous possibilities. This paper is concerned with such ambiguous situations, and with making it as easy as possible for the ambiguity to be resolved through consultation with the user. We show the importance of asking the user for clarification in as focused a way as possible. Focused interaction of this kind is facilitated by a construction-specific approach to flexible parsing, with specialized parsing techniques for each type of construction, and specialized ambiguity representations for each type of ambiguity that a particular construction can give rise to. A construction-specific approach also aids in task-specific language development by allowing a language definition 194 American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 7, Number 3, July-September 1981 The FINITE STRING Newsletter Abstracts of Current Literature that is natural in terms of the task domain to be interpreted directly without compilation into a uniform grammar formalism, thus greatly speeding the testing of changes to the language definition.

Our main goal was to produce a tutorial system for the English language; the intended users of the system are people with language delaying handicaps such as deafness, and people learning English as a foreign language. For these populations, extensive exposure to standard English constructions (negatives, questions, relativization, etc.) and their interactions is necessary. The purpose of the generator was to serve as a powerful resource for tutorial programs that need examples of particular constructions and/or related sentences to embed in exercises or examples for the student. The focus of the generator is thus not so much on what to express as on how to express it in acceptable English. The generator is composed of three major parts: a base component that produces base trees, a transformer that applies transformational rules to the trees to derive a surface tree, and a set of mechanisms to control the operation of the first two components. We discuss each of these components separately. Transportable Natural-Language Interfaces to Databases Gary G. Hendrix and William H. Lewis Artificial Intelligence Center SRI International 333 Ravenswood Avenue Menlo Park, California 94025 Proc. 19th AnnuM~ ACL Conf., June 1981, 159-162.","Over the last few years a number of application systems have been constructed that allow users to access databases by posing questions in natural languages, such as English. When used in the restricted domains for which they have been especially designed, these systems have achieved reasonably high levels of performance. Such systems as LADDER, PLANES, ROBOT, and REL require the encoding of knowledge about the domain of application in such constructs as database schemata, lexicons, pragmatic grammars, and the like. The creation of these data structures typically requires considerable effort on the part of a computer professional who has had special training in computational linguistics and the use of databases. Thus, the utility of these systems is severely limited by the high cost involved in developing an interface to any particular database.","This paper describes initial work on a methodology for creating natural-language processing capabilities for new domains without the need for intervention by specially trained experts. Our approach is to acquire logical schemata and lexical information through simple interactive dialogues with someone who is familiar with the form and content of the database, but unfamiliar with the technology of natural-language interfaces. To test our approach in an actual computer environment, we have developed a prototype system called TED (Transportable English Datamanager). As a result of our experience with TED, the NL group at SRI is now undertaking the development of a much more ambitious system based on the same philosophy. Chart Parsing and Rule Schemata in PSG Henry Thompson Department of Artificial Intelligence University of Edinburgh Hope Park Square Meadow Lane, Edinburgh EH8 9NW Proc. 19th AnnuM~ ACL Conf., June 1981, 167-172.","MCHART is a flexible, modular chart parsing framework I have been developing (in LISP) at Edinburgh, whose initial design characteristics were largely determined by pedagogical needs. PSG is a grammatical theory developed by Gerald Gazdar at Sussex, in collaboration with others in both the U.S. and Britain, most notably Ivan Sag, Geoff Pullum, and Ewan Klein. It is a notationally rich context free phrase structure grammar, incorporating meta-rules and rule schemata to capture generalizations.","In this paper I describe how I have used MCHART in beginning to construct a parser for grammars expressed in PSG, and how aspects of the chart parsing approach in general and MCHART in particular have made it easy to accommodate two significant aspects of PSG: rule schemata involving variables over categories, and compound category symbols (\"slash\" categories). To do this I briefly introduce the basic ideas of chart parsing, describe the salient aspects of MCHART, give an overview of PSG, and finally present the interesting aspects of the parser I am building for PSG using MCHART.

The generation process may be regarded as consisting of two major phases of computation; the first will determine what is to be said and how it is to be said, and the second will translate that message from an internal representation to English. Emphasis will be placed on the problems involved in the first component of generation.","The application for the generation of natural language is within a natural language interface to a database system. To date, the kinds of answers which can be generated by such systems are restricted to lists or tables of objects in the database. I am proposing generating responses to questions about the structure of the database. The kinds of responses that will be generated include descriptions of classes of objects in the database, differences between the classes, relations that hold between classes, information available in the database, and definitions of classes of objects, among others. A Technique for Managing the Lexicon in a Natural Language Interface to a Changing Data Base S. Jerrold Kaplan, Eric iays, and Aravind K. Joshi Computer and Information Science Moore School of Electrical Engineering D2 University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104 Technical Report MS-CIS-80-10, August 1979.","A difficulty in designing a Natural Language (NL) interface to a Data Base (DB) management system is insuring that DB updates do not obsolete the NL components. Of particular concern is the lexicon (the list of words that the system can process), mainly because NL queries can contain terms that appear as values in the DB, and hence are subject to change as the contents of the DB changes. For example, to process the question \"Does John Jones still work for the company?\", it is necessary to identify the string \"John Jones\" as a (potential) value in the \"EMPLOYEE-NAME\" field (assuming a suitable DB). If such names must appear in the lexicon for the system to process the query, then the lexicon will go out of date as the company's personnel shifts. Using the DB itself as an extension of the lexicon is equally problematic: the system will be unable to parse and provide a nega-tive answer to such a question if the name does not appear at all in the DB.","The approach suggested here is to infer a plausible field from the context of the query and semantic information about the domain that is implicitly encoded in the structure of the DB. This technique has been implemented in CO-OP, a NL DB query system that provides cooperative responses and operates with a typical CODASYL DB system. CO-OP treats the problem of selecting a plausible field as a special case of resolving semantic ambiguities. Examples drawn from the implementation are presented. Centered Logic: The Role of Entity Centered Sentence Representation in Natural Language Inferencing. Aravind K. Joshi and Steve Kuhn Computer and Information Science Moore School of Electrical Engineering D2 University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104 Technical Report MS-CIS-80-11, August 1979.","We will briefly describe the role of entity centered structure (ECS) of sentences in natural language infer-encing. The basic structure in discourse generally singles out an entity, to be called center, among all those which are the arguments of the main predicate. ECS makes n-ary predicates look like monadic ones by temporarily masking their structure, thereby affecting the relative ease with which certain inferences are made and information is retrieved. This short paper deals with a preliminary formulation of a system designed to capture these ideas and contains several examples of how some natural language inferences can be represented in the system. Formal properties of the system are under investigation.

In particular, cooperative responses have been considered dealing with the situation when the user's view and the system's view of the structure and/or content of the data base are disparate. Responses explaining the structure of the data base as well as responses which are implicit requests for monitoring states of dynamic data bases have also been discussed.

Joshi Computer and Information Science Moore School of Electrical Engineering D2 University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104 Technical Report MS-CIS-80-49, 1980.","Several results concerning phrase structure trees have been presented. These results show that phrase structure trees when viewed in certain ways have much more descriptive power than one would have thought. A brief account of local constraints on structural descriptions and an intuitive proof have been presented. The local constraints approach has been compared to some aspects of Gazdar's framework and that of Peters and Karttunen. Some results on skeletons (phrase structure trees without labels) have been presented also. It can be shown that phrase structure trees even when deprived of the labels retain in a certain sense all the structural information. This result has implications for grammatical inference procedures. Parasession on Topics in Interactive Discourse: Influence of the Problem Text Aravind K.

We will be particularly concerned with the case where cooperativeness involves both giving a truthful and informative response and \"squaring away\" the relevant mutual beliefs. In this context, we will suggest that the \"squaring away\" contribution of the interaction can be explained by a suitable modification of one of the maxims of cooperative conversation.","We also discuss a related topic dealing with excess (or surplus) information and how and when the system should assimilate this information, i.e., implicitly update itself without being explicitly told to do so. These considerations require that mutual beliefs should not be regarded just as a set of propositions but rather with some structure over them where the structuring of information itself is a mutual belief.

When intensional failures are detected, a form of corrective behavior is proposed to inform the user about possibly relevant data base structure that is related to the failure.

Together, they have the analysis and retrieval capabilities mentioned above. Frump analyzes news stories from the UPI wire for their conceptual content, and produces summaries of those stories. It sends summaries of stories about important people to CYRUS. CYRUS automatically adds those stories to its memory, and can then retrieve that information to answer questions posed to it in natural language.","This paper describes the problems involved in building such an intelligent system. It proposes solutions to some of those problems based on recent research in artificial intelligence and natural language processing, and describes the CyFr system, which implements those solutions.

Handling this kind of query requires using a discrimination tree, which breaks the space of possibilities down repeatedly, ultimately into manageable buckets. In a spatial system, a useful kind of retrieval is \"spiral search,\" in which the system searches the tree by starting from the \"best\" cell and gradually enlarging its attack.

Special problems arise when this program is applied to the domain of simple shaped objects; a shaped object can fall into more than one bucket, and a shaped object can have different lengths in different directions.

To rectify this, I have developed a first-order temporal logic, in which it is possible to name and prove things about facts, events, plans, and world histories. In particular, the logic provides analyses of causality, continuous change in quantities, the persistence of facts (the frame problem), and the relationship between tasks and actions.

A unified model of the understanding process can be defined using the distributed-computing viewpoint, provided some way can be found to integrate and control a collection of \"experts,\" each one associated with a certain kind of knowledge source. A technique is described, called hierarchical task management, for constructing computer language-processing systems comprising an arbitrary number of distinct, potentially distributed, processes. The technique is based upon the repeated activation and expansion of data structures called tasks, which define important components of the understanding process in terms of a controlled interaction among the experts. The tasks are main-tained on several \"agendas,\" and are manipulated by a uniform monitor called the task manager. The process of task management is illustrated in a multiprocess story understander called a distributable script applier mechanism (DSAM), which reads and summarizes newspaper stories about plane crashes.

For example, the ability to infer one's own goals is needed in an autonomous planning agent since it must deal with unexpected situations. However, together with meta-planning knowledge and the ability to project hypothetical futures, this feature enables the planner to detect and reason about complicated goal interactions, anticipate problems with proposed plans, and make choices in the face of competing alternatives.","This model has been developed in detail for the detection and resolution of goal conflicts. In doing so, we postulate several goal conflict resolution strategies, or meta-plans, called RE-PLAN, CHANGE-CIRCUMSTANCE, and SIMULATE-AND-SELECT. The structure and application of these meta-plans is explored in the context of both decision making and understanding the actions of other planners.

These suggest that a greater variety of stories could and should be made available to children. Higher-Level Features in Children's Stories: Rhetorical Structure and Conflict Cindy Steinberg and Bertram Bruce Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc. 50 aoulton Street Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138 BBN Report 18, October 1980, 25 pages.","Traditional surveys of children's literature have examined features such as text structure and topic, but have failed to take into account rhetorical elements such as author-reader distance, commentary, point of view, and insight into characters' minds. Similarly, they have glossed over aspects of character-to-character interaction such as responses to interpersonal conflict. These \"higher-level features\" of stories may be what makes stories interesting to read. They are also principal contributors to story complexity, and hence, to difficulty for beginning readers. With regard to both interestingness and complexity, it is important to come to a better understanding of these features.","To concretize our discussion, we first present two examples showing the importance of higher-level text features. Second, we sketch a theory of higher-level story features. Then, we briefly describe how we are applying our analysis to a selection of children's stories.

Strategies for Controlling Hypothesis Formation in Reading Bertram Bruce and Andee Rubin Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc. 50 Moulton Street Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138 BBIV Report 22, June 1981, 40 pages.","Reading is a process of forming and evaluating hypotheses to account for the data in a text. Because of its complexity, the task of reading requires strategies for controlling the proliferation of hypotheses. Four of these strategies, (a) jumping to conclusions, (b) maintaining inertia, (c) relying on background knowledge, and (d) working backwards from the goal, are generally effective, but they occasionally create reading problems, rather than alleviating them. Examples from protocols of readers reading a reading test passage are presented. These examples show both the effective use of the strategies and some problems that may arise from their use.

These results support the hypothesis that part of the difficulty children encounter in making the transition from beginning to skilled readings lies in an abrupt shift in text characteristics between lower and upper elementary school. Moreover, a comparison between school texts and popular trade books shows that the school texts may provide inadequate prepara-tion for the texts that skilled readers need to master. Thus, characteristics of the texts that children are expected to read may hinder rather than help in the at-tainment of educational goals.","The most promising approaches for such a pragmatics are: (1) conceptual dependency theory, in which language is a form of actions specified by goal-directed plans (e.g. Schank); (2) plan theory, in which the analysis of tasks and resources leads to the specification of a planned sequence of steps (e.g. Sacerdoti); (3) problem-solving theory, in which points or states in a problem space have to be connected by a successful pathway (e.g. Newell and Simon); and (4) procedural theory of discourse, in which language elements and systems are investigated with respect to how people utilize them in communication and processing.","The paper offers the framework of a natural language pragmatics along these lines and applies the resulting theory to a study of a scene from a stage play by Sidney Howard. It is shown that the actions and discourse actions of the scene are indeed generated by the characters' plans and goals. Processing Models for Children's Story Comprehension Robert de Beaugrande and Genevieve W. Miller English Department University of Florida Gainesville, Florida 32611 Poetics 9 (1980), 181-201.","It is argued that in abandoning trace-abstraction models of story comprehension in favor of schema-based ones, we have left some issues unresolved in regard to the treatment of bottom-up input. Using a real children's story employed in empiric tests, we review evidence that schemas undergo specification and modification via bottom-up input as the story is progressively read: a phenomenon describable as procedural attachment. There seems to be some trace-abstraction during comprehension but in a peripheral role and with unreliable or inconsistent results across a test population. We conclude that accuracy of recall is a less crucial question than the identification of strategies active during recall of both abstractive and constructive nature. The Pragmatics of Discourse Planning Robert-Alain de Beaugrande English Department University of Florida Gainesville, Florida 32611 Journal of Pragmatics 4 (1980), 15-42.","It is argued that the basic notions of natural language pragmatics cannot be the same as those of syntax and semantics as developed so far.

Linguistic Theory and Metatheory for a Science of Texts Robert De Beaugrande English Department University of Florida Gainesville, Florida 32611 Text 1, 2 (1981), 113-161.","This article explores the typical reactions which occur when an established science confronts a new object of inquiry, as we find when linguistic theory encounters the text. The usual discussions are not productive as long as the old \"paradigm\" is still accepted as the framework for achievement. The issues are therefore re-examined in terms of the metatheory of science (e.g. Sneed, Stegmtiller, Lakatos, Feyerabend, Hempel), and some general solutions are expounded for the problems of validating theories on the basis of empirical content. A paradigmatic example is then presented in order to show a possible role for logical linguistics in future theories: a computer grammar that parses text sentences into a progressive network and back again via theorem-proving, with further capacities for applying schemas, answering questions, and generating summaries. This example serves as an application of general design values and criteria for preferring and comparing alternative theories.

It is often hard to see which parts of a document are difficult to read or how to transform a wordy sentence into a more concise one. It is even harder to discover that one overuses a particular linguistic construct. The system of programs described here helps writers to evaluate documents and to produce better written and more readable prose. The system consists of programs to measure surface features of text that are important to good writing style as well as programs to do some of the tedious jobs of a copy editor. Some of the surface features measured are readability, sentence and word length, sentence type, word usage, and sentence openers. The copy editing programs find spelling errors, wordy phrases, bad diction, some punctuation errors, double words, and split infinitives.

The study of language is ubiquitous, with interactive systems increasingly supporting studies which previously might have been run in batch mode: the language scholar today is less reliant on mediating technical support. He can enter and query his data directly. He can, but need not, be a \"programmer,\" and can personally control the degree of complexity entailed by his studies, according to his own felt needs and goals. This freedom of inquiry should greatly aid interpretation and inference, since the scholar can more easily alter his methods and critical hypotheses. Interesting connections between language studies at large and the practice of data-base administration may be gleaned, and the growing concord between human-ism and technology further enhanced.

The KE system used is the SNePS semantic network processing system (Shapiro, 1979a).

The NL-system enables the NLU user-expert to: (a) input his rules about NLU and his lexicon into the semantic network knowledge base in natural language; (b) trace the inference processes, which utilize his rules, in natural language; and (c) employ an experimental rule-based generator to express knowledge built into the network via his NLU rules.

CLG partitions a system into a Conceptual Component (tasks and abstract concepts), a Communication Component (command language), and a Physical Component (display, keyboard, etc.). The components are further stratified into distinct Levels -- a Task Level, a Semantic Level, a Syntactic Level, and an Interaction Level -- each Level being a complete description of the system at its level of abstraction. Each Level's description contains procedures for accomplishing the tasks addressed by the system in terms of the actions available at that Level. That is, the system is described by progressive refine-ment. An extensive example, a small message-processing system, is described at all Levels in the CLG notation.","CLG is discussed from three points of view: The Linguistic View sees CLG as elaborating the structure of the system's user interface and of the communication between the user and the system. The principal goal of CLG in this view is to lay out the space of command language systems. The Psychological View sees CLG as describing the user's mental model of the system. The main concern in this view is with the psychological validity of the CLG description. The Design View sees CLG as a series of representations for specifying the design of a system. CLG proposes a topdown design process in which the conceptual model of the system is first specified and then a command language is created to communicate with it.

Since many such graphs must be constructed during the decoding phase of automatic speech recognition, it is valuable to be able to rapidly construct phonetic graphs for strings of words from phonetic graphs for the individual words in the string. However, because many phonological rules operate across word boundaries or require interword context, it is not possible to determine a unique phonetic graph for a word independent of the context in which it occurs.

This report focuses on the design of the program and answers questions concerning the relation between the technical part (implementation) and the linguistic considerations behind this computer program. It is argued that in the past a computer program performing this linguistic task was principally designed from the implementation point of view. This has led to a computer program which has a strong ad hoc kind of problem solving part of it. Therefore, this computer program turns out to be not adaptable to new situations and unforeseen mistakes. In this paper it is argued that the implementation of linguistic problem solving algorithms itself is a secondary problem and it is also argued that the definition of the task as well as the kind of system being created should be founded in intelligent linguistic considerations. \"Definitions\" and \"system\" are summarized with the notion \"design\" in this report. Thus, in the report, it is argued that the design of computer programs for linguistic operations should be principally based on intelligent linguistic considerations. This is the fundamental difference between other computer programs proposed in the past for the phonemicization of Dutch. It is argued that such a design is more prosperous as far as the results of the phonemicization program are concerned.
