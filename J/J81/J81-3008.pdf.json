The office traditionally is the focal point in any business organization for the receipt of quantities of incoming documents and for the generation of comparable amounts of outgoing text. In the future these two roles are expected to continue, but under much more trying circumstances: the volume of incoming and outgoing text -- hardcopy or electronic -- will increase, but the availability of people to perform the necessary processing will decrease. Secretaries will be asked to do more tasks for more people, using more complex equipment, and may very likely find this occupation less rewarding, leaving the office principals to fend more and more for themselves. This session will highlight new ways in which computers can assist principals in the intelligent processing of text, ranging from document abstracting to sophisticated critiquing of new material.","The session will be chaired by Lance Miller.

Office principals traditionally have had little difficulty in expressing what they wanted done to those who were to do it. Styles vary, but -- terse or expansive, formal or informal -- the method of communication was in some \"natural\" language. As the role of machines in the office increases, particularly that of computers, the problem of the communication language becomes more acute. The offhand request to \"Please pull the files on the Smith Account,\" once simply stated and forgotten until the documents appeared on the desk, now must be laboriously and precisely fashioned in a quite"]},{"title":"unnatural","paragraphs":["and unfamiliar tongue.
