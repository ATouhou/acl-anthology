More complex dictionaries are being designed for natural language processing systems capable of understanding and generating sophisticated texts.

To handle the wide variety of queries that wilF be posed to such a system, a flexible interface is necessary. Since English provides such flexibility and is already familiar to users, it is attractive as an interface language. This session will explore issues in both the design of flexible help systems and the use of English for communicating with such systems.

This special conference will focus on the use of computational linguistic techniques in solving real world problems, and will be limited to 300 participants. Original papers on the use of computational linguistic techniques are being solicited in the areas of: • data, information and knowledge management • training and education • language translation technology • speech recognition and synthesis technology The papers should discuss applications, evaluations, limitations, and general tools and techniques. Papers describing end-users' experience with these technologies are especially welcome. Six copies of an extended summary of five to eight pages, double spaced, should be sent by August 15, 1982 to:","Beatrice Oshika MD 72-27","System Development Corporation","2500 Colorado Avenue","Santa Monica, California 90406 It is important that the summary identify distinctive aspects of the work and clearly indicate to what extent the work is complete and has been implemented.","Summaries will be reviewed by the Conference Committee. Notification of acceptance of papers will be sent by September 15, 1982. For inclusion in the Conference Proceedings, final versions of papers must be received by November 15, 1982. Authors of accepted papers will be expected to sign a copyright release form. Limited travel funds for authors will be available.","Facilities for product and system demonstrations will be available, including videotape equipment. Short papers describing planned demonstrations and types of equipment required should be submitted by November 15, 1982. Additionally, tutorials and panel sessions are planned.","The Conference Committee consists of: Iris Kameny,"]},{"title":"System Development Corporation","paragraphs":["(General Chair), Beatrice Oshika,"]},{"title":"System Development Corporation","paragraphs":["(Program Chair), Don Walker,"]},{"title":"SRI International","paragraphs":["(Secretary-Treasurer), Christine Montgomery,"]},{"title":"Operating System Division, Logicon,","paragraphs":["Ray Perrault,"]},{"title":"University of Toronto,","paragraphs":["Jane Robinson,"]},{"title":"SR1 International,","paragraphs":["and Norm Sondheimer,"]},{"title":"Sperry Univac.
