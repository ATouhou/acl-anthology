All of the ACL sessions will be held on Monday, December 28. Two sessions of contributed papers will be presented, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, and an evening panel session will complete the offering of ACL/LSA sessions.","The program committee for these sessions was cochaired by D. Terence Langendoen, Brooklyn College and CUNY Graduate Center and Stanley Petrick, 1BM Thomas J. Watson Research Center. The members of the committee were Lance Miller, IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, John Moyne, Queens College and CUNY Graduate Center, and Naomi Sager, NYU Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.

Increased participation by industry -- including banking, manufacturing and insurance -- is expected at the conference. A wide range of equipment will be exhibited.","The two ACL-sponsored, 90-minute panel discussions are being organized by Lance Miller, IBM Research. They will address automated natural language processing in the office and the impact which such processing has on user interface, usability, and function.
