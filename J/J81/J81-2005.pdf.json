The basic problem then concerns what he calls \"processives.\" These he analyzes more precisely, chiefly with examples from Gothic but also with reference to Greek and English, in a treatment too detailed for presentation in the space allotted here. Since, however, the analysis of verbs in a grammar is of fundamental importance, especially in computational linguistics and artificial intelligence with their heavy reliance on case theory, Lloyd's article will repay careful study by readers of this journal. His proposed longer work following the \"prolegomena\" may also be kept in mind.","Many other articles not mentioned here are of interest, also, for specialists in computational linguistics.

Besides testing the completeness and accuracy of his formalizations, a programmed phonology would be of no little interest in presenting forms in the scantily attested early period of German. The availability in English of an article \"On some linguistic methods\" (521-546) onviews of Soviet scholarship by a highly regarded scholar, G.S. Slur, illustrates a further reason for readers of this journal not to disregard this volume. One may disagree with some of S~ur's statements, for example, his \"dissatisfaction with typology, whose chief aim is classification\" (530); actually, typological study of syntax has provided some of the best means for insights into the development of language and for explanations, especially when one moves beyond characteristics like adjective:noun and genitive:noun, or preposi-tion:postposition structures. Yet this and many other articles raise important questions, in a handsome tribute. In lauding a historical linguist, a highly appropriate conclusion is an article on views of a major linguist concerning the enduring problem of deep and surface structure: \"Quomodo superficiei grammaticae nexus sensusque profundior in Jespersenii Syntaxi analytica dicta tractentur\" (601-615) by Ladislaus Zgusta."]},{"title":"Win fred P.

The evaluations that have been done have been unsystematic and incomplete. This has led to uncertainty and confusion over the accomplishments of natural language processing research.","The lack of evaluation can be primarily attributed to the difficulty of the problem. The desired behavior of natural language processors has not been clearly specified. Partial progress toward the eventual goals for natural language processors has not been delineat-ed, much less measured.","This thesis attempts to clarify some of the difficulties behind evaluating the performance of natural language processors. It also proposes an evaluation method that is designed to be systematic and thorough. The method relies on considering a natural language processor from three viewpoints in the light of several taxonomies of issues relevant to natural language processing. Finally, an evaluation is described of PLANES, a natural language database query system. Abstracts of Current Literature The State-of-the-Art in Natural Language Understanding David L.
