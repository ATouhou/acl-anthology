A Note from the Editor: With this issue, our name has changed from AMERICAN ,JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS to COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS. While name changes are always difficult for all involved - we spent a year deciding on the new name - the greatest problems are faced by libraries, which now have to recatalogue the journal and create schemes for retaining the continuity of the volumes through the name change. Even with all these difficulties, however, it was felt that a name change was long overdue. The ACL is an international organization, yet the journal retained a name that reflected its origins but was misleading.","I am pleased that the journal is approaching the point of regular, on-time publication. The goal set out at last year's ACL meeting was to have completed volume 9, which was then not begun, by the next ACL meeting. My secret hope was that we could do better than that, and have the the first issue of volume 10, this issue, completed before the meeting as well. (I won't divulge what my secret fears were!) So, we came close to the more ambitious goal. This issue will be at the printers while COLING 84 is in progress.","Looking ahead, the goal for the next year is to have the journal on schedule by the 1985 ACL meeting. COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS still can offer rapid publication of your papers while our backlog remains low as a result of our increased publication schedule. A paper submitted in the summer of '84 that was accepted without revision could appear in print in the spring of 1985. James Allen, Editor A Note from the A CL Secretary-Treasurer: I will be leaving SRI International (after 13 years) to join Bell Communications Research, a new company formed to serve the seven regional telephone operating companies in the same capacity that Bell Laboratories has served AT&T. The move will take place at the end of July. Future communications should be directed to me as indicated below. I recognize that this change will create difficulties; so please accept my apologies for the inconveniences that will inevitably result. Donald E.

The full first name and initial of each author should be provided, followed by the corresponding institutions and complete mailing addresses. Manuscripts must be submitted in English.","The paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. It should state the objectives of the work, summarize the results, and give the principle conclusions and recommendations. It is preferable that the abstract not be in the first person, and it should not contain any mathematical notation or cite references. Work planned but not completed should not appear. Since the abstract will be used to select appropriate referees, it is essential to make it as informative as possible.","References should be listed alphabetically by author at the end of the paper according to the following style, where the naming convention is 'Surname, Firstname Initial.' and multiple authors are separated by semicolons, the last one being preceded by \"and\": Article in journal: Name. Year. Title (in initial capitals). Periodical-name (identified by underlining or italics) Volume(Issue-number): page#-page#.

Alternatively, the complete reference can be enclosed in parentheses, for example \"The system EZPARSE (Smith and Jones 1963) ...\". continued overleaf Footnotes should be avoided as much as possible. Whenever it does not impede the logic or readability of the paper, footnote material should be integrated into the text. When necessary, they should be numbered consecutively from the beginning of the article and appear at the bottom of the page on which they are referenced. Notation should be selected so as to simplify the phototypesetting process. Also, figures should be devised with consideration for whether they would require one column or two columns in the text. All figures in the final manuscript will be the author's responsibility. For initial submission of papers for refereeing, the figures should be integrated into the text as much as possible, rather than being inserted at the end of the document. Original line drawings must be drawn in black ink on white paper; the lines should be heavy enough to reproduce well. Photographs should be in black and white on glossy paper. Computer printout is not acceptable for figures; any such copy should be redone in a comparable type font. CL is interested in esploring the use of electronic submission for the final manuscript, for those able to produce and transmit copy in that form. We are prepared to handle both tape and network transmissions. For such a submission, it is essential to reduce the problems entailed in introducing format commands. The easiest situation for our Production Editor at present is to eliminate all such commands, separating sections that are handled differently by blank lines. It is, of course, essential to accompany the electronic transmission with a graphic version that indicates the preferred format. It should be recognized that deviations from personal preferences may occur in the interest of ensuring a more consistent style for our journal. Electronic submissions should be sent directly to the Production Editor at the mailing or net addresses provided on the inside front cover."]}]}
