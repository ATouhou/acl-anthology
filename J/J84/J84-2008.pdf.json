Universiteitsplein 1 B-2610 Wilrijk, BELGIUM A Decade Outlook on Research Opportunities in the Behavioral and Social Sciences The Committee on Basic Research in the Behavioral and Social Sciences is a National Research Council unit established in 1980 to assess and improve the vitality of research in behavioral and social sciences. The first Committee report, Behavioral and Social Science Research: A National Resource (1982), was a general statement of the scientific value, significance, and social utility of behavioral and social science research. A second Committee report, currently in preparation, derives from a 1983 symposium on \"Knowledge in Social and Behavioral Science: Discoveries and Trends over Fifty Years\".","These two Committee projects concentrated on the past record and present dimensions of behavioral and social science. There is now a national commitment to expand the future scientific and technological base. Promising new research directions must be canvassed, resources needed to foster prospective advances must be defined and evaluated, and priorities for additional scientific research spending must be developed and rigorously scrutinized. These processes are now occurring in nearly every major branch of science.","The Committee has therefore agreed to undertake a Decade Outlook on Research Opportunities in the Behavioral and Social Sciences, with the formal participation of the National Research Council's Commission on Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education, the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, and the Social Science Research Council. This project, supported by the National Science Foundation, the Russell Sage Foundation, and other sponsors, will be completed in 1986.","The Decade Outlook will study scientific frontiers, leading research questions, and new resources needed over the next decade, roughly 1986-1995, for rapid progress on fundamental problems in the behavioral and social sciences. The final report is to contain recommendations for research resources, facilities, and programs that may provide a high level of returns to fundamental knowledge. Research areas and new resource needs will be identified by the Committee with substantial advice from many distinguished senior level, mid-career, and promising younger scientists.","The Committee invites your ideas on leading research questions for the next ten years and on new resources","needed to enable rapid progress to be made on funda-","mental problems in the behavioral and social sciences.","Responses and inquiries should be addressed to: Committee on Basic Research in the Behavioral","and Social Sciences National Research Council 2101 Constitution Avenue, NW Washington, D.C. 20418 Announcements","Logic, Language, and Computation Meetings 8-20 July 1985: Stanford University The Association for Symbolic Logic (ASL) and the Center for the Study of Language and Information (CSLI) are planning'a summer school and a meeting July 8-20, 1985, at Stanford University.
