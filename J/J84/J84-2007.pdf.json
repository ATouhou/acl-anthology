Various disciplines that make use of pragmatic concepts and that can directly contribute to our understanding of human communication exist side by side, with different alleged aims and purposes, methodologies, and terminologies. It is the aim of this conference to contribute to the theoretical coherence needed to improve the capability and applicability of research results. Structure During each of the five morning sessions two lectures will be delivered by representatives of different disciplines dealing with pragmatic aspects of language. To promote discussion, texts will be distributed in advance. The tentative list of lecturers includes: H. Clark,"]},{"title":"Stanford","paragraphs":["U. Eco,"]},{"title":"Bologna","paragraphs":["P.
