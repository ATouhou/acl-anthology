{"sections":[{"title":"The FINITE STRING Newsletter Meeting Minutes Minutes of the 1983 European Chapter General Meeting","paragraphs":["Following are the minutes of the first ACL European Chapter General Meeting, held 1 September 1983 in Pisa, Italy. In the absence of Eva Haji~ov~i, the Chairperson of the Chapter, Harry Somers, the Chapter Secretary, presided.","On the programme and local arrangements for this inaugural chapter meeting, Giacomo Ferrari reported that 64 papers had been submitted, each of which had been sent to three referees. The 32 papers in the final programme had then been selected by the programme committee consisting of Ferrari (in the chair), Joost Breuker, Gerald Gazdar, Margaret King, Winfred Lenders, Petr Sgall, and Antonio Zampolli, who had met in two groups in Prague and in Geneva. The number of participants was given as just over 100, which was very encouraging given the relatively short time span since the announcement of the meeting.","In his Secretary's report, Harry Somers pointed out that the Chapter was now just one year old, and in this time membership had increased by 162 (not in-cluding new members at the Meeting), compared with 25 new European members in the previous year, an increase of 648 percent. Of these new members, 45 were East Europeans taking advantage of the International Fund, who were welcomed most cordially. Overall, European membership had increased by an impressive 83 percent.","Mike Rosner presented his Treasurer's report, in which he drew attention to the fact that members were only now being asked to pay their 1983 dues because of the delays in production of the Journal. He reminded members that payment by cheque in any Western currency was acceptable.","On behalf of the Nominations Committee, Ferrari announced that Benny Brodda had been named to replace Yorick Wilks on the Advisory Committee, as Yorick would be spending the next year on leave in Australia and Costa Rico. Ferrari expressed the Chapter's gratitude for Yorick's contribution to ACL activities in Europe, especially his invaluable help in setting up the Chapter over the last two years. All the other offices were recommended for reelection. With this announcement, the election procedure was instigated as described in the Chapter's constitution.","Don Walker reported on activities in the Central Administration. He stated that the possibility of forming an East Asian Chapter for members in the Far East and Australasia was being considered. He then reminded members of the existence of the International Fund, the main purpose of which was to provide funds for memberships, purchase of proceedings, and, if resources permitted, grants for attendance at meetings for speakers, for whom currency restrictions made such payments difficult. In answer to a question from the floor concerning the possibility of using the Fund to help such members buy relevant books for their libraries, Walker pointed out that the priority use of the Fund was to provide as many people as possible access to the AJCL via membership in the Association.","With regard to the Journal, Walker stated that the first issue of Volume 8 (1983) was currently in preparation and due for mailing at the end of September. From 1984 onwards the Journal would be titled simply"]},{"title":"Computational Linguistics, reflecting the more inter-","paragraphs":["national nature of the Association.

A copy of the Proceedings was included in the Conference fees, and all those in attendance would receive one in due course.","On the subject of Future Meetings of the Chapter, Somers reported on a proposal of Gerald Gazdar to simplify and standardise the organisation of refereeing and selection of papers. This would be considered at the appropriate time. It was agreed that future Chapter meetings were desirable and there was some discussion of possible locations and dates. It was agreed that conflict with other relevant conferences m especially COLING m should be avoided, and the meeting eventually settled on a principle of convening every other Spring starting in 1985. Possible locations for the next meeting include Manchester, Geneva, Paris, and Copenhagen; they will be investigated by the Advisory Committee. Walker reminded members that ACL was jointly sponsoring the forthcoming COLING meeting at Stanford University, Stanford, California, in July of 1984, and that the deadline for submission of extended abstracts was January.","The question of Associate Membership in the ACL for members of sister organisations was introduced by Hubert Lehmann, with particular reference to the German organisation LDV. It was agreed that the two organisations did not wish to appear to be in competition with each other, and that the members of both would benefit from general cooperation. This might take the form of an exchange of information, with the possibility of a joint conference some time in the future. It was felt that the question of joint membership as such was, for financial reasons, probably not desirable.

Walker pointed out that constitutionally the meeting could not take a binding vote on such an issue. He questioned whether the ACL should take a position on this kind of issue, and recommended that members should do so as individuals if they wished. Other members felt that this particular issue was not relevant to computational linguistics as such. It was also felt by some that it was undesirable for the ACL to be seen to be overtly political, especially as this might make it even more difficult for members from certain countries to participate in its activities. The motion was ruled out of order, and it was agreed that those interested would met to discuss the matter as individuals, but that the Association would take no official stand."]},{"title":"Harry Somers","paragraphs":["Chapter Secretary"]},{"title":"ACL INTERNATIONAL FUND","paragraphs":["At its Executive Committee meeting in Toronto on 19 June 1982, the ACL established the \"ACL International Fund.\" Its primary purpose is to make ACL memberships and publications available to colleagues who have difficulties in using their national currencies for international transactions. During 1982 and 1983, the Fund received $2533.25 in contributions; expenses amounted to approximately $2000. Since we are in the process of expanding the number of members in this category, we are very much in need of additional contributions. The list that follows identifies people who contributed during 1982 and 1983. It is presented here both to express our appreciation and to encourage members to continue to support the fund. If you have contributed during this period and your name is not listed, please contact the Secretary-Treasurer and accept his apologies for the omission. While we would welcome larger contributions, small ones can accumulate very rapidly. We anticipate serving about 100 International Fund members by the end of the year. If we provide memberships to all and proceedings to at least the major institutions and laboratories, the cost will be approximately $2000. Contributions of $4 each from 500 of our members would provide that amount. Please contribute what you can. The dues statement provides a place for doing that, but you can send a check to the Secretary-Treasurer made out to the ACL International Fund at any time. His address is located on the back cover."]},{"title":"1982-1983 CONTRIBUTORS","paragraphs":["$100 or more: James Cretsos, Aravind Joshi, Beatrice Oshika, Norm Sondheimer, Don Walker.","$50-$100: Barbara Grosz, Hiroshi Matsuoka, Barbara Partee, George Peck, Jane Robinson, Karen Sparck Jones, Fred and Bozena Thompson.","$25-$50: Lyn Bates, Veronica Bonebrake, Paul Chapin, Thaddeus Floryan, Philip Gleason, George Heidorn, Graeme Hirst, Jerry Kaplan, Richard Kittredge, Johanna Nichols, Paul Orgren, Ray Perrault, Stan Petrick, Hood Roberts, Naomi Sager, Jonathan Slocum, Brian Smith, Stuart Shapiro, Henry Thompson, Ralph Weischedel, Lotfi Zadeh.","$10-$25: R.
