However, for two of those papers the authors were asked to present tutorials: David Israel gave one on situation semantics, and Mark Liberman did one on speech analysis. As another experiment, Ray Perrault organized a panel discussion on computational complexity around a session of submitted papers, and prepared a tutorial to introduce them.

The success of the Conference on Applied Natural Language, which was held in Santa Monica in February, and the continuing distribution of surpluses from the National Computer Conferences by AFIPS contribute to the good financial picture. However, he noted that no expenses for the 1983 AJCL volume have yet been incurred. (A detailed report follows these Minutes.)","Walker presented the latest membership figures; personal memberships continue to rise, increasing 25 percent between 1981 and 1982.
