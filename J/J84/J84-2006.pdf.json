In a world where the control of growing amounts of information has great importance for every social group, there is a fundamental necessity to enhance research and realization efforts in this domain.","This is the reason why the Centre de Hautes Etudes Internationale d'Informatique Documentaire has for several years undertaken numerous actions for an improved knowledge of the needs in the area, to facilitate and promote meetings among research groups throughout the world, and also in the industrial sector.","With the effective participation and support of high-level scientific personalities, this Conference will allow an understanding of the advancement of research in the field, and an analysis of usefulness of the new systems.

Theoretical Approaches to Natural Language Understanding is intended to bring together active researchers in Computational Linguistics, Artificial Intelligence, Linguistics, Philosophy, and Cognitive Science to discuss/hear invited talks, papers, and positions relating to some of the \"hot\" issues regarding the current state of natural language understanding. The three topics chosen for discussion are intended to form the focus for contributions to Theoretical Approaches to Natural Language Understanding. The three topics include aspects of grammars, aspects of semantics/pragmatics, and knowledge representation. Each of the three topics will consider current methodologies: for grammars - theoretical developments, especially generalised phrase structure grammars and logic-based meta-grammars; for semantics - situational semantics and Montague semantics; for knowledge representation - logical systems (temporal logics, etc.) and special purpose inference systems.","Papers are solicited on topics in any of the areas mentioned above. You are invited to submit four copies of a paper (double-spaced, maximum 4000 words) to the program chairman before 12 January 1985. Authors will be notified of acceptances by 27 February 1985. Accepted papers, typed on special forms, will be due 30 March 1985 and should be sent to the program chairman.","To make refereeing possible, it is important that the abstract summarise the novel ideas, contain enough information about the scope of the work, and include comparisons to the relevant literature.","Accepted papers will appear in the Proceedings; those papers so recommended by the reviewers will be considered for inclusion in a special issue of Computational Intelligence, an international artificial intelligence journal published by the National Research Council of Canada.","Presentation of papers at the Workshop will be at the discretion of the program/organising committee in order to maintain the focus and workshop flavour of this meeting.","Information concerning local arrangements will be available from the general chairman.

Its scope is intended to encompass the contents of an Applied Natural Language Processing Conference as well as one on Theoretical Issues in Natural Language Processing.
