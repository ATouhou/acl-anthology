Bouwhuis (editors)","paragraphs":["(Defence and Civil Institute of Environmental Medicine, Toronto, L1MSI-CNRS, Orsay, and IPO, Eindhoven) Amsterdam: John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2000, xviii+522 pp; hardbound, ISBN 90-272-2190-1 and 1-55619-762-4, Dfl 250.00, $125.00 That the terms \"dialogue\" (e.g., between humans) and \"interaction\" (e.g., between user and computer) can be used interchangeably is implicitly assumed throughout this collection of papers edited by Taylor, N6el, and Bouwhuis. That a dialogue typically involves the use of multiple \"modes\" of communication and that it has its own internal structure are of obvious import to those who work in application domains that require the collaboration of human users either with software systems or with one another through the use of mediating software systems. This collection, therefore, will be of interest to researchers who want to know about early attempts to apply the metaphor of multimodal human-human communication to collaborative domains such as these.","This volume is a long-delayed follow-up publication from a workshop held under the same title in Aquafredda di Maratea, Italy, in 1991.1 The material in this volume is clearly not recent--the editors report that the authors were requested to bring the papers up to date, but since practically all of the works referenced by the papers in this volume predate 1994, it seems that their request was not made in the years prior to publication. This is also reflected in the absence of the notion of a communicative agent (although, due to its now-rampant overuse, some might welcome this) and the lack of reference to the work on embodied agents that emerged in the last decade and is clearly relevant (for exam-1 When referenced in the research literature, the workshop is often confusingly referred to as the \"Second Venaco Workshop,\" after the first workshop held in Venaco, Corsica, in 1989; the follow-up publication from that workshop is Taylor, N6el, and Bouwhuis (1989). pie, Cassell et al. [19941 and much research since then). However, the publication of this volume does make previously difficult-to-find material more readily available and does provide an interesting historical context for contemporary research. The application of the metaphor of human-human communication to human-computer interaction is hardly new--descriptions and discussions predate the 1980s (e.g., Nickerson 1977)--but it does invoke a certain amount of theoretical baggage. Those papers in this volume that contain discussions that address (however obliquely) such issues are perhaps of more enduring interest than those that describe implementations. Of particular interest are attempts to define the notions of a mode, a modality, and a medium of communication--such as those by Maybury and Lee, Teil and Beluk, and Taylor and Waugh. Such terms are used to distinguish among \"manners\" or \"ways\" of communicating, and part of the difficulty in defining them (evidenced in this volume by a lack of consensus) is that their meanings are indexical--their definitions depend upon an underlying theory (or at least model) of communication. One such underlying theory of choice in this volume is Layered Protocol Theory, which is distinctly information-theoretic in flavor (unforttmately, the description of this theory does not appear until chapter 25 of the 28 chapters). Another possible underlying theory, which is not explicitly adopted here, is proposed by Allwood in the introductory material (and is described in more detail in Allwood [1995]). Speech Act Theory receives scant attention.","Only a subset of the papers take on the topic of dialogue structure that is suggested by the title The Structure of Multimodal Dialogue II. Moreover, the editors' caveat that the collection is intended to inspire the interaction of cross-disciplinary ideas cannot excuse the poor quality of certain papers. This volume is certainly not a must-have, but some readers might find certain papers a complement to an existing collection of research literature concerned with the use of multiple modes of communication in collaborative domains.--Melanie A.

In this volume, it is presented as the very inter-section point of Mathematics, Computer Science, Linguistics, and Biology. This book is a collection of papers which closely examines classical topics in computer science inspired by formal languages, as well as showing new concepts and problems motivated in linguistics and biology. The papers are organized into four sections: Grammars and Grammar Systems, Automata, Languages and Combinatorics, and Models of Molecular Computing. They clearly prove the power, wealth, and vitality of the theory nowadays and sketch some trends for its future development. The volume is intended for an audience of computer scientists, computational linguists, theoretical biologists, and any other people interested in dealing with the problems and challenges of interdisciplinarity.\"-- From the publisher's announcement, with minor corrections","\"Our volume has two goals. One is to present some recent results in active areas of the three domains that converge in the new field.

All the papers are contributed by Gheorghe P~un's collaborators, colleagues, friends, and students in the five continents, who wanted to show in this way their recognition to him for his tremendous work.

The research described here involves the representation of technical computer concepts, but also the representation of how users conceptualize such concepts. These systems range from menu-based to natural language interfaces, some providing active help, intervening when they believe the user to have misconceptions, and some based on empirical studies of what users actually do while using UNIX. Further papers investigate planning and knowledge representation where the focus is on discovering what the user wants to do, and figuring out a way to do it as well as representing the knowledge needed to do so. There is a focus on natural language dialogue where consultation systems can become active, incorporating user modeling, natural language generation, and plan recognition, modeling metaphors and users' mistaken beliefs.","The articles are derived from papers originally presented at a workshop entitled \"Knowledge Representation in the UNIX Help Domain,\" organized by Peter Norvig, Wolfgang Wahlster, and Robert Wilensky at the University of California, Berkeley, USA, in December 1987.
