The paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must be submitted in English. Submissions may be made in any of the following categories: PAPER: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in computational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The length of a paper depends on its content, but we suggest that manuscripts be limited to forty double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of twelve journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed, being read by at least two members of the editorial board and usually by an additional expert in the particular subject area.","The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the author certifies the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publication to another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Editor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the case of a \"work for hire\", by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978 U.S. Copyright law. TECHNICAL CORRESPONDENCE: This category includes short articles reporting preliminary results of some project in progress, or the results of other studies of interest to the readership. Technical correspondences should not generally exceed eight double-spaced pages. Each technical correspondence is reviewed by at least two members of the editorial board before acceptance. LETI'ERS TO THE EDITOR: This includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these contributions for inclusion. Five copies of papers, technical correspondences, and letters should be sent to the Editor: James F. Allen, CL Editor Department of Computer Science The University of Rochester Rochester, NY 14627 arpanet: ACL@ROCHESTER.ARPA Anyone interested in reviewing a book, or in suggesting a book for review, should contact the Book Review Editor; publishers may also submit copies of books for review directly to the Book Review Editor: Graeme Hirst, CL Book Review Editor Department of Computer Science University of Toronto Toronto, CANADA M5S 1A4 arpanet: GH@TORONTO.CSNET The Finite String Editor should receive (a) copies of technical reports and reprints of paper s published elsewhere - or at least citation information and abstracts of such items and of books and monographs; (b) summaries of research in progress - of particular interest would be perspectives on the activities at a particular institution; (c) announcements of meetings of potential interest to the membership; and (d) personal notes (e.g., honors, moving, changes in status). Two copies of submissions should be sent to the Finite String Editor: Ralph Weischedel, Finite String Editor Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc. 10 Moulton Street Cambridge, MA 02238 arpanet: WEISCHEDEL@BBNG Fuller instructions about the format of submissions can be found in the first issue of each volume.

The full first name and initial of each author should be provided, followed by the corresponding institutions and complete mailing addresses. Manuscripts must be submitted in English.","The paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. It should state the objectives of the work, summarize the results, and give the principle conclusions and recommendations. It is preferable that the abstract not be in the first person, and it should not contain any mathematical notation or cite references. Work planned but not completed should not appear. Since the abstract will be used to select appropriate referees, it is essential to make it as informative as possible.","References should be listed alphabetically by author at the end of the paper according to the following style, where the naming convention is 'Surname, Firstname Initial.' and multiple authors are separated by semicolons, the last one being preceded by \"and\": Article in journal: Name.

Alternatively, the complete reference can be enclosed in parentheses, for example \"The system EZPARSE (Smith and Jones 1963) ...\".","Footnotes should be avoided as much as possible. Whenever it does not impede the logic or readability of the paper, footnote material should be integrated into the text. When necessary, they should be numbered consecutively from the beginning of the article and appear at the bottom of the page on which they are referenced.","Notation should be selected so as to simplify the phototypesetting process. Also, figures should be devised with consideration for whether they would require one column or two columns in the text. All figures in the final manuscript will be the author's responsibility. For initial submission of papers for refereeing, the figures should be integrated into the text as much as possible, rather than being inserted at the end of the document. Original line drawings must be drawn in black ink on white paper; the lines should be heavy enough to reproduce well. Photographs should be in black and white on glossy paper. Computer printout is nat acceptable for figures; any such copy should be redone in a comparable type font.","CL is interested in exploring the use of electronic submission for the final manuscript, for those able to produce and transmit copy in that form. We are prepared to handle both tape and network transmissions. For such a submission, it is essential to reduce the problems entailed in introducing format commands. The easiest situation for our Production Editor at present is to eliminate all such commands, separating sections that are handled differently by blank lines. It is, of course, essential to accompany the electronic transmission with a graphic version that indicates the preferred format. It should be recognized that deviations from personal preferences may occur in the interest of ensuring a more consistent style for our journal (see below). Electronic submissions should be sent directly to the Production Editor at the mailing or net addresses provided on the inside front cover.","In order to have consistant handling of the various text elements in articles appearing in Computational Linguistics, the following conventions will be used. Please mark your manuscript or copy of your paper accordingly. Note that punctuation marks will follow closing quotation marks unless the punctuation mark is a part of the quoted material.","Italics • emphasis","We want to determine just why this happens. • words or sentences used within the text","For example, persuade controls the subject of its complement, as in We persuaded John to","leave. • foreign words or phrases not in common use in English","One would italicize pieta but not per se. • book titles","as described in Chomsky's Aspects of the Theory of Syntax.","Indicate words to be italicized by underscorin~ them if they are not already italicized in the","copy you submit. Boldface","• the first occurrence of a term","The agreement predicates are defined solely over unordered sets of features. Authors must indicate when they want boldface by drawing a wavy line beneath the word(s) to be highlighted.","Double quotes ( .... ) • quotations (citations) within the text","He asserted that \"no man is an island\". • a coining or a special use of a word or phrase","The word \"fractal\" suggests something that is fractured.","Single quotes (' ') • the definition of a phrase or a foreign word/sentence","One usually defines etre as 'to be'."]}]}
