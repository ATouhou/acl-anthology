However, throughout his life he was a continuous source of new ideas and new projects and a powerful presence nationally and internationally in the field of machine translation. That his influence was not just local is illustrated by the EUROTRA project, the inception of which owes much to his efforts. Over the last five years he was instrumental in establishing, in both Malaysia and Thailand, research groups that are developing machine translation systems for the indigenous languages. In fact, it was in Penang that the leukemia, which claimed his life, resulted in hospitalization. He was transferred to Paris and seemed on the road to recovery when lung complications led to his death.","From 1969 to 1984 Professor Vauquois chaired the International Committee on Computational Linguistics, the organizing body for the COLING conferences. I first met him at the 1967 Conference, not yet called COLING. It was an exciting meeting, and a significant part of that excitement was contributed by his enthusiasm and his organizational skills. However, equally well conveyed was his personal charm and his sense of humor. Throughout his life, he used these traits, coupled of course with his intellectual competence, in the service not only of computational linguistics and machine translation, but of scientific research more generally.

Papers presenting original research on theoretical and applied aspects of lexicology are being sought. The Centre is interested in research on large-text files and, in particular, in the common concerns of those who are studying lexical knowledge bases. Typical but not exclusive topics include: • Computational Lexicology • Lexicography • Syntactic and Semantic Analysis • Natural Language Processing • Computational Linguistics • Knowledge Bases • Use of Machine-Readable Dictionaries and Reference Works • Structure/Management of Lexical Databases","All submissions will be fully refereed by the program committee.

A working draft of the paper, not to exceed 15 pages, for inclusion in the conference proceedings will be due by 30 September 1986. Conference proceedings will be available at the conference. It is anticipated that most of these papers will be reports on continuing research and that many of them will appear, in more complete form, in scholarly journals.","Subject to the availability of funding, financial assistance will be provided to speakers.
