CALLS FOR PAPERS","SECOND INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON NATURAL LANGUAGE UNDERSTANDING AND LOGIC PROGRAMMING 17-20 August 1987, Vancouver, B.C., Canada The workshop will consider fundamental principles and important innovations in the design, definition, uses, and extensions of logic programming to natural language understanding and, conversely, the adequacy of logic programming to express natural language formalisms. The main topics of interest are: • Logic grammar formalisms • Formal representations of natural language sentences","and texts • Resolution methods for specific aspects such as anaphoras, coordination • Natural language generation • Uses of techniques for logic grammars (unification) in other grammar formalisms • Compilers and interpreters for grammar formalisms • Applications: natural language front ends DEADLINES Submission of paper in final form 15 March 1987 Author notification of acceptance 1 June 1987 Workshop 17-19 August 1987 Final papers will be published in a book.

Recently, computational linguists have joined in the fray, with the result that computational solutions have begun to be proposed.
