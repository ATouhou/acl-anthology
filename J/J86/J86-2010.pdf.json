Six copies of a one-page anonymous abstract, along with a 3-by-5 card containing the name of the paper and the session (General or Special) for which it is intended, and the name(s), affiliation(s) and phone number(s) of the author(s), should be sent to ESCOL 86 Department of Linguistics University of Pittsburgh Pittsburgh, PA 15260 Twenty minutes will be allowed for the presentation of each paper, with an additional 10 minutes for discussion. CALL FOR PARTICIPATION CL AND AI BIBLIOGRAPHY Kuwait University is currently compiling an extensive bibliography in the areas of Computational Linguistics and Artificial Intelligence. The bibliography is meant to be of value particularly to universities and research centers that, like KU, are planning to start research and teaching in these areas. It will assist them to base their planning on state-of-the-art information in the field and to be aware of available resources.","The bibliography will include information on books, journals, publisl3ed papers, technical reports, educational tools, and systems.","We would appreciate information on any of the above categories, particularly on technical reports, tools for research, and systems. Information on systems should include: purpose of system, name(s) of designer(s), technical features, limitations, programming language, hardware requirements, and availability for educational institutions.","The bibliography will be published at the end of 1987. It may also be available on line through the European Academic Network.","Please direct correspondence to:","Ali Farghaly","Kuwait University","English Department","P.O. Box 23558, Safat 13096","Kuwait ANNOUNCEMENTS COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE Academic Press has announced this new journal, which commenced publication in March 1986. The purpose of the journal is to publish reports of original research related to quantitative descriptions of the recognition, understanding, production, and coding of speech by humans and/or machines.","The speech sciences have a long history, but it is only fairly recently that experirnentation with complex models of speech processes has become feasible. At present such research is carded out somewhat separately by practitioners of Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science, Electronic Engineering, Linguistics, Phonetics, and Psychology. Appropriate areas of investigation include the use of constructive mathematical analyses, computer simulation, algorithms for pattern analysis, syntactic and linguistic structures, the establishment of models of human performance, and the use of computers in measurements.","The journal will aim to provide a focus for this work and to encourage an interdisciplinary approach to problems in the speech sciences. Thus, contributions from all of the related disciplines will be welcomed in the form of reports of theoretical or experimental studies, tutorials, and brief correspondence pertaining to models of speech communication and their implementation, or fundamental research leading to the improvement of such models.
