Topics to be considered include the components of a natural language processing system; syntax analysis (including context-free grammars, augmented context-free grammars, grammatical constraints, and sources of syntactic ambiguity); semantic analysis (including meaning representation, semantic constraints, quantifier analysis); and discourse analysis (identifying implicit information, establishing text coherence, frames, and scripts). Examples will be drawn from various application areas, including database interface and text analysis.","Natural Language Generation Kathy McKeown,"]},{"title":"(Columbia University)","paragraphs":["In this tutorial, we will begin by identifying the types of decisions involved in language generation and how they differ from problems in the interpretation of natural language. Several techniques that have been used for \"surface\" generation (i.e., determining the syntactic structure and vocabulary of the generated text) will be examined, including grammars, dictionaries, and templates. From there, we will move on to other problems in language generation, including how the system can decide what to say in a given situation and how it can order the information for inclusion in a text. Here we will study the constraints that have been used for these decisions in domains such as expert systems, database systems, scene description, and problem solving. We will also look at the interaction between conceptual decisions such as these and decisions in surface generation, considering approaches that propose an integrated solution.","Structuring the Lexicon Robert Ingria,"]},{"title":"(BBN Laboratories Incorporated)","paragraphs":["This tutorial will discuss the information that has been stored in the lexicon.
