If the research program has been carried out collaboratively the award may be made jointly to the research team. The first recipient of this award was John McCarthy in 1985.","The Award carries with it a certificate and the sum of $1,000 plus travel and living expenses for the IJCAI. The researcher(s) will be invited to deliver an address on the nature and significance of the results achieved and write a paper for the conference proceedings. Primarily, however, the award carries the honour of having one's work selected by one's peers as an exemplar of sustained research in the maturing science of Artificial Intelligence.","We hereby call for nominations for The IJCAI Award for Research Excellence to be made at IJCAI-87 in Milan.

The Award carries with it a certificate and the sum of $1,000 plus travel and subsistence expenses for the IJCAI.

Its purpose is to promote interaction between members of the AI community. It does this by announcing the existence of AI tools, and acting as a pointer into the literature. Thus the AI community will have access to a common, extensional definition of the field, which will: • promote a common terminology, • discourage the reinvention of wheels, and • act as a clearing house for ideas and software.","The catalogue is a reference work providing a quick guide to the AI tools available for different jobs. It is not intended to be a textbook like the"]},{"title":"Artificial Intelligence Handbook.","paragraphs":["It, intentionally, only provides a brief description of each tool, with no extended discussion of the historical origin of the tool or how it has been used in particular AI programs. The focus is on techniques abstracted from their historical origins.","The original version of the catalogue was hastily built in 1983 as part of the UK SERC-DoI, IKBS, Architecture Study. It has now been adopted by the UK Alvey Programme and is both kept as an on-line document undergoing constant revision and refinement and published as a paperback by Springer Verlag. Springer Verlag have agreed to reprint the Catalogue at frequent intervals in order to keep it up to date.","The on-line and paperback versions of the catalogue meet different needs and differ in the entries they contain.

The catalogue entries are intended to be non-technical and brief, but with a literature reference. The reference might not be the \"classic\" one. It will often be to a textbook or survey article. The border between AI and non-AI techniques is fuzzy. Since the catalogue is to promote interaction, some techniques are included because they are vital parts of many AI programs, even though they did not originate in AI.","By \"portable AI software\" we mean programming languages, shells, packages, toolkits etc. available for use by AI researchers outside the group of the implementor, including both commercial and non-commercial products.

The catalogue is not intended to be a dictionary of AI terminology nor to include definitions of AI problems.","Entries are short (abstract length) descriptions of a technique or piece of software. They include a title, list of aliases, contributor's name, paragraph of description, information on availability and references. The contributor's name is that of the original contributor of the entry. Only occasionally is the contributor of the entry also the implementor of the software or the inventor of the technique.
