This is probably because of a principle that says noun modifiers should further restrict the possible reference of the noun phrase, and parts are common to too many wholes to perform that function.","(3) A knowledge base contains two kinds of knowledge, \"type\" knowledge about what kinds of situations are possible, and \"token\" knowledge about what the actual situation is. We are trying to determine which of these kinds of knowledge are required for each of the pragmatics problems. For example, reference requires both type and token knowledge, whereas most if not all instances of metonymy seem to require only type knowledge.","(4) At the most abstract level, interpretation requires the constructive proof of a single logical expression consisting of many conjuncts. The deduction component can attempt to prove these conjuncts in a variety of orders. We have been investigating some of these possible orders. For example, one plausible candidate is that one should work from the inside out, trying first to solve the reference problems of arguments of predications before attempting to solve the compound nominal and metonymy problems presented by those predications. In our framework, this is an issue of where subgoals for the deduction component should be placed on an agenda. IMPLEMENTATION In our implementation of the TACITUS system, we are beginning with the minimal approach and building up slowly. As we implement the local pragmatics operations, we are using a knowledge base containing only the axioms that are needed for the test examples. Thus, it grows slowly as we try out more and more texts. As we gain greater confidence in the pragmatics operations, we will move more and more of the axioms from our commonsense and domain knowledge bases into the system's knowledge base. Our initial versions of the pragmatics operations are, for the most part, fairly standard techniques recast into our abstract framework. When the knowledge base has reached a significant size, we will begin experimenting with more general solutions and with various constraints on those general solutions. FUTURE PLANS In addition to pursuing our research in each of the areas described above, we will institute two new efforts next year. First of all, we will begin to extend our work in pragmatics to the recognition of discourse structure. This problem is illustrated by the following text: Air regulating valve failed. Gas turbine engine wouldn't turn over. Valve parts corroded. The temporal structure of this text is 3-1-2; first the valve parts corroded, and this caused the valve to fail, which caused the engine to not turn over. To recognize this structure, one must reason about causal relationships in the model of the device, and in addition one must recognize patterns of explanation and consequence in the text.","The second new effort will be to build tools for domain knowledge acquisition. These will be based on the abstract machines in terms of which we are presently encoding our domain knowledge. Thus, the system should be able to allow the user to choose one of a set of abstract machines and then to augment it with various parts, properties and relations.

The goal of IJCAI-87 is to promote scientific interchange, within and between all subfields of AI, among researchers from all over the world. The conference is sponsored by the International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence, Inc. (IJCAII).","In response to the growing interest in engineering issues within the AI community, IJCAI-87's Technical Program will have two distinct tracks: science and engineering. The science papers, presented Sunday through Wednesday (23-26 August), will stress the computational principles underlying cognition and perception in man and machine. The engineering papers, presented Tuesday through Friday (25-28 August), will highlight pragmatic issues that arise in applying these computational principles. Tutorials will be presented on Sunday and Monday in parallel with the first two days of the science paper presentations. Meetings or workshops focussed on specific research issues might most appropriately be held on Thursday or Friday. TOPICS OF INTEREST Authors are invited to submit papers to either the science or engineering tracks within one of the following topic areas: 224 Computational Linguistics, Volume 12, Number 3, July-September 1986 The FINITE STRING Newsletter Calls for Papers, Proposals, Pictures, Nominations - Architectures and Languages (including logic program-","ming, user interface technology) - Reasoning (including theorem proving, planning,","explaining) - Knowledge Acquisition and Learning (including know-","ledge-base maintenance) -Knowledge Representation (including task domain","analysis) - Cognitive Modeling - Natural' Language Understanding - Perception and Signal Understanding (including","speech, vision, data interpretation) - Robotics REQUIREMENTS FOR SUBMISSION Authors are requested to prepare full papers, no more than 7 proceedings' pages (approximately 5600 words), or short papers, no more than 3 proceedings' pages (approximately 2400 words). The full-paper classification is intended for well-developed ideas, with significant demonstration of validity, while the short-paper classification is intended for descriptions of research in progress. Authors must ensure that their papers describe original contributions to or novel applications of AI, regardless of length classification, and that the research is properly compared and contrasted with relevant literature.

REVIEW CRITERIA Each paper will be reviewed by at least two experts. Acceptance will be based on the overall merit and significance of the reported research, as well as on the quality of the presentation. A paper may be reviewed by experts responsible for an area or track other than the one to which it was submitted if, in the opinion of a program committee member, it can thereby be more fairly reviewed.","Papers submitted to the science track should make an original and significant contribution to knowledge in the field of artificial intelligence.","Papers submitted to the engineering track should focus on pragmatic issues that arise in reducing AI principles and techniques to practice.
