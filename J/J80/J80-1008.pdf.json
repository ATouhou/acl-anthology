Here, too, it can be seen that respondents were very positive to the idea of a primarily hard-copy publication.","No","Question Yes No Ans. A. Would AJCL be read more? 72% 2% 26% B.

About 35 additional responses were received after the meeting, but it was apparent from looking at them carefully that they would not significantly affect the results already tabulated. George E. Heidorn Program of the 1979 ACL Meeting","The 17th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics was held at the University of California at San Diego, in La Jolla, California, on the weekend of August 11-12, 1979. The program committee for the meeting consisted of Norm Sondheimer (Chairman), Barbara Sangster, Bonnie Lynn Webber, and Ralph Weischedel, and the local arrangements chairman was Jim Levin. The 24 papers listed below were presented there. Copies of the proceedings, which includes the full text of most of these papers and extended abstracts of the others, along with an introduction to each session by its chairperson, are available for $5 from Don Walker at the address given on the inside front cover of this issue.
