The rest of the issue will consist of book reviews, announcements, news items, information on programs and courses in computational linguistics, descriptions of research projects and of resources relevant for research, and the comprehensive current bibliography with abstracts of publications and reports in the field. The amount of material published will be substantially the same as that included in previous years on multiple microfiches, in spite of the smaller number of actual pages, because the new format will accommodate more information in less space. Included with each issue of the"]},{"title":"AJCL","paragraphs":["will be a single 4-by-6-inch microfiche containing the same material as the printed version, one journal page per frame. However, since the microfiche can accommodate up to 98 pages, it will be possible to include additional material, such as appendices for technical articles, program listings, and the membership roster. An index card will summarize the contents of the microfiche, so that this form will be appropriate for independent archival use.","The survey materials. The cover letter and the questionnaire from the 1978 survey are reproduced in their entirety on pages 68-70 in the microfiche supplement to this issue. (Incidentally, this furnishes a good example of the kind of material that this supplement can be used for.) The two-page cover letter is a detailed presentation of the proposal for hard-copy publication, with its feasibility supported by facts and figures. The one-page questionnaire gives nine publication alternatives, ranging from all microfiche to all hard copy, which the respondent was asked to rank using the numbers 1 through 9; there are also four questions to directly solicit the respondent's feelings about hard copy versus microfiche.","Results. Of .the 513 questionnaires sent out (383 to the U.S., 40 to Canada, and 90 to other countries), 212 responses were received prior to the meeting at which the decision was made (169 from the U.S., 21 from Canada, and 22 from other countries). The table below shows, for each of the nine alternatives, the percentage of the 212 respondents who ranked that alternative as number 1 (i.e. their first choice). It also shows the average rank computed for and the resulting order of preference ternatives.

Each of these was just a variation on the basic theme of a primarily hard-copy journal as proposed in the cover letter.

Here, too, it can be seen that respondents were very positive to the idea of a primarily hard-copy publication.","No","Question Yes No Ans. A. Would AJCL be read more? 72% 2% 26% B.

About 35 additional responses were received after the meeting, but it was apparent from looking at them carefully that they would not significantly affect the results already tabulated. George E. Heidorn Program of the 1979 ACL Meeting","The 17th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics was held at the University of California at San Diego, in La Jolla, California, on the weekend of August 11-12, 1979. The program committee for the meeting consisted of Norm Sondheimer (Chairman), Barbara Sangster, Bonnie Lynn Webber, and Ralph Weischedel, and the local arrangements chairman was Jim Levin. The 24 papers listed below were presented there.
