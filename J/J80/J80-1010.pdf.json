Jerrold Kaplan","paragraphs":["Department of Computer and Information Science Moore School of Electrical Engineering University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104 ACM78, Proc. 1978 Annual Conf., Dec. 1978, 27-38.","Natural Language questions differ from most existing formal query languages in that they tend to admit a wider range of responses than their formal counterparts, and provide cues for selecting among the variety of appropriate responses. These differences reflect the fact that in Natural Language conversation, a respondent is expected to take an active role in the process of selecting and organizing responses, in contrast to formal query systems, where control of the interaction typically resides with the user or applications program-mer. This paper explores some specific ways in which Natural Language questions are particularly well suited for their environment, and discusses the potential role of similar capabilities in formal query systems, particularly with respect to Natural Language Data Base query systems.","* Editor's note: The abstracts in this first issue are not as \"current\" as I would like, but, because we did not publish the Journal in 1979, there is a lot of material to get caught up on. 54 American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 6, Number 1, January-March 1980 The FINITE STRING Newsletter Abstracts of Current Literature Impertinent Question-Answering Systems: Justification and Theory Laurent Siklossy Department of Information Engineering University of Illinois at Chicago Circle Chicago, Illinois 60680 ACM78, Proc. 1978 Annual Conf., Dec. 1978, 39-44.","A Question-Answering System (QAS) is impertinent if it tells a user something the user did not ask! Since a user rarely understands the full implications of a data base, especially a large one, his question is limited by his knowledge of the data base. Sometimes, a question similar to the one he originally asked could better satisfy his goals, but he did not ask it because he had no reason to do so. Hence, impertinence is a necessary feature of sophisticated QAS.","We describe a complete theory for impertinent QAS. The QAS is impertinent when, and only when, a small change in the question results in a large positive change in the answer, i.e., in the presence of a discontinuity. (The metrics are user dependent.) In impertinent QAS, the user's: \"Why didn't you tell me?\" answered by \"BUT YOU DIDN'T ASK,\" no longer occur.

First, the general objectives for near term systems in the areas of syntax, world knowledge, discourse, and problem solving are considered. Next, a comparison is made between the ATN parsing strategies in LADDER, ROBOT, PLANES, and EQS. Evidence for the importance of giving answers to queries not directly available in the data base is given together with some speculation on how the knowledge necessary for this might be acquired. After some general discussion of semantic data models, the semantic data model used in EQS is described, and the method used for building a semantic data model of an existing CODASYL data base is sketched. Lastly, the use of multiple levels of representation as a way to control complexity of such query systems is discussed. The Robot System: Natural Language Processing Applied to Data Base Query Larry R.

The design and implementation of this system is described and illustrated with detailed examples of the operation of system components and examples of overall system operation. The language processing portion of the system uses a number of augmented transition networks, each of which matches phrases with a specific meaning, along with context registers (history keepers) and concept case frames; these are used for judging meaningfulness of questions, generating dialogue for clarifying partially understood questions, and resolving ellipsis and pronoun reference problems. Other system components construct a formal query for the relational database, and optimize the order of searching relations. Methods are discussed for handling vague or complex questions and for providing browsing ability. Also included are discussions of important issues in programming natural language systems for limited do-mains, and the relationship of this system to others.

Attention is then focused on the first of the insulating components, the natural language system. A pragmatic approach to language access that has proved useful for building interfaces to databases is described and illustrated by examples. Special language features that increase system usability, such as spelling correc-tion, processing of incomplete inputs, and run-time system personalization, are also discussed.

The system is regarded as a model for portions of natural language that are relevant to interactions with a data base. The model provides insight into the functioning of language and the linguistic behavior of users who must communicate with a machine in order to obtain information. The aim of application independence made it necessary to approach many problems from a different angle than in most comparable systems. Rather than a full treatment of the linguistic capacity of the system, details of phenomena such as time handling, coordina-tion, quantification, and possessive pronouns are presented.

Operating on this data base, subsequent computer programs can retrieve specific facts and summarize the different types of information present in the original documents. The technique is based upon the prior development of a natural language parsing system equipped with a comprehensive grammar of English. To this have been added procedures which reduce paraphrastically the variety of syntactic forms found in sentences and align parts of different sentences which have similar grammatical and informational standing in their respective sentences. When these procedures are applied to documents in the same subject area, the result is a table-like structure, called an information format, which contains the same information as the original documents, but arranged in a structured, rather than narrative, form.

Automatic Error Detection in Natural Language Words R. Nussbaum and H.-J. Schek IBM Scientific Center Tiergartenstrasse 15 6900 Heidelberg, WEST GERMANY Technical Report 78.06.005, June 1978.","An approach for the automatic error detection in natural language words without the use of a dictionary of permissible words is described. Automatically generated tables which describe permissible syllables and syllable sequences are used instead. These, on the other hand, are based on permissible initial and terminal consonant and vowel clusters. Therefore, an arbitrary string or erroneous word is tested whether it resembles a natural language word applying the above sequence tables. It is shown that under certain assumptions the error detection rate is approximately 80 by using relatively small tables with 70k bytes.

Bruce Bolt Beranek and Newman, Inc. 50 Moulton Street Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138 Language Arts 55 (1978), 460-466.","This paper discusses two methods of text analysis used in research on children's understanding of stories, one based on story \"grammars\" and one on analysis of characters' plans. Using either one comes to similar basic conclusions. First, real stories have structures that can be identified and studied. Since it is a difficult task to recognize and use these structures in read-ing, children who have limited experience with real stories draw upon the reader's prior beliefs and expectations. The structure or connectivity of a story provides a framework for organizing appropriate prior beliefs. Third, the inherent complexity of story understanding, particularly the need to use prior beliefs in appropriate ways, means that there are usually several \"correct\" but different ways of understanding the same story. This suggests that children and adults my understand the same story in very different ways. Conversational Coherency Rachel Reichman Bolt Beranek and Newman, Inc. 50 Moulton Street Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138 CSR Technical Report No. 95, July 1978.","A major goal of this Work is to specify some steps of the process by which participants maintain coherency in their conversations. The underlying element of the analysis is a construct called a 'context space'. Roughly, a group of utterances that refers to a single issue or episode forms the basis for a context space. Superficially, a conversation is a sequence of utterances; at a deeper level it is a structured entity whose utterances can be parsed into hierarchically related context spaces.","As a conversation proceeds, each conversant is building up a model of the conversation. Such a model includes the conversation's context space structure, a notion of the present discourse topic, and a list ot items being focused upon. An important factor upon which the smoothness and coherency of a conversation depends is the lack of conflict between the respective models of the participants. Conflicts are prevented by a speaker following a number of high level syntactic and semantic relational rules that enable listeners to identify the speaker's discourse model.

Elements of a Plan-Based Theory of Speech Acts Philip R. Cohen and C. Raymond Perrault Department of Computer Science University of Toronto Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A7 CANADA Bo/t Beranek and Newman Report 4057, Feb. 1979.","A theory of speech acts is developed that treats speech acts as operators in a planning system. The speech acts of requesting and informing are formally defined, and plans containing those speech acts are presented. Unlike previous (informal) speech act the-ories, this paper supplies justifications for the form and 'content of its speech act definitions. The adequacy criterion proposed here is that given an initial set of beliefs and goals, the speech act definitions should allow for the generation of plans for those speech acts that a person could issue appropriately under the same circumstances. This adequacy criterion is used in judging whether speech act definitions pass certain tests, in particular, the test of compositionality. For instance, since a speaker can request that a hearer do some arbitrary action, a speaker ought to be able to request that a hearer perform a speech act. A number of previous formulations of requesting and informing are shown to fail this test as applied to the planning of questions and to multi-party requests, such as \"Ask Tom to open the door\". In order to plan questions (requests to in-form), two variations of informing speech acts are defined --informing about the referent of a description and informing whether some proposition is true, which lead to WH and yes-no questions, respectively. It is argued that meta-theoretical principles should be developed that state how to formulate speech act definitions to pass the adequacy tests. One such principle is proposed and is shown to allow for the planning of multi-party requests. Machine Translation and Machine-Aided Translation W.J.

This revival of interest in machine translation may well have surprised many who have tended in recent years to dismiss it as one of the \"great failures\" of scientific research. What has changed? What grounds are there now for optimism about machine translation? Or is it still a \"utopian dream\"?

It is argued that competent translation requires some reasonable depth of understanding of the source text, and in particular, access to detailed contextual information. The following Machine Translation paradigm is proposed: First, the source text is analyzed and mapped into a language-free conceptual representation. Then, inference mechanisms apply contextual world knowledge to augment the representation by adding all information that was implicit in the input text. Finally, a natural-language generator maps the most relevant sections of the language-free representation into the target language. We illustrate this process with examples of English-to-Spanish and English-to-Russian transla-tions, including some produced by SAM, a working system of computer programs at Yale University. 60 American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 6, Number 1, January-March 1980 The FINITE STRING Newsletter Abstracts of Current Literature Memory Organization for Natural Language Data-Base Inquiry Janet L.

Most of the participants in the workshop were interested in our ideas on this subject.

Since American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 6, Number 1, January-March 1980 61 The FINITE STRING Newsletter Abstracts of Current Literature Scripts model a knowledge structure that people constantly apply, both to cope with the world and to understand what they read, SAM embodies a theory of context and how context is to be used in the process of understanding. Understanding Goal-Based Stories Robert Wilensky Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science University of California Berkeley, California 94720 Yale Computer Science Report 140, Sept. 1978.","Stories usually describe situations involving purposeful interactions between people. To understand stories, a reader needs a large body of knowledge about the kinds of situations that may occur, and must be able to use this knowledge to infer implicit aspects of a situation described by a text. Building a computer program that understands stories therefore requires an explicit description of this knowledge, and the construction of an inference mechanism with which to apply it.","This thesis is about understanding story situations involving goals. Most of the thesis is concerned with describing the categories of story situations that goals arise in, and with giving algorithms for detecting and processing the situations in each category. The most interesting categories of story situations involve multiple goals. Understanding a situation with a number of goals in it requires a reader to determine the interrelationships between those goals, and to infer the consequences of these relationships. Goal relationships form the basis for most of the situational categories presented here.","Knowledge of story situations and how they can be processed was used to build a story understanding program called PAM (Plan Applier Mechanism). PAM reads stories in English, and produces story representa-tions that include the inferences needed to connect each story's events. To demonstrate that it has understood a story, PAM answers questions about the story and expresses the story from several points of view. Subjective Understanding: Computer Models of Belief Systems Jaime Guillermo Carbonell Department of Computer Science Carnegie-Mellon University Schenley Park Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213 Yale Computer Science Report 150, Jan. 1979.","Modeling human understanding of natural language requires a model of the processes underlying human thought. No two people think exactly alike; different people subscribe to different beliefs and are motivated by different goals in their activities. A theory of subjective understanding has been proposed to account for subjectively-motivated human thinking ranging from ideological belief to human discourse and personality traits. A process-model embodying this theory has been implemented in a computer system, POLITICS. POLITICS demonstrates its understanding by answering questions in natural language question-answer dialogs.","POLITICS represents political ideologies as goal trees that structure the motivations of political actors and the relative importance of the various motivations. General purpose counterplanning strategies and more specific situational inference rules model the reasoning processes. Counterplanning strategies determine when, how and why political actors attempt various plans to thwart each other's goals, nullify each other's thwarting attempt, or end mutual hostilities. The subjective goal trees determine the focus of attention for the reasoning process. Only inferences that are relevant to the interests, goals and beliefs of the understander are pursued. This process drastically reduces the inference search space.","In addition to POLITICS, the theory of subjective understanding has been embodied in other process-models, also implemented as computer programs. These programs are TRIAD, a system that models human understanding of social conflict situations, and MICS, a system that models a participant in a natural language conversation. TRIAD generalizes the ideological conflict understanding of POLITICS to encom-pass all types of situations, ranging from domestic quarrels to judicial decisions and international disagreements. MICS uses goal trees to represent the conversational motivations of a person, and thus guides the course of the conversation towards the topics it is interested in discussing. All three systems presented in this dissertation are integrated understanding systems, incorporating subjective beliefs, reasoning strategies, and natural language analysis into a single, unified process. 62 American Journal of Computational Linguistics.
