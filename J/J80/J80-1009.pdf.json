This is a change from the previously announced date of June 18-21, and was brought about by a desire to minimize the overlap in time with the Cognitive Science Society meeting, which will be held in New Haven earlier the same week (see next item).","The ACL meeting will be divided into two parts. During the first two days (Thursday and Friday), refereed, contributed papers will be presented, and the Annual Business Meeting will be held. Gary Hendrix of SRI International is the Chairman of the Program Committee, and a Call for Papers (with a February 15 deadline) went out to all ACL members in December. The other members of the Program Committee are Charles Fillmore, University of California, Jane Robinson, SRI International, Ivan Sag, Stanford University, Henry Thompson, Xerox PARC, and Rober Wilensky, University of California.","During the second two days of the meeting (Saturday and Sunday), a parasession on \"Topics in Interactive Discourse\" with invited papers and panels will be held. This part of the meeting is being organized by Bonnie Webber of the University of Pennsylvania, and will consist of three panels, Front-end Design: Demands of Service Application, chaired by Barbara Grosz of SRI International, Front-end Design: Demands of Convention and Channel, chaired by Jerry Hobbs of SRI International, and Natural Language Interactive Systems: Looking to the Future, chaired by Bonnie Webber. Among the panelists will be John Carey (Alternate Media Center, NYU), Phil Hayes (Carnegie-Mellon University), Howard Morgan (University of Pennsylvania), Emmanuel Schegloff (UCLA), and John C. Thomas (IBM Research).","The Annual Banquet will be held on Friday evening, amongst the Egyptian mummies in the Rotunda of the University Museum.","Local arrangements for the meeting are being handled by Kathleen McKeown of the University of Pennsylvania. Cognitive Science Conference at Yale","The Cognitive Science Society will hold its second annual conference at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, on June 16-19, 1980. There will be three major addresses, three panel discussions, and sessions of short papers sponsored by members of the Society. (A Call for Abstracts has already gone out to members, with a deadline of March 1.) There will also be computer demonstrations and a banquet. Dormitory space at the University is being reserved, and a room plan and meal plan will be available for attendees.","Arrangements will be made to minimize the impact of the one-day overlap with the schedule of the ACL meeting (see previous item).","For further information, contact Professor Wendy G.

Both artificial intelligence and theoretical linguistics provide the underpinnings for studies to be reported at COLING 80, and applications including office automation will be presented together with pure scientific results. Voice recognition and the problem of Chinese character input-output are likely to have a large place in the final program, according to David G. Hays, program chairman.","Computational linguistics is the study of interac-tions between human language and the computer. On the linguistic side, papers on discourse structure, semantics, syntax, and phonology are usually included in conferences; papers on the history of language, lexicography, literary studies, and dialect variation are frequently offered. In artificial intelligence, natural-language input for programming, data-base access, and data input are topics of high current interest. Readers for the blind and other voice input-output applications have appeared.

Since then conferences have been held in Canada, France, Hungary, Italy, Norway, and Sweden. The Tokyo conference will be held during the week preceding the IFIP conference on computing. COLING meetings are sponsored by the International Committee on Computational Linguistics, of which Bernard Vauquois, professor at Grenoble, France, is chairman. Professor Hiroshi Wada is honorary president of COLING 80. Professor Makoto Nagao is local arrangements chairman.","Information about COLING 80 can be obtained from: David G.

Jerrold Kaplan Department of Computer and Information Science Moore School of Electrical Engineering University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104 ACM78, Proc. 1978 Annual Conf., Dec. 1978, 27-38.","Natural Language questions differ from most existing formal query languages in that they tend to admit a wider range of responses than their formal counterparts, and provide cues for selecting among the variety of appropriate responses. These differences reflect the fact that in Natural Language conversation, a respondent is expected to take an active role in the process of selecting and organizing responses, in contrast to formal query systems, where control of the interaction typically resides with the user or applications program-mer. This paper explores some specific ways in which Natural Language questions are particularly well suited for their environment, and discusses the potential role of similar capabilities in formal query systems, particularly with respect to Natural Language Data Base query systems.","* Editor's note: The abstracts in this first issue are not as \"current\" as I would like, but, because we did not publish the Journal in 1979, there is a lot of material to get caught up on. 54 American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 6, Number 1, January-March 1980"]}]}
