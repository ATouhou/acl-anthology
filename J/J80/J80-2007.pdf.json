Secretary-Treasurer's Report","paragraphs":["Don Walker reviewed the financial status of the Association for 1978 and the period of 1979 through 6-30. The income figures for the two periods are $16,634 and $9,193, respectively; the corresponding expenses are $10,560 and $5,070; and the balances are $6,074 and $4,123. The current assets (as of 6-30-79) are $20,595. In perspective, the Association can be viewed as financially healthy. A more detailed report on financial status is included as an attachment to these Minutes (on page 116).","Walker presented the membership status for 1977 and 1978, and for 1979 through 8-9. For those three periods, the values for individual members were 500, 444, and 457; for institutional members, they were 201, 2i8, and 206; with total membership figures of 701, 662, and 663. Membership declined during 1978, but seems on the increase for 1979. A more detailed report on membership status is included as an attachment to these Minutes (on page 116).","According to a change in the By-Laws of the American Federation of Information Processing Societies (AFIPS) of several years ago, for ACL to retain its membership status, it will be necessary to reach a total of 1500 individual members by the end of 1980. There is a possibility that we may be able to satisfy these requirements if we can get 900 members. Both goals seem difficult to achieve, although it is expected that the new phototypeset printed version of the"]},{"title":"American Journal of Computational Linguistics","paragraphs":["will provide a weapon for the membership campaign.

Its appearance has been delayed by the necessity to make decisions about formats, since everything is being done for the first time. The three papers for this issue were submitted in machine-readable form, a practice that can provide substantial savings on the time required for input. Heidorn stated that the delay in publication should be attributed to the editor; the authors, referees, and reviewers were not to be held responsible. Some papers for future issues were already in hand; of those submitted, three are being reviewed, eight were rejected, and ten are being evaluated by the Editorial Board. Eighteen books of the thirty received from publishers have been assigned to reviewers. Program Committee Report","Norman Sondheimer, as Chairman, described the activities of the Program Committee (which consisted of himself, Barbara Sangster, Bonnie Webber, and Ralph Weischedel) in the organization of the Meeting. Twenty-four of the sixty-three papers submitted were accepted for presentation; others of good quality had to be rejected because of time limitations and the necessity for balance in the program. Although not originally anticipated, it proved possible to prepare a Proceedings for the Meeting, copies of which have been distributed to attendees. Many of the papers are reproduced there in full, together with introductory statements prepared by the people who chaired the sessions.

[The final figures for attendance at the Meeting are as follows: 162 total, including 73 members, 42 new-members (nonmember registration fee credited toward membership), and 47 students (15 of whom are members).] Editor's Report George Heidorn reported on the status of the"]},{"title":"American Journal of Computational Linguistics.","paragraphs":["The first issue is expected in September. It will include three papers, three book reviews, and 25 abstracts, Executive Committee Report","Kaplan reported on the discussions at the Executive Committee meeting which took place on 10 August. With regard to AFIPS, he observed that the membership goal they required seemed unreachable, although 114 American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 6, Number 2, April-June 1980 The FINITE STRING Newsletter Minutes of the 1979 ACL Meeting the benefits of continued affiliation with that organization woulct make efforts toward that goal worthwhile. In any case, since additional members are of value to the Association itself, we should try to acquire as many as possible. In reference to support of Abacus, a popular journal on computing (similar to the Scientific American) being considered for publication by AFIPS, he remarked that several years ago ACL had pledged $5,000 as a guaranteed loan toward its production. However, the Association does not have the resources to respond to a more recent request for venture capital funds to satisfy the requirements for an additional $700,000. [Subsequent decisions by AFIPS have resulted in cancellation of the plans for producing Abacus.]","In discussing COLING-80, which is scheduled for 29 September to 4 October 1980 in Tokyo, Japan, Kaplan noted that the relation of COLING as an organization to ACL has never been clearly established. The Association has always provided free publicity for those meetings, but this year it also has given $500 to Dave Hays, the current Program Chairman, in support of his Committee operations. While the COLING meetings do constitute competition with ACL for papers during the years they occur, it is felt that the cooperation is worth continuing. Kaplan also remarked that it may be possible for the ACL to host a COLING meeting in the United States in conjunction with our regular annual meeting some time in the next few years.","The initial planning for the next ACL meeting had considered the possibility of taking the form of a third TINLAP (Theoretical Issues in Natural Language Processing), following the very successful meetings in 1975 at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and in 1978 at the University of Illinois. However, the convening of the La Jolla Conference on Cognitive Science [which immediately followed the current meeting] made that inappropriate. Instead, the Association is planning to combine a meeting with submitted papers and a parasession of invited papers on issues in interactive discourse. It is scheduled for the second or third week of June, 1980, in Philadelphia. The possibility of coordination with other societies to increase the attendance is being considered.","Kaplan pointed out that there are a number of or-ganizations whose interests overlap with those of the ACL: AFIPS, COLING, ACM's SIGART (Special Interest Group on Artificial Intelligence) and SI-GLASH (Special Interest Group on Language Analysis and Studies in the Humanities), ASIS's SIGALP (Special Interest Group on Automated Language Processing), the Cognitive Science Society (which is just being formed), the Association for Computers and the Humanities, the International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence, AISB (the British/European Society for the Study of Artificial Intelligence and the Simulation of Behavior), CSCSI/SCEIO (The Canadi-an Society for Computational Studies of Intelligence), and the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing. He said that the Executive Committee was considering what kinds of relationships might be established with some or all of these other groups.

Resolutions Committee Report","Bonnie Webber expressed the grateful appreciation of the Association to Norm Sondheimer and the Program Committee for the organization of the technical sessions, to Sperry Univac for their preparation of the Call for Papers, the Advance Program, and the Conference Proceedings, to Jim Levin, his colleagues, and the UCSD for the local arrangements (with an expression of confidence in the prospects for the forthcoming banquet), to Ron Kaplan for his guidance of ACL during the year, to George Heidorn for his work on the conversion of the AJCL to phototypeset printed form, to the AJCL Editorial Board and other reviewers for their support of the Journal, and to Don Walker for his continuing management of the affairs of the Association.","The members expressed their approval of her resolution.
