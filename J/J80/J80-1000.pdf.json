The decision to switch to a primarily hard-copy form, with a microfiche supplement, was made by the ACL Executive Committee at the Annual Meeting in July 1978, after a survey of the membership showed overwhelming support for the idea. (The results of this survey are presented in an article on page 49.)","The first issue in this new form was originally scheduled for the first quarter of 1979, but difficulties associated with the conversion caused several delays, eventually totaling a whole year's time. By then it seemed like a good idea to give this first issue a date of 1980 and consider 1979 to be a year lost to experience. (As a consolation, members who paid their dues in 1979 will not have to pay dues in 1980.)
