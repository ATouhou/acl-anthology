The aims of the conference are to provide an opportunity for professional contact and discussion of a major interdisciplinary question: how the redefinition of objectives and methods in the humanities and social sciences contributes to the exchange of ideas and information among the humanities, social sciences, and computer science.","The papers contributed reflect the range of principles and methods currently adopted in essentially nonnumerical data bases. Also represented are studies of pedagogical applications, social implications, and potential changes in these disciplines as a consequence of their adoption of computer-based technology. Opportunity will be provided to demonstrate both local and remote systems on the PDP-11.","For further information contact: Professor E.

However, they are in a format, and subject to rules of inference, consistent with earlier accounts of this system of language analysis and understanding. Their use is discussed in connection with the phenomenon of extended use: sentences where the semantic preferences are broken. It is argued that such situations are the norm and not the exception in normal language use, and that a language understanding system must give some general treatment of them. A notion of sense projection is proposed, leading on to an alteration of semantic for-mulas (word sense representations) in the face of unexpected context by drawing information from the pseudo texts. A possible implementation is described, based on a new semantic parser for the Preference Semantics system, which would cope with extended use by the methods suggested and answer questions about the process of analysis itself. It is argued that this would be a good context in which to place alan-","* Editor's note: The abstracts in this issue are not as \"current\" as I would like, but, because we did not publish the Journal in 1979, there is still much material to get caught up on.
