(University College London) Chichester, England: Ellis Horwood, 1989, 290 pp. (Ellis Horwood Books in Information Technology) Distributed by John Wiley & Sons Hardbound, ISBN 0-7458-0651-1 and 0-470-21439-2, $67.95 This book reviews the methodology used in the assessment of speech recognition and synthesis systems. The text is based on a report that was prepared as part of the ESPRIT (European Strategic Program for Research and Development of Information Technology) program. Thus, although the editors are all from the University College London, the authors of the various chapters represent a broad sample of the major speech research centers in Europe.","The book is composed of six major chapters, with an introduction and a final note on future developments. An extensive bibliography is included at the end, along with a glossary, an index, and an appendix listing the project partners. The four major chapters cover assessment of speech recognition systems (Chapter 2), assessment of text-to-speech synthesis systems (Chapter 3), speech databases (Chapter 4), and transcription and labeling of speech data (Chapter 5). The last two chapters discuss applied issues relating to tools that are useful in the development of speech systems and management of large databases. The coverage in the four major chapters is generally very complete. Chapter 3 on text-to-speech is excellent.","The worst aspect of the book is its appearance; particularly the typesetting and page formatting. The typesetting is so poor it leads one to wonder if these people should try speech input/ output. Of course, speech I/O would obviate the typesetting problem. The best aspect of the book is its technical content. Any serious developer or consumer of speech technology can gain by careful study of this book. Furthermore, the multilingual mission of this ESPRIT project forced the authors to confront a number of difficult questions, for which this book offers some good practical starting"]},{"title":"points.--Jared Bernstein, SRI International","paragraphs":["BOOKS RECEIVED Books 'ii,;ted below that are marked with a t will be reviewed in a future issue.","Authors and publishers who wish their books to be considered for review in"]},{"title":"Computational Linguistics","paragraphs":["should send a copy to the book review editor at the address below.
