Send $35 or DM 70 (students, $18) to Johan Vanparys, Facult6s Universitaires Notre Dame de la Paix, Rue de Bruxelles 61, B-5000 Namur, Belgium. Cognitive Linguistics will be a forum for high-quality research into language as an instrument for organizing, processing, and conveying information .... The formal structures of language are studied not as if they were autonomous, but as reflections of general conceptual organization, categorization principles, processing mechanisms, and experiential and environmental influences. As language is not to be isolated from the other faculties of man, cognitive linguistics has an interdisciplinary openness to the other cognitive sciences. Consequently, contributions to the journal may adopt either a linguistic point of view, such as language-specific description, typological comparison, historical and variational studies, theoretical and formal modeling; or they may assume that perspective of a neighboring discipline such as psycholinguistic experimentation, anthropological fieldwork, computer simulation, and philosophical analysis--From the Editorial Statement, issue 1(1), 1990 TRANSLATING AND THE COMPUTER 10: THE TRANSLATION ENVIRONMENT TEN YEARS ON Pamela Mayorcas (ed.)

Smith (California State University, Northridge) Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 1990, xii + 300 pp. Hardbound, ISBN 0-262-19299-3, $32.50 Those who process natural language necessarily process text. Smith's Introduction to text processing covers nuts-and-bolts implementation matters of text processing from data entry through encryption and compression to concordance generation and machine translation. Other topics covered are document storage and retrieval, text editors, string matching, macroprocessors, text formatters, hyphenation algorithms, spelling checkers, writers' tools, statistical authorship studies, and automatic abstraction. Some topics are treated in considerable detail; some that would normally require books of their own, such as IR and MT, receive overviews. Generally speaking, the technical material is strong and well presented.","Curiously omitted is any discussion of character sets: ASCII, its limitations, and the many recent proposals for extensions. (The Computational Linguistics Volume 16, Number 4, December 1990 245 Briefly Noted Books Received book itself persistently uses an ASCII hyphen where longer, non-ASCII dashes would be correct.) Nor does the lengthy chapter on text formatting include discussion of good or bad typography or layout, or what features such systems need for the user to achieve attractive documents. (The book's typesetting is not too bad, but the leading is a tad too tight, the paragraph spacing two tads too loose. The layout is based on the elegant MIT Press house style, but there are many widows and orphans, and figures are often very poorly placed and hard to distinguish from the text.)","The book is oriented strongly toward Unix and its text-processing tools. Although primarily intended as an undergraduate textbook (pun unavoidable), it may also serve as a useful reference work for its summary of techniques in encryption, hyphenation, and the like.--G.H.
