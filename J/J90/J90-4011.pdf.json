Martin, Editor-in--Chief","paragraphs":["Vol. 4, No. 2 (Summer 1990) of the International Journal of Supercomputer Applications is devoted to a collection of articles that demonstrates the benefits of using visualization as an essential approach for interpreting and evaluating computational results. Guest edited by Steve Follin, this exciting issue is accompanied by an hour-long videotape available in VHS format, with segments elucidating each of the featured articles. Vol. 4, No. 2 covers problems ranging from the simulation of global climatic effects of greenhouse gases and the evolution of a numerically severe storm to the photometric classification of clouds on Jupiter and the numerical simulation of flow through an artificial heart valve. Order today and see for yourself how visualization is enabling researchers to represent the scientific challenges that supercomputers are addressing. 157 pp., illustrated, videotape included, $50.00 Prepayment is required.

The paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must be written in English. Contact the editor regarding the possibility of electronic submission. Submissions may be made in any of the following categories: PAPER: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in computational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The length of a paper depends on its content, but we suggest that manuscripts be limited to forty double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of twelve journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed, being read by at least two members of the editorial board and usually by an additional expert in the particular subject matter. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the author certifies the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publication to another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Editor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the case of a \"work for hire,\" by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978 U.S. Copyright law. TECHNICAL CORRESPONDENCE: This category includes short articles reporting preliminary results of some project in progress, or the results of other studies of interest to the readership. Technical correspondences should not generally exceed eight double-spaced pages. Each technical correspondence is reviewed by at least two members of the editorial board before acceptance. LETTERS TO THE EDITOR: This includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these contributions for inclusion. Five copies of papers, technical correspondences, and letters should be sent to the Editor: James F.
