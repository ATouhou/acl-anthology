The chapter on expert systems does not really explain what an expert system is, nor how it works, nor how it could be used by a CALL system. So these topics will be rather confusing for the nonspecialists.","To conclude, it seems to me that this book will not contribute to familiarizing language teachers with notions of computer science and artificial intelligence.

(Series in computer science, vol. 12) Hardbound, ISBN 9971-50-664-5, $78.00 Reviewed by M. Martin Taylor Defence and Civil Institute of Environmental Medicine and Insup Taylor University of Toronto Readers of Computational Linguistics who might have been led by the title of this book to expect an introduction to computational problems in the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean languages will in fact find little of relevance. The title is misleading: the book is not about Chinese, Japanese, and Korean computing. It is almost entirely about the problems of input, coding, and display of Chinese characters. It has a great deal to say about the nature and history of Chinese characters, and about the problems of using them in computation. It ignores the phonetic scripts used in conjunction with characters in Japan and Korea, and discusses Chinese characters mainly from the perspective of Taiwan rather than the People's Republic of China.","If you want to learn about Chinese characters, or to develop computer systems for the Chinese market, you should probably read this book, because it has a lot of information on the subject. If not, you might like to read the book for amusement, since rarely does such a personal, egotistic, chauvinistic, and polemic book see the light of day. (It is certainly rare for a book author to give himself \"ten tlhousand thanks\" for his own work on a standardization committee; and we do not accept the yin-yang-based symbol of the I Ching as evidence that the Chinese invented the fundamental theory of computation.)","Chapter 2, \"About the Chinese language,\" is actually about Chinese characters rather than the language. This chapter gives a good account of history, structure, and sounds of characters, and includes many figures and tables. Other chapters and several appendices give statistical data on characters and phonetic symbols. These parts of the book: could be very useful to someone interested in the details of Chinese character input, coding, and display.","The book is written in a \"Chineselized\" version of English (to use a word much favored by the authors). It would have benefited greatly from a reading by an English-speak!ing copyeditor, and a typographer should have been consulted about the design. The content should also have been checked more carefully, as illustrated by Rule 3 of the Dai-E coding method, the complete text of which is: \"If the character is comprised of a container without another radiczl, then rule 3 will not apply\" (p. 137).","In Chapter 7, the book goes beyond Chinese I/O to consider Chinese programming languages and operating systems, though the authors seem to have some misconceptions about what is available to non-Chinese speakers. \"Total control of a given computer system means that the human users must be able to communicate with the compute.r system in their human native language without hinderance [sic]\" (p. 253). \"Could you imagine English speak-ing people having to write their programs in another language? What would the result be?\" (p. 254). \"It is not an English operating system, if it cannot communicate with the user in plain English\" (p. 255). Readers of Computational Linguistics will presumably now step up their research so that they can develop the first English operating system.","FORTH is the sole programming language that merits the authors' approval, seemingly because it emulates Chinese., philosophy: The second similarity between Chinese philosophy and FORTH can be found in the dual functions of the F'ORTH interpreter/compiler. The FORTH interpreter i,; an interpretive compiler as well as compilative interpreter. It is one of two, two of one. This is similar to 244 Computational Linguistics Volume 16, Number 4, December 1990 Book Reviews Briefly Noted Chinese thoughts on the combinations of heaven and man. Heaven is the man, and man is the heaven. Good is evil, and evil is good. The universe is but one. It is very Zen-ish. If you look from this angle, it is yin, but, if you look from another angle, it is also yang. Yin and Yang are one. (p. 267)","An unintentionally self-referential comment (actually used about the work of the People's Republic of China on character coding) occurs on page 211: \"What kind of mad joke this mess is?\" As the authors mysteriously say (p. 49): \"The history of Shr 3 Huang 2 Di 4 of the Chin 2 Dynasty should be a mirror for all of us to reflect on and learn from.\" M.

Cognitive Linguistics will be a forum for high-quality research into language as an instrument for organizing, processing, and conveying information .... The formal structures of language are studied not as if they were autonomous, but as reflections of general conceptual organization, categorization principles, processing mechanisms, and experiential and environmental influences. As language is not to be isolated from the other faculties of man, cognitive linguistics has an interdisciplinary openness to the other cognitive sciences. Consequently, contributions to the journal may adopt either a linguistic point of view, such as language-specific description, typological comparison, historical and variational studies, theoretical and formal modeling; or they may assume that perspective of a neighboring discipline such as psycholinguistic experimentation, anthropological fieldwork, computer simulation, and philosophical analysis--From the Editorial Statement, issue 1(1), 1990 TRANSLATING AND THE COMPUTER 10: THE TRANSLATION ENVIRONMENT TEN YEARS ON Pamela Mayorcas (ed.)

Smith's Introduction to text processing covers nuts-and-bolts implementation matters of text processing from data entry through encryption and compression to concordance generation and machine translation. Other topics covered are document storage and retrieval, text editors, string matching, macroprocessors, text formatters, hyphenation algorithms, spelling checkers, writers' tools, statistical authorship studies, and automatic abstraction. Some topics are treated in considerable detail; some that would normally require books of their own, such as IR and MT, receive overviews. Generally speaking, the technical material is strong and well presented.","Curiously omitted is any discussion of character sets: ASCII, its limitations, and the many recent proposals for extensions.
