In the book, interlinguistics means the study of planned (or, pejoratively, artificial) languages such as Esperanto, Volapiik, etc. Schubert has collected 18 papers (in English, or translated into English), covering sociolinguistic, psycholinguistic, theoretical, and literary aspects of planned languages. detail. Metataxis rules are simply mappings of dependency structures of one language to those required by another. The rules are indexed by governing morphemes, and are in the form of a morpheme dominating constrained variables as dependents. Metataxic rules are also used in the dictionary to map from a single word in one language to phrases in another, or vice versa.","The book is limited to describing the syntactic component of a translation system, and it emphasizes the linguistics of the protess, offering few comments on the computational aspects. Generally, it is a good source for scholars with an interest in the linguistics of dependency analysis, and it provides a detailed bibliography of mainly European work in dependency theory. As an approach to machine translation, there is no obvious advantage of metataxis over the customary transfer rules defined on phrase structure constituents.--Rob't F.

It is used to mean the mapping from a source language syntactic dependency structure to that of a target language. Schubert holds that this is a primary process in language translation, and reports that the Distributed Language Translation Project has constructed metataxes (i.e. dependency transfer rule systems) for English to Esperanto and Esperanto to French. The first four chapters present a history of dependency theory and a discussion of its linguistic basis. Dependency is defined as directed co-occurrence of morphemes. It can be determined by distributional studies of the co-occurrence of words and phrases in utterances. If we consider the sentence \"Very interesting people arrive,\" we can observe that \"they\" can be substituted for \"very interesting people\" and maintain grammaticality in \"they arrive.\" Similarly, the substitution of \"people\" for the phrase maintains grammaticality. But the substitution of\"very\" or \"very interesting\" for the whole phrase results in ill-formed utterances such as *\"very arrive\" or *\"very interesting arrive.\" An essential criterion for dependency appears to be that the word that cannot be omitted from the phrase under substitution criteria is the governor of the phrase. Within the phrase, applying the substitution process to \"the very interesting people\" shows that \"the people\" and \"interesting people\" are both well-formed phrases, and that \"people\" dominates \"the\" and \"interesting.\" But \"very people\" is badly formed, while \"very interesting\" is good. Thus \"interesting\" governs \"very.\" At the sentence level, the verb is taken (mainly by convention) to govern subject, object, and complements. It also appears to be by convention, rather than substitution criteria, that prepositions and conjunctions become governors of their phrases. Directed arcs, labeled by their syntactic function, connect a governing term and its dependents.","Detailed examples of dependency analysis are offered in several different languages, and the process of metataxis is explained in BOOKS RECEIVED Books listed below that are marked with a t will be reviewed in a future issue.","Authors and publishers who wish their books to be considered for review in Computational Linguistics should send a copy to the Book Review Editor at the address below.
