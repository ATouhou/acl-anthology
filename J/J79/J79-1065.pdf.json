In keeping with the Resident's Addrpss 4 hortatory tone of a sermon, however, I'm going to point out some ways in which I feel we've neglected our intellectual responsibilities The first and most immediate way is in the response, *or lack of it, to fundamental criticism of the field as a whole To my knowledge there has been no intellectually serious response to the extended arguments, famfliar to all of us, which have called the viability of most of the field into question I refer to the philosophi cal arguments of Dreyfus, the moral arguments of Weizenbaum, and the pragmatic aiguments of Lighthill (I am aware that these arguments were raised a9gait?st artificial intelligence research generally, but each of the authors includes In his indictment much of the reeearch that is taking place in computational lingufstics today","paragraphs":[")"]},{"title":"I have seen prenty of attacks on these people More than one person, for example Has observed to me that a computer beat Dreyfus at chess, the insinuation being a Samuel Johnson-like \"Thus I refute Dreyfus, 11 when of course this has nothing whatsoever to do with his arguments I have heard a person whom I respect hlghly call Weizenbaum's thoughtful, anguished book \"terrible, anti-science \" The defensive reactions which appeared In the literature upon the appearance of the Lighthill report were In the spirit of political fervor, calls to solidarity with our British colleagues, rather than reasoned rebuttals to Lighthill's principdl charges But attacks are not arguments If the critlcal arguments are bad, they should be easy to refute with better ones, if they are good, if we cannot refute them, then intellectual respons~bility demands that we alter our outlook and our praotlces to conform to them. A failure to respond at all, a retreat into mutual self-assurance and a search for converts to the cause among studentsalfd the uninformed general public, not only violates intellectual responsibility but also leads to in-creading intellectual isolation, as disinterested members of thee in-tellectual community observe the one-sldedness of the ddbate and draw tfieir own conclusions accordingly Perhaps these comments make clear the reasons for my choice Q£ text President's Address The second way in which I think our intellectual responsibilities demand more of us than we now do bas to do with the future of the field, the way we train graduate students in computational linguistics About nine years Kvno and Oettinger published in the - CACM a graduate curriculum in computational lingtfistics.

Opinions may differ on this, but I would say that a fully qualified professional in computational linguistics should not only have mastered computer science and linguistics proper (and by \"mastered\" I mean at the ABD graduate level in both discip*lines), but should also have had more than casual exposure to experimental psychology, to appreciate-the discipline of experimental evidence for the validation of models, and to analytic philosophy, to the extent of controlling the philosophical literature on the metaphysics and epistemology of the minds-machine controversy, which goes so directly to the roots af the science, as we discussed previously Perhaps I am poorly informed, being out of direct contact with graduate education, but it is my impression that in many if not all graduate programs in computational linguistics, a high degree of programming skill and survey-level exposure to linguistics are the major requirements for writing a thesis in computational linguistics Many people, of course, acquire expertise in","paragraphs":["other"]},{"title":"pertinent competencies, to their credit; but a graduate curriculum is really a definition of the field, a tangible projection","paragraphs":["of"]},{"title":"our image of what the field is really about, and I would maintain that our intellectual responsibility is to broaden that image from what idt is at present President's Address","paragraphs":["6"]},{"title":"The thlrd and final responsibity I would urge on you is our responsibility to the educated citizenry at large The most direct way that academic members 6f our profession have of meeting that responslblity is in the teaching of undergraduates, liberal arts students who are not RnjOrS in computer science or llnguistics A course in \"Language and Computers\" or the like can perform the vital function of demystifying the computer, of teaching the future business-men and politicians and teachers of our society the capacities and the limitationa of this large and growing social force I think that an undergraduate computational llnguistics course can be more effective in this way","paragraphs":["that"]},{"title":"the standard introductory programing course I also think ,that, properly taught,","paragraphs":["it"]},{"title":"can lead to a greater of humanistic values, of the","paragraphs":["uniqueness"]},{"title":"and Significance of human beings, than most courses in the humanities As a practicalmatter, in the growing number of inst~rutions where there 1s a premium on undergraduate enrollments in departmental courses, such a course can be very popular A final Bibllcal text 1s one that I will apply to myself","paragraphs":["at"]},{"title":"this point, whlch I should probably have heeded earlier.

The major avenues of approach injclude the numerous fedml goyc-cnt programs, voluntary health as so cia tîand the hundreds of fou~~dations,","Crovcxnmtntal sources are well documented and specrfrc, It takes only a familiarity mth the necessary publications to be well mformcd and a great deal of time to research them. In this area, the publications I find moat valuable are the Catdog of Fsdsraf Domsstic Assstance, NIH Guade, Fedeml Reester, Comns+ce Busrnsss Dady, NlH Pragram Announcements and Gurde to NIH Programs and Awards Other sources include the Dtrectoty of Ressarch Grants, Medacal Research Fudtng Bullehn and Fundmg Sources an Health and Alltsd FislrkF","Vofuntary Health Associations also provide adquate descriptions-of their programs and qpplication ~cdures, although it takes work to ferret out all that exist and obtain detatlcd information The number and rango of voluntary associations can be determined by coerulting the list of the National Health Council, Inc. aab by monitoring refereneta such as the Annwl Regrstcrr of Grunt Support and the Grants Regzster","Private foundat~ons are, for the most part. another matter as their dcscriptiona in the Foundatton Datsctory, Fouridatton News Foundat~on Grunts Index and other publications ore often gcncrd or vague and getting more detailed information may be difficult Many administrators am kami1iar mth governmental and association funding sources, but frquently find the foundation field b more obscure.","Foundations ddfer from govern. mental and-voluntary heath associations in their funding source.

Therefore, foum dation monies available for graau are usually dependent upon stock Researching"]},{"title":"Foundations","paragraphs":["Thia was dramatitally illustrated","born 1973 to 1974 when the Ford","Foundation asseta dropped horn a","market value of $3 billioh to $2","billion, the Rockefeller also went","down a third and Mott, Kettering","Duke and Luct declined as much aa","a half with a resulting drop in awards made and often a concommitant reduction ixl staff. There goee your job securitp! Many individuals were cauet in the repercussions of a flagging economygrantors and grantees alike.","For a tong time foundations held large amounts of stock in one or a few companies. Although the market value of these assets may have been high, it was not necessarily reflected in income. Many foundations with large assets awarded very few grants. To some members of Congress, a foundation's holdings of large blocks of stock was a way of controlling cornpanies and resulted now and then in \"self-dealing \" Another problem was that the foundation, in its prtfcrential tax position, was a public trust, set up for philanthropic purposes. Yet, if the dividends wwen't forthcoming, no monies went into the public domain for which the foundation was ostensibly created. Thus, the Tax Refonn Act of 1969 came into being. The measure in-sisted upon diversification of stock holdings, insuring a better return and a reasonable amount of funds being expended each year. To obtain this, Congress mandated a minimum payout, starting at the beginning of the phase in period in 1972, of 4.5% to 6% of their assets by 1975.","This should have been good news to those seeking funds but the ultlmatc benefits perhaps have not fully materialized due to the nation's economy. It appears hopeful. however, that this depressed economic period is about over and that we are entering a time of growth in foundation activity.","How then to make foundation approaches? First, one sMould be ourc that a project fall8 as much as possible within the IEownda tion's purview. S~COP~, one should determine thc form of application required. In lieu of substantive idormation derived fmm PMU~ repmi or specific foundationn instmctions, it is safe to say that a letter of inquiry is the preferred contact.","Despite my years of experience. 1 find it difficult to convince faculty members that a brief letter of two or three pages is the correct method of approach. Yet, such is the case even with very Iarge foundations such as The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. It is co,unterproductive lo prepare a full proposal or send one that has either been turned down by NIH or even been approved without funding and submit it to a founda tion.","Why, you might ask? A review of foundation annual reports npould makc it clear. The first year that I joined the Hartford Foundation, with a staff of six, only two of whom reviewed proposals and handled all administrative functions, we made 100 awards (one of ten proposals) for a total of $14 million. Small staffs hold down the administrative cost, allowing more money for the foundation' s programs. This is something everyone should want.","Admidstra tivdy , an institution should try to control the flow of requests to foundations. There are those foundations that will only fund one grant at a particular institution during a given year, and only want to receive one application at a time. SOIII~ will consider two, and others more, but that should bc Researching Foundations researched. At times, 1 have found foundation officials becoming very disturbed over multiple submissions of which the institution's officials were unaware. One must appreciate the role of the reviewer(s) eduating proposals for a foundation because, for the most part, they are sincerely trying to objcctivcly decide where their limited bds can be spent to achieve the greatest good for society; an awesoma responsibility considering the many requests they receive. Making their job easier by keeping your ptoposal within. their area of inteiest and conforming to their statctl application procedures can only serve fiur own objectives.","In preparing a letter of proposal, remember that clarity is of the utmost importance. Often you will be addressiag a well-informed laymen. Make it easy to perceive what you plan to do, how yau plan to do it and why your idea differs Erom other approaches. Stress the originality of your protocol. Usually give a round figure budget per year for the number of years you are seeking support. Attach a curriculum vitae, pertinat papers and information about your bstitution, including a ux exempt letter. These data are especially important if this is your instinttion's first contact with the f~undation. It is also wise to have your institutional authorized official counttraign the letter to show that pour project has administrative ap proval. I! human experimentation is involved, tell them you will send on the approval of your Ruman Studies Committee it they are interested in your project.","The question of personal contact comes up often when discussing foundation submissions. There arc almost as many answers as there arc foundations. If this means trying to we the fact that someone ipvolvcd with your institution knows a foundation trustee, I would gtncrally say it serves no purpose at least where larger foundations arc concerned. A ld foundation might be a different matter. At the Hartford Foundation, when a trustee received a direct communique, he referred it to the administrative staff for the customary review, which I always felt was admirable. Judgments, hopefully, will be made on the merits of a proposal, not on the basis of whom someone knows.","On the other hand, prcconsultation by phone is recommended. It is also appropriate to ask in tht letter of inquiry for a personal interview which would allow the investigator and/or perhaps the research officer to answer questions and describe the project in greater depth. Conkidering foundation's small staffs, however, I would not push for this pefsonal contact.","As for a brief description of a foundation's review process, the proposal is first reviewed for originality of approach and its correspondence to the foundation's stated objectives. Further considerations may be similarity to already supported research, number of projects funded or under consideration at an institution, etc.","If the project survives the initial review, a fuller propeal is usually requested. The detailed proposal is frequently sent to experts in the field fox comment. If this review is affirmative, a concise project description and the evaluation of the rtvicwer(s) is presented for consideration to the hard of Trustees and aq award ie made.","One Iast word for research administrators. As excellent as the government publications are, of the thousand programs described perhaps only a third pertain to the medical field in which I am, in-volved. Then, many relate only to state and local educational and krvice agencies. Therefore, the need arises for a personal list, containing those areas involving only private or public non-profit educational institutions. This problem is skirted by many administrators by simply giv-ing out a few standard, well-known sources. But considering the tight money situation, I feel an administrator should provide a huly comprehensive list."]},{"title":"American Journal of Computational Linguistics","paragraphs":["Microfiche 65 : 22"]},{"title":"NATIONAL SCIEtJCE FOUNDATION - LINGUISTICS PROGRAN - GRANT LIST The following frames contain a list of research","paragraphs":["grants awarded by the NSF through"]},{"title":"its Linguistics Program during the Fiscal Year 1976, July 1, 1975 - June 30, 1976, and the Transition Quarter, July 1, 1976 - September 30, 1976.

These knowledge sources are integrated with sophisticated signal processing and acoustic-phonetic analysis of the input signal, to produce a total system for understanding continuous speech. The system contains components for signal analysis, acoustic parameter extraction, acoustic-phonetic analysis of the signal, phonological expansion of the lexicon, lexical matching and retrieval, syntactic analysis and prediction, semantic analysis and prediction, pragmatic analysis and prediction, and inferential fact retrieval and question answering, as well as synthesized text or spoken output.
