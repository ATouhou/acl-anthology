These judges a l so made rn t i ng6 of teletyped interviews uith psychiatric patients and uith a random versiors of PARRY1. The mean ratings of PARRYI along the dimension of linguistic noncomprehens i on were better than those received- by RANDOM-PARRY but uere 'three times- worse than the heah tatings received by patients. Once the ratings of PARRY2 along this dimension are completed, ue wi I1 be able to compare them uith those of PARRY1 and the patients and obta7n a more objective measure of improvement.
