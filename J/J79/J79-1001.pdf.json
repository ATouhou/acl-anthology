The aim of the publication is to report curreht research. promptly and to announce meetings, conferences, courses, publications, and other activities of interest and imp~ytance to computational linguists. AJCL is the official journal of the Associatioh for Computational Linguistics, which published Mechanicall Translation until 1968 and The Finite String until 1973. ACL's Executive Committee in 1968 decided to publish a new journal under a three-point policy. ACL appoints the editor and editorial board, thus controlling policy. A large working editorial board and adequate clerical support assures timeliness. AJCL attempts to review submissions withim a month. Microfiche publication permits distribution of programs, grammars, dictionaries, illustrations, etc. The grant provides for extensive mailing of announcements and sample issues in order to develop a full subscription list as quickly as possible."]},{"title":"American Journal of Computational Linguistics","paragraphs":["Microfiche 1 ?

Indeed, such a survey would be a massive baok in itself since it would include much work from computer science, linguistics, psychology, philosophy and logic. The literature that is discussed is presented only in support of the author's argument that the ai-m of language analysis is, and always has been, not the judgement of the degree of grammaticality but the explication of meaning. The bibliography and literature discussion~also remind the reader of the slow pace of publishing. The book was published in 1972 and reports on wdrk substantially completed by 1968 [5].
