For: the present, we heve confined the dewin of the system to the field of elamentary ehemlistrj where we can describe the semantic world in rather concrete terms At the same ti=, various compleu- events occur ln this field For example, substances which partleipate in part~cular events may disappear, new substances may emerge, or some properties of the substance? may be altered To treak these comple situations, it was necessarv to formally represent relationships between events and cl~aages of state and to devise an appropriate schema of representing context, In mst appr~ache~ to the understanding of natural barlgunpe tl~roupk artificial intelligence, schemas which entail rigid logical operations are used to represent both knowledge and context Loglcal operatlons appear to be necessary for solving some kinds of problems in natural language, especially at the deep deductive level of unders tandlng. However, lntui tlwe reasoning is not easily formalized in terms of loglcal operatlons It is our contention that intuitive reasoning 1s completely based on the language activity in the human brain Associative functions relating to semantic similarities between words, semantic depth of an interpretation and probability of associative occurrence of events are inherent factors in intuitive understandinn and the seasoning process, Y.
