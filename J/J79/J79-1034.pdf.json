This paper presents a formal ism cal led Semantic Processing Scheme, SPS, for use in describing semantic interpreters. SPS is a rule-based system with a rule-ordering scheme that can produce deep case structures from phrase-structure trees. It was originally developed to demonstrate how English prepositions, such as \"up\", \"down\", and \"through\", which reference location, motion, and orientation in space could be semantically interpreted. This paper presents SPS in its current form and shows how it can Landle these prepositions, call ed the locative prepositions. SPS is continuing to be used in studies of semantic processing.

This is in contrast to the pragmatic level, where situation-specific information is used to interpret the semantic structures. In sumnary, a system employing SPS would construct syntactic trees, use SPS for the production of Case structures, and employ a pragmatic processing scheme to interpret these structures.

As the above example shows, the registers are used here in situations where mare than one event/state results from a clause.

SPS allows for this by automaticall v associating variables with the S and NP nodes in trees.

The maans of progresslng through a constl tuent and assurlng its complete Interpretation Is provlded by forced anchor! ng and marking schemes embedded in the rules.

A formal ism for writing semantic interpreters, SPS, has been described, It alfows for a semantic feature scheme that can describe the restrictions on locative prepositions. SPS also has registers that can be used for these restrictions and for building up the case structures that represent the meadings of locatives. A rule-ordering scheme is also heloful here. It car] be said that SPS is a good vehicle for dterpreting locative prepositions, and that any system for semantic Interpretation with these features will be able to analyze locatives. We do not claim that SPS is a cornpl etely successful semantic interpreter. However, the formalism seems to be clear and expressive and it does work for locative prepositions which, to the authors' knowledge, have not been as effectively dealt with elsewhere. It could well provide the basis for a uniform, coherent structure for semantic interpretation, especial ly for Case analysi-s.

PARSING AND IXlEKP~ION USING NEIFXlRKS ~raditionally, the object of pars- sentences has been to outwt syntactic trees. These trees serwd as inpt to scamtic mutines charged with the generation of mmiq stn&ures. Whgrad (1972) and kbds (1970) tried, wtth sarre degree of suaxss, to integrate the tm processes an3 use each process to guide the other process. shank (1972) and Wilks (1973) have stressed that syntactic processing was secordary to nwning analysis and should be necessary only when the resolution of ambiguity by meaning analysis alone had failed. Utilizing netmrk meaning representatbns the parsing phase is rkmst ccmpletely smtically orient&. QE important q-product m the methcd to be described is the detection of the correct sense of naninals, modifiers and actions. The parsing weeds as follows. Words, in a clause that has been classif3ed2 are i3camed fmn left to right in search of a suitable cardidat& for an action. Once found, the senme is separated into ( (FIRST PAKI?)

Thus X, in this case, wuld represent ap AKtM?SE rvJnindl capable of \"giving\". This is very similar to what Shcank does when parsing in conceptual dependency theory. If the wrds in the surface utterance do rmt satisfy the constraints for arguments of the predicate being examined, it is due to one of four reasons. First, alternab syntactic constructions could exist. Secohd, a different sense of the qctiorr is \"correct\". Third, the particular action cadidate in question is not the action of the clause. Finally, sane other reason, like slang expressions might be the cause. Whenever arguments fail to satisfy predicates, a search for alternative inplication templaw begins. The result of this search is shclwn quite clearly J in Figure 11 of Section IV for tbe ternary predicate \"give\". In that example \"give\" is u&d syntactically in two different £om to distinguish the indirect object, one with the preposition TO and one witbut.

Cases are not view& as conceptually primitive binary relations as Filhre (1968) and res~ar~hers influenced by him, notably Schank (1972), view than. In a case structured system the central ncde would denote a specific action or process with the property that it is a \"giving\" and involves John, the book, and bkzy as agent, object, and Pecipient respectively.

Nevertheless the mtion of an \"agent\" to depend in part on causal priority of a state of the supposed agent in the sequence of states mer consideration, and in part on the extent to which purpsive behaviour can be ascribed to the supposed agent in general, and in part to the extent to which the particular sequence of states which he initiated can be assum3 to be intentional on his part.
