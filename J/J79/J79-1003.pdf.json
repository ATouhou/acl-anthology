This does not mean doing away completely with representations and procedures which computers have traditionally used, but adding new representations and procedures which they have not used. People often store and communicate imprecise, incomplete, and unquantified info tion; they aften assert truth or falsity in relative terms; and they seldom seem to use rigorous logic in their inferential processes. Because of these conditions, people s,eem to have an almost infinite info tion processing capacity, with inference making and problem solving abilities more refined and far more flexible than any existing computer program.

Since the zon jungle and Xndonesfa produce rubber, the tutor could have said WN~W on the basis of the mismtch between the Chaea and those regions, with respect to climate and raidfall. A positive and negative analogy subroutine has been implemented in SCHOLAR. It is a fallback strategy to be used icf them is not enough info tfsn stared calculate ae functional relationship. For a functional analogy it is only necessary to know the functionally relevant altrfiutes and Uaeir relative importance. Then SCHOLAR looks to see if it knows any similar objects where the property in question is in fact stored. It tries to find a match or a mismatch by comparing the gioen object and the similar object with respect to their values on the Eunctiollally relevant attributes. People frequently uae such analogical reasoning, probably because of the ill-defined nature of their knawledge about functional relations. The laet example in Figure 3 sh&s the use of a functional relation to anewer a @Whyw question. The population density of a place depends on an indefinite set of functional determinants: climate, soil, and rainfall are major ones but distance from the sea, the par'icular continent, presence of valuable minerals, all contribute in different ways. The tutor picked one determinant t had a value inapprgpriate for a large population density and gave that as a reason.
