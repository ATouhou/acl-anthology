Empiricism and rationalism are epistemological theories that have no direct bearing on theory construction and theory testing. To conclude, Jacobson should make a distinction between the theory construction stage and the theory testing stage of scientific activity, and l'eave room for hunches and biased intuitions as well as unbiased empirical data.

His account of this relation is therefore deficient. For neither stylistically impropriate, nor syntactically or semantically deviant sentences do occur in Jacobson's type of corpus. (A clumsy sentence marks stylistically impropirate uses, while a bad sentence marks syntactic or semantic deviance.) Hence he cannot tell whether a sentence is absent because it is deviant or because it is stylistically impropriate. Elicitation tests, of course, could distinguish between the two cases. Maybe stylistic factors play no role here, but they can only be excluded by empirically based results. Jacobson also has"]},{"title":"a","paragraphs":["problem with his discrete categories. On p. 9 and p. 49 he states that his taxonomy requires countable items and cannot therefore use the concept of a continumn. Hence Jacobson has to find a way to classify preverbs that gives rise to rather sharp boundaries, but I do not think that he has succeeded in d6ing bhis. This shows a weakness in his theoretical framework. On p. 23 Jacobson characterizes what preverbs do syntactically and semantically. Syntactically verb phrase preverbs modify the verb, and sentence preverbs modify the clause to which they belong to. semantically verb phrase preverbs characterize processes or states; sentence adverbs characterize propositions (i.e., the semantic contents of the sentences or clauses'), acts o.f communication, and events or circumstances. However, these functions are not unique to preverbs. This leads one to wonder why is the adverb position before the main verb should be interesting enough to warrant a special label. (If Barbara Partee is right it is even harder to motivate a special label.) What do preverbs have"]},{"title":"in","paragraphs":["common that is exclusive to them besides their position? If it is only their position, one could just as well study grdups of adverbs called \"presubjects\" or \"postverbs\" too. It should also be mentioned that Jacobson's characterization of the functions of verb phrase and sentence adverbs is inadequate. (14 On p. 23 Jacobson says that a preverb-can presuppose that the proposition expressed by the sentence the preverb occdrs in states a fact. Now according to Enrique Delacruz, \"presuppose\" can have three distinct senses: 1) A sentence p may presuppose a sentences p*, 2) The speaker of a sentence p may presuppose a proposition P* r 3) A predicate or verb V may presuppose a sentence p*. It is not clear to me which of these senses of \"presepposel' Jacobson has in mind. Here Jacobson could avoid this unclarity. I disagree with Jacobson's statement on p. 25 that the generation of a preverb is often hinted at by means of a paraphrase which is less remote from deep structure than the preverb itself. Ray Jackendoff has shown that this type of paraphrase does not"]},{"title":"work","paragraphs":["in general and hence,"]},{"title":"is of limited usefulness.

Similarly, his phrase \"sentence praverbs that are derivable from sentences on different levels in the structural hierarchy\" needs more explanation"]},{"title":"to","paragraphs":["be comprehensiblel Jacobson goes on to expound on pp. 25-27 what I consider to be a confused and erroneous view, namely that a preverb can simultaneously be both a sentence and verb phrase modifier. He explains this in terms of a notion of l'coalesencel' (i.e., double derieation). But coalesence simply indicates that the sentence in question is ambigious. Consider, for example, the following example given by Jacobson: \"They were suddenly attacked.\" One reading that (corresponding to the case where wsuddenlyf' is a sentence adverb) is that there was an attack on them that was sudden. The other reading [correspondihg to the case where \"suddenly\" is a verb phrase adverb) is that they were attacked"]},{"title":"in","paragraphs":["a sudden manner. These two readings have different truth-conditions, and the sentence is therefore two-way ambigious. The preverb is a sentence adverb m one reading and a verb phrase adverb on the other, but never simultafieously both. Jacobson oonsiders a managable- number of preverb classes on p. 49. His ~Lassification is based on syntactic and semantic criteria. Now it is relevant to ask why syntactic and semantic criteria taken together should delimit natural preverbal classes. It might be that some classes of preverbs are syntactically natural while others are semantically natural, but not both, and vice versa. After all, syntax has mainly to do with the distribution of morphemes that determines the well formedness conditions for a natural language, whereas semantics has mainly to do with the information contained in the sentences that accounts for which inferences are valid in a wide sense of the term \"valid1'. Jacobson fails to show that his combined sytltactic and semantic criteria do indeed delimit natural classes of preverbs.

Intra-Clausal temporal preverbs denote a large variety of temporal aspects, namely the following: point of time, e.g., today; duration, e.g., long, frequency, e.g., often, temporal proximity, e.g., soon, and preceding coinciding and subsequent time in relation to the moment of speaking or writing, e.g., before, now, and later.
