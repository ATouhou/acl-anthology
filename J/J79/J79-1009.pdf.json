THEQRETICAL ISSUES (5) Are there still significant aspects of human language use which they cannot account for? (6) What is the best model of human lanquage use that can be assembled out of the concepts that nave been developed in computational linguistics, linguistics, P psychology, and artificial intelligence? (7) How well does it really -approxima%e what humans do with language? (8) With respect to gaps in the model, is thefe any-thing currently in the wind-adequate to complete them? Thus our primary purpose is both to provide an assessment of our mowledge and goals in this area .with respect to language processing and to provide a cross-disciplinary tutorial for the participants. A secondary purpose of the ~orkshop is to discuss the important issue of valid methodology in such research. In eight ses:sisions, speakers will address the audience on points made by themselves or others in posimtioh papers pxeviausly distributed to all participants. After these presentations are finished, speakers and audience will take part in general discussions. MOT I VAT1 ON AND GOALS In recent years, researchers in several disciplines have been converging on the problem of language understanding and memory as providing a handle on the problems in their own fields. Researchers in Artificial Intelligence, conce.rnad with building models of intelligent behavior, have.started to develop and study models of conversational interaction, which naturally rely on models of language understanding. This is often done without reference to the work of researchers in other disciplines. Lingui,sti-cs, of course, has always been concerned with language, but \"frequently at no level higher than that of the sen-. fence. Such theories as derived fkom the consideration of sinale sentences out of context are diffioult to apply to the task of understanding. Recently*some linguists such as Chafe have shifted thelr emphasis towards understanding and modelling dis-"]},{"title":"course,","paragraphs":["which is af"]},{"title":"direct","paragraphs":["relevance"]},{"title":"to","paragraphs":["questiorls of understanding. Psychologists have also been interested in problems of language understanding and memory. While early research did look to l~.nguistics to p-ovide plausible theories of human language behavior the then-curtent theories proved insufficient to the task. As a result, some psychologists have begun to create their own theories, while others have begun to pay attektion to the wark of A1 researchers. Computer models are now appearing which are ex-. pli-,cations of these theories: In the field of computational linguistics, the challenge of building computer systems which can carry on fluent and helpful dialogues with a user has dlso shifted the emphasis in the field from more efficient parsers to mote capable understanders, In spite of this convergence of many different disciplines on the same problem, there is sqrprisingly little communicat.ion between researchers in the different fields, apart, from occasional discovery of nrelevant paper$ in one field by members of anm-other. Without conferenqes of the sort that we are proposing, there is. no opportur)ity for the individual researchers in these different fields to talk to each othek directly. Th'e value of SUCR face-to-face confrontation and the opportunity for asking questions and sxploring tne applicability of techniques in areas other than the ones"]},{"title":"that","paragraphs":["the author had"]},{"title":"in","paragraphs":["mind are well appreciated.

It is equally obvious that all this is far beyond the linguist's reach at the present staae of linquistic knowledge. In order to arrive at a practical solution of this problem one swould impose sorre restrictions on the process of FIT. In other words, certiain criteria of the quality of translation shohld be formulated, and if necessary and possible, lowered. One might try to restrict the output of an MT system in khe sense that it should certainly not produce what the user does not actually need It is evident that the user of a translation of a scientific or techniml text will not require as much finesse and subtlety as the user of a translation of a literary text. So~e (e.9. Garvin) are prepared to go even further and construct system which would produce clearly inadeouate though still tolerable translations (in a swense nobody has even suc~~eeded in defining) in order to gain in speed,. Now, when \"machine-aided translation\" or similar approaches are suggested, a restriction is imposed on what the computer is supposed (and thought of as capable), to ao. The restriction on the input in RSA determines,. 01 course', sore restrictions on the output (but, certainly, not to the extent RESTRICTGD SUBLANGUAGES of tolerating barely acceptable tran~lations'). On &he other hand, rather on the contrary, the simplicity and easier observability of the material of a restricted sublanguage0mak,e automatic translation feasible, allowing at* the same time and Cor the same reason for the total accountability of the sublanquage which makeg it possible to account for and use for the practical purposes of translation all the complex semantic and pragmatic in/fomation which might be relevant for translqtion. Of course, what makes it. possiblg is that the degree of complexity of such information in the restructea sublanguage is very much inferior to what might be observed in language as a whole. What follows, However, is that restricting the input of an MT syste~ to a sublanguage of a certain type RSA ensures high quality translation within the sublanguage and no further restrictions or lowering of the quality of translation is necessary. It should'be mentioned at. this point that RSA shares wsth \"nachine-aided translation\" the property of requiring a limited amount of predetermined and routine huvan participation prior to automatic processing. Syn'tax and semantics, lexicon and grammar. One of the major claims of RSA is that, at least in applications to restricted sublanguages, intricabe and labor-consuming syntactic alg~r~thms (cf. Me1 cuk, 1964) are redundant.
