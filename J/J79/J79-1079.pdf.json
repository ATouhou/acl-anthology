In the case of yes-no questions, the goal is that the hearer modify his model of the world such that in that world the speaker wants the heaker to tell him whether the fact questioned is true. In the case of imperatives, the goal is that the hearer modify his model such that in that world the speaker wants the hearer to bring about the truth of the ordered fact, and that certain social consequences will follow From non-compliance.","The raw datum of comprehension, then, is not the sentence or the proposition, but the fact that a certain speech act has occurred.

There is, for example, a general principle of ceteris paribus that comes into play in consideration of alternative worlds. Roughly, when constructing a model of a world alternative to some point-of-reference world*(usuall~ the real one), the hearer wi 11 assume, lacking evidence (from assertion or inference) to the contrary, that the alternative world is consistent with the point-ofi reference world in a1 1 relevant respects, To take an extreme example, if sonSeone is telling me about life on Arcturus, I will assume that the laws of physics are the same there as on earth, unless something the speaker says leads me to be1 ie~e otherwise.

Olson","Ontario Institute for Studies in Education Toronto, Candda Abstract It is conventional to treat the meaning of an utterance in a discourse in terms of two components, the pPOpositiona1 and the pragmatic or speech act component, the first indicating the meaning of the sentence, the second indicating its intended use by the speaker. Some arguments and evidence are presented to show that these two systems are interde-pendent. Roughly, it appears that social considerations, primarily status, determine ,which aspects of a proposition are lexicalized in the-utterance. Thus, a child with high status relative to his interlocutor may use a command, \"Give me a block\", while ~f he has low status relatlw to his interlocutor he may use a request, \"[lay I have 3 block?\" If he is an equal, a peer, (and perhaps only then) he w~ll use an explicit true proabsition such as, \"You have two more than mer1. Cnly &this third case 1s the propositional meaning expllcit in the sentence pez se, and only in this case is an affirmative or negative response dependent strlctly upon truth conditions (on assent rather than compliance). This concept of the social aspects of aaning is examined through an analysis of what is said vS what is meant in some child-child and teacher-child conversations. Theories of human cognition have gradually ad-justed their accounts of perception and of knowledge to the fact that neither perception nor knowledge are simple copies of the environmental prior experience, but rwher to the social relatrions in which those knowledge structures are constructed. Theories advanced under the banner of the \"sociology sf knowledge\" have claimed that the structures of knowledge and perception reflect the or~anizing properties of the social system in which the experiences occur and are assimilated. This line of argument 1s usually attributed to Durk-Keim. According to his biographer Steven Lukes (1935) the cognitive processes reflect directly-the social aad political structures of a society. \"Conceptual thought, was,\" Durkheim Qaimed, \"social and nothlng but an extensioh of society\" (Lukes, 1973, pp. 23-24) and again, \"Logical life has its fjrst source in society\" (Lukes, 1973, p. 441). In an admirable colJ.ection of essays and monographs, Ilary Douglas (1975) takes up and extends the Durkheimian view. With Durkheim, she claitns that: \"...ideas rest on classification. Ultimately any form of knowledge depend on principles of classification. But these principles arise out of soclal experience,. sustain a given social pattern and themselves are sustained by it. If this guideline and base is grossly disturbed, knowledge itself is bt rlsk\" (p. 245). Specifically, she argues that the dlscriminatlng principles as to what is clean and yhat is polluted and what generally is \"against nature\" is derived from social structure. Nature is classified in such a way as to uphold the social order--thus in a social order In which men are status-dodnant over women and children it seems only natural that women and children be assigned low-status duties such as dish-washing. events that occasion them, ~runer's (1957) \"New Taken in their boldest form, these theories argue ~ook\" in percept ion, which was devoted to showing that knowledge is soclally constructed; there are the role of hypotheses, expectancies and set on close tles between the soclal order and the concep-the processes of perceptual recognition along tual order. But how does this social order affect, with Bartlett's (1977) analyses of the role of CQ* to be affected, or otherwise interact with \"schema\" in remembering helped to relativize the the conceptual order? accounts of the relation between stimulus and perception or between reality and knowledge. Naw, however, we are asked to make our accounts of huma?~ cognition even more relative as not only to innate categories, and to expectancies based on Paper prepared for Theoretical Issues in Natural Language Processing (TINLAP-2). Urbana, University of Illinois, July 25-27, 1978. I am indebted to Ed Sullivan and Frank Smith for our lively discussions of these issues, and to Canada Council for support. Most of the theorles which attempt to relate social structures to cognitive ones have postulated_symbols as the mediating link. Symbols are culturally designed and they aye acquired by childrebfor use in comnunication and for the interpretation of, experience. But where in a symbol sys&m, such as language, shall (we looh for evidence of their relation to social structures? The best known of these theories of th'is relation such as those of Vygotsky (1962), Bruner (1966) or Whorf (1956) have tried to isolate the social constraints on the semantic, propositional side of language rqther than the social, interpersonal or pragmatic side D£ language. In so doing they followed the then-predominant focus of linguistic and semiotic theory. Theories of symbols have tended to emphasize the semantic, denotative or referential side of meaning at the expense of the social, pragmatic ot interpersonal side ofbmeaning. In his classical treatment of symbol systems, Itelson Goodman (1968) focused e$clusively on the objective or informative or semantic aspects of symbols, that is, the relation that exists between the symbol and the event kt represents, denotes, expresses oa exemplifies. Chomsky (1972, p. 24) too, focuses on the logical or semantic aspects of meaning--that aspect of meaning which is invariant across the various functions to which a sentence mqy be put, in his theory of language. Studies of language and cognition have similarly focused on labels and on grammatical relations fn their attempts to find the relations between language and thinking. Hence Durkheim looked at classification systems, Vygotsky looked at the superordinate catewries, and \"scientific concepts\" Brwer and oreenfield looked in the structure of adjectives, Cole and Scribner looked in the structure of logical inferences and so on for-evidence of social-cultural differences. And indeed some indications of social differences have shown up in shose studies although thcy tend to reflect simply degrees of familiarity with a certain approach to problems primarily, \"learning to confine interpretation atq the text\" (Olson and Nickerson, 1978). There is however a second dimension of language which has been brought to the fore by recent analysis of the functions of language under the rubric of speech act theory. Sentences are now considered and analyzed both in terms of the propositional content of the sentence, traditionally the semantics or meanings of the language, and the pragmatic function, what one is attempting to do by means sf that sentBnce--promising, convincing, commanding, requesting, stating and9he like. Searle (1969) following Austin (1962) differentiates propositional acts of referring and predicating from illocationary acts qr stating, questioning, commanding, promising and so on, The same reference and predication can occur in the performance of completely different speech acts as in Searle's example : 1, Sam smokes habitually. 2, Does Sam smoke habitually? 3. Sam, smok; habitually! 4. Would that Sam smoked habitually. (p. 22). Halliday (1970, 1973) too, in his analysis of the functions of language, differentiated three primary functions of language--the ideational function, the interpersonal function and the textual function-- which jointly specify the s-cture of any particular utterance or series of utterances. Clark and Clark (1977) suggest that speakers and listeners of the language use two general principles in comprehending utterances, the \"reality principle\" and the \"cooperative principle\".

Note first that a symbol simultaneously serves two sorts of relations represented in the diagram by two dimensions of language--one dimension, represented by the horizontal axis in Figure 1, is that specifying the social relations between speaker1 writer and listener/audience ; the symbol expresses a social relation between speaker and listener. And the second dimension, represented by the vertical axis, is that specifying a relation between symbol and meaning or between signjfier and signified. The first we may call the social or interpersonal meaning of a eymbol and the second the logical meaning of that symbol, linguistic or otherwise. It is this horizontal dimension, the social one, which until recently has not been given its due. Moct studies of language for example have been devoted primarily to the syntactic/semaqtic meaning of words and sentences and the veridical relationships between sentences and the situations they represent. This is the aspect of language which most weakly reflects the social relations. And yet, as I mentioned above, this is the dimension of meaning that most hypotheses of the Dudcheimian sort- have focused upon. It is the horizontal relation, the relations between persons that promises to illuminr~te the relations between social and cognitive wtructures.

While this speech act analysis contributes importantly to the view that the meaning of a sentence is more than the proposition it expresses, that is, it explicates the function or pragmatics of language, it seems not to go far enough.

However, the important poir.t for us to notice is that the social relations between the speakers assumed by the three sentences is entirely different. The command assumes that the speaker has superior status to the listenel?, the request assumes a differential inferiority of the speaker and the declarative assumes, perhaps, the equality of the participants, The point I wish to emphasize is that an utterance is simultaneously doing two things--it is specifying the logical relation between symbol and referent, the vertical dimension of Figure 1, and it is specifying a social relation between the interlocuto'rs. Together, they contribute to the meaning of the symbol, utterance or expression. However, Searle's analysis is above all a theory of language. It is less a theory of the social structures that those linguistic structures construct and/or sustain. My concern here 1s to 'relate these two sets of structures. One of the most notable attempts to construct a br~dge between sociological theory and psychological theory of language and the cognitive processes is that of Bernstein and his collaborators (1971). Bernstein isolated two patterns of speech which, he claimed, mapped on to two social classes.

Middle class families he described a.s person-oriented. Duties and priviLedges were assigned to various roles, but a person was not permanently assigned to a fixed role but rather the role was contracted or negotiated with the other members of the social group, Duties, priviledges and responsibilities were assigned by a &iscussion and contract rather than being permanently as signed to particular individuals. Social theorists would recognize these patterns as essentially \"monarchist\" versus \"social contract'' political structures. In the first case the parent witn the highest status has the right to decree what family members are to do, he is awarded respect and he is assigned high status duties. Law status individuals are to be obedient and to accept responsibility for low status duties. In the latter case, such assignments are negotiated. th5se social differences translate directly into the linguistic patterns mentioned above. The former, relying primarily upon position and status require the close observance of status relations and a minimum of negotiation. For the middle class, the social contract requires a high degree of linguistic cmpetence in negotiating roles, rights, agreements and priviledges. Hence the latter can be expected to generate an elaborated code. Evidence for this theory has generally outweighed eviderrce against it but several writers have attributed the observed differences not to linguistic incompetence but to the cocial environments in which the data was collected, Labov (1972) for example found that speaker& of Black English Vernacular were eqsentially as adept with the language when they conversed with their peers as were white children.

However, working clqss children (more generally children from families with a positional, heirarchical structure) may be expected to assign themselves a - low status relative to various authoritie~ and assign interpretations on the basis of those status differentials more so than will middle clasq children. Thus, it may be predicted that if sentences which are,ambiguous representations of speech acts were presented to working class and mlddle class children, the former would tend to comply,that is to treat the statement as an indirect reque9t--while middle class children would tend to assent, that is to treat the statement as ability or information questions.

Many of our institutional practices can be seen as keeping people in their assigned status positions and language may be seen as one such means. Nice illustrations of these social-linguistic games have been presented by Gumperz (Note 2), Ervin-Tripp (1977) and Mitchell-Kernan and Kernan (1977). Gumperz reports a conversation between a husband &nd wift in which the husband asks \"Where's the paper?\" and the wife, with sme annoyance, replies \"1'11 get it.\" The first statement may be interpreted as either a request for locative information or an indirect request that she get him the paper. Her recognition of that dead possibility, that he, even if only in the back of his mind, wanted her to get him the paper, was the sou?ce of annoyance. Mi tchell-Kernan and Kernan' s (1977) example is even more apposite. In the course of a group discussion between an experimenter-teacher and a group of chiidren one child gave an indirect comnand to the adult who had her foot on a chair: \"I want that chair!\" with which the adult complied. Some of the other children gasped and said ttO-o-o-o Claudia, you gon' let her talk to you like that?\" (p. 205). The social message is obvious. You have to have status to give commands and the child did not have this status. The children were well aware of that aspect of meaning. Mitchell-Kernan* cites further examples of*precisely this social game-. Some of the children waul$ try commands on other children simply to see if the listener would comply, If they complied, the child issuing the command would have gained proof of his greater social status. When they tabulated the frequency of various kinds of \"directives\", Elitchell-Kernan and Kernan found that addressees who were loy-er in rank than the speaker received over five times as many directives as rhbse higher in rsnk (p. 203). They conclude: \"Directives and reactions to them were constantly used tb define, reaffirm, challenge, manipulate, and redefine status and rank. At times the directives involved actually served the ordinary fdnction of directives--that of requesting goods or services--while at the same time, because of their frequency of occurrence or the particular $om they took, served to test the addressee's view of the statuses ~nvolved\" (p. 201). Ervin-Trlpp (1977) too found a particular soclal d~stribution of various forms of directives in her studies of how children learn to honor various factors such as age, dominance, task and fam5liarity in making requests (p. 186)"]},{"title":".","paragraphs":["As these authors polnt out, directives are used only as instrumental means of carrying out pragmatic speech acts suitable to particular interpersonal and social conditions but also to accomplish certain interpersonal functions--primarily establishing and maintaining a social order, a status quo. In using these constructions, the chrld is simultaneously learning two interrelated pictures of reality--the nature of \"objective reality\", that is the propositional or knowledge system, and his place fn the social order--that is, who has a right to make requests, to Issue commands, and to make true descriptBons and so on. As argued above, this is because e;ery symbolic expression has a value on both of these dimensions. And I have suggested that these two dimensions are interdependent; descriptions are more apt to be assessed exclusively in terms of their truth in some social relations than in others. Less direcuevidence of the uses of status differentials in the speech patterns comes from studies of language in the classroom.

It appears that the right to ask questions was a high status perrogative. Furthermore, the questions were not slmply requests for information. The teacher already knew the answer--the point of the pues$ion was to see if the child knew the answer. The question serves primarily as a meank of holding students accountable for the information acquired from reading the ~ext. Whfle the utterances specify true facts, that is, relations between symbols and referents, the form that the proposition takes again depends upon the social relations between the interlocutors. Sinclair and Coulthard (1975) also found that many of the interrogative and declarative sentenqes used by teachers in fact served as-imperatives. For example, the statement \"~omebody 's talking,\" \"I see chewiag gum\" were not to be taken as true descriptions but as indirect commands. They called, as we prefer to state it, for compliance rather than assent. Goody (Note 3) in an interesting study of the forms of questioning among the Gonja oE Ghaaa, found that questions In that society were not merely mans of securing lnfoxmation but were primarily reflections of the stat& of the interlocutors. Hence, ch2ldren rarely asked questions, not because they had no need for information, but: rather because,asking a questlon of an adult would be to upset the social order. Goody comments : \"The secGring of in£ or&tion becomes secondary to consideratio& of status relations\" (p. 42, 1975). The surgace form of an utterance depends upon both the propositrional structure ahd on the pragmatic function. All sentences appear to do both slmultaneously--as we have suggesteki the symbol simultaneously stands in a specifiable relation to a meaning--1t represents a proposktion--and In a specifiable relation to the speaker and his listener Both of these dimensions may be invariant across some set of transformations. Different sentences mag assert the same proposition, as for example actlve and passive sentences or declaratives and questions. Presumably, as well, sentences with different propositional content may be used to constr9ct or malntain the same social relatlon between interlocutors. There is presumably more vnan one way to be obsequious and more than one way to be insubordinate.

However, even ~f they may be differentiaad, it is important to notice that those two dimensions, the loglcal and the social are not independent.

And what are the conditions under which an utterance will be judged as an order, or a request for action?

Lisa, technically speaking, tells a lie. (Recall that sne was the one who counted them). But her denial was not merely one of falsehood. She knows that if she agreks to the truth 6f Jamie's statement, she will have to turn over some of the blocks. That she doesn't want to do so,she denies the statement. My guess is that that is what all libs are--tampering wlth truth value for social or personal ends. Truth, like falsehood is motivated. More than that. Lisa is not denying the truth of Jamie's statement simply in the service of social ends. Rather, 3 would guess, she does not know any means of simultaneously meeting both the social and logical criteria. Paul, the teacher does, ilote his reply when Jamie appeals to him. The prebupposition of his sentence is that Lisa has more. Rather than deny it, ile presupposes It and uses his sentence to hold that no redistribution i!4 required, presumably on the premise that possession is nine-tenths of the law. \\hat I would like to suggest from this example is that truth c~nditions are not separated from social utility. Claims of truth will be advanced primarily if the gaining of assent implies compliance with some social goal. Symetrically, denials of truth will be offered if the social consequence of assent are perceived to be undesirable. It is at this point that social relations enter into the language. Micro social orders, small scale transactions, like the one mentioned above, involve the solution of small-scale interpersonal problems ~vhich must be solved either for individual machiavellian goals or for shared srcial goals. The main problem is how to secure compliance, agreement or at least to prevent the loss of the status quo (An interesting expression). That may be done by several means, direct action, commanding, pleading, or hard negotiation on a common ground. Facts are one such ground, which as we have seen, are overlooked if thev are embarassing; authority is another such ground, which as we have seen, tries to gzt involved or take sides. Disputes in the larger social order appear to be solved on somewhat similar means. As Foucault (1971) pointed out, different-social orders make use of different criteria for truth and hence different grounds for the legitimation of the social order. Authority, the father in a p&triarchical or der or the priest ia',an ecclesiastical order, has the 'power to decide in the case of dlspute~, as judges do in our own courts. Hopefully, they have adequate recourse to the truth, but poor judgments carry just as much weight a@ go2d,ones. The decisions likely to gain the greatest compliance have both. It is interesting to recall in this context the wisdom of Solomon. One may wonder I£ ~olomon's judgments were considered so good because he &s so wise or becaqse he happened as well, to be king. More likely the stories of his wisdom and justice, helped to legifimize the authority that was socially assigned to hlm. In our own society, great weight is assigned tO\"truthl' \"facts\", \"sense data\" as objective grouods for mak-lng scientific, social and political decisions. As long as people believe that truth is objective, it serves as an important means of \"legitimizing\" a soclal order (Habermas, 1973). Furthermore the establishment of institutions Like universities devoted to discovering the \"truth\" independent of its social utility, helps to sustain the view that there are such facts and that those facts can be used to sustain the social order, (Hence, wk may count on"]},{"title":"L7","paragraphs":["some continued support even if we were (God forbid) unsuccessful in finding any such truths.)

Angela Hildyard recently took some of the statements from our tran* cripts and built them into a series of ten stories. Here is one of these : One Saturday morning SusJe and Kevin Jones went to the movies. Their mum gave them some money to buy some popcorn. Susie bought a Large box and they shared it out. When Kevin looked at Susie's shjare he didn't feel too. happy \"You've got more than me\" he said. The stories describing social predicaments of this sort were each followed by a recall test, e.g., What did they buy to eat? What did Kevin say?

When further queried as to why he said that, they replied, \"Because he wanted more1'. These results ere shown in Figure 2. The implication of these flndings is that almost all of the children interpreted the statement, I I You have more than me'' not simply as a true statement but rather as an indirect request and that interpretation biased the recall of the younger subjects. Older subjects remembered both what was intended by the sentence and the meanq the speaker used, here a declarative, true statement, to achieve it. That is, the sentence was not interpreted and evaluated strictly or even primarily on truth criteria but on 'social ones. And the younger the children, the stronger the tendency to treat the sentence as a call for compliance and hence to report it as such. These findings are similar to those we have obtained earlier in our studies of recall and inference from st~ries wlth children of different ages in which we showed that recall tends to be of \"what was meant\" rather than \"what was said\" and that with <~gc (and schooling) children come to be able to differentiaLe the two (Hildyard and Olson, in pres's). In a further study, ilildyard read che stories, exclud-ing the last line, to Kindergarten (age 5) and Grade 2 (Age 1) children, and adults and asked them to imagine what the victim said--in the above story, for example, \"What do ybu think Kevin said to Susie?\" There were two important additional factors. Flrst, the child may be either demanding a right--it may be that he is asking for his own sock back--or a favor--he may be asking for something that actually belongs to the other cLild. Further they could be asking Lhese rlghts or favors of low status lndlviduals, young children, or high status indivlduals, parents and teachers. There were 16 subjects at each grade level and there were three stories of each type. Agaln, I shal1,mention only the most lnterestlng results. First, favors were much more likely to be signalled by a conventlonalized request than were rights. Over all age levels and item types, the favor Items were marked by requests 77% of the time while rights were so maytced only 45% of the time. How rights were signalled varied with the age of the subj ects"]},{"title":".","paragraphs":["The youngest sub] ects use dlrect commands to their peers and conventlonalized requests to thelr parents and teachers. Thus they may say, \"Give me my sock\" to a peer and \"May I have my gold star\" (which had been promised) to the teacher. Adult subjects, while they use requests for favors, rarely use commands in attempts at obtaining their rlghts and tend rather to use declaratlves \"You have my sock\", and questions, \"Do you know where my sock is?\" Adults use this device 33% of the time whlle children of both ages use it about 15% of the time. Adults, in obtaining theix rights also use \"legitimized requests\", requests accompanied by reasons more so than do the children. These results are presented in Table 1. Note that In all of these cases, subjects asplred &*the same goal--'either through their direct meanlng or in'their lndlrect meanings they conveyed the same illocutionary force. Yet the utterance used to express that intention took a different form de-pendipg upon the social relations between the participants.

Secondly, the presumed rlghts, the status quo, determnes the form in whlch that illocutlonary force will be 'express~d. Favors are largely expressed through requests, although adults also frequently add reasons, while rlghts may be expressed through commands, occasionally throu311 threats, or through the provision of reasons (Declarative~ and Questions). Ervin-Tripp (1977) has recently cited similar results from an unpublished study by Sharon James. In a third study, Beverly Wolfus gave K~ndergarten and Grade 2 chlldren a series of dlrect comands such as (Tell me what this is! Put the penny In ahe glass!) and ambiguous ablllty requests (Can you turn over the cup? Could you tell me the name of this?), while pointing to a cup or other objects and observed how children interpreked and responded to them, She was particularly interested in whether the children opted for the direct expressed meanlng or the indirect pragmatic meaning of the ambiguous expressions. Thus tlTell me ~f you can put the penny in the glass\" could be answered by assent, 11 Yes I canf1--the dlrect meanlng--or by complianc~e, by actually puttlng the penny in the glass--the ~ndirect, or pragmatic meanlng. When issued direct T commands, both age groups complled extremely consistently. Told \"Open the book\", everyone opened the book. To \"Tell me what this is\" every one said, \"A pen\". The differences in the responses to ambiguous questions and statements for the two age groups were striking. Theae differences occurred in response to the questions and statements which were ambiguous between a propositional and a pragmati~ interprata-tion, that is ambiguous in their call for assent as opposed to compliance. To the statement \"Can you turn over the cup?\" older children would say \"Yes\" that rs, assent, younger children would silently turn it over, that is, comply. To \"Tell me ff you can put the peqrty in the glass\", older children wmld assent by sayxng \"Yes\" or \"I can\", younger chlldren would comply by putting the penny In the cup. To I1 Do you know what thls is?\" while pointing at a penny or a,cup, older chlldren would assent by reply~ng \"Yes1', young children would comply by reply-ing \"Penny\" or \"Cup\".

Ervin-Tripp (1977), observed a similar affect. When told to \"Say why don't you stand up\" the child said \"Stand up!\" and stood up--that is, he complied. Again this indicates that the meaning of the statement is, at least at the beginning, not simply its truth value, although that meaning may be calculated as part of its more pragmatic meaning. Rather, the sentences are scanned, as it were, for their implications for action, and that is what the youngest children tend to opt for. Further we can see some lndicat ion of the tramsition from compliance co assent in the Kindergarten children in the item \"Do you know how to x?\" Here these young subjectq would first assent and then comply 64% of the tdme. Again, wlth age or schooling, children begin to differentiate the propositional from the pragmatic meaning and to be able to respond to eitber of them. However, it appears that this propositional meaning Ps not primdry but rather specialized out of a primary undifferentiated social pragmatic meanfng. Nota that one of the factors that appears ro give those sunple declarative sentences a powerful $1-locutionary force for the youngest children 1$ that they are spoken by an adult in a school context. The chlld assumes that the adult is not just stating or asserting some thlng \"The book IS open\" but In-directly requesting that something be done about ~t. G-lven a high status indlvidual in n hbrarchi-cally structured institutional context, the chlld assumes that any utterance requlres compliance not assent. Let us return, In conclusion, to some of the general issues raised at the outset. I have argued that all utterances serve both ob j ectlve (truth) functions and social (comp'liance) functions and that these are not independent. Many examples from the studies showed that the form which a directive takes depends upon the status relations between the interlocutors. Thls ~s clearly the case for lmperatlves and requests--requests are more likely for prlviledges and imperatives for rights. Requests are more llkely to hlgher status lndiv duals and imperatives to lower status individuals. Imperatives occur more frequently when chlldren address Lower status individuals and rationalized quesLions, de-clara,I;lves and requests occur more frequently In the language of adults. Further the evidence showed that almost any form of utterance from a hlgh status individual including a decarative sentence such as \"The book is open\" tended to be interpreted as an ~ndirect Imperative when spoken to a lower status rndiGjdua1- That 16, dhe statement called for compliance rathet than assent, Our question at thls polnt is whether or not statqs differences, differences In the social relations between speakers affect the interpretation of statements with the putative status of true desr criptlons. Generally, are claims of truth ~nde-pendent of clalms of status? As I have suggested, putative true statements call for assent (or f alsir ication) while putative Imperatlves call for compliance (or defiance). But, as we have seen, if a true description is given by a hlgh status indlvidual, a lower status indivLdua1 may respond with compllance rather than assent. Can the two cr-Ltex3.a be specialized? Can statements ever be constructed such that they call Eor assent and not complBancd? If not why are there such things as assertions? The fact that some stntemepts c8n be assented to indfbate that the truth functions can be isolated at least 't~ornewhat frum their more general social functions. Even fn chat case however, the true statements would bc gencrnt-ed (or denied) when they have social ufllity, much as Lisa denied Jamie1& stntcment that she hod morc. The alternative, however, that bhc mcanlne of a sentence is purely subject ivc, that is wh~itcver you can get R listener to comply vltli, is even morc precarious.

An Argument about: the Composition of Conceptual Structure Ray J_ackendo f f Brandeis University","In order for people to be able to talk about what they perceive, there must be a level of mental representation at which information conveyed by language is compatible with information from sensory systems such as vision, nonverbal audition, touch, and so forth. I will call this level concepkual structure. Though the existence of conceptual strbcture has been more-=or less taken for granted (especialPy by the A1 community), the need to consider it seriously has been brought to the attention of 1inguLsts rather recently, by such works as Fodor (1975) and Miller and Johnson-Laird (1976) This paper will present a combination of linguistic and visual evidence which bears on the nature of conceptual~tructure.","1, deucral properties of a r-ory of conceptual structure","A linguist's questions about conceptual structure can bO separated into two major issues. The first, which the linguist shares withmany branches of psychology, concerns the form of conceptual structure itself; the second, Farticular to linguistics, concerns the mapping between conceptual structure and syntactic structure, An answer to the first questXon, within the theoretical paradigm I will assume, will consist of a set of well-formedness rules for conceptual structure. The second will be answered by a set of correspondence rules wlfich relate some subset of coneptual structures (the verbally expressible conceprb) into some subset of syntactic structures (the meaningful sentences).","It seems reasonable to assume for a flrst approximation that the well-formedness rules for conceptual structure are universal and innate! i.e, that everyone is born wlth the capacity to develop the same concepts. However, the actual concepts that one does develop will depend to some extent on experience--including possibly lingulstic experience, so there is room for a certain &mount of \"~horflan\" variation if necessa~ 1.","On the other hand,"]},{"title":"tbls","paragraphs":["position is not conslstent with what I gather is the strongest versioh of Piagetian developmental theory, whl ch could be construed in the present framework as a claim that certain conceptual well-formedness rules must be leaned. Rather, the, development of the child's conceptual ability must be attributed to increasingFichness and intercofihection of concepts, or to growth either in the well-formedness rules or in computational capacity, over which the child and the environment have little or no control. (The kind of growth I have in mind here is akin to the growth of bones and muscles: the envlron-ment mus* furnish nourishment, but it hardly can be said to control the interesting aspects of structure. See Chomsky (1975) for discussion.)","In addition cb the assumption of universality and innateness of the conceptual well-formedness rules, I will make three other assumptions about the theory of conceptual structure and its relation to Janguaged First, a theory of conceptual structure must be observationally adequate: as the level llnking language and other percepeual system;, it must at least be able to express all the cwcep-tual distinctlons made by natural language. In practice, thls calls for an attempt to account for a lexically and grammatically significant tragment of the language hthout artlflcial assumptions about the semantics (such as restriction to a microworld).","Second, a theory of conceptual structure must provide some principled way for the meanings of the parts of a sentence to be comblned into the meaning of the-whole sentence. This requirement of qompositionallty may be takeq more or ?Less strongly, depending on whether or not .one re-lres each syntactic cznstltuent (or ever. each word) of a sentence to correspond to a well-formed concept.","Related to this second assumption 1s a third, that the correspondence rules relating syntax and eonceptual structure be relatively simple. As motivation for this constraint, we observe that the language learner must relate syntactic form to unserstood meanings--1n fact he must probably learn many aspects of syntactic form in part by figuring out from context what meaning is intended by other speakers. Slnce syntactic form varies from language to language, the correspondence rules must be at least partly learned. In order to be able to explain \\how the child manage3 to acquire language, we should strive for a theory in which at least the fanguage-particular part of the correspondence rules is fairly straightforward.","A second argument for the simplicity of correspondence rules is more heuristic. Language is, after all, an inf6rmation transmassion system, conceptual structure being the information which language conveys.. It would be perverse no$*to take as a working assumption that language is a relatively efficient and accurate encoding of the information it conveys--despite generations of philosophers who have assured us that language is impossibly unsystematic and va8ue. To give up this assumption is- to refuse to look for principlks in natural language semanbics. Accepting it entails that all deviations faom efficient encoding be rigorously justified; what appears to be a qpirky relatkonship betwean syntax and conceptual structure may turn out to be merely a bad theory of conceptual structure., (See Goldsmith and Woisetschlaeger (1976), ~ackhdof f (1978) for arguments to this effect,)","2, The argument: Pigure formation and pragmatic anapho ra","The preliminaries complete, we turn to the main argument, which begins with a discussion of one aspect of visual perception before turning to linguistic matters. We then will draw consequences for conceptual structure, where visuqi and linguidtic information interact.","One of thsmost important and well-studied phenomena of vidual perception is-the emergence"]},{"title":"if","paragraphs":["a figure against a background. Intuitively, the figure is what attention is directed to; coherence or \"thingness\" inheras in the f igulte. It is often reported that the figure seems to stand out from the ground or to be imbued with greater vividness than the ground.' The study of ,the figure-ground opposition has been one of the major preoccupations of the school of gestalt psychology (see e.g. ~Uhler (1947), Kof fka (1935) )"]},{"title":".","paragraphs":["For a simple and hopefully illustrative example, consider the contents of this page, in particular the geometric configuration in Figufe 1, Figure 1 The who* of this configuration can form a visual figure seen against the background of the page.

The number of possible figures that can be be perceived in a given configuration is very large, perhaps unlimited;,however,","2. Only a small number of these are-qarticularly salient.","3. Relative salience of perceived figures is a function of both features os the physical signal and properties of the visual system.","4. Features of the visual context can affect relative salience of figures. .For example, the configurations in Figure 2 become much more likely to emerge from Figure 1 upon presentation of Figure 2; certain other possible figures (such as other arrow-shaped configurations) undoubtedly become somewhat more salient than before, while certain other possible figures not preseqted here remain as unlikely as before.","5. Features of the visual signal interacting with the viewer's intention can make certain figures more salient than they ocherwise might be. For example, more figures will merge from Figure 1 if the viewer is instructed to find all possible figures. si2ilarly, thls aspect of figure formation is crucial in children's puzzles which ask the reader to find three iabbits and two bears hidden in the forest, or in the ~iGchfeld cartocns in the New Yotk Tifnes in wh~ch the reader zn on the joke is t-o find a sthulated number if instances of the configuration NINA. These figures would not emerge at all were it not for the reader's intention to find-tnem.","6. Features of the visual slgnal interacting with the viewer's knowledge may make cerCain figures more salient, Someone who has worked with automobile engines will percgive more distinct figures upon looking under the hood thanqa mechanical nonce; a botanists may see a number of distlnct plants where a layman sees only a tangled confusion.","I't is Important to distinguish the conscious decomposition of a figure lnto parts from the process of figure formation itself. The former IS available to awareness, and is in fact governed by principles$of figure formation: as was seen in the example above, the perceived parts are themselves figures. On the other hand, the mental processes whlch bring about the emergence of a figure are themselves nqt open to awareness, and the aspects of the configuration whleh are relevafit to the character of the perceived figure may have l~ttle to do with the intultlve (i6.e. conscious) decompositop of the figure. To make this clearer, consider the not--atypical e~ample of facial recognltlon. Though one can recognize and distinguish thousands of faces, one dan-not in most cases consciously decompse faces and say specifically what makes them recognizable and different from each other. In present terms, each recognized face forms a remembered figure, but many of the distinctive features of faces do not themselves form figures and hence are not availa$le to conscious awareness (see Carey (1976), and also Helmholtz's (1885) brief but insightful remarks (p. 369)).","The observatlong we have made about the figure-ground phenomepon have"]},{"title":"a","paragraphs":["bearing on"]},{"title":"the","paragraphs":["nature of conceptual structure.

The mapping can only be given by a recursive procedure which associates subpatterns of the language with sub-parts of the percept-& other words the correspondence is between some analysis of both descriptlons and percepts. We are of course no more aware of the conceptual analysls of percepts than we are aware of the analysis of linguistic inputs. Given tb necessity of an analysis of both, the most parsimonious story of how this occurs is one which assumes that both are analysed into a struc, ture in the same lnterllngua--viz., mentalese, Contrary to some of my crltics on this polnt (Kosslyn E Pomerantz, 1977, Anderson, 1978) such a view is neither inconsistent nor unnecessarily mmplex. Independent arguments suggest that at least this much analysis or translation is necessary and there is, to my knowledge, no convincing argument that more than one form ~f interlingua is needed. Though this latter posslbility 1s not ruled out, the relatively weak constraints placed on the formal properties of the representing medium at present (vlz., that ~t consist of sumbol structures) make thls posslbllity seem unlikely. Furthermore, the freedom we have In thinking about information recelved through all modalities ahd the readiness with whlch we forget (outside of experimental settings) how we came to know something argues that at least memorles and thoughts might appropriately be vlewed as being modal.","Another question that arlses"]},{"title":"In","paragraphs":["connection wlth the nature of the language-perception corresp~ndence is whether the formal properties of the two are Independent or whether one might be 'able to explarn llnguistlc properties In terms of perceptual or general cognltive ones and vlce versa.

Clearly thls view assumes that the relevant aspects of thought and perception (my flrst precond~tlon) are present prior to language learnlng.

The only notlon at-ound (as Fodor, 1975, has argued) regarding how a new concept (or term of mentalese) could be learned IS one which says that what people learn 1s the relatlon of the new concept to some relational structure of already known concepts. But thls precludes the learnlng of any concepts that are not definitional cornposltes of old ones, and therefore strlctly elimlnatle. Unfortunately, this appears to Include most natyral concepts Like the theoretical terms in s7cience, most natural concepts cannot be given a context-free defilnltlon but rather depend on the entire system of concepts for thelr meanlng (whlch is why dictionary deflnitlons are Invariably circular). While one can speak of the accomodatlon of llngulstlc usage (e.g , the referents of wcrds can vary as we dlscove~ new empirical facts--such as that both steam and Ice are really just forms of water), the accomodatlon of the mentqi concepts, ip terns of whlch the lingulstlc terms can be understood, remalns a mystery. The mystery IS not lessened, moreover, by talk of motor schemata or vlequllibratlontv as Plaget does. In each case of putatlve conceptual change the process elther depends on assimilating new concepts lqto arrangements (or schemata) made up of old conkepts, thus severely llmltlng the type of canceptual change possible, or it is left unexplained There is no explanation, nor even the beglnnlngs of an approach, for deallng wlth the accomodation of, schemata or conceptual structures into ones not expressabLe as deflnltimal composltes of exist-lng ones.

People are sometimes mlslead by certaln computational metaphors into bellevlng that the problem can be dispensed with by something like compilation. But however attract,ive that notion IS, as a way of talklng about how new procedures cantcome into being which are themselves expressed in terms of new operatlons, it does not generalize to concepts in general Such a notlon works in the case ~f procedures because the s2t of computable functions 1s closed and reduceable to elementary (Turlng machine) operatlons in a way that the set of conceptuallzatlons of the world 1s not.","It seems to me that there are two gefieral avenues open for dealing with thls dllemma, both of whlch slmply raise more questions than they answer.

Compound concepts (such as clrcular red object) caa also be constructed as well as definitional composites, but these constitute a mlnority of our mentalese yocabulary. Of course, there need not be (and In fact certainly will not be) a one-one correspondence between concepts and words In the spoken language. It 1s qulte llkely that mdst wogds do correspond to concepts, though there have hen suggestlons that some words are represented by com-positions of more primitive concepts (e.g., klll = do something to cause to dle; never = not ever).
