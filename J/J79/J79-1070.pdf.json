The reason for the criterion of computability is that this rather strict requirernevt makes vague gcnernlizatiot~s i~nposisible (or at least more difficult), and forces exact specification of proccsscs being hypothesized- (However, this criterion is frequently difficult to apply, and in some instances the author s decision was undoubtedly a subject ivc one. ) It should be clearly poirltcd out that no attempt is made here to deal with the semantics of individual sentences. A familiarity with recent work in semantic representatian in cognitive psychology, linguistics and artificial intelligence is assumed (see Norman and Rumelhart [75], Schank and Colby [73] and Steinberg and Jakbbovifis [ 71 1 ) Although many problems in representing the meaning of individual sentences remain unsolved, this study focuses an those aspects of mcanlng that are conveyed only by groups of connected sentences"]},{"title":"-","paragraphs":["texts. Additionally, only work that attempts to deal with the semantics or understanding of texts, as opposed to statistical or syntactic analysis, is considered. This focus on text has also led to the omission of studies of non-textual mpmory and of computational systems that understand and solve problems stated in English or carry on dialogue. This omission is not meant. to imply that work in these areas has no relevance to text understanding, but the dif fcrent focus and additional constraints of these studies make such implications difficult to isolate. Page 4 The study is divided into three parts, which occasionally overlap, The first section deals with the conterlt of coni~ccted text"]},{"title":"-","paragraphs":["that is, what exactly does text commtlnicate. The work in this section is primarily that of experimental psychologi~ts interested in memory and recall- The second section deals with the _strucrurq of text, apart from its specific content, This work has been done mairlly by cultural antl~ropologists and those interested in the theory of literaturc, but is also being investigated by experimental psychologists. The third section discusses computational models prop-osed by computational linguists, which include attempts to implement in computer programs some of the processes discussed in the other sections- Each section is concluded with a dlsc~~ssion of the emerging model of text understanding. Finally, some directions for needed research are suggested. It is hoped that this kind of interdisciplinary survey will call attention of workers 112 one area to work in other areas addressing the same problems, This type of communication is valuable in two distinct ways. When similar conclusions are reached in different disciplines frequently using different methods and with somewhat different goals, these conclusians must be given special credence, On the other hand, it is sometimks the case that one discipline completely overlooks a problem or some aspect of it due to their own interests and biases. Such omissioi~s need to be brought into sharp focus. Page S 1.0 THE CONTENT OF CONNECTED DISCOURSE This scctfon will present a brief survey of the recent work of some experimental psychologist,̂concerned with thc process of understanding corlncctcd discourse. Thc details of their cxperi~n~nts will not be presented, but the types of cxperirneals and general conclusions will be discussed, as well as any madcls proposed by the investigators. Th~~se results seem to cotlve rge toward a single model, in spite of apparent cont radictions, Psychological work on text understanding is relevant to computational models because humans are still the only good tcxt undcrstnndcrs. Also, although some aspects of psychological research, such as forgetting, are not currently included in any serious way in computational models, it would appear that such models have a very useful role to play in pointing out where significant details of the process of text understanding are being handled intuitively by the theorist, and have not really been defined in the tlleory, 1.1 The Nature Of Discourse Content The nature (general characteristics and features) of the meaning of connected text will be examined first. The principle focus of these studies is to compare the understanding of a text to the actual text and attempt to charnctefize the types of differences that are found. 1.1.1 Harrl~ly, Brainsford And Franks"]},{"title":"- I\\,~rc*l,ty, Bra~~sford and Franks in n large body of work (Bransford, Rarclay irnd l'rrwks [72], l3nrcl~y [73], Bransford and Franks (731, Branrrforrl atld Ptt*('*n 1,-11 1741 nnd Frn~~ke and Rraneford [74]) argue for the cxletence of II","paragraphs":["t t c rcy~rcscnt nt ions indepcndcnt of the surface input, and propose active 11 1 t'haiCS 011(~11t it18 on thc input."]},{"title":"They describe eontencea as Information whl(\\r is ttscld by tlrc undcrstnnder to construct a descript-ion of a situation.

The explanation offered is that r;\\~ll jr'ct rz i~r;r\\cl thc2 t spntinl kt.rowlcdgc to crclate situatiot~ dcscriprions, and when two different sentences produce the same description, it is difficult to distinguish them. Similar investigations used a sequence of sentences, each comparing two objects from a set of five according to some dimension (e.g. positjon, height, speed, weight). Subjects who knew that a single situation was being described had a better memory for the situation, but were less able to distinguish sentences they had heard from those implied by the described situation. Once again, the conclusion is that a non-linguistic representation is created when a meaningful text is understood. A final group of studies involved descriptive texts that were ambiguous or difficult to comprehend without an appropriate context. The context might be a picture of the described situation or a meaningful title for the text. In every case the results indicated the understander attempted to build a description of the whole situation, and when this was very difficult or impossible, comp rehension was low. (Related studies by Anderson, Reynolds, Schallert and Coetz [76] and Scallert [76] utilize texts, each with two totally different meanings. Evidence is obtained that one or the other alternative is almost always chosen for the entire text. The effect of subjects backgrounds on interpretations of these ambiguous texts Is also Gtudied, and a correlation between background and chosen interpretation is claimed. ) The principal conclusion of these studies is that the process of understanding text involves constructing a consistent unified meaning, wlli ch is not simply the set of individual sentenee meanings.

He proposes a text base which underlies discourses, but his revised and elaborated thought on this is discussed in Section 1.2. ,Me, describes a model of discourse processing in which he makes a distinction between episodic and semantic memory, argues that the processing operations must be well defined (he suggests pattern matching and completion, abstraction and generation) and argues that recall is essentially a different pmcess from recognition in that recall requires input organization while recognition does not, Kintsch reports a number of experiments undertaken to test aspects of h;i$ theory.

Thorndyke uses recognition tests after the presentation of the story to compare inferences that have been reinforced by a continuation sentence with neutral and inapp rop riate inferences. He found the reinforced inferences much more likely to be recognized as part of She text than the neutral inferences, while recognition of inappropriate inf erenc~s was very unlikely. Thorndyke suggests that although this evidence indicates that inferences are made and stored as part of the understanding of a text, a more important implicaOion exrsts. This is that the role of inferencl ng is to aid in the 4ntegretiot.r of new information into tble larger framewi3tk of the understanding o,f a text when no appropriate understanding could be obtained from only the explicitly stated information. 1.2 The Structure Of Discourse Content Attempts to characterize the content of text necessarily lead to a structuring of that content. Simple one-dimensional representations in which propositions are connected only by co-reference or by time or causal ordering Page 13 are adequate for only a restricted class of texts. The following studier all p ropose some type of multi-level representation of content. It seems appropriate to begin a discussion of memory structure with Bartlett [32] since he is often referenced as the originator of several cu rrently popular hypotheses. It should be remembered that Bart1 et t was concerned with memory in general and the phenomena associated with recall, and did, not restrict himself to the study of disc~urse. His pxinciple conclusions were that memories are not stored in isolated, static units, and that exact recall is very rare. \\In fact, he often found cases of gross distortions in the recall of his subjects. He suggests that instead, memory is composed of a number of active, organized masses of past reactions and experiences, which he designates schemata, and a small amount of outstanding detail- Remembering is seen as a constructive process strongly affected by memories other than the one being retrieved. His ideas of organization beyond the sentence, of storage of something other than actual input sentences, and of active processes that modify text prior to its reproduction in recall are all currently en joying wjde acceptance.

He proposes the existence of a semantic representation underlying any particular discourse which contains the rncal~lng of the discourge, but, does not reflect the details of the surface form of the teyt. Thus, a single semantic represent~tion might underlie numerbus actual discourses. His semantic representation assumes a conceptual taxonomy showing the relationship of each known concept to its superordinate concept (i.e. the familiar semantic hierarchy), but he does not provide details on this. He also proposes an additkonal set of hierarchies showing the relationships of the concepts in"]},{"title":"a","paragraphs":["particular discourse. For example, the following: means that a nebula is either seen or it is not seen, where all of the concepts are defined on the conceptual graph. Crothers does not carefully define his notation, so it is ~ot clear exactly what may or may not occur at a node, Primarily, concepts (words) or connectives are used (e.g. NEBULA. IS AND, OR, WHY). Since hc deals only with expository, descriptive material he finds no need to represent actions or time, Crothers performed recall experiments on two different versions of the same material, and arrives at three conclusibns. First, he concludes that the surface paragraph *s not a Page 15 -fieant factor in recall, thus arguing for a surface-independent semantic repnsentation for the paragraphs. His- last two conclusions are negative xejecting hypotheses he had previously suggested. The first of these is that superordinate nodes in the meaning of the paragraph will be recalled more frequently than subordinate nodes. The second rejected hypothesis is that iaforaation not directly connected to the most superordinate pode of the paragraph I&"]},{"title":"lese","paragraphs":["likely to be recalled than information that is connected.

Clearly, this hypothesis, if true, could be confirmed only if it is tested against the appropriate content structure. Spiro's comments regarding the use (pr laah of use) of pre-existing structures are relevant, In the case of unfamiliar expository material, such as that used by Crothers and Meyer, it seems reasonable to suppose that the author s organization would be used to organize the semantic representation due to the lack (or n,on-use) of any appropriate pre-existing content structures. Thus Meyer's results suppart the importance of propositional level, and Crothera results do not- Ylowevev, a familiar structure, like an action sequence, is understpod in the. same way regardless of presentation setting. Thus, Kintsch and van Di jk found that the role of a proposition in the pre-existing structure (the macro-structures) was primary in determining its importance, It should be noted that even Meyer found variations in the recall of midclevel propositions that she could not explain by reference to the author's organization. It is plausible to assume that these variations were caused by individual differences in prior knowledge, resulting in differing content structures. Page 28 In light of thts, it seems plausible to propose a general model that distinguishes the following component processes bf text understaading (realizing that like almost all distinctions, such as syntax versus semanticq, they are really ~nadequate, but useful, oversimplifications). First there is the process of comprehensioh of the surface structure which builds a representation that is independent of the surface form of the text, This representat$on contains as much inferred information as is necessary to meet some minimal level of understandability, or coherence. This representation is organized hierarchically by higher level content st ructures ghich summarize or generalize over a larger amount of detailed in£ onnation. These higherlevel structures would normally be pre-existing (i. e. known to the understander) although a text could result in the creation of new structures. Different types of texts could certainly differ in the complexity of each of these tasks, explaining the variation ,in di f f iculty of understanding. The process(es) explaining forgettfng, and the integration of new information into prior knowledge, operates on this text representat-ion. This process is poorly understood, and there are no well defined hypotheses about its operation. It appears to operate primarily on the content structure of a text. So, for example, Spiro's subjects integrated information from the stories they read into their general expectations about love and courtship, and lost the specifics of the tpxt, even recalling it with radical mods f i,ca t ions This pxocess would explain the almost total loss of detail information with time, as well as the interactions and distortions caused by previous knowledge.

But if significant changes have occurred, recall will be distorted. As suggested by Kintsch and van Dijk, summary is seen as recall to a controlled depth. Retrieval accesses the higher-level organization first, and uses these structures to access more detailed information. As retrieved information is generated as output text, a test of coherence would be made. If something has been forgotten or changed so that a necessqry explanation or link is missing, the retrieval process would supply a probable piece of information from the general pre-existing structures. This, along with modifications from integration into prior knowledge, accounts for the reconstructive aspect of recall-This general model does not account for the recall of very specific surface details (e.g. words and constructions used in the input text) but"]},{"title":"as","paragraphs":["suggested by Kintsch's work, it seems best to treat this as a process separate from the general understanding of text. One other inadequacy of the model is that it specifies complete comprehension of all input propositions, including assignment to an appropriate role in a higher level structure. Frederiksen suggests that overgeneralization is a loss of detail which reduces the processing load. The idea that partial processing is sometimes done on input information is also suggested by Bobrow and Norman [75]. They describe such processes as resource-limited. This kind of processing seems to be indicated by facts such as loss of detail in immediate recall and the subjective impression of partial comprehension in a number of situations (such as reading verg rapidly, reading while partially distracted or reading very complex Page 30 material). Wowever, while the idea of discarding comp rellended in£ ormation* could be described computationally, selective comprehension ia a process that requites further investigation. One of the principle contributions of computational investigations with this sort of model will be specification of the processes of comprehen~ion, which can only be done by specifying the nature of pre-existing memory structures. Meyer's work is an example of the use of undefined basic stmctures. She criticizes Crothera for requiring two graphs to represent a text one of which ia his Eundame~ital hierarchy of kndwn concepts. She, instead, simply doesn't define any of her predicates first or higher order, apparently taking them as primitive. Assuming that one attempted to define even the argument roles f~r the rhetorical predicates, enormous difficulty would be encountered. Advocates of case systems have always had difficulty defining the exact role of cases, or delimiting the class of entities that could fill a case role. Consider how much more difficult it would be to define what pairs of things could exist in the RESPONSE oF COVARIANCE relations, or exactly what the charactexistics of these arguments are. Kintsch and van Di jk attempt to set out much more well defined structures, but even they have little to say about the set of structures that must exist, what information they must contain and how the camprehension algorithms use the text and the structures to build higher-level structures.

The syntactic structure allows production of the semantic stucture, which is justified by its usefulness in p roducing summaries. 2.4 Mandler And Johnson Mandler and Johnson [77] discuss an extended form of ~umelhart's story grammar, which they propose as a basis for text recall studies. The extended Page 39 grammar allows multiple episodes and does not utilize the additional structure containing the semantic interpretation which Rumelhart suggests. Mandler and Johnson feel that this second structure is unwieldy and frequently redundaat., Conjunction, time-ordering and causality are included as categories in the grammar. They observe that restrictions imposed on a story by this type of grammar include allowing only a single protagonist per episode, and prohibiting the realization of higher level nodes in the actual text. They demonstrate the utility of their grammar on several stories, including \"The War of the Ghosts\". They also note that a transformational component remains to be developed which would provide for deletions and reorderings of the ideal story structure- They discuss a set of predictions for recall studies, which are suggested by this definition of story. structure. These include: 1. Accuracy will be better as the story is complete and ordered as defined by the ideal structure-2, Elaborations will be poorly recalled. 3. Optional nodes' realizations will be less well recalledm 4. Causality will be better recalled than simple time-ordering. 5. Inversions should be fewer as the story is closer to the ideal structure-6.

In answering the question about the types of implicit in£ ormation Charni ak discovered that resolution of pronominal reference frequently requi red common sense knowledge. Consider Charniak's most discussed example [Charniak,"]},{"title":"741","paragraphs":[": Today was Jack's birthday. Penny and Janet went to the store. They were going to get presents. Janet decided to get a top. \"Don't do that\" Penny said. \"Jack has a top. He will make you take it bock.\" The \"it\" in the last line is normally understood to refer to the top that Penny would buy, but any purely syntactic procedures would probably select the top that Jack already has, on the basis of recency. The correct choice of referents seems to be based on the common sense knowledge that if a present is purchased and given, it may be returned or exchanged. The fact that if a person receives a duplicate present he may not wish to keep it is also Page 52 relevant. This realization led Charniak to concentrate on the problem of pronominal reference. Instances of reference are clearly recognizable in the input, and the need to utilize common sense knowledge seems fully present. Charniak decided to represent common sense knowledge as inferences. That is, implicit knowledge is made e~plicit by having rules which infer the implicit fact upon presentation of the necessary explicit information. Por example, if one knows that it is raining, the inference that anyone outside will get wet is valid, The presentation of the sentence John went outside. is sufficient to trigger the common sense inference John got wet, in a situation in which it is known to be raining. Charniak's chaice of in£ erences as a represent ation was probably strongly influenced by the availability of MICRO-PLANNER. (For a discugsion of MICRO-PLANNER, see Winograd [74] and Charniak 1761) Before examining his inferences in more detail, one other question must be considered. Since an inference is drawn at some particular time, the question of when inferences should be made arises. Three possible answers to the question are suggested: 1. Make no inferences until the story is accessed (e.g. to answer a question about it, summarize a part of it, etc,) Page 53 2."]},{"title":"Make","paragraphs":["inferences"]},{"title":"as","paragraphs":["the"]},{"title":"story","paragraphs":["is read, but only those that"]},{"title":"are","paragraphs":["necessary to solve"]},{"title":"some","paragraphs":["particular problem (e. g. to"]},{"title":"solve","paragraphs":["p roblems of ambiguity or reference)"]},{"title":"3.

If any event is encountered which is not anderstandable in terms of the current script, the event will be represented at the CD level, but will also be placed on a Wierd list. For example Schank discusses the processing of a story in which John has his pocket picked while riding a subway. Later, he has no money with which to pay the bill after eating at a restaurant- The first sequence of events is understood in terms of the subway script, but the pocket picking event is placed on the Wierd list. When applying the restaurant Gcript, the &aability to pay is encountered in the text and is inexplicable from the rotm~rmt script. The script applier asks the monitoring program to look for cprrs~al occurrences that could result in John having no money. The dtor finds the pocket picking event, and returns the informati6n to the scrlpt qplier which uses it as the required explanation. Of course, the problems in general are much more difficult than this riqle example indicates. For example, an unusual event within a script could imterrupt the script's normal continuation. Obstacles, such as not being able to get wbat you want at a restaurant, may cause altering or abandoning the restaurant script. Distractions, sueh as a robbery in a testaurant may lead to suspension of the restaurant script for a sub-story, or to its abandonment, Furthermore, simultaneous,, independent scripts are possible. The situation of eating in a dining car involves both the train script and the restaurant script. Finally, the activation and termination of scripts is a very complex p roblem. For example, consider the sequence: John went to a restaurant, After eating lobster, he bought a watch. Does this describe a restaurant event followed by a purchasing event, or the more unusual case of buying a watch in a restaurant? Either is possible, and the story in which this s,equence is found would determine the most probable interpretation.

And the two propositions: Man is a hunting animal. Modern man hunts for sport. are also connected since the second is a more specific proposition (\"modern man\" is immediately subordinate to ''man\") than the first.

Hence, Phillips claIms to have presented computational interpretations for the principle text phenomena. As a test of his proposed model of text, Phillips presents a model of text understanding embodied in a computer program. His program inputs a discourse in the form of parse trees of the sentences and builds the knowledge representation of the discourse. An interesting use of the Metalingual const mcti on is its function in replacing non-cognitive surface words by the"]},{"title":"Page 80","paragraphs":["appropriate cognitive structure.

Thus, the"]},{"title":"IP","paragraphs":["The boat contains Horatio Smith. is matched to the GP Things contain peaple. Notice that Phillips uses GPs to capture the same knowledge that features and selectional restrictions capture in many other systems. So the correct interpretation of a GP is that it is a plausible proposition, not a necessary truth. Once the IP has been matched to a GP, three additional checks are made starting from the matched GP. One is to determine if any of the terms of the proposition have Metalingual definitions. If so, new knowledge correspondin& to the definition is added to the discourse representation. For example, if the discourse included that \"John was poisoned\" the elaborated information that \"John ingested something that caused him to be ill\" would be added. A second check is to see if the matched GP is discursively connected to any Page 81 other GPs. If so, new k~lowledge is added to the discourse which corresponds to the related GP and the d$.ecursive connection. If the rnatche'd GP were \"People are injured\" and it had a causal link to \"People are unable to act\", then the IP \"John was injured\" would result in the addition oE \"John was unable to act\" with a causal link from the original IP, It is by using these interrelationships of GPs that Phillips accomplishes inference. The third test is to determine if the matched GP is a part of any 'contentive theme. (The encyclopedia's GPs have pointers to all contentive themes which contain them.) If so the theme is matched against the discourse as a whole to see if all components are present and all constraints satisfied, If they are, the theme is addtid to the discourse rep resent ation. \"Accidental drowning1' would be added to a discourse representation which had matched the GPs and connections I' (\"People contact- water\" and \"~eople cannot act\") cause (\"People drown\") \" with a coreference constraint on \"people\", After processing Ips and adding the related structure to the discourse representation, the second major step is testing the discourse for coherence. This involve two tests. The first: determines if the discourse is connected. Then, thematicity, is tested by checking to see if a single undominated theme has been found. It should be noted that non-contenrive themes, since they have no component actions, and thus cannot be pointed to by GPs, must be tested for in a serial fashion. If the discourse passes both tests, then it is judged coherent. Page 82 To illustrate the process, a very brief description of the understanding of a atory will be given. Given the story: (IP1)"]},{"title":"A","paragraphs":["boat contains Horatio Smith. (IP2) The boat overturns. (IP3) Horatio Smith drowns, the following events would occur: 1, IP1 and IP2 would be matched to GPs which are parts of a complex event that has as a causal result, when instantiated, the added propositions: (AP1) Horatio Smith is in the water. (caused jointly by IPl and IP2) (AP2) Horatio Smith is injured, (caused jointly by IP1 and IP2) 2. The GP corresponding to AP2 results in the addition of: (AP3) Horatio Smith cannot act- (caused by AP2) 3. The GPs corresponding to AP1 and AP3 are part of a complex event that has the causal result \"People drownt', But this is the GP which matches IP3. So a causal link is added from AP1 and AP3 to IP3. 4. The discourse is tested for connectedness, and passes the test. 5.

For all of these reasons, Phillips' understanding model is useful more in suggesting the kinds of problems involved, than in providing an actual model of text understanding. 3.3 Other Work Space limitations and the narrowly defined scope of this sunrey have combined to eliminate certain interesting work from detailed consideration. Wilks [75, 76, 771 has described a text understanding (and translation) system which uses a meaning representation called Preference Semantics. The system normally opercltes in a basic mode, dealing with sentences individually, but is capable of entering an extended mode when a reference problem occurs. An example is \"it\" in John drank the whiskey from the glass and"]},{"title":"-","paragraphs":["it felt warm in hi3 stoomch.

Thus, both \"ltm was in John's stomach, The vhiskey is in a part of John-roipld ath be extracted. These two, pqopositions can be identified, thus resolving \"it\" as \"the whiskey\".","*I Bwever, had the above example been"]},{"title":". and it was good.\" the original pruposifions, as vell as relevant extractions, would then be subjected to m ccuncm sense inference rules\" such as 1. <1 drink 2) -> (1 judges 2) 2, (1 is good)","paragraphs":["<-> (2 wants 1) rt3ich would be used to find the shortest inference chain identifying the referent. For the example, when \"the whiskey'' is tested, the established","(John drhk whiskey) -I-> (John judges whiskey) -subset-> (John wants whiskey) <-2- (Whiskey is good) where %ant\" events are a subset of \"judge\" events. A recent addition to Wilks' system is large knowledge structures (like frames) called \"pseudo-texts\". They are suggested as containing other knavledge which might be required in solving reference problems (although they have other important use in understanding individual words). Page 86 At the levei of text, Wilks differs from Rieger and Charniak primarily in his insistence upun entering an extended made only when a problem requires it. Reference p toblems are the only problems he discusses as triggering thia mode His use of pseudo-text B in establishing textual connections is still too briefly described to critically evaluate. Rieger ~([75b, 75c, 76a, 76b1, Rieger and Grinberg [771) has described a complex system for the organized representation of cause and effect knwledge, .a& plans utilizing this knowledge. A set of decision trees (\"selection","11 networks\") are postulated which. given a goal, select certain common sense algorithms\" capable of realizing that goal. Rieger asserts that the same knowledge st-ructures used for planning, should be used for understanding the intentional acts of others, To do this in text, he requires knwledge which allows prediction of goals and actions likely to be made in response to the occurrence of some event or state, A subsequent sentence is tested to see if it confirms any prediction by being a step in an expected action or in an algorithm to achieve an expected goal, This testing requires that all algorithms be indexed by step. Thus, it must b~ possible to find all occurrences of (X GOT0 Y) in some set of algorithms, A confirmation is used to more- coslfidently predict the course of action being followed, Clearly, Rieger is dealing with the same problems as Schank and Abelson (section 3,2.1.2), but ha.s not yet clearly demonstrated the utility or practicality of his approach to this aspect of text understanding.

These relationship8 indicate that Hobbs does not make a distinction between content and form (author imposed) relations. Thc complexity of Hobbs' system (in the large number of rules and their interactions) makes evaluation difficult until he has completed his computer implementation. Other work that should be mentioned includes Schmidt ([761, Schmidt and Sridharan"]},{"title":"[77]), who","paragraphs":["discusses the problem of recognitioh of plans from actions, as well as Novak [76] and Bobrow, et a1 [77] who both use frame like knowledge structures in specialized language understandi rag systems. 3.4 Discussion And Conclusions What have the discrissed computational models added to the previously described model of text understanding? Charniak, Riegex and Wilks have demonstrated how-it is possible to infer information only implicit in a text. Schank has especially examined the richness and complexity of causal connections, which are often implicit. This capability raises many additional questions, however, including when, and how many, inferences should be made. Whi le Cllarniak and Rieger suggest making many infe rences whencvv r possible, Wilks argues for making them only as required. Neither approach has yet been Page 88 applied to sufficient ly 1 argc trxt s and knwledge bases to convincingly demonstrate its validity. Pre-existcnt kn~wledgr structures have been suggested by Schaak and Philips to avoid the extrc:mc8ly difficult problem of making matiy-step inference chains to establish inlpli ci t con~~cct ions. Although use of these structures has demonstrated their ability to meet this goal, as well as their usefulness in generation of summaries and paraphrases, problems have appeared. Complex knowledge structures and real texts present many difficult.kea la matching an input proyosltlon with an element in the structure. When the match"]},{"title":"is","paragraphs":["imperfect, or- when many choices are (computationally) posgible, it is very difficult to perform the required matching correctly, In an attempt to deal with this difficulty (as well as others), and to recognize the fact that novel situations are also unde rstandable, Schank, Abelson, Rieger and Schmidt have been concerned with recognizing the motivations and intentions of actors. This aspect of understanding is clearly important, for the stated rt3asons, but the approaches described have almost certainly been too simplif icd for the understanding ,of actual texts.","It Thus *the requi rcmcnt that an understar~ding of a text contains as much inferred inforniat~o~~ as h~!c~ss~iry to mqet some minimal level of"]},{"title":"... coherence\" (section 1.4)","paragraphs":["is wen to bc a computationally difficult problem.
