These patterns are stated in terms of inferenres to be drawn from the current sentence and a previous sentence. An ordered heuristic search of the data base is used to locate the desired inferences. Intersentence relations are especially important in algorithm descriptions, for they determine the flow of control in the program. The most common and easily handled patterns in these texts are Temporal Succession, cause, and Enablement. They are translated into successive lines of code. But also important is the Contrast pattern: \"The predicates of sentences S1 and S2 are the same. One pair of corresponding arguments are contradictory. The other pair are different: but similar.

The methodology analyzes naturally-occurring dialogues rather than prepared examples. For each dialogue we choose to analyze, a separate model is constructed. Each model is judged against annotations of the dialogue prepared by a trained observer who uses a predefined set of categories of phenomena. Although the processes employed in each model are to be as general as we find practical, they may also be as ad-hoc as necessary to make the model work. After several models have been produced in this fashion, we expect to find that, although many processes have been too idiosyncratic to be used in more than one model, many others have seen repeated application and thus have demonstrated their more general utility. These processes are regarded as the principal results, since they have been verified against a diversity of observers' annotations.

A restaurant waiter realizes that when a patron says, \"Waiter, this soup is cold,\" he is not merely thereby making an assertion, but is also making a complaint, and perhaps requesting rec~if ication. Utterances can be understood to hav'e more than one intention. Two types of kntentions are described in this paper, both of which depend largely on contextual factors for their recognition or understanding in a dialogue situation. Those of the first type (type A) are broadly applicable to many discourse situations and are understood primarily on the basis of the syntactic structure of utterances and certain facts about the status relationships that hold between the speaker and the hearer. Type A intentions are very similar to the Speech Acts of Searle or of Gordon and Lakoff. Speech acts of the second type (type B) are much more dependent on the nature of the particular contextual situation. They. are recognized or understood on the basis of shared cultural norms concerning the particular kind of conversation the participants are engaged in. Type B speech acts are much less general in nature than type A. If a salesman says, \"This little two-tone model has been priced to sell,\" then the customer should recognize that the type A intention is to make an assertion or a claim, and that the type B intention is to offer an item for sale. 14th ACL Meeting A prdcessing"]},{"title":"model for speech act","paragraphs":["recognition or understanding is presented,"]},{"title":"in","paragraphs":["wMch procedures called spe-ech act schemata"]},{"title":"are activated.

The operations work by accessing a data base of world knowledge inferences, which are drawn selectively in response to the operations, and which carry a measure of their salience that varies with the context. Intersentence relations are determined by matching the current sentence and the previous text against a small number of patterns.

Background.","paragraphs":["The FCC decision was based ultimately on whether the Dataspeed 40 was characterized as a \"data communication^̂̂or %ta processingI1 device. If it were the former, it could be offered by ATGT as a comn carrier; ~f it were a data processing device, however, it could not be offered. The FCC ruled in its 1971 llComputer Inquiryv1 (Docket No. 16979) that communications common carriers may not directly provide data processing services; while this ruling would have allowed ATET to provide the Dataspeed 40 (as a data processing device] offering through an unregulated subsidiary, ATET was precluded from even this latter optlon by an agreement in an earlier consent decree with the U.S, Department of Justj ce, to the effect that ATGT would not enter an unregulated industry such as the data processing industry. Rationate of the decision. In ruling on the proposed tariff the FCC stated that it must consider \"all the relevant factors, such as the technical characteristics of the equipment, as as st8 intended uses.\" (Emphasis supplied.) The ruling distinquished between two class& of equipment, one in which equipment was designed and marketed for terminal-to-terminal message exchange, and another in which equipment was designed and marketed for the input, output, formatting and conversion of computer-based data, Le., intended for interaction with a computer. The Commission found the Dataspeed 40/4 to be equipment llwhose pritnary function, design, and marketing is as an integral p3rt of a data processing service involving the programmed interaction of the terminal device and a ~entral computer processing and/or storage unit;\" more specifically, it found the device intended to be a substitute for the IBM 3270 and similar equipment. The Commission noted that the Dataspeed 40 was not capable of terminal-to-terminal communication (w~thout the use of additional data processing support) , and emphasized that it was clearly not intended for this purpose, in either its design or marketing. fie ruling also indicated concern over possible unfair com7etition related to the Dataspeed 40. The petitioners opposing the Dataspeed 40 h~d indicated a fear that if the device were offered by ATGT directly, it would be cross-subsidized by other 9'FET offerings, thus giving the common carrier an advantage in a non-rcgulated competitive market (i. e., computer peripherals)"]},{"title":".","paragraphs":["Indeed, the rationale of the Computer Inquiry in requiring common carriers to offer data processing services only through subsidiaries was to make cross-subsidies from a coinmon carrier to its subsidiary easily detectable. Possible further inquiry. In discussing the consent decree itself, the Commission said that \"we believe the appropriate manner to deal with this problem is through a petition seeking a revision of the Commission's rules, as well as a possible rc opening of the 1956 consent judgement.\" This statement appears to substantiate informal comments that the* FCC is considering a now Computer I'nquiry.

INTERAGENCY COMMITTEE ON A?P HOLDS PLANNING CONFERENCE The Ingeragency Committee on ADP (automated data processing), a group comprised of ADP policy officials and managers from the various Federal agencies, recently held a major' conference on Federal ADP planning.

Congressman Charles Rose, Chairman of the House Ad Hoc Subcommittee on Computers, warned the Federal agencies that dhey would have difficulty in obtaining funds for ADP services and equipment if they did not improve their ability to explain Executive Branch ADP requirements to the Cbngress, Speaking for the National Bureau of Standards, Dr. Ruth Davis described her agency's activities to implement the Brooks Act; she noted that despite NBS proposals, \"there Femainsf no means fbr insuring compliance with Federal information processing. standards .I1 In the area'of personnel management, the conference participants offered several reco~nmendatiom* for further developme~~t by the Civil Service Commission and the Interagency Committee, including the fostering of professionalism through a formalized certification and testing program, and the strengthening of Civil Service quallflcations standards.

In the Senate, Charles Phiyps of Texas Instruments (Manager, Strategic Planning] presented the highlights of the so-called Bucy Report prspared by the Department of Defense Task Force on Export of U.S. Technology. Among its many findings the Bucy Report concluded that non-communist nations, including thoseof Third World and particularly those of the Middle East, are \"potential pipelines\" for the transfer of high technology to communist nations. The Report also found that government-to-government scientific exchanges had the potential of transfering technology very actively, and as such \"should be monitored to ensure consistency with restrictions on export of st~ategic U.S. design and manufacturing know-how.\" Testifying in both the House and Senate, Peter McCloskey, Presidentrof the Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers Association (CBEbIA) objected-to the lack of clear policy guidance in Federal statutes which regulate East-West trade; he specifically objected to the \"national interestn criteria used in assessing specific license applications under the Export Administration Act. McCloskey urged that Department of Commerce Technical Advisory Committees (which include industry representatives) be given a greater voice in formulation of policy related to technology export. He also argued that criticism of East-West trade policy relating to com2uter technology is unfounded, stating that \"no significant military contribution has accrued to the U.S.S.R.\" as a result of U.S. computer exports.","The National Science Foundation (NSF) has published An Analysis of Federal R&D Rmd-","ing by Fwtion, FiscaZ years t869-2976 (#, enclose $1.

AFIPS IN WASHINGTON AFIPS EFTS CdMMITTEE MEETS WITH NATIONAL COMMISSION; CObfiENTS ON REGULAYION 3 Paul Armer, Chairman of the AFIPS Special Committee on Electronic Fund Transfer Systems (EFTS), accompanied by the Director of the AFIPS Washington Office, recently met vith William Widnall and John Benton, Chairman and Executive Director respectively of the National C~mmission on Electronic Fund Transfers, to discuss prospective AFIPS interaction with the Commission. Both Widnall and Benton indicated a generally favorable reaction to the concept of providing AFIPS technological expertise to the Commission, and discussions are eXpected to continue on developing specific mechanisms. In a separate development, Armer provided comment through AFIPS on the proposed amendments to the Federal Reserve's Regulation J, which deals with wire transfers between Federal Reserve Banks, and other aspects of the Federal Reserve's automated payments system. The letter comment submitted by Armer was initially drafted by Dan McCracken, Vice Chairman of the AFIPS committee, and was reviewed by committee members prior to submission. The conqnents focused on cwo specific areas. First, Armer pointed oat that while privacy and confidentiality of account information was addressed in the amended regulation, the area was treated in a very cursory manner. In the absence of a specific definition of \"adequate safeguards,\" prescribed appeal procedures for consumers, and related penalties on financial institutions and their employees for unauthorized di~closure, he argued, the proposed treatme~t was nearly meaning-less. Second, Armer pointed out that while the press release describi~g the proposed amendment made reference to Ifpayments on magnetic tape\" (and implied the transfer of funds by physical delivery of tapes), the proposed regulation defined acceptable \"mediat1 much more broadly than magnetic tape, in a way that would make the Regulation applicable to a full scale Electronic Fund Transfer System. Armer urged the Board to restrict the definition of media to only transfers on magnetic tape, and to gain relevant experience in this area before publishing broad regulations which would reach EFT systems more generally. AFlPS PRESIDENT RALSTON URGES CONTU TO EXPLORE COMPUTER-RELATED COPYRIGHT The Director of the AFIPS Washington Office met in March with staff members of the Natiunal Commission on New Technological Uses af Copyrighted Works and was told that the Commissiork would, at its April 1 meetihg in New York, determine whether it would investigate and make recommendations on copyright matters related to computer t ethnology (Washington Report, 3/ 76) As a result, AFIPS President Anthony RalSton has written the Commission, urging the Commissioners to go forward with investigation of these tlimportantll issues, and to make recommendati~ns which wauld lead to clarification of the resevant law. Ralston emphasized that AFIPS1 intersst in this area is not commercial, but rsther, that the Federation wished to see the legal treatment of the arca,developed in a manner which is technically sound. \"Both the Congress and the Federal Judiciary, by the nature of these institutions, are in a difficult position to consider all aspects (i.s., legal, economic and technical) of [these issues] .ll Ralston said in his letter. He concluded, [i] t is our hope that yDur Commission will apply its unique resources to give these issues the considered study which they demand.\" STATUS OF, H.R. 214 PRIVACY LEGISLATION Rep. Charles A. Mosher has predicted that H.R. 214, a bill: which would require c~urt orders for government surveillance of many kinds of communications, will be approved within the month by the House Subcommittee on Courts, Civil Liberties and the Administration of Justice. The bill, as revised by the Subcommittee, is expected to include coverage of non-aural interception of electronic communications (i.e., data communications) sent over wire; AFIPS had earlier been ask-ed to provide technical commenAt upon this aspect of the bill (Washington Report, 2/76) While the proposed statute would not reach non-wire data communications, it would for the first time provide Federal statutory privacy protection for computer data transmissions, telegrms, and other non-verbal trallsmisslons over wire.

FCC CHA1RhlA.N ANNOUNCES PROPOSAL FOR NEW COhiPUTER INQUIRY Speaking at the recent Fourth Annual Conference on Telecommunications Policy Research (cosponsored by the Federal Communications Commission [FCC) and the White House Off ice of Telccammunications Policy. (OTPg), FCC Chairman Richard Wi1e)r announced his proposal for a new FCC llComputer Inquiry\" which would re-examine the interrelationship between computer and comnlunications technologies. h'ilcy is spccifically proposing to the Comrnissiorlers that the FCC initiate n notice of inquiry and proposed rule making, and that it undertake a series of public sessions which would reach both the commercial and research camunities regarding new technologies (both current and planned) and their applications, Particularly significant, Wiley indicated an innovative approach in which these public sessions would become part of the record in the formal Conlputer Inquiry proceedings, The public sessions will be in two formats, First, Wilcy indicated that he would propose a ''Future Planning Conference\" which ubuld be oriented toward ne\\r. developments in computer coi~ununications and their impact on FCC regulatory responsibili-ties; while the Future Planning Confcr'ences are not themselve-s new to the FCC, Wileyts proposal to incorporate the transcript of the Conference into the Computer Inquiry record represents a novel approach to obtaining technical information from the research community-, which is not normally a party to FCC proceedings. Second, Wiley described a proposed \"Commission Demonstration Programt1 which would supple-ment written comments submitted in the course of the Computer Inquiry with live demonstrations and debate regarding communications equipment (including terminal devices). This program would attempt to elicit information pertaining to vendors, users and uses of such equipment; vendors would be allowed to comnlent on their own as we11 as competitors equipment, OTP COmlENTS ON FEDERAL RESERVE'S PROPOSED REGU1,ATION J The White House Office of Telccsmmu~ications Folicy recently submitted crsmmcnts on the Federal Reserve Board's proposed Regulation J. (See R'L~sl:!)zgtorz .Scp,-rt, 4/76). OTP1s comments indicated concern that the proposed changes would permit the actual provision of EFT services by the Federal Reserve, an activity which would be \"in-appropriate and unwise.\" In a letter to the Director of rhc AFIPS Washington Office, OTP Acting Director John Eger described OTP1s specific concerns: \"First, we have been witnessing for some time the steady development by the private sector of the generic type of services now proposed by the Federal Reserve Board. There do not appear to be any economic or technological reasons for the Federal Reserve to involve itself in the actual provision of these services. Accordingly, absent any compelling justification for government entry into this market, the private sector should be left to provide electronic funds transfer services in an environment that is free from government operational involvement. Our second concern relates to the control of and access to the comprehensive body of sensitive and confidential financial information that will eventually be carried by electronic funds transfer systems. Opera-tion of such systems by the Federal Reserve would give it direct and automatic access to this information. We seriously question the wisdom of creating an environment wherein a government agency xould have such ready and unprecedented access to this vast amount of information concerning the day-to-day financial affairs of the public.\" PRESIDENT SIGNS WHITE .HOUSE SCIENCE ADVISER BILL President Ford has signed a compromise version of legislation to establish a White House Science Adviser* passed by the House and Senate on April 26, It was anticipated that the President would sign the bill, since the compromise version was without mest aspects of the Senate bill which he had found objectionable (Wasungton Report, 1/76). President Ford is expected to name the new science adviser very shortly; amid varcious rumors, Dr, Simon Ramo of TRW is considered to be a leading candidate' for the new position. The compromise bill (#) will give the new White House Office of Science and Technology Policy relatively limited budgetary authority, to \"advise the President on scientific and technological considerations with regard to Federal budgets, and assist the Office of Management and Budget with an annual review and anaylsis of funding proposed for research and development in budgets of all Federal agencies\" (emphasis supplied). The bill creates a Presfdent's Committee on Science and Technolagy (similar to a prcdccessor committee, the President's Science Advisory Committee) to bring together leading scientists for a two-year study of the Federal science and technology program. While the bill will make the new science adviser a member of the White House Domestic Council, one of the legislative coinpromises will preclude the adviser's membership on the National Security Council, Finally,, the, measure eliminates a proposed grant to each state, which would have been applied to development of state science and technology programs. COMICATIONS REFORM BBILS.GENERATE GROWING CONTROVERSEY The Consumer Communications Reform Act of 1976, a bill which would radically modify to the benefit of ATET recent Federal Commurlications Commission (FCC) policy on specialized carriers and interconnection, has recently been introduced in various versions in both the House and Senate (primarily H.R. 12323 (#) and S. 3192(#)). The Act, which closely follows AT&T1s or'iginal proposal, carries four key provisions First, it would resrrict approval of specialized carrier (e-g., providers of data communications services) applications by requiring the appZicatzt to show that the proposed service will :lot result in increased charges for telcpllone exchange service or \"wasteful or trmeces~ary~~ duplication of common carrier facilitfes, and will not significantlj. lmpzir the technical integrity of, or capacity for unified planning in the nationwide telephone network. Second, it would preclude the FCC f~om fequirlng charges for new common carrier services which exceed the in-crenlental cost of providing such service; opponents argue this provision would allow ATET to subsidize its new offerings through existing services, thereby forcing specialized carriers out of the market. Third the bill would allow acquisition of a common carxiear by another common carrier. Finally, it would put jurisdiction over 5nterconnection policy [regarding the connection of non-bell instruments to the net-WOFQ ex~lusively under state jirisdiction, which would have a nullifying effect on"]},{"title":"-","paragraphs":["the xecent FCC interconnection decision (Nashingtun Report, 12/75). Rep. Torbert Macdonald [Mass.), chairman of the House Subcommittee on Comunications has responded to the Act by arguing that competicion against comon carriers would not necessarily increase local rates (contrary to ATET's position), nor would it cause other undesirable redistributions of rates; he stated it to be in the national interest to allow competitive costs to determine rate structure. Specialized oariers (e.g.; hlCI and Datran) have also denounced thc bill as an ATGT effort to SegisIatively eliminate competition, despite contrary policies implemented by the FCC .and the courts. ATGT Chairman John deButts replied in recent comments at the ATGT shareholder meeting that FCC decisions allowing interconnection and selective competition in high-profit markets (i.e., high-volume urban markets) threatened the technical integrity of the network as well as AT&Tfs ability to ,plan its facilities and operations.

SUF EVARE COPYRIGHT TO CONTU In response to a request submitted to the AFIPS Washington Office by the National Commissiorl on New Te~hnological Uses of Copyrighted Works (CONTU), AFIPS societies recently commented on the issue of copyright protection for coinputer software. The request from CONTU executive director Arthur Levine enumerated ninc specific questions on which the Comi$sion sought comment. The AFIPS Washington Office, working through the liaisons fr~m the respective AFIPS societies, arranged comqent from those societies electing, to participate ACFI, DPbH, and the IEEE Computer Society. It should not go without rccognitiop that the individuals invited to prepace comment by the participating AFIPS societies did excellent work in the extraordinarily short time period (ten working days) which COXTU allowed for prepamtion of comment. The individual participants were: for ACbI, Herbert S, Bright; for DPbliZ, William J. Moser; and fot the IEEE Computer Society, Herbert R. Kollcr and Kathaniel Macon. In addition to preparing written comment, each of those participants (with the excep-tion of Dr. Macon) participated in the hearings which QONTU held in Washington on Hay 6. In all cases, the participants spoke eithcr as individual experts, or presented g sununary of comments from varibus experts within their society, The comments reflected a fairly widely perceived need far some form of software protection. While there was little support for the proposition that copyright provided the best legal vehicle for such protection (in contrast to approaches such as patent or trade secret), there appeared to be greater agreement within the societies on the desirable charaotsriat~cs of software protection, and on the principle that protection should encourage software development by allowing a reasonable commercial return, mile existing copyright law precludes only copying of protected materials, the participantsf conmcnts supported the suggestion that software protection should be extended to include use (i.e., execution) as well. Further, the comments indicated that \"copyingvr should be defined to include the reading (or copying) of a program into core memory for execution, a necessary prerequisite to \"use.\" The commentators all indicated that approaches other than copyright may constitute the best solution; there was some.indication that an entirely new legal system of protection ($,em, outside of patcnt and trade secret as well) should be considered. While there were divergent statements on whether software protection should extend beyond program code itself, the participants indicated that programs other than literal copies in the same computer language should, in some eases,. constitute an infringing copy. The witnesses generally concurred that software protection, properly implemented, would increase the useful dissemination of software and not unduly restrict users, AFIPS \\VASHINGTON ACTIVITIES COMMITTEE MEETS IN IVASkIINGTON The AFIPS Washington Activities Commiftee (Keith Uncapher, chairman; Ralph Leatherman; and Frank' Ryan), along with AFIPS executive director Robert Rector, met on April 20 at the AFIPS Washington Office.

Mr. Rose began by outlining several areas in which Federal information policy has begun to take shape, lie cited the Brooks Bill as an early effort (in 1965) to deal with problems of Federal government computer procurement; he added, however, that the Brooks Bill is not being implemented completely, and that the Bill will need to be amended as technology changes. He also noted that the new legislation establishing a Presidential science adviser (wash;ngton Report, 5/76) encourages the improved transfer of scientific and technological information, and directs the new Ofsfice of Science and Technology Policy to maintain adequate data bases on science, engineering an6 techn-y. Rose also pointed out the efforts of the National Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works in thc area of software protection (see Washingt~n Rcport, 5/76), Rose specifically urged AFIPS to consider a position on the suggestion recently, made by Joh:~ Eger, acting director of the I\\?lite House Office of Telecommunications Policy, to create a joint Co~~gressional cornittee on information policy. The committee would establish a Congressional focal point for formulating such policy, in contrast to the present situation where decisions are made in numerous groups within the Executive Branch. ~ongressional use of computing. Rose gave his primary emphasis to Congressional use of computing, particularly data base access, Here he cited the need for ed-ucating the Congress, both for their own immediate needs and for a better understanding of the technical aspects of information policy, and challenged computer professionals to provide the needed help, through the AFIPS Ivashington Of ficc.

The Comptroller of the Currency, a different Federal agency which regulates national banks, has issued guidelines for the evaluation of EFT systems. According to an article appearing in EFTS-Industry Report, these grlidelincs indicate a need to deal with consumer and security issues prior to the interim or final reports of the National Commission on EFTS. The guidelines recommend that a bank should assure its customers that the personal and financial information which it accumulates will be used only for banking purposes, and that it should not be sold or divulged without written customer consent, unless required by law or within tlgenerally accepted banking practices;\" further, infarmation processed by outside services must be treated with the same degree of confidentiality as transactions handled entirely within the bank. In the area of security, the Comptroller suggested that the National Bureau of standards encryption algorithm be considered as a means oP protecting transmissions between banking terminals and central processors, and recommend ed a number of other specific technical security procedures, BELL BILL: PLAYERS AND ISSUES The recently introduced \"Bell B111\" (Cons3mer Communicatiorjs Reform Act of 1976"]},{"title":"--","paragraphs":["see Washington Report, 5/76) promises to make Federal communications regulation a major political issue in the next year.

However, a major factuaZ issue has recently emerged which will play a key role in the controversy: whether revenues in those ATGT services subject to competition subsidize residential rates, ATGT staunchly maintains that competition will raise resigential rates, while its competitors maintain that this is not the case; the FCC has stated that careful studies must be undertaken to determine who ($,em, which user groups) subsidizes whom, Congress is expected to hold extensive hearings on these and related issues.

GAO REPORTS ON COMPUTER PROBLEMS RECEIVE CONGRESSIONAL ATTENTION A recent series of reports released by the General Accourlting Office (GAO) on the subject of computer-related pkdblems in the14Federal government have received considerable attention by Sen. Ribicoff, chairman of the Senate Committee or\\ Government Operations. The series of three GAO reports deal with (1) computer-related crimes, (2) unreviewed automated dec'ision making by computers, and (3) protection of Federal computer facilities against sabotage, fire and flood, fraud and human eryor, Regarding computer crlme, GAO reported 69 instances of computer abuse resulting in losses of over $2 million; most of the fraud involved lluncomplicated actstt made possible by inadequate management controls. GAO also reported that computer7 programmed for auton~atic decisions can cost the government a large but undetermined amount of money by issuing unreviewed paynlents and instigating unreviewed (and incorrect) actions in Federal agencies. Sen. Ribicoff described these reports in considerable detail in remarks in the CongressionaZ Record, and indicated that his committee staff is conducting a preliminary investigation into the problems identified by the GAO reports; he is expected to hold Senate hearings on the subject by the end of the year. CURRENT FCC NATTERS Tymshare has filed an application with the Federal Cornn~unicatTons Commission (FCC) requesting authorization for a new subsidiary, Tymnet, to operate as a value-added carrier. Tymsharets non-regulated status has been an issue at the FCC tor some time, in an informal proceeding brought by 'I'clcnet, a regulated competitor of. Tymkhare (Washington Report, 11/75). The proposed new service would include such capabilities as speed and Code conversion, and store-and-forward message services. Meanwhile, Telenet has filed with the FCC for the provision of a public packet-switched data communications service between the United States and the United Kingdom. The proposed system would interconnect the Telenet network with packet-switching facilities operated by the British Post Office, using the X.25 packet mode interface approved by the CCITT (an international telecommunications standards organization).
