FINANCIAL STATUS Don Walkw, Secretary-Treasurer, reviewed the financial status of the Association, a copy of which is attached to these Minutes. He presented income and expehses both for 1'977 and for 1978 through 21 July. The balances of $6,332.19 for 1977 and $7,060.63 for 1978 constitute ajs9et9 of $13,39r.82. However, the major costs for AJCI, for the current year are yet, to be incurred, and dues for AFIPS have not yet been billed, At the same time, the $1,000 advance to cover costs of the TINLAP-2 Meeting is likely be returned, along with a portion of the excess of income over expenses, which will be shared with ACM/SIGART. The indebtedness of the Association ta the Center for Applied Linguistics, which housed the previous Secretariat, has been paid off. Of the total of $13,486:06, funds from the previous Secretariat provided $9,913.92; $3,572.14 was taken out of income for 1977. I Walker remarked that the income item from AFIPS for 1977 of $2,365, which refledted a disbursement of surplus funds from the National Computer Conference, was unlikely to be repeated again soon. AFIPS is in the process of creatAfig 2 new journal, ABACUS, modeled after Scientific American, and future surpluses probably will be used to defray or at least to backup the startup ,costs. The journal is expected to be self-sustaining, and might eventually show a profit. The current balance in the TINLAP-1 Account is $109.41; approximately 75 copies remain. MEMBERSHIP Walker reported membership figures for 1977 of 500 individual and 201 institutional, for a total of 701. The current figures for 1978, through 21 July, are 405 individual and 208 institutional, for a total of 613. A slightly more detailed breakdown is attached to these Minutes. EDITOR 'S REPORT Dave Hays, Edito-r of the AJCL, announced thaG he was resigning, effective at the end of tb year. The next issue will include the TINLAP Proceedings; the final issue of the current year will contain a complete index for the five years of its publication. The Jourrlal wa3 established in 1974 as an NSF-sp,onaored experiment in microfiche pub1icat;ion. Anticipating the implications of George Heidornta survey (see below), Hays remarked that this mode of publication is likely to be replaced by microprocessor technology and might never repeive a full scale trial. Allep expressed the gratitude of t,he Association to Hays for his devotion, his constructivenes~, and his tireless efforts in establishing and sustaihing the A JCL"]},{"title":".","paragraphs":["This tribute was affirmed by the members. Allen then announced that Heidorn, currently Associate Editor, would replace Hays as Editor in January. A NEW FORMAT FOR THE AJCL Heidorn presented the results of his survey of the qembership regarding a new format for the AJCL. Of 513 questionnaires mailed (to both current members and to members ~ho paid for 1977 but not yet for 1978); 212 were ret;'urned. The responses favored crea'tion of a hard copy edition, similar in format to the Communications of the ACM, with or without an acoompanying microfiche version. Most members felt that such a change would encourage a wider readership and an increase in the submission of techical articles, A more comprehensive report by Heidorn is included elsewhere in this iswe. Allen reported that the ExecubSve Committee, after reviewing Heidorn's findings, has decided to issue the Journal in the new format with both hard copy and microfiche versions sent to each membep, beginning with the first issue of 1979. The microfiche also may contain appendixes for technical articles, program listings, and other material of interest to the membership but less appropriate for Inclusion in hard copy form, like the list of members. NEXT MEETING Allen stated that a decision about the time and place of the 1979 meeting had not yet been made. Asiloalar, near Monterey in California, is being considered, possibly around the time of the next International Joint Conference on Artificial IntelLlgence, which wj-11 be held in Tokyo from 20 to 24 August. In the discussion, members expressed concern that the choice should not discourage attendance by graduate students. For 1980, the Executive Committee recommended that a third TINLAP meeting be held. The President, Vice President, and Secretary-Treasurer constitute an interim opmmittee to investigate this possibility and to negotiate with SIGART, a3 appropriate. Allen also remarked that an offer already had been received from Aravlnd Joshi to host TINLAP-3 at the Universi ty of Pennsylvania. NOMINATIONS FOR OFFICERS FOR 1979 Aravind Joshi, reporting for the Nominating Committee (Joshi, Petrick, and Chapin), announced the following nominat5ons for officers for 1979: Nominating Committee: Jonathan Allen, MIT, Executive Committee: Stanley Roaenschein, RAND Secretary-Treasurer: Donald Walker, SRL International Vice President: Bonnie Lynn Webber, University of Pennsylvania President: Ronald Kaplan, Xerox Palo Alto Research Center No additional nominations were received from the floor. Allen called for a vote, which was unanimous, and the alate was declared elected. NEW BUSINESS Carol Lane presented a resolution supporting the ratification of the Equql Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. After extensive discussion and after motions to amend and to table were defeated, the members affirmed the following substitute resolution by a vote of 20 to 13:","WHEREAS, inclusion in the Constitution of these United States is the basic unalienable right of every citizen;","WHEREAS, the Association for Computational Linguistics views as intolerabl.; the selective exclusion of over one-half the pophation of this country;","WHEREAS, the Equal Rights Amendment, writing women into the Constitution, must be ratified by three-fourths of the states (38) prior to its incorporation","THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that all future conventions, rneetlngs, and conferences of the Association for Computational Linguistics will, for the duration of time durlng which the Equal Rights Amendment is under consideration by the several states of the United States, be held only in those states that have ratified the Equal Rights Amendment. RESOLUTIONS HavQng set out in advance the syntax of his report for the Resolutions Committee, Ron Kaplan expressed the gratitude of the AssocYation to Dave Waltz, his session organizers, and the Unlverdty of Illinois for the organization and conduct of the meeting; to the National Science Foundation, and particularly to Carol Ganz Brown, for its financial support; to the current officers for their constructive-efforts during the first part of their elective term (and with encouragement to contlnue these efforts for the rest of the year); to the retiring members of the AJCL Editorial Board--Robert Barnes, Fred Damerau, Gary Martins, John Olney, and Naomi Sager--for five years of effective service; to Dave Hays for his countless hours and fruitful endeavors in realization of the AJCL; and to George Heidorn for his willingness to become the new editor. Dave Hays called attention to the efforts of Martin and Iris Kay in the preparation of the AJCL ~ibliography, and they were duly included in the list of resolutions. The members, affirmed these sentjments enthusiastically, and Allen directed the Secretary-Treasurer to express the appreciation ~f the Association formally to Dave Waltz., The meeting adjourned.

BENZON","Language, Literature and Communications Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute","Troy, New York 12181 The comments on the dust jacket for the third edition of Colin Cherry's On Human Communication come from reviews of previous editions whf-ch appeared in such diverse places as the Canadian Journal of Psychology, Physics Today, and Romance Phllolo~ ahd lndicllte that it fs a broad ranging and fascinating book. The range is certainly broad, so broad that I have included a table-of contents as an appendix to this review rather than attempting to summarize the contents of the hook. But it is no longer fascinating. Students of human c~mmunication have thought and debated much and even learned a little between the publication of the first edition of On Hman Communication in 1957 and the publication of the third edition in 1978. But very little of that material has become part of the substance of Cherry's book @though some of it is cited). Thus, while the first editf on may well hkve been \"A Review, a Survey, and a Criticism'' (the book's subtitle), the third edition is not. Too much is left unconsidered. The most serious gap is in the consideration of natural languages. Cherry gives the impression that infomation theory, statistics, Fourier analysis, and perhaps a little logic are the most important fonnal tools for the analysis of natural language. That may have been true when Cherry mote the first edition of the book, but it is cqrtainly not true now, Cherry does make a few references to Chomsky, but none of the substance of the Chomskian revolution (not to mention post-Chomskian developments) has affected Cherry's treatment of natural language. The texture of theorizing and model building in lin@istics, psycholinguistics, and cognitive psychology has undergone considerable change since the Fifties, but little of that has become part of the substance of On Human Communication. Similarly, a great deal of work: has been dove on nonverbal commur~ication in the last two decades. While cherry alludes to some of this work, he midies no attempt t~ summarize any of the major lines of inquiry. As with modern linguistics, the material is too diverse to cover it a11 in the sort of survey which Cherry intends On Human Congmicatidn to be. What I find so disheamtening is that so little of thls material is mentioned at all, especially when one realizes that Cherry has added a new chapter (\"~uman Communication: Peeling, Knowing, and Understanding\") to ,the third edition for the purpose of talking ab~ut what is specifically human about human communication. That Cherry should devote ten pages to Zipfvs law while not even mentioning the work of Paul Ekman, Carroll Izard, aad Manfred CJJrnes (to mention only the work which comes mqst readily to my mind) on the expression and cmnunication of emotion is biearre, -Pinally, Cherry's treatment of semiotics is relatively insulated from most of the-semiotic research of the last tqo de&es. Semiotics is itself such a diverse and amorphous enterprise (as diverse and amorphous as the study OF human communication is) that it is perhaps unfsir to criticis* Cherry for shortchanging it. Rut Cherry introduced the t3piC of ritual into his final chapter and that is a subject on which semioticians have had a great deal to say (I am thinking of structural anthropologists such as Claude Levi-Stmuss, Edmund Leach, and Victor Turner). C,onsequently I am inclined to view Cherry's neglect of Semiotics perhaps more harshly than I otherwise would. No doubt Cherry catlld be charged with other sinssf oniinission, but the three I've mentioned are serious enough, It is equally beyond doubt that an edition of On Human Communication which $ncluded this material would be a very different book, not Colin Cherry's book at all. If Cherry had, attempted and achieved a synthesis of his material, then its value as a synthesis might well outweigh the dated nature of some of the elements of the synthesis. Rut Cherry wasn't after a synthesis; he simply wanted to see what was out there. There is now much out there which Cherry hasn't seen. Consequently On Human Communication is not a good guide. The person -who wants or negds a general introduction to the subject of human communication which reflects the current state of the art(s) will have to look elsewhere.

F~rst, ~t is demonstrated how the system's communicative competence is enhanced by its imitation of human visual-search processes. The approach taken to noun-phrase resolution is then described, and an algorithm for the","paragraphs":["generation of noun phrases is illustrated with a series of examples: Finally, the system's ability to explain its own reasoning is discussed, with emphasis on the novel aspects of its implementat~on. 1, THE TREATMENT OF VISUAL DATA The natural language dialogue system HAM-RPMu converses with a human partner about scenes which either one or both are looking at directly (or have a photograph of). At present the system, which is implemented in FUZZY (~eFaivre 1977), 1s being tested on two domains: the interior of a living room and a traffic scene. Since it is assumed that both partners begin the dialogue with relatively little specific knowledge about the scene, most of the specific information used by the system during the conversation must be, obtained by a process more or less analogous to looking at the scene. we have found it worth-while to make the analogy qulte close, requiring the system to retrieve its visual data by doing something like casting a series of glances centered on various points in the scene. Fig. I is a schematic drawing of a section of our traffic scene, showing a tree with a parking lot in front of it. How easy is it to recognize the various objects in Fig. 1 when glancing at point A? CAR9 and CAR8 will be about equally easy to recognize as cars. TREE4 will probably be recognized more easily, since it is equally close to point A, and very large, and since there are no simi lar types of objects. On the other hand, CAR3 wi 11 be less easily recognizable, since it is farther away. MAN̂is probably too far away to be recognizable as a man at all (he is recognizable only from the points nearest him, as is shown by the four arrows pointing away from h~m). Just this information is stored In HAM-RPM in a separate associative network corresponding to point A. In all, there are about a hundred such small networks (represented by the small dots in Fig. I), corresponding to possible glances at the scene. The statements about the nature of the various objests which are recognizable from the point in question are ordered, in a way characteristic of the FUZZY programing language, in terms of their recognizability, so that they will automatically be retrieved in that order2. T.he system's overall structure is described in (v. Hahn et al. 1978) as are the goals and methodological principles which guide the research wi thin the project. 2, These networks are implemented as CONTEXTS in the sense introduced by tile l anguage CONN I VER. Fig. 1. \"The man in front ot the tree\" A simple example will show how the data stored in this way can be used by the system. When interpreting the defin~te description the man In front of the tree, assuming %hat TREE4 is the one meant, the system enters several CONTEXTS in front of TREE4, within each retrieving the internal names of the men recognizable from that point. It doesn't flnd MAN̂until it has entered the CONTEXT corresponding to point 0. It then enters a couple more, and, finding no further men, assumes that it has found the referent of the definite description. Information not only about the respective types of the various objects, but also about their other attributes is stored in a similar way. Why is it worth all this trauble to make the systan sensitive to the recognizability of the various facts about a scene from the various points within it? After all, the facts themselves could be stored very straightforwardly. Our principal justification is that, for a dialogue system which is supposed to communicate effectively with a hunlan partner, the bare facts about the scene are less important than the way the partner himself would be likely ro perceive them. If only the facts thenlselves are known, intorrnation may be lacking which is essential for the production of a connnunicatively adequate response. For example, the definite description whose interpretation was just sketched was, strictly speaking, ambiguous, as there is a second man in front of the tree whom the system would have considered to be the referent of the description if MAN2 hadn't been there. Yet the system didn't even notice this ambiguity, since it stopped shortly after flnding the first man. To be sure, the resolution of such ambiguities could also be achieved by giving the system general Information on the recognizability of objects for human beings and letting it choose on that basis which of the potential referents of the description was the one which the partner was most llkely to have intended to refer to. Instead of doing this, we have made the system itself a model of its partner, so that instead of referring to a model, it only has to 'be itself' or 'act naturally' in order to comnunicate effectively'. In add~tion to the interpretation of ambiguous utterances, there are other situations in which this approach can be applied elegantly (Fig. 2). SITUAT ION l NFORMATI ON 1) Interpretation of an ambiguous definite description 2) Generation of a definite description"]},{"title":"3)","paragraphs":["Description of a part of a scene Fig. 2 Which object the speaker is probably referring to Which reference points will be easy fqr the l i stener to f iad Which objects the speaker might be ~nterested in hearing about Two of the reports (v. Hahn 1978a, 1978b) which have been issued by the HAM-RPM group deal with the question of the nature of the relation between the dialogue partner model and the human partner in some detail. When describing the location of arl object with reference to other objects, the systeii~ wi ll usually find a nun~bet of potential reference points; in general, it should mention those which are visually easiest for the listener to find. This is likely to happen if it itself finds these reference points partlculdrly easily. When answering a vague question, such as a request to describe what is on the other side of the street, the system will have to select among the many visible facts those which the listener might be interested in hearing about. In many cases, these will be the visually most salient facts. 2. NOUN-PHRASE RESOLUTION Two of the components of HAM-RPM which make use of the visual data are those responsible for noun-phrase resolution, that is, the determination of the potential referents of a noun phrase, and noun-phrase generat ion, that is, the construction of noun phrases to identify objects uniquely. The procedures which resolve noun phrases wo~k on the shallow structure af the input sentence. Th~s IS what IS obtained after multiple-word phrases and idioms have been replaced with canonical expressions, the words have been looked up in the lexicon, and a simple morphological analysis has been performed. A definite noun phrase is recognized within the shallow structure as a structure consisting of a definite article, possibly one or more attributes, a noun, and possibly a relative clause (Ritchie 1977). In a way reminiscent of Winogred's SHRDLU (Winograd 1972), processes involviqg semantics and pragmatics are activated in HAM-RPM as soon as possible during the analysis of the input sentence. The noun-phrase interpreter tries to find a unique referent for each definite noun-phrase by using the knowledge stored in the conceptual and referential semantic networks and performing visual search algorithms. For example, the definite description The prcture hanglng to the left of the red chair, referring to Fig. 3, is replaced with the internal object-name PICTURE1 in the shallow structure of the sentence. This strategy can save a good deal of unnecessary processing: if no object is found which satisfies the description, there is no further parsing, but rather fed-back to Fig. 3 the conversational partner. In the .case where more than one potential referent IS found, the one mentioned most recently IS assumed to be the referent. If none of them has been mentioned recently. the system asks the partner for further details, assuming, as it were, that he does have some particular object in mind. These details take the form of a noun phrase, which may be either complete or elliptical. Further attributes of the intended object may be specified, it may be characterized in terms of Its spatial relations to other objects, or the noun originally used in the descript~on may be replaced wi th a more specific one. Not all noun phrases, of course, can be replaced immediately w~th a specific referent. One such case IS exemplified by the description the chalr rrl front of the red cupboard. Appl led to the scene i~ Fig. 3, the noun phrase the red cupboard cannot be replaced, because there is more than one red cupboard, but it cannot be ignored, either, because there is more than one chair. The entire noun phrase can only be interpreted when it is recognized that there is only one pair bf objects which stand in this relation to one another. Another case where a definite noun phrase can't simply be repidced directly by its referent is the generic description with definite article, as in the sentence The cha~ 1s somet-hrng to sit on. Lately we have been thinking about what formal features of a sentence might be helpful in recog-n I z i ng such descr ipt ions (see Grosz 1976)"]},{"title":".","paragraphs":["Two clues which tend to favour a generic interpretation are the absence of any referential attribute and the presence of an adverb such as usually or normally. On the other hand, a generic interpretation becomes somewhat less plausrble if the noun phrase is the object of a local preposition, as In on the chair, if the sentence is in the past tense; or if the verb can be generally classified as one involving visual perception or spatial relations. We assume that, no matter how many weak inference rules of this sort are incorporated into the system, there will still be some ambiguities which can only be resolved by other means, including interaction with the speaker. A general goal in this connection is a sort of compatibility between noun-phrase resolut ion and noun-phrase generat ion, in the sense that the system should be able to understand any kind of noun-phrase that it can generate, and vice versa. 3. NOUN-PHRASE GENERATION The method we have developed for the inverse process, noun-phrdse generation, is distinguished from earlier approaches mainly in three respects. The f ~rst is its use of what might be called a iworst-case-firsti strategy. The second is the way it takes into cons~deration the ease with which the l~stener will be able to interpret the description it generates, when more than one uniquely identifying description is possible (~errmann G Laucht 1976). The third is its use of complex spatial relations to deal with the 'worst cases', that is, those in which several objects are indistinguishable on the basis of their properties alone. Let's exatnine a fewexamples of the behavior of the algorithm First, two trivial cases. Fig. 4 The street in Fig. 4 has a proper name, and is thus referred to simply as Schluterstrasse. The tree is the only one in the discourse world, and hence is identified as the tree. The number of interesting possible strategies becomes greater when the object to be described is one of several belonging to the same conceptual class. Consider for example MAN1 in Fig. 4. The system looks among its properties for one which distinguishes it from MAN2 and MAN3, and describes it as the small man. A similar process underlies the generation of the noun phrase the blg man with the umbrella to refer to MAN3. Note that the system uses redundant labels. This is a consequence of the sequential nature of its noun-phrase generation: First, the property 'big' is found. When the system notices that there is another big man in the scene, it looks for a Furkher dist iw*-shing property and finds the umbrella. This property would in fact be adequate in itself, but the system doesn't attempt to find a minimal characterizing set of attributes. This sort of redundancy, which is often found in human beings, saves time both in the generation and in the interpretation of definite descriptions. HAM-RPM frequently uses negative characterizations of various kinds, as, for example, when MAN2 is described as the bry man without an umbrella. Now let's turn to some more complex problems of noun-phrase generation. So that the pictures don't get too cluttered, we will use examples from a simple GREEN SQUARE3 Fig."]},{"title":"5","paragraphs":["domain of geometrical figures (fig. 5). Consider CIRCLE1 in Fig."]},{"title":"5.","paragraphs":["Note that there are two green circles in the scene. The presence of several objects which are indistinguishable on the basis of their attributes alone is the worst case which can occur. The reason why we have spoken of a 'worst-case-f irst' strategy is that the system checks for this case early, rather than trying immediately to construct a simpler characterization such as those in the last few examples given. Informal observation shows that human beings also often notice the presence of identical objects in a scene immediately. The only way to distinguish these two circles is by reference to spatial relations, for example, the green clrcle in front of the red square. We may note in passing two ways in which the form of a description may be constrained by the form of the question which is being answered. First, properties wh~ch have been presupposed in the question should not be ment ioned i n a descr i pt ion. Cons i der the ques t ion Which square is red?. The answer The red sguare is clearly unacceptable, so instead the system answers he square in front of the green triangle (= SQUARE I i n F tg"]},{"title":". 5) . A second","paragraphs":["constraint of this sort is that the system sphould not produce circular Fig. 6 descr~ptions. For example, when answering the question Where is the red triangle?, the system should not answer To the left of the green square whlch is to the rlght of the red triangle, a l though each ha1 f of thi s description is perfectly natural when considered in isolation. It sometimes happens that objects chosen as spatial reference points In a description in turn have to be identified with the help of other reference points. For example, CIRCLE2 in Fig. 5 is described as the green circle ln front of the green square which 1s to the left of the red triangle. As this example shows, the products of such recursive applications of the generation algor~thm can soon become difficult to understand. We have made the maximum allowable depth of recursion a parameter which can be set to varlous values for experimental purposes. Perhaps the most difficult problem in noun-phrase generation is the unique identification of an object when there are objects with exactly the same prsperties in its immediate neighbourhood (fig. 6). This is a task which often causes difficulties even for a human speaker. To set the stage, suppose that CIRCLE6 in Fig. 6 IS to be identified. The system first describes its position relative to the other circles in its group: the r~ght-hand clrcle Then it identifies the group of which CIRCLE6 is a member with-63 In the see-ne as a whole, distinguishing it first fra CROUP2: in ftont (ind to tl~c* left and then f ro~n GROUP3 : which 1s to the left of the square. Thus the complete descr ~ption is The right-hand czrcle in front and to the 1 tjft wlil cdr rs to tllr left of th~ squnra. TO put the point more generally, complex scenes sometimes have a hierarchical.struct~re in which groups of s~milar objects serve as units which have to be identified in much the same way that objects themselves are. The remarks we have made about circular descriptions and recursion depth apply on the level of groups as well. Concluding this sketch of HAM-RPM's .noun-phrase interpreter and generator, we would like to stress that all these algorithms are doma~n-independent. 4. EXPLANATION Although all of the examples d~scussed up to now have involved some sort of description of visible aspects of a scene, HAM-RPM frequently makes use of general knowledge and inference rules to draw conclusions. For example, the system might be asked Is the park3ng zone tarred?, where the parking zone in question, though part of the scene, is hidden from view. It would then try to answer the question using approximate inferences based on fuzzy knowledge (~ahlster 1978), concluding that the parking zone might very well be tarred, because a parking zone is in a sense a part of a street, and streets, like thoroughfares in general, are usually tarred. Inferences which stand on such shaky ground as this one are of limited use to the conversational partner unless the system can describe the reasoning which underlies them. Furthermore, not just any description will be satisfactory: the system ought to act in accordance with the following 'three maxims, as formulated by (Grice 1975): 1. Hake your contribution as informative as is required. 2. Don't make your contribution more informative than is required. 3. Be relevant. Thus, describing an inference chain in every detail will not in general be cmunicatively adequate, if some of the inferences are essentially defini-t I I , aild t~tbllcc conccpt~~il I y tr i v id Only whcn the dialogue partner has rt.pcdtrhdly rccl~rcsted deta ils about inferences wi l l i t be sensible to mention all ol tllc~i~ Now I~bt's looh at the way we have tried to achieve these goals in HAM-RPM, uhi~lg the example just given. Three processes are essential. First, while the ruasorilng is being performed, a sort of trace of the Inference process is stored in a separa'te date base called INFERENCE-MEMORY. Second, after an explanation of the conclusion has been requested, this part of memory is traversed to find those of the assumptions used which are on a conr~~uo~catively appropriate level of detail. Finally, these assumptions are expressed in natural language.

We show, however, that Sampson's model, and several of its restricted versions, allow a far wider range of generative powers. In the cases where the model appears to be too powerful, we suggest possible alterations which may make it more acceptable. 1. Introduction Linguistic theories are at least partially interested in presenting the regularities found in natural languages. Given the current dominance of the Transformational Generative (TG) school in the field of linguistics, it seems necessary for theories competing for attention to possess a formal model, In addition to the advantages normally derived from presenting results through a formalism, such as precision, succinctness and verifiability, one can also comment on the veracity of metatheoretic claims. It was using such formal arguments that Chomsky and his collaborators demonstrated the inability of finite automata and of context-free grammars to describe all natural language constructs. Similarly, the formal work of Peters and Ritchie","paragraphs":["[8,91"]},{"title":"was important in uncovering inadequacies of two notions of TG theory namely, the \"recoverability of deletions condition\" and the \"universal base hypothesis\". Finally, since many generative linguists want grammatical theories which characterize natural languages, they fault any theory which is .too powerful\" in the sense of being able to describe languages which clearly cannot","paragraphs":["be"]},{"title":"natural languages, such as non-recursive sets. Furthermore, computer scientists working on natural languages will have to give in the future more consideration to the work of linguists, especially on \"exotic\" languages, in order to be able to observe a wider range of phenomena. Such access will be facilitated if the formalismsin which the grammaTs are prese'nted lend themselves to computer implementation for purpose$ such as parsing, testing, etc. This entails, among other things,that linguists should avoid as much as possible features which make their grammars generate non-recursive sets, and hence it","paragraphs":["is"]},{"title":"one of the purposes of the present paper to","paragraphs":["point"]},{"title":"out such features and discuss possible ways of avoiding them. In this paper we will discuss one model proposed for the stratificational theory of linguistics. This theory, advanced by S. Lamb, H.A. Gleason Jr. and their collaborators","paragraphs":["(C51,[61,C71),"]},{"title":"advocates that langdages be described in terms of several sub-systems, known as strata. Each stratum has","paragraphs":["its"]},{"title":"own set of units and a tactics specifying the tlcorrectfl (\"all~wable'~) structures that stratum. specific grammar might for example have strata corresponding roughly to semantics, syntax-morphology and phonology, although this is by no means standard. Furthermore, the strata are linearly ordered as levels, and there is a realization relation which connects adjacent strata by attaching to every well-formed structure on one stratum, zero or more accompanying structures on","paragraphs":["the"]},{"title":"adjacent strata. Note","paragraphs":["therefore that a"]},{"title":"particular utterance has simultaneous expression on each stratum. In this","paragraphs":["paper"]},{"title":"we examine the formal model for stratificational linguistics proposed by Sampson","paragraphs":["(L131)."]},{"title":"This model uses rewrite grammars G1,G2, ... to describe the tactics, while the realization relation is essentially a rewrite system R acting as a transducer between the languages of-the tactics. More specifically, realization connects adjacent tactics G and","paragraphs":["Gj+l j"]},{"title":"by matching sentences u in the language generated by G with those sentences j v in the language of","paragraphs":["Gj+l"]},{"title":"which can be derived from u by using rules from R. An important property of the linguistic realization relation is the fact that' every structure on some stratum can have only a finite number of llrealizates\" on the next stratum. This means that the rewrite system R must be constrained so that it has no recursive symbols. Such a rewrite system will be called acyclic. We investigate here the effect of acyclic rewrite systems acting as transaucers on axiom sets, varying the type of the derivations and rules allowed. We prove in this paper that regular languages are closed under transduction by acyclic rewrite systems, but that the linear context-free languages are mapped onto the recursively enumerable sets. This implies that stratificational grammars with non-selfembedding ta~ctics would be too weak while those with even one context-free tactics would be too strong. If the realization derivation","paragraphs":["is"]},{"title":"restricted to be in some sense \"leftmost\", then we show that the transduction can be performed by a finite,state device known as an a transducer. Furthermore, if productions","paragraphs":["with"]},{"title":"null right-hand sides are not allowed in an acyclic rewrite system then all the derivations can be made leftmost. This provides one possible method of restricting the generative power of acyclic rewrite systems. By deriving a recursive characterization of the languages generated with n-strata in terms of (n-1)-stratal languages, we can show that if the realization is restricted to being leftmost, then the languages described are homomorphic images of the intersections of the languages generated by the tactics. In particular, this means that we can find natural families of stratificational grammars which generate far example the sets recognized in real time by nondeterministic multitape Turing machines. This result partially confirms a hitherto unproven claim by Sampson, and discredits Postal's Clll classiciation of stratlficational grammars as just another variant of context-free phrase-structure grammars. Finally, we investigate the use of ordered rules in linguistic grammars and prove that in several models they allow the generation of sets which are not even recursively enumerable","paragraphs":["a"]},{"title":"clearly unsatisfactory situation.
