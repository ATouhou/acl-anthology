There is not enough infopmation in the spech signal to uniquely identify the phonemes or words in a normally spoken utterance. 2.

SPEECHLIS has used two task domains; that of the LUNAR text question-answering system 1361 which deals with chemical analyses of Apollo 11 moon rocks and one dealing with travel budget management.

The acoustics component anaJyzes the acoustic signal to extract features and segment the utterance into a iattice of alternative possible sequences of phonemes t~chwartz and Makhoul [26]), phonological rules augment the output of the acoustic component to include sequences of phonemes which could have reaul ted in the observed phonemes; the lexical retrieval componant retrieve8 words from the lexicon on tho basis of this information (Rovner, et.al.

We call the formalism a Modifi& Au~mentdd Transitiom Network (MATN), and assert that it has the same power as the original ATN formalism. The changes, are briefly indicated here. For a fuller discussion, see Bates [4]. Every arc of an ordinary ATN has a test component, which may be any predicate. It is usually a boolean combination of tests on the current input word (its features, etc.) and the contents of registers which have been sat by actions on previous arcs. In the MATN formalism, the test component of each arc is, on all but the PUSH arc, a list of two teats. The first is a test on the Page 10 current word and its features, i.e. a local, context-free test. The second is a test on the register contents, i.e. a context-sensitive teat. Both tests must succeed for the arc to be taken. The reason for splitting up the testa in this wav is that register checking tests cannot be made unless the repisters are sat, apd in mally situations in the speech environment there may not be enou~h left context to puarantee that the prcper r*egisttbrs would be set. Thua it is useful to be a to evaluate the context-free test on an arc at a different time in the parsing Rrocess from the context-sensitive one. On PUSH arcs, there are the types of tests which a used. It is useful and efficient to test the next word of input before actually doing the PUSH, to sea, for example, if the next word can begin a constituent of the ty~e being PUSHed for. This test is called a look-ahead test, and takes the place of the normal context-free test in the test component of the arc. Them is also the usual context-sensitive test on repisters ;rhich were set before the PUSH arc was el-]countered. And finally, when the PIISH arc returns with a constituent, another context-free tedt may be done on the structure of the entire constituent. Therefore, the test component of a PUSH arc is a list o.f the three tests iust desaribed.

Section 4 Uverview of SPARSER The input to SPARSER is assumed to be a set of words together with their boundary points (which may or may not be related to points in time). A word together with its boundaries Is termed a word match. A word match also includes a score which indicates how well the ideal phonemic representation of the word matched the acoustic analysib of the utterance (but as we shall see the parser has little need of this information). Since the same word may match at several sets of boundary points or may match in deveral ways between the same boundary points, each word ~t~~ is also given a unique number to help identify it. Thus the structure for a basic word match is: (number word leftboundary rightboundary lexicalscore) e.8. (4 TRAVEL 5 11 94), or (4 TRAVEL 5 11 (94 110)) where the score is given as a pair of numbers representing the actual and maximum scores, or (4 TRAVEL 5 11) where the score is omitted. How is the input to the parser to be constructed? We assume that acoustic processing and lexical scanning components can operate on a digitized waveform to produce a number of word matches such as prev.iously shown"]},{"title":"in","paragraphs":["the word lattice of Figure 1.1. (That this is possible has bean demonstrated by Woods"]},{"title":"[33]).","paragraphs":["Allowing the parser to operate unrestricted on the entire word lattice would probably not be fruitful because of the large numbe~ of locally syntactically correct combinations of words, but one possibility for input to the parser would be to take a set of the best-matching, non-overlapping word matches in the lattice, such as those in Figure 4.1. A set of non-overlapping word matches is a hypothesis about the content of the utterance. In order to avoid creating large numbers of such sets which are put together combinatorially with no basis except local acoustic match, semantic or pragmatic processes can be used to group word matches based on what is meaningful or likely to be heard. For example, if a dialogue has been about various nickel compounds, the combination \"nickel analysesw may be more likely than \"chemical analysesff even though the word match for 'tchemicalff has a higher score than that for mnickelfff'.

In certain circumstances which will be detailed later, the input to SPARSER will be a theory together with one or more word matches which are to be added in order to create a new larger theory which is then to be syntactically analyzed. We will assume that there exists a cantrol component which presents SPARSER with theories to process and to which SPARSER can communicate predictions and results.

That does not mean that no more transitions can be made, since arcs which do not test the input word can be taken as usual. Arcs which do use input cannot be taken, but they can be used to predict what sort of input would be acceptable at that position.

Section 5 More Details of the Parsinfi Process 5.1 DEPTH vs BREADTH The parsing strategy just outlined works bottom up when beg inn in̂to parse an island and when a constituent is created which was not monitored for by the current theory. It works top dawn after an island has been started and to make syntactic predictions at the ends of islands. Both top down and bottom up techniques can be either depth or breadth first. Depth first processing takes at every step the ffl-st piece of information available and pursues its consequences. Breadth first processing considers at every step every possible next step of every alternative and pursues all paths in parallel. Breadth first processing generally takes much more space than the depth first many paths would have to be remembered at once Rags 40 instead of having just one stack which could be popped and reused when necessary. The breadth first process mi~ht save some computation steps and might produce several ambiguous parsin~s simultaneously while tba depth first process would find one before the others (the latter is a'small difference, since both processes would have to be run to exhaustion to insure that all possible parsings had been found). In parsing speech, some mixture of breadth first and depth first proc~ssing can be extremely useful. To illustrate an advanta~e of breadth first processing in the speech environment, consider what might happen if, durinp the processin8 of an island the parser picks up a confirtiration to extend which has several possible arcs emanating from it. If one arc is chosen and all the others are held as alternativss (imem depth first), but the chosen arc is wronp, all subsequent paths beg inn in̂with that arc would have to block before the alternatives would be tried. However, if the end of the island were reached before. the success or failure of the first choice were confirmsd, the only way that backup would ever take place would be to have one or more events add words to the thsory so that the path could be extended until it failed. Since the pap wou.ld be likely to be filled by (incorrect) words predicted by the erroneous path, or by no words at all if the (incorrect) predictions were not satisfied, it is not at all clear how the process would aver know to back up.

SPARSER could use prosodic information in several ways. Verification of constituents would be a prest help, but local proaicid information could be used ev*n earlier in the parsing p~oceas.

If, as is more likely, yome major boundariey could be reliably detected, then it would be easy to revise SPARSER to begin procsssinp at such places even #within an island at states which can begin constituents.
