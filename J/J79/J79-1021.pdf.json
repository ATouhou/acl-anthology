These are each specialized computer science research fields with distinct objectives and assumptions. The narrower goals involve making it possible for a computer user to employ a near natural-language mode for problem-salving, information retrieval, and other applications. Naturdl computer responses have also been created and a special term, \"understanding\", has been used to describe the resulting computek-human dialogues. Phe purpose of this paper is to survey these recent developments to make the A1 literature accessible to researchers mainly interested in computation on written text or spoken language."]},{"title":"1, INTRODUCTION The computer literature discussed in this paper uses several linguistic terms in special ways, when there is a possibility sf congusion, quotation marks will","paragraphs":["be"]},{"title":"used to identify technical terms in computer science. The term \"understanding\" is frequently used as a synonym for \"the addition of logical relationships or semantics to syntactic processing\". This use is substantially qarrower than the word's implicit association with \"human behavior implemented by computer'' the narrower use is introduced as a neutral reference point, The question of whether a computer porgram can operate in a human-like way is central to artificial intelligence. \"Do current 'understanding' program systems show how extended human-like capability can be implemented using computers?\" is a related pragmatic questton Initially this investigation sought to examine whether programs which \"understand\" language in the stipulated narrow sense are protatypes which could lead to expanded capability. Unfortunately, \"language understanding\" and its special subtopic \"speeeh understanding'' are insufficiently developed to permit profitable discussion of the original question Hence an operational approach to the recent literature is taken here. This paper outlines how \"language understanding\" research has evolved and identifies key elements of program organization used to achieve limited computer \"understanding\". 2, LEVEL AND DOMAIN Current A1 programs for lankuage processing are organized by level and restricted to specified domains. This section presents those ideas and comments on the limitations that they entail. Three principal levels of language-processing software are 1. \"Lexical\" (allowed vocabulary) 2. \"Syntactic\" (allowed phrases or sentences)","paragraphs":["3"]},{"title":"\"Semantic\" (allowed meanings) ln practice all these levels must operate many times","paragraphs":["for"]},{"title":"the computer to interpret even a small portion, say two words, of restricted natural-language input.

To reduce the complexity of this task, the designer limits the subset of language allower or the \"world\" (i.e. the subject) discussed. The word \"domain\" sums up this concept, other terms for \"restricted domain\" are \"limited scope of discourse\", \"narrow problem domain\", and \"restricted English framework\"","paragraphs":["The"]},{"title":"limitation of vocabulary or context constrains the lexicon and semantics of the \"language\".","paragraphs":["The trend"]},{"title":"in","paragraphs":["the"]},{"title":"design of software for \"natural-language understanding\" is to deal","paragraphs":["with"]},{"title":"(a) a specialized vocabulary, and (b) a particular context or set","paragraphs":["of"]},{"title":"allowed interpretations in order","paragraphs":["to"]},{"title":"reduce processing","paragraphs":["time."]},{"title":"Although computing results for several highly specialized problems Le,g. 7, 231 are impressive examples of language processing in restricted domains, they do not answer several key concerns. 1.

(More detail on parallel developments in speech processing is presented later.) The early \"language-understanding\" systems, BASEBALL [9], ELLZA, and STUDENT, were based on two special formats: one to represent the knowledge they store and one to find meaning in the English input. They discard all input information which cannot be transformed for internal storage. The comparison of ELIZA and STUDENT in [I] is with regard to the degree of \"understanding\" ELIZA responds either by transfoiming the input sentence (essentially mimicry) following isolation of a key word or by using a prestored content-free remark. STUDENT translates natural-language \"descriptions of algebraic equations, ... proceeds to identify the unknowns involved and the relationships which hold between them, and (obtains and solves) a set of equations\" [I, p 851.

Programs with an ability to spout back similar to ELIZA's usually store a body of text and an indexing scheme to it.

It is sh~wn that proposi~ions of a coherent discourse must be logically cbnnected and exhibit a hierarchic thematic structure that has a single root. An eqample of a logical connective is 'Cause'; a theme is a generalized pattern that is associated with a single word, e.g., 'poison' is describable as 'Someone ingests something that causes him to become ill'. A theme applies to a discourse if 2ts definiens matches part of the discourse. The topic of a coherent discourse is its matrix theme; an illformed discourse has no topic. Not all discourse structure is expressed. If omitted, it must be inferrable. The process of inference requires a store of world knowledge - encyclopedic knowledge.

REPRESENTATION","paragraphs":["AND UNDERSTANDING Preface","Jaime Carbonell was our friend and colleague. For many years he worked with 11s on problems in Artificial Intelligence, especially on the developrnerit of RII intelligent instructionnl system. Jainle directed the Artificinl Intelligence group et Bolt, Deranek, and Ncwman (in Cambridge, Massnchusetts) until his death in 1973. Some of us who hod worlred with Jaime decided to hold a conference in his nlemory, a confcrerlce whose guiding principle wonld be that Jaime would have enjoyed it. This book is the result of that conferencb.","Jain~e Carbonell's isnportant contribution to cognitive science is best sumnlarized in the title of one of his publicatio~ls: A7 irt CAI. Jaime wanted to put principles oE Aritificial Intelligence into Computer-Assisted Instruction (CAI) systems. He dreamed of a system which had a data base of knowledge about a topic matter and general information about language and the principles of tutorial instruction. The system could then pursue a natural tutorial dialog with a student; sometimes following the student's initiative, sometimes taking its own intiative, but always generating its statements rind responses in a natural way from its general knowledge. This system contrasts sharply with existing systems for Computer-Assisted Instruction in which a relatively fixed sequence of questions and possible reponses have to be determined for each topic. Jaime did construct working versions of his &ream--in a system which he called SCHOLAR. But he died befoi-e SCHOLAR reached the full realization of the dream.","It was a pleasure to work with Jaime. His kindness and his enthusiasm were infectious, and the discussions we had with him over the years were a great stimulus to our own thinking. Both as a friend and a colleague we miss him greatly.","Cognitive Science. This book contains studies in a new field we call cognitive science. Cognitive science includes elements of psychology, computer science, linguistics, philosophy, and education, but it is more than the intersection of these disciplines. Their integration has produced a new set of tools for dealing with a broad range REPRESENTATION AND UNDERSTANDING of questions. In recent years, the interdctions among the workers in these fields has led to exciting new developments in our undemtanding of intelligent systems and the development of a science of cognition. The group of workers has pursued problem$ that did not appear to be solvable from within any single discipline. It is too early to predict the future course of this new interaction, but the work to date has been stimulating and inspiring. It is our hope that this book can serve as an illustrntion of the type of problems Chat can be qq~roached through interdisciplinary cooperation. The participants in this book (and at the conference) represent the fields sf Artificial Intelligence, Linguistics, and Psychology, all of whom work on similar problems but with different viewpoints. The book focuses on the common problems, hopefully acting as a way of bringing these issues to the attention of all workers in those fields related to cognitive science.","Subject Matter. The book contains four sections. In the first section, Theory of Representotion, general issues involved in building representations of knowledge are explored. Daniiel G. Bobrow proposes that solutions to a set of design issues be used as dimensions for comparing different represetltations, and he examines different forms such solutions might take. William A. Woods explores problems in representing natural-language statements in semantic networks, illustrating difficult theoretical issues by examples. Joseph D. Becker is concerned with the representation one can infer for behavioral systems whose internal workings cap not be observed directly, and he considers the interconnection of useful concepts such as hierarchical organization, system gaals, and resource conflicts Robert J. Bobrow and John Seely Brown present a model for an expert understander which can take a collection of data &scribing some situation, synthesize a contingent knoultedge structure which places the input drrta in the context of a larger structural organization, and which answers questions about the situation based only on the contingent knowledge structure.","Section two, New Memory Models, discusses the implications of the assumption that input information is always interpreted in terms of large structural units derived REPFLESENTATION AND UNDERSTANDING from esporionce. Daniel G. Bobrow and Donnld A. Norman postulate active sciicrnnla in memory which r~fer to each other through use of car~tuxl-deper~derlt descriptions, and whir11 respo~irl both to input data and to hypothcs~s about structure. Benjamin J. Kuipers describes thc conc~l)t of a frame us a structural organizing unit for data ele~nents, nnd he discusses the use of these units in the context of n recognition system. Terry Winogrod explores issues i~lvolved in the controversy on rcl~rcsc~lting knowledge iu declarative vcrsus procedural form. Winogr~tl uses the concept of a frame ns a basis for the synthesis of the declarative and proccdural tipproaches. The frame provides an organizing structure on which to attach both declarative and procedural informhtion.","The third section, lligher Level Structures, focuses on the representation of plans, episodes, and stories within memory. David E. Rumelhart proposes a grammar for well-formed stories. 'His summarization rules for stories based on this grammar seem to provide reasonable predictions of human behavior. Roger C. Schank postulates that in understanding paragraphs, the reader fills in causal connections between propositions, and that such causally linked chains are the basis for most human memory organization. Robert P Abelson defines a notation in which to describe the intended effects of plans, and to express the conditions necessary for achieving desired states.","The fourth section, Semantic Knowledge in Understander Systems, describes how knowledge has been used in existing systems. John Seely.Brown and Richard R. Burton describe a system which uses multiple representations to achieve expertise in teachiog a student about debugging electronic circuits. Bonnie Nash-Webber describes the role played by semantics in the understanding of continuous speech in a limited domain of discourse. Allan Collins, Eleanor H. Warnock, Nelleke Aiello, and Mark L. Viller describe a continuation of work on Jaime Carbonell's SCHOLAR system. They examine how liumans use strategies to find reasonable answers to questions for which they do net have the knowledge to answer with certainty, and how people can be taught to reason this way. iii REPRESENTATION AND UNDERSTANDING","Acknowledgments.

Although this my seem tb ignore cqutational linguistics, the greatest imnediate benefit for the pmgranurter lies in the fFrst the chapters anyway. Within Chap 1, the section on gramws and patterns can be used for the inIplemntation of simple syntactic analysis. For exaqle, there is a straightforward mpping of a BNf g~mmar into SNOBON patterns, but there are pitfalls (as well as scsne more efficient representations in the balance) that the programer ought to know. These are c'arefully explained. A topic that I felt was inadequately covered in Chapter 1 was the definition of the pattern mtching mechanism itself. The immediate presentation of examples using pattern rratchhg (page 2) calls for a brief overview of pattern mtchhg syntax and seman-tics. Surely a progrwnnw? muld appreciate not having to refer back to his in.troductory text should some patten function or construct bebhazy in his memory. Even an appendix wuld be satisfactory. In addition, this would support the section on ptterns as procedures by providing the underlying semantics for such tlprocedures. EUrther incentive for its inclusion is provided by. the excellent review of progt-annner-defined data types in Chapter 3. Why leave pattern mtching to the userJ.s recollection? The function definition facility discussed in Chapter 2 eraables the constructic of generic functions. Since there are no data type declarations for function argunents or parwters, often only one function is required for the execution of related op&ations.on various data types. The proliferation of functions in a complex system might therefore be systemtically reduced., The burdeg falls on the progrmer, of course, to sort out +he admissible combinatians or appropriate actions. An addition function for real and cmplex numbers is discussed, where the fom is a SNOBOL4 primitive and the latter is constructed from pmgrmer-defined data types. Although not in the realm of cqutatiowl linguistics, it does have a parallel, for exmple, in a function whi& inserts data into a semantic network and is expected to handle various chunks of netwmk as well as atomic data. The data type might only be determined. during prop execution; using a generic function avoids distracting logic within the user's primary function. The section on functions as generators is a little weak from the point of view of computational linguistic requirements fa procedures which generate successive alterna?ives frcmn a complex s-tructure, for example, sentence parsing or referent resolution. The use of sjmple global variables is tm lMted in these contexts; one often heeds to become involved with saving the values of ~e~eral lwal variables in special data blocks or stacking the decision pints associated with alternatives. The first is a well-known compiler-design technique, while he second involves a backbxicking control struc'hxe. In fact, an excellent illustration of these ideas would be an implementation of the SfJOBOL4 pattern matohing system in SNOBON. Chapter 3 is the mst useful because it desmibes how propammer-defined data types can be used to build \"sh.u~tures~~: stacks, queues, lhked lists, binary trees, am3 trees. The skillful user of such representations will find a reduced role for complicated patterm mtchhg expressions because the implicit structure &coded into a string becomes dfest in the explicit links of the shcture. Not only is there often an economic advantage, but the semmtics of SNOBOL4-are easier to use than the implicit itcMracking semantics of pattern mtching. (Grimold himself phts this out in the section on patterns as procedures. The prog~mner is encouraged to consider economic trade-offs in the hplemehtation of stcuchuws. Often overlooked questions are addressed: for example, the relative merits of implementing stacks using strings, arrays, tables, or defined data types. Programs for the use or traversal of structures are also provided. Although exercise 3.40 requests a representation for directed graphs, neither hint nor answer is pvided. The canputatid linguist having an hterest in smtic networks or similar associative structures is thus lef-t to his own expertise. ?he basic -tree representation mst be significantly dified to incorporate labelled edges, a nears of eaversal (search) thmqh the edge set, and, of course, non-txee structures. Gritwold apologizes for not covering every application, 6 8 but the generality and current popularity of networks for the representation of knowledge calls for expanded treatment of the topic. Among the appSications covered in detail, the ones most relevant to ccsnputational linguistics include a Mndom sentence generator (fm a pra~~~nar), an mcm processor, and (perhaps) a context editor. The input and output of textual mterial is covered in depth undw d6cument prepmtion (Chapter 6).

This style reinforces the stated intention of the book, which is to heLp a programmer with a problem by providing descriptions of non-mathematical techniques. The style and intention do limit the usefulness of this book, as some of the topics would be well known to advanced programmers and are not covered in sufficient depth for such a person. It is then the area between these two extr'emes to which this book is aimed, and there it can be of great service. The only important assumption made of the reader is that be know the variable types of Fortran (integer, real, Hollerith, etc.) and their attendant foymat specifications. A good knowledge of character formats is especially useful, although the major use for them is in output statements used in the examples given in the book. It is also assumed that the reader knows the basic Fortran statements, but this is simple matter as opposed to the format and variable type problems which confront a Fortran programmer. The bodk also includes several exercises at the end of each chapter (answers not supplied unfortunately) and a short but very complete bibliography which includes several sources for each chapter. The book's primary value is as a source for Hints to problems encountered during programming, providing an introduction to the'more sophisticated literature which can be found by starting with the bibliography. This book is therefore a starting point for picking up a basic vocabulary, techniques, and references for someone who has just completed a programming course or who needs a quick introduction to some technique which he may want to look at later in more detail.

The size of the literary corpus also called for basic decisions by successively sequestering different fractions of the corpus (in a way that would have doubtless intrigued Thomas himselfl), the compilers reduced the mass to manageable proportions. Their decisions may be set down serially. (1) LITERARY. First, divide the authentic works of Thomas (100"]},{"title":"+ 181)","paragraphs":["from those of other authorship (61): treat each in separate series. Secondly, extract literal quotations, citations in references to other authors, and cross-citations to other Aquinian treatises; treat these sepaiately. This leaves distinct layers of mat'erial for concor dancing.. (2) PHILOLOGICAL. First, separat.e out indeclinable6 like prepositions, conjunctions, adverbs, f oms of esse , helping verbs, etc.. pronouns, numerals, etc., etc ; these will occupy a pareiaular concordance. Second, put the remaining nouns, adjectives and verbs in a primary concordance: nbuns and adjectives arranged alphabetically by termination; verbs by a standard order. (3) LOGICAL. TO reduce the bulk of the concordance and to make the vacabdlary and context more rationally accessible: First, analyze out frequently used phrases (.e.g., liberum arbitrim, acceptio personarum, caelum et terra"]},{"title":"-","paragraphs":["there are about 500 of these), concordancing them under one word only; for example, acceptia personarum would be listed after all other instances of acceptio. Secondly, distinguish words which are either proper names or so commonly found that only a brief context (1% lines) need be quoted; the rest can then be set in a context of"]},{"title":"a","paragraphs":["lines"]},{"title":"-","paragraphs":["and the whole interfiled in a single series. These decisions have determined both the cnaraccer ana content of Sectio 11, comprising two series (Aquinian and non-Aquinian works) of five concordances each. So much for the Cotlcordance proper. There remains a further instrument for the use of scholars, Sectio I. In this are included indices of diseribution, sumrnarhs of the lexicon, and indLces of frequency: Through these lists linguistic and literary studies of all sorts can be made. By reverse alphabetical ordering of lemmata and forms additional 'kinds of analysis are facilitated. Since these volumes have not yet appeared, they can only be briefly mentioned here. A massive concordance of this type must carry a concise yet: precise location code for each item. The editors have determined the proper modern edition to be used, have set a precise order of works to be followed In the concordancing of each type under its appropriate lemma, and have summarized this on a separate 4-page insert, to whidh the user will doubtless make frequent reference as he learns to use this grand instrument of research. A short review cannot do justice to the immense detail and the intelligence with which this detail has, with human and computer help, been marshalled in the I.T. Ea'ther Busa and his associates are to be commended not only for their achievement, but: also for the example they have set for other laborers. Future Concordances to comparable literary corpora will obviously have their own special features; yet Busa's method of attacking problems"]},{"title":"-","paragraphs":["linguistic, philological, logical, quantitative"]},{"title":"-","paragraphs":["will suggest analogous modes of approach to others. While an index to St. Thomas by no means exhausts even the whole body of Christian Latlnity, it provides a key to the heart of Roman theology during 8 9 its period of greatest fruitfulness and to classical and patristic thought that passed through the schoolmen's filter. Space elso precludes discussion of the physical aspects of concordancing and printing, fo~ which Father Busa had the assistance of IBM. In a work of such vast proportiohs, the care of men cannot obviate error. Some 53 errors have been noted by the compilers in Conoordantia Prima. But even the correction of at least one of these contains a minor error: B.O12(QDV)23 13.ag8/8 should read B.012(QDV)22.13.ag8/8. See Sectio 2 vol- 1, p. 526, co1.2. Also 12.Tabula Syntagmatum, the list of phrases concordanced under only one member of the phrase (pp.xiv-xvi) has at least two errors: bona esteriora should read bona exteriora (p. xiv): drosperitas terrena should read prosperitas terrena (p. xvi) The most useful pentaglot descriptive booklet of 46pp. is somewhat marred in the English version by misprints and verbal infeliaities. But these small matters are quite eclipsed by the enormous accomplishment of Father Busa and his co-workers.
