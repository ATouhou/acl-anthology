Introduction For many years syntactic analysis and the theor;- of formal languages have developed in a parallel, but not closely rel-ted, fashion. The work described here is an effort t.0 relate these areas by applying the tools of formal power series to the p-iroblem OF parsing.

The polynomials we will use have terms of the form (Z,A), where Z is a string aver aa extended alphabet and A represents a sequence of productions of G.

The vector space analysis then appear& to confirm the conclusions derived earlier from the statistical models, that terms which appear in a collection with great rarity or excessive frequency are not optimal for content description purposes. Term Value Measuremt:nts 2. Compariscn and Evaluation The discrimination value analysis can be used to derive an effective indexing policy: since the best terms appear to be those with medium document frequencies, such terms can be directly assigned as content identifiers without further refining transformations. On the other hand, terms with excessively high document frequencies must be made more specific thereby decreasing the frequency of their assignment to The queries and documents of the coilection: contrariwise, terms with low document frequencies must be made more general by increasing their assignment frequencies. [5] This can be achieved by joining two or more high frequency terms into term phrases, while assembling a number of low frequency terms into term classes. Obviously, a term phrase exhibits a lower assignment frequency than any phrase component, and vice-versa for a term class which replaces a number of individual class elements. It was shown earlier that the use of phrases and term classes (thesaurus) constructed in accordance with t*he frequency requirements imposed by the discrimination value theory produces substantial improvements in retrieval effectiveness (recall and precision). In the present work, additional relationships are examined between the statisticd and the vector space models. However, instead of aotudly 'using the various term sets in a retrieval environment, an attempt is made to relate the formal frequency and vector spaee properties of the terms to the se-nantic characteristics of these terms. Specifically, consider a collection of documents in a given subject aea and an appropriate set of user queries pertaining to that area. For each user query, the set of documents can be partitioned into two subsets consisting of the Term Value Measutements 70 relevant set R and the rlonrelevant set I, respectively. Relevance is assumed to be user-specified in such a way that a relevant item is assumed to be one which ig related in some sense to the infornation need expressed by the various user queries. The linguistic, or semantic, character of a given term can now be introduced by assuming that the most valuable content-identifiers assigned to a collectio~l of texts are those which are! concentrated in the documents specified as relevant to the respective queries, as opposed to the. nonrelevant ones, contrariwise, the less valuable terw will be concentbated in the nonrelevant items. The discussion may be formalized by using the concept of term relevance TR. [7] Consider a term k contained in query Q;. the terBm releva~ke TR(k) may be defined as where r and hk are the number of documents containing term k that are k relevant and nonrelevant respect ively to query Q, and"]},{"title":"I","paragraphs":["R"]},{"title":"I and I","paragraphs":["I"]},{"title":"I","paragraphs":["ire the total number of relevant and nonrelevant documents for that query.;' When a term k occurs in more than one query, its term relevance may be taken as the average of the relevance values obtained for the various queries.

Furthermore, the terms falling into ;he former class ape likely,to be more useful for content representation than those in the latter. To verify th'e relationships between the statistical models of word importance and ths vector space model, dcsument collections are used in three different subject areas, including aerodynamics (cRAN), medicine (MED) and world affairs (TIME). The vocabularies and user populations are disjoint for these rhree areas. Results which carry through for all three cases should be extendable to other subject fields as well. The basic collectibn statistics are contained in Table 2. It may be seen from the Table that the term relevance is defined for only a relatively small number of terms for each collection, namely 458, 172 and 375 for CRAN, MED, and TIME, respectively. The reason Ls that a term relevance value is computable only for terms which occur joinaly in certain query-document pairs. Fop small experimental collections operqting with a restricted number of queries the size of the corresponding term sets is obviously limited. Consider now the comparison of the standard statistical term value measures with the term discrimination values obtained by the vector space transformations. Table 3 shows the values of the NOCC/EK and S/N measures (expressions (1) and (2)) obtained for tine 50 terms with highest discrimination values and the 50 terms with lowest discrimination values for each of the three test collections.

Thi& indicates that the high discriminators have very much higher average term relevance than the low discriminators; alternatively expressed, there is substantial agreement between the semantic term relevance concept and the automatically derived term discrimination values. The data already included in Table 3 are shown in term relevance order in Table 4. The output of Table 4 contains range and average values for NOCC/EK, S/N, and DV for the 50 terms with highest term precision and the 50 terms with lowest precision for the CRAN and TIME collections, respectively. Averages are produced for only 30 high and 30 low precision terms for the MED collection because in the medical environment the small number of available queries (24) made it possible to compute term precision values for only 172 terms in all.

It may be seen that the Term Value Mcas urements high relevance terms exhibit a much lower frequency spectrum (as e~pected for good discriminators) than the low relevance terms. Once again, it appears that the term relevance reflecting the semantic properties of the terms in their particular collection environment effects a division among the terms very si~ilar to that obtained by the discrimination value cornputat ions. In earlier work it was shown that the discrimination value theory which leads to the assignment to queries and documents of medium frequency terms cincluding also phrases constructed from high frequency terms, and term classes made up of low frequency terms-) exhibits egfective retrieval characteristics. [4,5,6] Typical average retrieval precision values for three different recall levels (recall of 0.1, 0.5, and 0.9) are shown for the three collections in Table 5. The output shows that the use of medium-frequency phrases and term classes improves performance by about 20 percent compared with the assignment of single terms alone. The comparison of Tables 3 and 4 between discpimination values on the one hand, and statistical and semantic parameters on th\"e other, indicates that the same theory which produces such effective retrieval characteristics also conforms to the known sta'tfstical and linguistic theories of term behavior.
