Natural lmguages are more general-purpose than most artificial languages, which means that you can talk about a wider subject area if you use natural ldnguages. Natural languages can be used by everyone without special trafning, so computers talking natural language can make more people able to use more different computer facilities. Finally, a rizing part of computer usage in the future will be unintelligent processing of natural language texts, and such systems can be improved if the processing is not wholly unintelligent. There are also wellknown difficulties with natural languages for computers. Natural language is closely connected to human knowledge. Therefore, natural laneage sentences can only be understood by a mm or a computer with factual howledge about the subject matter and with the ability to reason w,ith those facts.

Plural nouns Plural nouns do not simply indicate a set of singular objects, There aze also properties which belong to the composite of all the elements together. One of these is the property of be~ng~lurd, that is of having more than one element. If we say \"Two horses are running;\", then each horse is not plural, neither is each horse two, it is the composite which has these two properties. Plural nouns must theyefore often be translated into composite objects in the data base, since relations on sets in our data base alway-s refer to the lndivjdual members of the set, not to the set as a whole. An excep-[;ion from this rule is phrases in the general sense 'like \"A11 men are male humanstt. Rere the plurality is of little importance, and no composite object is created at 51-put translation. Therefore, when a plural refers to all objects with a certain property, then a variable is created, but when the plural noun phrase refers to some special collection of objects, then a composite object is created. We introduce the new relation NTlM which goes from a composite object to the numeral of it. We also introduce the relation COMPLW which goes from a composite object to a predicate which applies not necessarily to the composite, but which applies to all its elements.

However, for a phrase like ttEvery man and woman in the cityt1 we do not want to find only couples of men and women, so general sense noun phrases are not translated into my composites at all, The pmts are fitted sepazately into the sentence framework instead, If we say !?The father and the mother of Mary is comingn, then obviously it is the composite which is llcomingtt, but it is not so obvious that \"offT refers to the composite.

Deduction patterns and natural language if-clauses A natural language statement like \"If the weather is rainy and a person outdoors and the person is not wearing any raincoat, then the persoh will become wet.\" introduces deduction rules into the data base. These rules are only valid if a pattern of facts in the data base can fit into the pattern created by the deduction rule. Such deduction rule patterns are called keys in our system. After merging into the data base, the statement above may look like in figure 38.

The reason for this is that if there axe two different persons, one who is outdoors, and another who is not wearing a raincoat, then we do not want to conclude than any of them necessarily will become wet. We therefore have to single out in the data base one person and two events in which this person is the subject. One of the events should say that he is outdoors, the other that he is not wearing a raincoat. We therefore have a key of one person and two events, which have to be fitted with facts in the data base when the deduction rule is used. The quantifier HTHATvl refers from a conclusion to the deduction pattern key. It means to single out that member of the referred set to which the whole pattern has been matched, In the figure above, lithe weather is rainyf1 is not part of the pattern, But in reality, there is in *he natural lavllguage text an implicit time and place indication: \"If, at a certain place, at a certain time.. .I1 and this place and time will fit the weather into the pattern key. Our program does not yet handle such implicit time and place indications. There are two short relations for \"imply\" in our data base: COND and IFTHEN, COND refers to necessazy conditions, IFTREN to sufficient conditions. To handle cause and effect patterns, and the resulting structure of situations depending on each other, probably more such relations are necessary, but we have not introduced them yet.
