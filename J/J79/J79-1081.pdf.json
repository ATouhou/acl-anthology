Properties of Lex+cal Rezations. a, Refldvity, Symmetry, Transitivity. Certain properties of lexical-sewtic relations can be very useful in deductive inference. For instance, 15 we know that a cheetah is a ki,na or mammal anu a mamm i.s a kind of vertebrate then we can deduce that a cheetah is a kind of vertebrate. Writing T for the taxonomy relation, we can abbreviate this sentence: if cheetah T mammal and mammal T vertebrate then cheetah T vertebrate. Whenever bTc and cTd, it follcaws that bTd. This fact ran be described much more effi ciently by the stuement that the taxonomy relation is transitive. Two other commonly menttand properties of relations are refilexivity and syrmnetry. These properties may ppply to predicates formed from lexical entries as well as to lexical-semantic relations. To be precise, a relation R defined on a set S is said to be a trana~t<ve relation if whenever b and c are R-related and also c and d are I? related then b and d staAd in a relation R also, Synonyniy is a transitive relation just as transitivity is. The preposition in behaves in the same way. If Sam is in the kitchen and the kitchen is in the hotel, then we know that Sam is in the hotel. The time interrelation before behaves like this, too. If Zorro arrived before the posse did and the posse arrived before thz explosion, then we know thgt Zorro arrived before the explosion. A relation R defined on a set S is said to have the refZez<ue property if all the elements of S are R-related to thenl~elves, that is, if mRm is true for all members m of the set S, The synonymy relation has this property a word means the same thin% as itself. The antonymy relation ANTI does not have this property. It is not rrue tha&, hot ANTI be, for example. A relation R defined on a set S is said to be e~stric if whenever,b and c are R-related then so are c and b; that is, R is symme.tric if and only if bRc always implies cRb. Synonymy also has this property. If b is synonymous with c, then c is synonymous with b. So has antonfly. Given that hot ANTI sold, we immediately know that= cdd ANTI hot. Taxonomy ie not eymmetric, however. A lion is a kind of mammal, but a mammal is not a kind of lion. In question answering we may be just as Interested in drawing negative conclusions as positive-ones. Thus i~rmay be important to know tliat tf bRc is true then cRb must be falae. The term asynmrstrio is used to describe a relation R for which bRc and cRb are never both true, at $east when b and c are different elements of the stt S. Taxonomy is asymmetric and so is the thug interrelation before. If the question asks, \"Did c happen before b?\" and we know that b happened before r, we can answer with a confident no. For want of a better term we will say that the relr Sion R is mn-synonetrio if it is neither symmetric or &symmetric. In this case bRc and cRb are sometimes both true and sometfmes not. Shilarly, he term imefz.exive is used for the case in which mRm is never true, while the term nonreflexit)e is used for the case in which mRm is sometfmes true and sometimes not. In the same way intransiti~e is taken to mean that if bRc and cRd, we can conclude that b and d are not R-related, while nantrcrnsitive will mean that bRd is sometimes true if bRc and cRd, but- not always. Each lexical relation itself; has a lexical entry. The reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity properties of the relation are listed in this entry, as they are in the entries for interrelational operators and prepositions and other lexical item for which they are relevant. There are also lexical entries under the property names, refldvs, irr~~~~vr, etc. listing the appropriate axioms. The motivation behind laical entries for properties is first of all greater generality. Secondly, it makes it much easier to add lexical relations and to add other properties which turn out to be useful. At this stage of development there are several transitivity axioms: For lexical relations Rel, like taxonomy b Re1 c c Re4 d ' b Re1 d For interrelations J, like bsfbre lloZdsfI(~,~,,Z,)) A RoZda (I(J, Z2,Z3)) Holds (I(J,Z~"]},{"title":",z$) For prepositions Q like in or abave Intuitively these are all instances of the same concept, transitivity. Theze should be some single way of expressing it. It is a defect","paragraphs":["of this representation system that there is not. A relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive Ls called an equivalence relation. The synonymy relation is an equivalence relation since it has all three properties. If R is an equivalence relation, then a subset consistrlng of all the elements which are R-related to a partirtllar element x by the7equivalence relation is called an equivalence class. In an equivalence class all the elements are R-related to each other. An equi vaf ence relation partitions a set into equivalence classes ; each element of the set belongs to exactly one equivalence claas. The synonymy relation paftitions the items in the lexicon Ln just this way. There Is a class consisting of stcsp%oion and all the words synonymous with 8148phion, like mistmcet and dozibt. These synonymy classes are disjoint; each word sense in the lexicon belongs to exactly one of them (cf. Edrrmndson and Epstein 1972, Palmer 1976). With this ge a basis an equivalence relation of paxaphrasability between sentences can be established. Sentence S1 is a paraphrase of sentence S2 if one is obtained from the other 3y substituting synonyms for each other. d Mr. Kennedy viewed Lady Laura with suspicion. Mr. Kennedy regarded Lady Laura with mistrust. We might also allow substitution of conversives, nominalizations, etc. Nancy was Sally's student. Sally was ~ancy's teacher. Sally taught Nancy. The equivalence classes of this relation, each one of which is the set of all pamaphrases of a given sentence have a definite theoretical importance and some practical significance in question answering. One member of a class might well 'be part of the story; another the right answer to* a question.","- - I This representation system can be viewed as defining a relation P such that S1 P S2 if and only if S1 and S2 have the same representation. If the representation system is well defined, then P should define the same equivalence classes as the paraphrasabilitv relatior b. Xttt)srses, The inverse R of the relation R is the relation which \"goes in the opposite direction\" from R; that is, bRc if and only if cRb. Thus, bake T make and mke T bake are two ways of saying the same thing. Both pieces of information are stated in the lexicon. However, the lexical entry for Eake includes T nuke; the lexical entry for naks includes T hake. Why bother to say the same thing in different places? There are two reasons for this. First of all, the inversa relation may be a relation that is conm~nly and easily verbalized, worth naming in its own right. This is certainly true of the CHILD relation, as in pu~py CHILD 20g. Instead of asking \"What is a baby dog called?\", we could ask ''What is a grow? puppy talled?\" or \"What does a puppy grow up to be?\" The second reason is that putting this information in both entries can &e searches easier and much faster, We may only have one half of the pair and need the other. We may have dog and pppy. This is easy if we have the information CHILD pppz~ in the dog entry. Othewise we might have to search the whole lexicon, In other situations we have two words but no direct connection between them. For example, suppose the system knows"]},{"title":"twn T mama2 and maZ T vertebrate and is then asked, \"Is a","paragraphs":["lion a vertebrate?\" The connection betwen Zion and vertebrate can be found much more quickly if the search starts *om both the vertebrate end and the Zion end of the chain at the same time, but to do this there must be s pointer to m~mmaZ in the oertebrute entry.

The ECD uses t~o different names for a relation and its inverse (So and Vo ace inverses, for example). If this were dane here, two versions of the appropriate axiom schemes would be needed, one in the CHILD entry and one in the PMNT entry. Since a relation R is called symmetric if bRc alwaye implies cRb, it follows that a symmetric relation ie its own inverse. The syaonymy relation S and antonymy relation ANTI are both self-inverse in thie sense."]},{"title":"- 7","paragraphs":["For this reason we never need the spnbol ANTI, etc. ANTI is MITI The entry for hot includes ANTI cold, the entry for cold includes ANTI hot. 0. (hrique Linkage. Raphael (1968) has proposed a property which seems extremely useful. He calls it m6qus-Z$nkuge (U). Nathematicians usually.refer to such relatdons as one-to-one. A relation R has the unique-linkage property if whenever xRy then bRy is false for any bk and xRc is false for any cry, i.e. any object is R-related to at most one other. ~aphael's example of unique-linkage is the relation \"just to the right of\". The behavior ie especially characteristic of the queuing relation, e.g. with days of the week, Monday Q Tuesday, etc.Some relations may be uniquely linked on one side only, e.g. mother-child is uniquely linked on the left. We can define UL unique-linkage on the left and UR unique linkage on the fight. (A relation which is UR is a single-valued function. If R has the UL property, then its inverse is a single-valued function.) Raphael also proposed for SIR-1 (ibid, p. 101) a property which he calls ixreflexive. R is set-nunreflexive if (\\lx M)--WBcX) 6!acX) @RBI In the SIR model both the 'X is a part of Y' and the 'X is owned by Yf relations hwe this property.

The part-whole relation' has both properties in our model. In any nonempty subset in the model there is something in it that is not a proper subpart of anything else in that subset, and also something that has no proper subpart. A relation that has this property stops samewhere. It is not reflexive and not circular, A search that goes on looking for links of this kind will stop somewhere. The relation 'is an ancestor of' has this property. We will eventually run out of ancestors in one direction and descendants in the other, at least, inside a finite model.

Pmtial Ordering. Any transitive relation defines a partial ordering. Several of the lexisgl relatiohs discueeed earl,ier are transitive; many lexical items are transitive too. One important reason for.repr*senting time in terns of the transitive interrelatEton before is to allow one to make the same kinds of sdmple deductions about time that one can make about taxonomy. Some transitive relations, like taxonomy, are alsb reflexive. In this case we talk about a weak order<ng. (X s: Y for numbers is a weak ordering.) Some are not reflexive, these are called strong ordering relations. (X < Y for numbers is a strong ordering.) The time relation before 5s a strong order3ng relation. For any weak ordering there is a strong ordering and conversely, Starting with the taxonomy relation T,","1 I for example, a relation TI or proper,taxonomyl' can be defined consisting of the pairs x and y for which xTy but x and y are different. Then~Tly means that x is a kind of y but different from y. If instead one starts with strong ordering relation before, one can deane a weak relation \"beforel\" for which x beforel y means that either x before y or x cooccured with y. The queuing relation Q is nat itself a partla3 ordering but a partial ordering can 'be derived from it. Monday Q Tuesday anLTuesday Q Wednesday, but it is false that Monday Q Wednesday. Queuing is an 'immediate successor *lation like the relatxon between a natural number n and the next number n+l.
