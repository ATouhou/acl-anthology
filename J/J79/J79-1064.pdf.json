REPORT OF THE ACL 1977 ANNUAL MEETING PANEL ON 3 SPEECH UNDERSTANDING AND COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS A CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF THE ARPA PROJECT S. R. Petrick IBM T J. Watson Research Center This panel discussion was chaired by Jon Allen of MIT. The participants were Jack Mostow of Carnegie-Mell~n University (ably substituting for Raj Reddy on short notice), Don Walker of the Stanford Research Institute, and Bill woods of Bolt, Beranek and Newman The panel format featured a half hour talk by each panelist followed by a period of discussion centered around questions from the audience. Jon Allen began by reminding the audience that the ARPA five year speech understanding project had just ended last October, and that this was an appropriate time to step back and ask just what had been learned as a result of that project He then turned the podium over to the panelists to address that ~ssue. Don Walker began by supplying some general background information on all the ARPA-sponsored efforts before he tutned .to the specific accomplishments of SRI. They were all concerned with speech understanding rather than speech recognition, and they each focussed on one or more specific tasks SRI, for example, was concerned with information retrieval with respect to a navy ship data base. This concentration on specific tasks limited generality somewhat. There was also a focus on producing an operational system. This was good in some respects, but this emphasis on results did make it impossible to follow many promising research paths. Performance requirements, such as s~ze of vocabulary and processing time, were not all realistic. The approaches followed differed widely from group to group These diverse approaches were perhaps appropriate to the state of knowledge which existed, but they did limit ARPA SPEECH PANEL 4 the opportunity to share results. There were competitive aspects to the ARPA effort. In addition, the necessity to attend lots of steering committee meetings hlndered local progress. The computing power made available for the ARPA-sponsored efforts was good but still not enough It was not as much as the investigators had hoped for. Walker referred to the money which had been expended and remarked that although it was substantial, it was not enough. Not only would more computing power have been useful but more people and more time would also have contributed to improved results. Turning then to a more detailed examination of the SRI effort, Walker dlscussed four system issues which had been dealt with: (a) integration of speech, syntax, semantics, etc., 1 e., specifying contributions and Interactions of multiple knowledge sources persp~cuously and efficiently, (b) cooperation, i.e., sharing lnformation and avoiding dupl~cation of effort, (c) evaluation, l.e., rating alternatives and choosing what to do next, and (d) attention, i c., avolding dissipation of resources over competing alternatives He also dlscussed some component issues including those required for natural language specificatlon, task modelhg, and dialog interactions Typlcal sentences in the SRI Information retrieval application were cited and discussed These included WHAT IS THE LENGTH OF THE LAFAYETTE? THE GEORGE WASHINGTON? DID GENERAL DYNAMICS BUILD THE SHARK? WHO OWNS IT? WHICH FRIGATES WERE BUILT BY CAMMELL LAIRD COMPANY? The SRI system organization was discussed briefly Those portions of the system concerned with acoustics, phonetics and phonology were handled by SDC on their own computer whilehigher levels such as syntax and semantics were treated by SRI Basically, a flexible control facility provided for such alternatives as either building structure up from acoustically determined words or building it top-down in a syntax-directed fashion. In any ARPA SPEECH PANEL case, a semantic network was constructed using scores of' the degree of phonetic match involved with various alternatwes. Turning to the definition of the input language, Walker stated that it is accomplished by means of linguistically motivated (ATN) rules that are general and extensible over a variety of domains. These provide a means for adjusting ('tuning') the language definition to particular domains without loss of generality. Syntactic, semantic, and discourse information is combined within the rules that define words and phrases. The SRI semantic component makes use of partitional semantic networks. It handles higher-order logical predicates, especially quantifiers It provides deduction routines for retrieval and inference that can access a supplementary relational data base in responding to a user's query It also provides a network substructive that is converted to an English sentehce or phrase to answer a user's question. SRI discourse modeling is based on in-depth studies of domaln-oriented dialogs A model of dialog context is encoded through the use of semantic partitions. Dialog context (through semantic closeness and syntactic considerations) is also used to find the meanings of elliptical expressions and the referents of definite noun phrases System integration was briefly discussed. In the SRI system this provides for interaction of information from various sources of knowltdge"]},{"title":"--","paragraphs":["syntax, semantics, and discourse -- as part of the language definition itself The SRI effort avoided commitment to a particular system control strategy, allowing instead for flexible use of various strategies for putting together words and phrases out of incomplete and uncertain fragments. The SRI system control facility was the last topic discussed by Walker. The points made about it included the following: Ratings are assigned to incomplete sentence structures reflecting the highest possible continuation of each such structure. The priorities of available alternative continuations are assigned as a result of those ratings. Data structures are organized for testing hypotheses about utterances in a manner that avoids duplication of effort. Combinations of top-down, bottom-up, and bidirectional strategies are alfowed. The flex~bilit~ A R PA SPEECH PANEL provided by the SRI system control made possible extensive e~perimental studies to evaluate design alternatives. Control strategies which were evaluated included the fbllowing four paired alternatives: 1) Island driving versus left to right processing of utterances 2) Testing for all words versus resting for just good matches 3) Using sentential context versus ignorlng it 4) Focussin& on selected alternatives versus continuing on a single successful path until it succeeds or fails. Experimental findings from these studies of alternatives included a) Context checking is important; it helps priority setting bJ Testing for all words improves performance but it is costly. A more efficient mapper is needed. c) Island driving produced wild exponential branching on long sentences. d) Focussing on selected alternatives is less effective than best first following of a single path. Nevertheless, simple b'est-path-first parse algorithms are not good enough e) There is a strong need for a phrase mapper for word coarticulation f) A high false alarm rate was reported. Hit scores were better than false alarm scores Bill Woods, the next speaker, began with a discusSion of a speech spectrogram He described early experiments in which two investigators, Ken Stevens and Dennis Klatt, attempted to \"read\" spectrograms either on a segment by segment basis or making additional use of their knowledge of English phonology and syntax. They correctly transcribed between 70 per cent and 75 per cent of the individual segments considered in Isolation (some segments were only partially identified, r.e., certain of their distinctive features were correctly identified), but attained 96 per* cent word accuracy in an experiment which used a computer program as an aid to human classification together with the human skills and knowledge of linguistic constraints they commanded. A number of observations were made. They included the following: ARPX SPEECH PANEL ( 1 ) Small function words are hlghly unreliable anchors. (2) Acoustically based matchlng alone is insufficient; accidental word matches outnumber correct ones. (3) Speech understand~ng is essentially a nondeterministic process. (4) Sequential left-to-nght scanning presents problems; the first and last words are often not pronounced carefully; the first stressed word is a more reliable anchor There is a need to recqver from any garbled word, especially the first one (5) The space of alternatives must be open-ended You might have to go way down the list of likely alternatives to find the right one (6) There is a strong need for merged representations. Many similar hypotneses share common parts. A discussion of the sources of knowledge In the BBN System followed.Acoustic-phonetic, phonological, lexical, syntactic, semantic, discourse, and factual sources of knowledge were considered. A program to assign scores 'to each of a number of overlapping segments for each possible candidate phoneme was described. Results of an experiment were described in whlch the correct phoneme was identified 53 per cent of the time and the flrst or second choice was correct 70 per cent of the Zrme. Per cent of phonemes correct within the first N choices for various values of N was reported as follows N 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 % correct 53 70 75 79 83 84 86 The BBN verification component was next d~iscussed It takes an analysis-by-synthes~s approach to word matching. A synthesis-by-rule procedure is used to generate word ternplates, and these templates are compared with a parametric verslon 'of the signal to determine the closeness of match. The pragmatic ATN-based grammar which served as the .syntactic component was identified as that described by G. Brown in a paper presented earlier that day. ARPA SPEECH PANEL 8 A diagram of the BBN HWIM System or~aniiation was discussed briefly. The basic operation of the system was described as follows: (1) create initial theories (2) rank them, (3) give them to the parser, (4) have the parser suggest the n best words (5) verify best matches, (6) add results on to islands previously identified to form larger islands, and (7) let these nekw events trigger new theories and continue this cycle. Woods then presented transparencies citing in parallel columns the ARPG-imposed 197 1 goals and the degrcee of success attained by the BBN HWIM System in meeting those. goals. I include reproductions of those transparencies.

In discussing this summary Woods stressed that the difficulty sf recognition is very much affected by the branching factor associated with the syntactic component in question and with the distinctiveness of the paths allowed.

They included the following: (1) Coping with ambiguity (BBN did not eliminate this by fiat) (2) Error recovery (island driving is good in this respect) (3) Parsing algorithms (4) Interaction of syntax, semantics, and pragma.tics (5) Degrees of \"grammaticality\" (BBN was just getting into this.

The final talk of the afternoon was given by Tom Moslow of Carnegie-Mellon University. The CMU project featured a task domain concerned with information retrieval for a set of A1 abstracts. Vocabulary size was 101 1 words and a branching factor of 9.53 was cited, indicatxng a considerably more restricted syntax than that of the other efforts. Two distinct systems, HARPY and HEARSAY-I1 were implemented, and the results cited for each were: HARPY 97 % word accuracy 9 1 5% sentence accurac 95 % semantic accuracy 27.9 Mips (about 30 times real speech rate) HEARSAY-I1 86% word accuracy 73 % sentence accuracy 9 1 % semantic accuracy 85.0 Mips (85 times real speech rate) After a discussion of how signal variability and imperfect knowledge lead to a combinatorial explosion of alternative transcriptions, making speech understanding very difficult, Mostow gave more detailed descriptions of both HEARSAY-I1 and HARPY. HEARSAY-I1 is an asynchronous, data-directed, hypothesize and test model in which cooperating, independent knowledge sources communicate by means of a \"blackboard\". In this model it is easy to deactivate a particular knowlgdge source, and this made it relatively ARPA SPEECH PANEL easy to evaluate the worth .of each such source. Focus of attention mechanisms were studied. The system is island-driven and makes use of a task-specific pattern matching grammar HARPY is quits different. It integrates knowledge sources into a uniform state-space netwbrk at the phoneme level. All knowledge sources, high and low, must be integrated into such a network. It was claimed to be very efficient for sufficiently restricted languages with a sentence accuracy over 90 per cent on a 1 MIP PDP/ 10 in 10 to 30 times real time Proceed-ing to a new task requires that a similar but new grammar be produced, which Mostow claimed was not a major unoertaking. A general observation was made and illustrated by specific experience accrued at CMU. This was that different uses of the same linguistic knowledge regulre different knowledge representations. Precompiling knowledge into an appropriate data structure for a given use is more efficient than interpreting a single global knowledge structure. The philosophy of language design adopted by CMU was, given a set of typical sentences, to construct a sequence of increasingly larger languages each of which properly contains its successor. The last member of this sequence must account for the given corpus. In other words it was proposed that full linguistic constraints be relaxed at first to produce a simpler model with a co~respondingly more efficient recognition procedure; it was argued that this provides a cheap filter on data, and the output of such a model can, in turn, be constrained by a more elaborate model. In illustration 'of this approach with respect to HARPY, it was suggested that a finite state net could serve as the simpler model and an ATN grammar as the more elaborate model. A HEARSAY-I1 example was also discussed in which a Markov model serves as the simpler model and a pragmatic template grammar as its more elaborate extension. The problem- of understanding ungrammatical speech was touched on briefly. The approach suggested was to use a template-based gramntar but to accept approximate template realizatiops. If the normal grammar fails, find grammatical fragments and coneatenate them if permitted by general rules. ARPA SPEECH PANEL 13 Search techniques for both HEARSAY-I1 and HARPY were discussed. The locus search method of HARPY was cited as one of the main contributions of CMU research along with the HEARSAY-11 blackboard model and the results obtained on the interpretation of ungrammatical utterances. Future directions included r@dhsion of the system(s) to provide for more general (larger and more flexible] input lang-w and extension af the methods developed to such other AI tasks as the development of vision systems. Following the prepared panel talks questions were directed to the panel members from the floor. I cannot ide'ntify all the questioners so I will not attetnpt to supply names. I have paraphrased questions and answers in most cases. Q: What linguistic constraints were imposed other than a 1000 word vocabulary? A: Formal grammars of one type or another were used (for example, an ATN grammar for the BBN effort). Sentences which were grammatical with respect to these formal grammars were read by subjects. Q: Was any use made of intonation? A: (Woods) Some use of intonation constraints was implemented into the HWIM System rather late in the program but was never tested in the final crunch. Q: What results from speech work should help in text processing? A: (Woods) The development of a model for completing unfinished sentences. This has certain psycholinguistic implications. A: (Walker) Language definition involving general categories and pragmatic grammars for one thing. The integration of all knowledge sources at the phrase level is also a significant contribution. A: (Mostow) The determination of how much milage can be squeezed out of cheap methods. We expect to continue this type oE speech research but not to do much more on high level constraints. Q: Why did%CMU do so much better than the others? ARPA SPEECH PANEL A: (Combined responses of all three panelists) CMU picked a simpler dotnain perhaps and definitely used a much cruder (morc restrictive) grammar. The BBN LISP Sysfcm and operating system wcrc less cfficicnt than CvMII'\\ lower level programming. BBN aimed for a tougher target (as evidenced by their more realistic granlnlnr and correspondingly higher branching factor) and didn't make tt in ~p~tc of a ten \",I pcr month improvement ovef the last few months. The BIjN results were intermediate bench marks along thc way toward a targct which was never reached because of a lack of time whereas CMU was more realist~c i,n budgeting its time. CMU had no real theory. It just threw in a new dictionary entry whenevcr necessary. CMU emphasis was placed on general A1 techniques. not linguist~c principle3 BBN could only process 10 utterances per night whereas CMU could prows\\ 10 utterances per hour. Hence, CMU could consider more data SRI d~d not have a tcltal system avialable to them, being dependent on SDC for their front end. so thcy yere at a disadvantage in this respect. All speakers agreed that once real time speeds are achic~ed, the user interaction possibilities will be attractive. SRI not only had no opportunities for fine tuning, but the~r approach was claimed to be even more linguistically motivated than BBN's. It was similar to BBN's before the latter's switch to a pragmatic grammar. SRI reported a 40/1 false alarm-to-hit ratio on the part of the acoustic component supplied by SDC but still achieved close to 90% semantic success Its system was estimated t~ run in 200-300 times real time on a vocabulary of 320 words and a grammar with a static branching factor of 110. AR PA SPEECH PANXL 15 Precomputation gives HARPY its efficiency br iaikorporatioa 6f new knowledge into HARPY makes new precomputatidn necessary and it is expensive, Does anyone currently have a government contract to pursue speech recognition? Not to anyone's knowledge, but mofe general contracts may include some speech work. Speech understanding is not dead but is currently in abeyance. Is the rumor true that NSF may pick up some speech work and therefore some projects that would otherwhe be funded will suffer? It is true in the sense that people previously supported by ARPA funds are entering the competitive pool for a static amount of research funds There IS a \"new player\" however in the form of the Sloan Foundation, wHich is supporting less capital intensive research, is bss systems-oriented, and is seeking to encourage cooperation between different groups. What would you do different if you were starting over? (Woods) I would do some things different but probably that would be wrong. I would give more reassurance to new people starting work on the project that they were on the right track. ARPA managers need such reassurance too. More intermediate results might have kept up the interest of the sponsors. Too many decisions had to be made on the basis of inadequate experimentaion. (walker) Groups were brought together and educated and them disbanded. I can hear the difference between /s/ and /z/, etc. Why don't you do some better acoustic work so as to be able to make such discriminations reliably? You \"hear\" the difference in large pirt by me- of higher constraints such as syntax, semantics, and even pragmatics. It is wd documentd that the information for identification just isn't in the segment to be recognized in many cases. Are there any companies now working on sgpech recognition? Yes. IBM is, and other companies such as Threshold Technology are working on word template matching."]},{"title":"American Journal of Cornput at ionai Linguistics","paragraphs":["Microfiche 64 : .16"]},{"title":"ESSAYS OM LEXICAL SEMANTICS>","paragraphs":["VOLUME"]},{"title":"I1","paragraphs":["SPRAKFORLAGET SKPIPTOR Box S"]},{"title":"104 65 Seockholm","paragraphs":["282 pages"]},{"title":"SKr","paragraphs":["60 ISBN 91-7282-065-9","Department of Psychology University"]},{"title":"of","paragraphs":["Georgig &,hens 30602 Since the editor did not provide an introduction to this second vblume, the only information we get about the authors of the 9 papers it contains is in a short blurb on the back cover of the book.","The young linguists who gathered fifteen years around the Laboratory of Machine Translation [in Moscow] were attracted by the prospects of creative endeavor which the problem of automatic t~ansaltion offered: the problem itself and the search fdr a way to solve it did not ~ehit any dogma to dominate.."]},{"title":".","paragraphs":["They wanted.. .to understand ah3 clearly formulate how a person under-stands the meaning of an utterance in'the given languaqe and then constructs a message in another language that preserves the original meaning.

Soqe intricacies of semantic analysis are difficult to follow no matter how lucidly they are presented.

The essays are revisions, sometimes minor and sometimes major, of prevkausly-published studies. They are, Hill tells us, wconcerned w$th poems as designs, and all fit into a thbught-out scheme of the relations of literature and language.\" The view of language he brings to this collection is admittedly Bloomfieldian, and it might be argued that no Pattern in Poetry 35 amount of revision could bring his structural linguistics-based observations up to date. Yet his particular brand of' linguistics is not a point of contention here; indeed, the book's strengths and weaknesses stem from oBher considerat ions. The strength of the dozen essays making up the book is that an intelligent, sensitive reader of poetry is sharing insights with us. His sole dogma, it appears, is the invocation of the Joos Law, \"to choose the least meaning for any unknown item and the maximal meaning for its context.\" The way this law is used reminds me very much of the basic principle of New Criticism, as well as uhat seems to me to be a basic tenet of scientific inquiry: that is, to make minimum assumptions about the data that yield maximal insights or organiwtion. Usually the Joos law of semantics is applied with good sense and profit to us all. A second principle guiding Hill's reading of poetry is one I would like to see writ large over each departmental office and lounge in every university: In B work we admlre we do not have to justify every line to yet think it excellent.

Thus, syntax, semantics and pragmatics become essential components of a total speech understand~ng system. The control problem in such a system involves integrating the knowledge available from these components with the possible interpretations of an utterance syggested by its acoustics.

Schwartz Bolt Beramk and Newman, Inc., Cambridge, Massslchusetts 02138, While gathering acoustic data for the acoustic-phonetic analysis of speech, it is nmessary to consider many different sounds in varying phonetic environments to assure that the results are statistically significant. In order to reduce the amount of time required to test hypotheses, a facility has been developed which provides an interactive environment for performing a wide variety of acoustic-phonetic experiments on a large data base of continuous speech. Using this facilrty, one can formulate an experiment, run it on selected portions (or all) of the data base, and d~splay or tabulate the results in a meaningful way. Another experiment may then be run based on the results.

A bypassable causal selection network is a tree where each node has a test and a set of one or more alternative branches associated with it. One such network exists for each state or statechange concept. The terminal nodes of these networks contain approaches, CARs which map out plans for solving problems. All networks tests are to be shared; there is a central copy of the test and references to it from each point in the net where the test is to be applied. By making appropriate use of this feature it is possible to insert conditional bypasses into the network such that, as mare and more of the environment becomes known the solutions to problems tend to grow increasingly stereotyped. Thus bypassable networks can adapt to context. The bypass arrangement is frame-like, but the frames are distributed bundles of bypasses which can blend in essentially infinite variety.

A method of precision weighting has been developed which partially meets these objections. A precision weight is attached to each query term according to whether the term occurs primarily in documents ident~fied as relevant to a given user query or whether it occurs in the nonrelevaat documents. Given such a precision weight~ng system and an assumption concerning the distribution of the vocabulary accross the documents of a collection, formal proofs estab'lisfi that at every level of recalf the' precision weighting system may be expected to be superior to a system in which terms in the query and document vectors are unweighted.

Hanika, eds., Progress in Cybernelics and Sysierns Research Vol. If, Halsfed Press, 1975 ISBN 0-470-88476-2 In order to understand language and how it is used it is necessary to discover how it is learned. A new-born child (it is assumed) does not have at his diaposal a built-in syntax, but he does have mechanisms for collecting and assimilaling information. The first stage of learning is assumed to be the building of a set of associations between physical entities and their linguistic representations. in chi tdren, there are additional problems regarding the learning of the various physical manipulations necessary to actually pronounce the appropriate word(s); th~s point is not pursped here. Learning of associations appears to involve two main precepts: perception of a physical entrty, and ider~tfficativn of the context in which the entity appears. Prom these, the learning to be achieved involves the formation of concepts about the entities perceived. ~hksse concepts include descriptions of classes of entities and associations with contexts and linguistic represerrtations. 84 HUMANITIES The,"]},{"title":"London Stage 1800-1900: A Data Base for a Calendar of Performances on the Nineteenth-Century London Stage Joseph Donohue Department of English, University of Massnchuserts, Amhersr Computers and rhe Humanities 9: 19- 186, July 1975 A","paragraphs":["data bank containing information about daily performances on the London Stage in the 19th Century may well be as many as a billion characters representing as many as a million performances.

As presently envisioned the system will1 include a simulated world (a Martian landscape). a Sensori-Motor System, a Cognitive System, and a Human Monitor and Control System. The robot includes a motion system, a tactile sensor. and a highly-developed vision system. The simulation provides a complex animal-like organism to be used in developng the cognrtive system. Detailed descriptions are given outlining the algorithms used to calculate the visual occlusion of one object by mother and the obstruction of the robot's path. The completed portions of the Human Monitor and Control Systein are described, and a description is included of the expected nmt steps in the research.

A definition program is created from a series of PATCOSY Definition Language (PDL) commands. The output from the program is a sequence of data maps, one for each ~ecord type in the database. Tbe data maps are accessed by the PATCOSY Manipulation Language (PML) commands so that particular record occurences can be made availabte to the applications program which originated the command. Hence PML is a host language access mechanism. PATCOSY has been designed specifically for the National Health Service (GB) and therefore reflects the structure and inter-relationships which exist between the information created by the differerit parts of the health services when a tola1 medical information system is considered. PATCOSY is described in relationship to the CODASYL recommendations,"]}]}
