A significant percentage of the contract services are in the form of Research and ~evelopment (R & D) or programmatic work which colleges and universities are particularly wcll-suited to perform. The government commits these funds in eithet of two WAYS: grants or contracts.","University researchers are generally more familiar with the grant procedure than with the contract procedure. Under a grant program, a given federal agency is authorized to grant funds to non-profit institutions, frequently educational institutions, for the purpose of supporting research or a in a given general area. A body of general conditions are established by the Congress and refined by the applicable agency to set parameters for the pro$am as a whole. A specific grant for a program can be made so long as it fits within the gevral stpndards (the Guidelines) of the program and meets whatever qualitative standards for review that have been established.","Since grant funds, particularly in research areas, have been inc~asingly competitive in recent years, the university community ' is turning its attention to potential support through the contract mechanismi. A contract, unlike a grant, is generally awarded for the purpose of meeting a specific reqwrement that a federal agency has determined to be important to the achievement of .the agency:s responsibilities. The contract will tend, therefore, to be specific in terms of the agency's needs, and in the case of research, wdl usually be for the purpose of \"applied\" rather than \"basic\" research. The contract, also unlike the grant, can be negotiated with any organization that is legally constituted to do business w~th the government, whether non-profit or profit-making.","Government procurement m its present massive scope is a relatively new phenomenon, having emerged fin as prpscnt form in the past quarter of a century.

A speclal government task force has recommended legislation -which would bring uniformity in procurement policy. Congress is considering such legislation, which will be discussed later. Basic contractual agreements with the federal government are developed in one of four ways:","A. Sole Sotrrce I'roclrrement.
