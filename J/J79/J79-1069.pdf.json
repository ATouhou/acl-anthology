The delay in completion ~f the 1977 run of this Journal is due to the Editor's desire to include a substantial number of technical contributions. A decrease in the rate of arrival of manuscripts for consideration, together with a continuing high rate of rejection by the Editorial Board, resulted late in 1977 in an absolute lack of technicalmanuscripts ready for publication. Young's contribution was accepted in October 1977","paragraphs":[";"]},{"title":"the prescnt issue went to press immediately upon receipt of Sondheimerls finished article. The alternatives open to the Association are a smaller Journal, publication of contributions presently considered to require revision, or a vigorous campaign to stimulate more submissions. The present Editor, whose term expires when the 1978 run is complete, is conducting a small-scale campaign. Beyond that, decisions and action lie with the officers and members of the Association.

Only those who shared in the blrakthroaghs of the 50 s LaKtl them seriously--the activity has now shilted to the computer rdom. It is therefore timely and fitting that a comprehensive bibliography, such as this one Speech synthesis 59 with an analysis of the atudies that proved to be milestones of that period, should appear at this point in time. This excellent work, bv a member of the Phonetics Institute of the University of Provence at Aix-en-Provence, contains Rome 2000 titles and detailed summaries of work carried an over a period of 25 years (1949-1974) in four areas: apparatus for synthesizing speech, the synthesis of phonemes, the synthesis 6f proclodic features and epeech perception. Chafcouloff uses several earlier bibliographies as his point of departure, such as those of Simmons qnd KGs~er, plus the bibliographicai indications gben in Lhe works of Fant, Flonagan and others. The vastness of the project of course pre-cluded a commentated bibliography, but the discussions at the beainning of each section are, in our opinion, not only intere~ting reading but hi~hly informative as well. Tlre bibliography is intended as a cool for researchers but makes no pretense of being exhaustive. In fact, a number of items were purposely omitted, particularly those where it was not clear whether the techniques in questlon involved synthetic inyut. A11 this is explained in a brfef Introduction. The first section, entitled \"~ynth2se giiniirale et apporeils de synt%ese, I I"]},{"title":"-","paragraphs":["begins with a brief history of speech synthesis, both bona fide and fraudulent, and includes such figures as Kratzenstcln (1782) ,* Vbn Kernpelen (1791), Faber (1835), Koenig (1882), Helmholtz (1885), Stumpf (1926), Paget i1930) and Fletcher (1944). The remainder of the discussion preceding the bibliography is divided into live secrions, the flrst Pour dealing with dif fkrent types of synthesizers, the last with the high points of research accomplished with them. The following general types are described and discussed with respect to how they can be used in phonetic research: the Vocoder and its vriations, formant Speech synthesis 60 syntl~esizers, vocal analogs and spectrbgraphs (P1s)rback-type synthesitcre). Over 1400 items follow. The second section, \"~ynthBse et sons du lengagh ,I1 deals principally - with the research accomplished at three laboratorfes (Haskins, the Speech Co~unications Department at M.I.T. and R.I.T., ~tockholm), but the work of lesser know1 centers, such as those at Edinburgh, in Japan and the Bell Telephone Laboratories, are also i~lcluded. The bibliography that follows contains nearly 600 items, The third section, \"Synth6se et 6tudes p~osodiques\" takes as its point uf departure blettbs' meticulously documented review of techniques for studying intonation (Les -- - tedniques de La phon6tique instrumentale et L'intonatton, P.U.B., 1971). Attent-on is Locused on three areas, namely stress, tones and intonation models. With respect to the latter chere is understandably a particularly good coverage of the fine work done by ~hafcouloff's coll~gues at Aix-en-Provence. Since thls area has been the least studied, it is not surprising that the bibliography that follows shmld contain less than 150 works. The fourth section, \"~ynthese et perception,\" is one of the most interesting from this reviewer's point of view because ~t deals with a number of fundamental aspects of perception. The three areas vtlined by Chafcouloff are 1) the study of modes of speech perception, 2) abnormalities in speech perception, and 3) studies on the intelligibility of synthetic speech. This section thus belongs more in the realm of psychology than it does to traditional phonetics, Such. questions as categorical/non-cate,gorIcal perceptian nf phonemes and the conceptual/perceptual differences between vowels and consonants are discussede Over three hundred bibliographical i terns follow.

Unlike the Privacy Protection Study Commission which (through its Final Report) precipitatgd the introduction of the Omnibus P~ivacy Act (see Washingfan Report, 1/78, p. 4), the NCEFT had no Congressional participation. In addition, the banking sources conclude, the strong views of different lobbying gqoups in the EFT area will have a mitigating effect on any omniBus legislation. (For example, the American Bankers Association and the Independent Bankers Association of America disagree on whether automated teller machines should be considered \"brick and mortart1 banks.) These same sources note that EFT does not yet involve a substantial political constituency, and (as such) wlll not command much attention from legislators. Finally, th& suggested that, with the lack of comprehensive EFT legislation, Federal and state regulatory bod1 es nay provide regulation.

Several speakers noted the vulnerability of RGD to the budget-cutting process. One said RED is eliminated from the Federal budget because it represents at least a portion of the 30 per cent of the budget that can-be changed. Perhaps 70 per cent of the Federal budget was estimated to be fixed, z.e., representing unchangeable expenditures authorized by Congress on a continuing basis (such as Social Securlty payments). In addition, it was noted that R4D is especially vulnerable to budget-cutting because its benefits are not always immediately recognizable or even tangible. According to Mr. W. Bowman Cutter, Executive Associate Director for the Budget. Office of Management and Budget, President Carter views all request for R&D \"equally1' in the sense that (taken all together] they axe more than the nation can afford. (Thus, the President's use of zero-base budgeting is a review of all proposed expenditares for a particular area in contrast to a"]},{"title":"- review","paragraphs":["of incremental changes in expenditures form year to year.) However, Cutter also noted the salutary effect of RID on sustaining economic growth. Mr. William D. Nordhaus, member.

Stevenson D-111) attributed the downtrend in RED funding to the llovhrsellingll of science and technology in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Sen. Stevenson added that if the Office of Science and Technology Policy (which he called the \"focal pointu for Fede.ra1 R4D) is combined with a new Office of Planning and Analysis (as presently discussed), it would represent an additional \"setback\" for RED.
