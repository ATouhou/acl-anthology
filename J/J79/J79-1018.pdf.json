LOGO offers many additional features as a language for teaching programming skills to non-mathematically oriented users and one of the most important of these may be as a parenthesisfree form of LISP. In our use of LOGO graphics, we-consider that a picture has a name, a program to praw it, a cursot startpoint~value, a head'ing, a size, a frame of minimum arid maximum X and Y coordinates, a center of gravity and coordinates associated with any points on it that we need to refer to, such as feet, hands, head, top, bottom, etc. CLOWN EQR (LAMBDA.()"]},{"title":"...I SIZE 1 STARTPT (XY) HEADING NBR","paragraphs":["PFRAME (MIN X, MAX X, MIN Y, MAX Y) FEET (Xi) a a BOTTOM (=> All of the XY coordinates designated in a picture structure are relative to the startpoint, heading and size.

We must use trigonometrikc functions to compute a heaaing value and a location of the startpoint that will achieve this result.

Siinilar- adjustments are made to the PFRAME values to translate and rotate the imaginary picture frame defined by the XY extremals. To assemble a set of pictpres into la scene, the bottom pieture is assigned an XY s~tartpoint and heading. Each picture it supports is translated and rotated to result in adjustments to startpoint, heading and pframe values. Each picture beside it is s~ilarly adjusked until a scene is cgmpleted by accounting for all its pictures'. At tQis point, the scene is scaled to the size of the display screen, and the picture drawing programs are,executed. The PFRAME concept developed by Gordon Novak and Mike Smith is very helpful as a computafional abbreviation Eor.fhe program that draws the picture. The PFRAME attribute has a minimum x, maximum x, minimum y, maximum y as four points that define a rectangle that surrounds the extreme points of the pictime, When the picture is programmed these are assigned by hand with reference to whatever startpoflt and heading were used. The picture as defined is taken as size 1. Whenever the picture is translated or rotated the values of PFEUME, STARTPT apd HEA~ING are adjusted accordingly. As each pair of piccures are combined into a scene, a FFW is computed for the scene. The final PFRAME for the entire scene is adjdsted to the size of the screen with appropriate scalidg of the size values of its component pic turas. 39 A f'requent use of PFRAMES is to find default values for TOP, BOTTOM, LEFTS~DE and RIGHTSIDE as contact points between pairs of pictures"]},{"title":".","paragraphs":["Dep'ailed descriptions of these processes are-not particularly relevant to this paper's goal of presentipg an easily computable syntactic-semantic scheme for subsets of English but will be presented"]},{"title":"in forthcoming papers by Bennett-Novak and by Michael Smith.
