It is instructive to contrast the above Junction Grammar treatment of relative clauses with its treatment of noun complements. It would seem that there are serious theoretical problems associated with the phrase structure rules *NP?rNP S and NP-N S of Transformation Grammar [6]"]},{"title":".

These rules propose to account for restrictive relative clauses and noun complements, respectively, both embedding an entire sentence to a nominal antecedent, encompassing both constituents with brackets labelled NP. It seems clear that the two structures in question are in fact related, i.e. in some sense similar, but not in the way suggested by the P-rules proposed to generate them. Specifically, in each case there seems to be an overlapping of constituents in the main clause with those in the subordinate clause: In the relative clause, an NP of the main clause coincides referentially with an NP of the dependent clause ; in the complement, a noun, or potentially, a noun phrase, of the main clause is equated referentially with the entire dependent clause. Thus sentence (2) is ambiguous over the relative clause and the complement readings. (Notice that one can replace that with which for the relative clause reading but not for the complement reading.] There is nothing in the P-rule formulation to make this overlapping of constituents explicit, however. Hence, a mechanism for checking the coreference of NP1s is required so that the relative clause transformation could apply to sentences embedded by NP-NP S and produce the appropriate relative pronoun. It is not clear, however, whether this mechanism is supposed to establish a coreference relation between the head N and the complement S in NP"]},{"title":"-+N","paragraphs":["S, since no T-rule seems to depend upon such a check. Moreover, there is no clear justification for using"]},{"title":"N","paragraphs":["rather than NP to the right of tlie arrow in the complement rule, since the head of a complement can have articles and modifiers too. Still more serious is what appears to be implied by the relative clause rule. Namely, the entire clause is bracketed with a nominal category (NP), suggesting that it, like the complement, is functioning in its entirety as a nominal constituent. The structural symmetry of these two rules results in a false general-ization (the illusion that both clauses were nominalized) while failing to make explicit the generality which actually exists and is semantically crucial (the referential overlap between constituents in the main and dependent clauses). What is needed are structural representations which reflect the overlapping of constituents without violating what seem to be the correct categorizations."]},{"title":"The","paragraphs":["Junction Grammar solution is as follows: N"]},{"title":"sv An N * N N A *","paragraphs":["SV (that) fact which fact Relative Clause Noun Complement In the case of the relative clause, the intersection occurred on categorially homogeneous nodes (on Nls)"]},{"title":",","paragraphs":["whereas in the complement structure the intersection occurred on heterogeneous nodes (N /S) so that the entire subordinate clause intersected with an NP of the main clause.

Returning now to the discussion of relative modifiers, we continue our description of interjunction, which, as the reader will recall, entails intersecting trees corresponding to the following schema : Basic relative modifiers are defined to be relative clauses of which the modifying node is of noun category, the relative marker for such clauses being in some cases null (e.g. the boy I saw was crying), or such words as which, who -9 and that.

Notice that one might search available data a long time before finding an instance of some of the types exemplified, as each would require a special context.

Sample Transfer Language Statements. SAMPLE TRANSFERS Having discussed the major statement types in TL, let us consider a few specific transfers. This will be but an indication of what is done in transfer, but later reports are expected to present substantial transfer grammars between language pairs. Languages frequently differ in their preferred wnceptualiza-tion of a given action. For example, English prefers eat supper to sup, while French prefers souper to prendre le souper. Similarly, to watch television has become the single sememe fernsehen in Ger-man. Alternatively, a verb and non-verbal participle [9] may correspond to a single verb (e.g. make happy goes to alegrarse in Spanish). Several examples of such patterns are listed in Figure All these correspondences are handled in TL by writing one simple transfer for each general pattern and then loading the appropriate keys. For example, the first case (V + N+V + E) could be treated by keying on the verb in each case and loading as parameters with the key the crucial object or objects. This will cause collapse and the composite sememe to be formed. In order to make this and the subsequent examples easier to follow we will use the English words themselves instead of their semantic indices. Thus, we might load the following keys:","FRN EAT 12 PI. = LUNCH, JOIN DEJEUNER =11 P2 = SUPPER, JOIN SOUPER =12 SPN GIVE 12 P1 = THANKS, JOIN AGRRDECER =I1","GER TAKE 12 P1 = WALK, JOIN SPAZIERGEHEN =11 P2 = BATH, JOIN BADEN =12 GER WRITE 12 P1 = POEM, JOIN DICHTEN =I1 to eat lunch ---r dejeuner (FRN) to eat supper"]},{"title":"*","paragraphs":["souper [FRN) to eat breakfast desagunar (SPN) to give thanks"]},{"title":"-","paragraphs":["agradecer (SPN) 50 take a walk- spaziergehen (GER) to take a bath baden (GER) to have an accident 4 verunglticken (GER) to write a poem- dichten (GER) to point rnontrer du doigt (FRN) to clap- battre des mains (FRN) V$ (A* (A+E) +E) +E--+V+E to make sad"]},{"title":"* attrister","paragraphs":["(FRN) to make angry -+ encolorizarse (SPN) to stare at Xj regarder X fixQment (FRN) to turn the pages of a book"]},{"title":"+ fculletcr","paragraphs":["un liver (FRN) Figure 4.
