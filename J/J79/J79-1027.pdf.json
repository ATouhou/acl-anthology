The semantic analysis proceeds from the preliminary semantic representation (PSR) via the intermediate SR (ISR) to the final SR (FSR), making crucial use OX an encyclopedia which codes semantic knowledge. The three stages of the semantic analysis are discussed. Concatenation Rules establish the PSR, Meaning Rules and Encyclopedic Rules the ISR, and Semantic Linking Strategies the FSR. At every stage, the semantic representations are in terms of a modified predicate ca~culus notation. Syntax-free as well as syntax-sensitive Linking Strategies are presented for clause-internal linking. Finally, syntax-free linking of constituent clauses of complex sentences is described.
