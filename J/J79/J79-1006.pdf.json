I I It is difficult to imagine the source of such misinformation because nothing has been published or publicly revealed.about the system's linguistic approach since the Company's infancy in early 1970, before the development of three generations of Logos machine systems, at an expenditure of two and a half million dollars. For the record, the Logos System does not predicate its success on the processing of constrained English. Even in its earliest days the system handled standard linguistic operations as active-passive and verb-process noun transformations and limited pronomial antecedence recognition. As early as mid 1971, when the Logos I1 English-Vietnamese system was still in mid-development, no less a critic of MT than Wallace Sinaiko acknowledged in an Institute for Defense Analysis study (Paper P-761, August 1971) that (pa 33) \"translation by computer, or machine translation (MT) is surprisingly good from a research and development point of view. It is encouraging, we believe, that the present state of 'technology permits fairly sophisticated technical English to be processed by YT; resulting translations into Vietnamese can be read and understood by native readers of that language. \" Or again, speaking of tests showing the relative merit of human translation, post-edited MT, and unedited MT by.the Logos System, (p. 22) mPerformance under all language conditions was surprisingly similar and not significantly different for the tests on Chapters 1 and 3. This suggests that some material might be left unedited, particularly if it is not too technical, I I Mr. Sinaiko's views were based on the Logos System's performance in translating the Air Force's ~nstrument ~l~in~ ~anual, which was hardLy written in constrained English. The English-Russian System, reported on in the March-April TFS (Vol. 10, Nos. 3-4) translated 7 texts (to the satisfaction of Sovlet officials) that were taken from foundry specifications destined for the Soviet Union's Kama River Project. The Logos I11 English-F.rench System has been under contract to translate IBM computer manuals experimentally, with success. On the strength of its performance, Logos subsequently received a contract from the UN to install its English-French System for pilot translation experimentation. The system is now about to undergo optimization for use in bi-lingual Canada. If Dr. Wilks feels MT systems should address language other than as it is encountered in the real world of Kama engineering specs, UN treatises, and AF training manuals, then, of course, there can be no argument with his views. Concerning linguistics and the Logos System, the Company attributes the strength of its technology to the system's grammar and ulti- - mately to-the linguistic principles on which it is based. This grammar has been developed inductively through the processing of 5 million words (and over 100 concordances) of scientific, engineering, legal and eco~omic/political texts, and through contrastive studies of English with Vietnamese, Chinese, Russian, French, Spanish and German. The grammar makes use of transformational Sechniques for normaliz-ing (a La Selig [sic] harris) various constructions for semantic transformation purposes. Other than this, the grammar is a phrase-structure grammar with a high degree of development in word class sub-classifications. These sub-classifications (somewhat along the lines suggested by Chomsky in Aspects) are semanto-syntactic groupings, that is, semantic groupings in terms of syntactic behavior and effect. For example, over 100 semanto-syntactic subclassifica-tions have been recognized and applied to verbs, representing, in effect, a systematic mapping of the intersection of syntax and semantics in English verbs. Logos has refrained from publishing any accounts of its grammar in the interest of protecting a proprietary aspect of the Company's business. But in all fairness to ourselves, Prof. Wilks' unaccountable misrepresentations could not remain unanswered. Bernard E. Scott President P.S.

Physical properties of vowels were analyzed in terms of elementary acoustical parameters: formant frequencies, slope of glottal source spectrum, mean fundamental pitch frequencyf and rapid fluctuation of fundamental pitch period. Relationship between the configuration on the PAS and the acoustical parameters was examined through multiple correlation and regression analysis. The contribution of those acoustical parameters to the petsonal quality of the five Japanese vowels and the relative contributions of the vocal tract and the glottal souzce characteristics are demonstrated quantitatively. Results obtained partially by utilizing hybrid voices in which the source wave or the formant frequency pattern was interchanged among different talkers.

Among the attractive features of speech and auditory channels are independence of visual and manual channels, omnidirectional nature of speech propagation, ability to communicate simultaneously with men and machines, and potential for using a telephone instrument as a complete computer terminal. Problem areas include incomplete knowledge of linguistic and semantic aspects of speech processing, lack of effective techniques of acoustic signal processing and need for large amounts of digital processing.
