Tho system is not programmed to simulate the human translator by producLng automatic translations. Rather, tho user can call upon the computer's roeourcog ns needed in the translation process to shorten the delay bctwcan the initia-tion of a tranelation and production of a finished version. A combination of display terminals. computer hardware, and software is used to perform functions which have habitual human counterparts of a mcclzanical nature, e.g., dictionary look-up, dictionary updating, creating of text-related glosdaries, editing and layout, collection of text statistics, c~bbination, insertion, and deletion of text. An essential aspect of this dystem of computer aids is that, while assuming the burden of much of the mechanical drudgery associated with production of a translation, it leaves to the translator those tasks wl~ose successful completion is most heavily dcpcndent on characteristics that are uniquely human, in particular, the ability to produce grammatical output in which appropriate target translationa have been selected dn the basis of understanding of text content rather than through heuristics or brute force.

In this connection, the user can perform tho following tasks on line: 1) Enter and/or edit a text, e.g., a translation or a dictionary. 2) Look up dictionary entries and browse through dictionaries and other reference files. 3) Update dictionaries or other text files. 4) P~int text in formatted or unforinatted layout. 5) Obtain text-related glossaries in textual word order or alphabetically .sorted. 6) Obtain statistical information and concordonccs on translatiand and/or (machine-readable) source langauge texta. 7) Delete, merge, and duplicate text files or text portions. 8) Permit other users to share texts and dictionaries on-line and/or off-line. 9) Obtain instructions on how to use the systetn.

The first of these modelshas become known as TAUM 71 (I) and the latest one will be presented at the COLING 76 Congress. Because of the huge mount of data which needs to be complled in order to make such a system, not to mention the introduction of a truly semantic component, no such system will be available for years to come. It is however possible to consider immediate limited applications for computer translation. METEO is an example derived from the TAUM 73 model. TAUM has also tried to demonstrate that computer translation could be successfully applied to the translation of technical manuals in a two-month experiment with the Canadian Translation Bureau and will concentrate in the next two years on the design of more appropriate parsing techniques and procedures for the treatment of idiomatic expressions. General description J","METEO is a fully automatic system for the translation of public weather forecasts from English into French covering the whole of Canada. It has been operating on arl experimental basis since last9 December and due to be fully operational on the 15th of May 1976.","Public forecasts for Canada are prepared in several regional centers from data sent by measuring stations throughout the country ana centralf7ed on a computer via the CN/CP communications network. Forecasts to be translated are retrieved, placed in a special file and processed one by one by the translation system, There is no human intervention prior to translation other than the actual typing of the text by a communicator at the corresponding regional office. The output of the translation system is handled by a specially designed editor (GERANT) which displays rejected sentences on a screen terminal at the local Translation Bureau. These sentences are taken care of by a human translator and as soon as a communication is completed it is redistributed to radio stations and newspapers using the same communications network as before. There is no revision of the sentences accepted and translated by the system and to our knowledge this is the fbst time the product of a computer translation system will be distributed directly to the public."]},{"title":"The sentences rejected by","paragraphs":["the sytem represent"]},{"title":"less than 20Y","paragraphs":["of the total input, the main causes belng: mlspellcd words, characters blurred in"]},{"title":"Cransmfsslon, words","paragraphs":["not"]},{"title":"in dtctionary, poor English, syntactic","paragraphs":["structures unknown to the"]},{"title":"parser, etc. The","paragraphs":["estimated load of the system is 30.000 words per day at the rate of over 1000 words per mlnute and the all-i~clusive cost is about"]},{"title":"one","paragraphs":["ttiird that of human translation.

First of all, because ita linguists are its programmers, they know the system inside and out. On top of that, it produces hexadecimal displays with each sentence translated at the option of the user. Our linguists evaluate these records of the computer memory to identify translation pt-oblems and to identify precisely what program or routine is at fault. Having identified the problem, they then request SYSTRAN to produce concordance listings of a sufficient rimer of sentences containing esnctly the same problcnrs. After the linguist analyzes the resultant corpus, he designs, programs, implements and tests the necessary modifications. b:odifications to the system do not always require such extensive research. Sometimes they are self-evident and require only a change in a single line of coding. The SYSTRAN macro instructions used by the linguist are automatically converted to assembler language during processing.

Advontagos of Machine Translation Of course, the greatest advantage of a machine translation is speed. A 10-page article can be translated on the computer in hlinutcs. key punching requires 3 to 4 hours, and pra- and/or post-editing maybe half an hour. Thus a requos ter could have the translation back the day after he asks for it, Cos tq A rcccnt cs timate indicnLcs tl~nt cosLs of lccy punching, cotnputcr operation, and tllc small omount of prc- al~d/or post-editing that wc do aro comparable with tl~ose of human translation. Uc do a minimum of pre-editing. I usually go through an article and mark, the first time it occurs, letters or words that are not to be translated. The key puncher then punches so that \"Vitamin A\" is translated","I I as such rather than as Vitamin and\". Manual post-editing consists in indicating, at the fiast appearance, the meaning of a work that is not in the dictionary. The time for this is really chargeable to research rather than to xouti~~c translation because we then codc such words and ctltcr them in the dictionary. We have o program for post-editing which can be used to change the meaning of a word that is obviously wrong in tllo context; for example, we con instruct the machine to change the word \"floor\" as a translation of the Russian \"pol\" to \"scx\" in a biological article.

A dcscription of the underlying representation of each of the 26 upper case letters af the English alphabet was obtained through analysis o f ambiguous characters which were generated for this purpose. The descriptions are in terms of an abstract set of invariants, called functional attributes, and their modifi-ers. The relationship be tween the physical attributes, derived from pl~ysicril measurements upon a character, and the Zunct ional attributes is given by a set of rules called Physical to Functional Rules. Three different techniques for de tennining these rules through psychophysical experimentation have been tested, and the particular rule for the attribute LEG has been determined. The rertraintng rules can he obtained in a similar fashion, and the combi~led results are expected to provide the basis for a machine algorithm.

MACHINE PROCESSING OF CHINESE CHARACTERS","paragraphs":["William SLallings","Center for Naval Analyses","Arlington, VA Chinese Characters","Chinese cl~aractcrs, used to encode, a11 the dialects spoken in China as well as the historically unrelated Japanese laAguage, present a unique machine processing and optical character. recognition (OCR) problem. Written Chinese is a pictorial arld symbolic system which differs markedly from written Western language systems. Chinese characters are not alphabetic; they are of uniform dimension, generally square, and are composed of strokes, each one a line that can be drawn without lifting the pen. In these highly structured characters, many regularities of stroke configuration occur. Quite frequently, a character is simply a two-dimensional arrangement of two or more simpler ch,~racters. Nevertheless, because strokes and collections of strokes axe combined in many different ways to produce thousands of different character patterns, the system is rich.","Written Chinese is very difficult to learn: there are over 40,000 characters, each corresponding roughly to a word in Kcstern languages, of which an educated person would be expected to know about five to ten thousand. The meaning of each character and its fixed m~nosyl~abic pronundation must be learned by rote. Usually, these two tasks are eased somewhat because one coinponent of a character gives a clue to its meaning and the rest gives a clue to its pronunciation. But since there is no alphabetic order to Chinese characters, another difficulty is dicti~nary lookup; a number of special systems have been devised to impose an ordering, none of them terribly convenient. Finally, a student of Chinese must learn to draw the strokes of each character in a particular order; a character may have from one to thirty strokes with eight to twelve being typical.","Of direct relevance to the use of OCR for Chinese is the desire of the Peoples' Republic of China to simplify th@ written language through a series of language reforms. The first is that the government has recommended the general use of only 2000 characters. Publishers, being government-controlled, are under instructions to stay within the total of 2000 as Ear as possible. Secondly, the government has simplified a large nunber of characters with the result that the avorage number of strokes per character has bcen reduced by about a factor of two to an average of about 6 to 8 strokes per character. Thie continuing policy of language simplification will case the difficulty of Chinese OCR, Data Procecsinq Requirements","The requirements for machine-processing of Chinese characters,","whether for machine translation or other applications, are four: O input 9 storage Q data processing O output","The requirements in the latter three areas are formidable compared to those imposed by the btin and Cyrillic alpnabets, For example, a machine trahslation device might be required to print out the Chinese text together with its translation. An adequate representation of each character would require a 32x32 black/white matrix. Xionce the storage of th'e image alone of each of 5000 to 10,000 characters would require 1000 bits., Nevertheless, because of the vast uoprovcments made in memory density and processing speed of computers, these requirements no longer present a problem.","The only remaining bottleneck is ihput. Because of the many thousands of characters in common use, a ke,yboard for Chinese (for typesetking, typewriting, keypunching, on-line computer entry, eta.) is an ungainly affair.

Summary of FBIS Seminar on Machine-Aided Translation","S. Re Petrick IBM Tw Jw Watson Research Center Yorktown Heights, N. Y. 10598 In the first paper delivered at this conference Wallace Chafe pra~entad the following model of translation: a source language sentence is first parsed to produce a surface structure. This is converted by some process of coinprehension to a deeper, conceptual structure that reflects the meaning of the sentence in a more direct way. This conceptual structure my or may not be a language-Independent universal structure, In those models whora it is not universal but instead is tailorad to the source language, it must be coaverted to a corresponding conceptual structure that is similarly specific to the target language. In any case, conceptual structures must be mapped by a vcrbhlization process into corresponding target language surface structures whose debracketizat ions yield the required target sentence output. Other speakers suggested extensions to this model, for example, to provide for context beyond isolated sentences, Basically, however, Chafe's model provides a good basis for discussing the translation efforts which were described by the other speakers at this conference. For example, one way in which different systems roughly based on Chafe's model can vary is in the relative depth of their conceptual structures. Actual systems that were discussed varied in this respect all the way from rather abstract structures that directly represented meaning to shallow structures whose relationship to corresponding sentence meanings was, at best, tenuous. All of ohe comercially intended systems which were described appeared tp rely upon such shallow structures, in some cases on surface structure itself. In most cases this was explicitly stated by speakers at this conference, and in other cases it could be inferred from outright errors in exhibited sanple output where intended neaning was not correctly determined. All of these MT systems, however, exhibited what dght be"]},{"title":"73 called extensive coverage of the sburca language, e., outppt was produced for every source language sentence (undoubtedly also for ungrammaEicaZ source language ut termee) .

Their advocates point out the necessity for deeper conceptual structures as well as shpplementary iniortI\\ation and inference in order to adequately translate certain sentences. They pay a pricc, howover, for their insistence on more adequate conceptual structures, because those structures are not easily obtained for unrestricted text input. It is equallly true of the A1 and Computational Linguistics bsystems, whether based m formal grammars or procedurally defined, that the coveraEe of the saource language prwided is currently very sparse. Due to the fact that most source language sentences are not processed by these systems, they are unsuitable for unrestricted text and have been applied only to question answering systems and $0 restricted toy-world domains. The amount of effott required to extend the coverage of, say English, to a state useful for MT while maintaining the adequacy of assigi~ad conceptual structures might be variously es tinatcd by different autlloritics"]},{"title":", but it is my","paragraphs":["opinion that it is very large indeed, large enough to make such applications as question answering systens niore at tractive candidates for consideration in the next few years. Anothet point to note in conjunction with all of the systems discussed at this conference is that their treatment of the process Chafe referred to as verbalization is rather primitive. Thus in spite of the fact that this aspect of a computational linguistic system is often referred to as uninteresting or trivial compared to the task of understanding an input utterance, and in spite of the fact that my normally difficult facets of verbalization do not present 74 a problem in MT, the cursent output of languag,e processing sys terns is very unnatural and rough. This is true of A1 systems as well as operational MT sys terns, If, in fact, we examine the specific realisations of the componunts in Chafe's model whidh were reported to be included in the >E systems described at this conference, we find very few cllangas over the situation that prevailed ten years ago. The comprehension coriponent is realized by such means as a context frqe grammar, a Q-System, or an analysis-based ad hoc procedural specification. DiEf icultias ~nd shortcomings related to conccp tu31 structures have already been noted. These h~ve changed very little over the past Bew years. Similarly, we have already commented on that portion of the target language oudput inadequacy which is attributable to shortcomings in the treatment of verbalization. In summary then, currently operational or projected systems are only marginally different in their mderlying organization and design than their predecessors. If, then, there is little that is novel about the underlying niodels of current and projected MT systems, it is natual to ask how many hardware and software improvements have been made. Several claims were xade about improvements in procedural programing languages. Although I am fully aware of the benefits which follow from the use of a well suited programming language, I don't think the improvements which are claimed are very significant. For one thing, many language processing tasks are still very difficult to program using the best prdgramming languages. And for another, convenient programing is no substitute fur the absence of satisfactory models and algorithms, Recent advances in editors and time sharing systems might, however, be significant factors in making the development of machine-aided human translation more attractive."]},{"title":"75 Hardware developments of the past decade include time sharing hardware, automatic photocomposition devices, larger primary and secondary storage, faster processing speeds, and lower costs.","paragraphs":["Optical character recognition was reported not to have advanced significantly in the past few years.

The question which arises, l~bwavor, is what their effect is likely to be on MT. The key issue is how much of tho total effort can be handled by a coaputer and how much must still be dono by human labor. Text input, pre-editing, and pos tediting can take as much human time and effort as complete human translation. Of critical importance is the evaluation of current systems to de-termine the quality of their unedited output, the uses for which such output is acceptable, and the amount of postediting that is required to neet well defined higher standards. No clear results of this type were pxovided at the conference and careful study is necessary to resolve certain seemingly contradictory claims. Thus, there were reports of translation output which was not postedited, other output which was only lightly posteditqd, and still other output that was extensively pos tedited. The implication was given that no =ore editing was required than was given, and, although there is a sense in which that claim is undoubtedly true, it fails to take into considera-tion the quality of the output, the purpose for which the translation was requested, and the degree sf requestor satisfaction. Although I did not systematically examine large quantities of source language input and corresponding unedited target language output, the examples which I did exmine suggested a rather low level of performance with respect to both fidelity of meaning output and to smoothness and naturalness of the output. The overall quality of output produced strikes me as comparable to that of ton years ago, and a colleague of mine with more experience in Xr than IGY om assessed the output I shawed llim as more ambitious in its attempt to ncl~i~ve natural output than past systems but probably not any nore sucmssful. Attempts to produce natural target liinguogcr word ordcr and correct insertion of articles kalpad in sope cases but just as often made t;ha translatiun worse. Clearly, it is no simple task to evaluate the quality of output schiov.ible through the use of a particular >iT sys turn, to dctgriaine tile axount: of post-editing necessary to briog it up to required standards of quality, and to estimate the likely cost of achieving that quality. Each prospective user of an XT system must carefully do this, but from what was presented at this conference I would not expect any current Xi' systems to compete ccor,on;ically with human translation except in those few cases where requirenents for quality and accuracy are so low that unedited or very lightly edited output suffices. In addition to postedited ?IT, this conference also discussed the use of hardware and software aids to hman translation. There seemed to be a consensus that well-engineered systens csn be produced now, that their use looks promising, and that they probably are limited to increasing the productivity of human translators by a factor of 2-1 or 3-1. Opinion wad divided as to whether they might evolve ifit 5 humn-aided sys teems. It did apaear clear &at! existing systems have not yet been carefully field tested, and that they do not contain all the aids to translation that have been suggested. STANLEY R.

Summary Remarks for Machine Translation Conference Sally Yeates Sedelow An- issue whlch emerged early in the conference and recurred either explicitly or, more of ten, implicitly during subsequent scsslnns concerned the relative values of pragmatic solutions and more basic research. An additdona1 factor was the often presumed relationship between more basYc research and science, and between the pragmatic and fts synonym, 'ad !~ocness. 1 7 I suspect we would all agree that there is no necessary progression from what some here have termed 'engineering' solutions to theory from which one can generalize. On the other hand, neither is there any necessary relationship between science (in a strict definition) and what is sometimes called basic research by linguists, computational linguists, psycholinguists or whoever among us is dealing with natural language. In my judgment, for an), major leap forward in machine translation or in natural language understanding in general, more classical science is badly needed. Science is needed not only for its rigor, which implies well-ar ticulated models and thorough and extensive predictive-type testing (including efforts to reproduce results in a number of llaboratories')"]},{"title":", but also for cumulativeness. In the situation under consideration, I am struck by the number of isolated hypotheses and experiments which don't seem to lead anywhere, and upon which others seem unable to","paragraphs":["build. By way of elaboration upnn the point I'm making, it may be helpful to note that in the humanifies, there is precious little difference between the prggmatics (for example, writing a poem) and basic reseach. I would argue, for example, that much research on and criticism about a poem is, simply, in effect allother poem or set of poems, even ~hough couchcd in prose. When a literary scholar cites orhor rclcvent work at the beginning of an article or book, he sometimes docs so to create an illusion oi cumulativcness, but often to disagree with much of what others h~va said bccnuse it is thfough such divergence that creativity ae a critic is dcmonstratcd, In my opinion, much social scicrice is closer to the humanities than it is to physical scie~~ccs when it comes to the ~ragmatics/bnsic research distinction. Such is the case in part because in the social sciences-- notably in linguistics-we are studying our own artifacts, and it is all too easy at (one hopes) the unconscious level to manipulate those artifacts (in the case of linguistics, symbol systems) to demonstrate a particular notion or theory. Although sometimes a problem, this kind of manipulation is much less likely to occur in the physical sciences, where some natural phenomenon is being studied. Tn the social sciences and in natural language research, a ~uch greater openness to testing is needed. Lacking, as it docs, an \"unconscious level,\" the computer is in many ways ideal for such testing. For example, Joyce Frlednan's programs have been used to test the consistency of grammars based upon a particular model of transformational grammar. On the other hand, with reLerence to the value of the computer, we should be wary of constructing very elaborate, computer-based systems which do some one or two things very nicely, but whi~h have no generality and make no contribution to the cumulativeness which we must have if"]},{"title":"79 I1 we're going to move toward any uti 3ia\" (to use a word employed yesterday] re natural language understanding - avplica tions , such as machine translation, In other words, who build computer systems we should think lase about -- ad hoc dcmonstra s of notions","paragraphs":["or theories, and more about testable, genesalizable eyet s.

The first concerns the consumer, or reader, of mashine translations and the second involves the translation process in a computer-aided environment, As to the first, I'd simply like to applaud the response to a suggestion that tran-lation of weather broddcasts into French would be much easier if only a few formats and phrases were permitted. The response: \"That would be boring to read"]},{"title":",","paragraphs":["\" shows laudable recognit ion of the importance of stylistic variety for readability and, more generally for commuaication; also, presumably for those of us gathered here, some grace in the use of language is one of life's pleasures and we would not care to be a party to its abandonment. The second factor relates to the first, and concerns the suggested use of computer-based editing systems as an aid to translation. The 80 point I want to make may seem trivial or obvious but since a show of hands indicated that few if any of the professional translators at these sessions hove used editing systems and I know that linguists who might advisa on auch systems have tended to conccnrrote on lengunge strings no longer than a sentence, I think the point is worth making. That is, cathode ray screens t~l~ich form the interface between man and macl~ine in editing systems really can't display much text at a time. As someone whose professional concorn for years was extendcd discourse, 1 find a cathode ray tube vhry confining; when reading rind writing I: like to be able to look backward at strings of at least a acdium-sized paragraph's length. An ability to sea that much text enables me to correct the kind of lapses one makes when writing--frequent repetition of a word or phrase, repetitive patterning in sentence length or structure, and so on.. Although 1've never been a professional translator, I assume that they have analogous requirements. Therefore, I'd urge that e system to be used in machine translation either provide larger screens or keep a kind of running summary which could be used to alert the translator through underlining, a warning message, or wl~atever"]},{"title":", that, for example, a given word or phrase was being used","paragraphs":["roo often.

The principles of the first section summarize my reactLon to the contributions presented at the conference; the guides of the second section express my opinion about the making of decisions in a fairly broad area. GENERALITIES 1. Almost everyone hates computers, including most computer scientists. In '\"Information IIandling\" (Current Trends in Linguistics, ed. T. A. Sebcnk et al., volume 12, pp. 2719-2740), I noted that professors who give their students clever tricks for skimming technical articles refuse to permit their computer programs to use the same tricks; the computer must work the hard way, in accordance with general theories of the structure of information. A friend suggests that hatred of the machine must be responsible. Anyone who hates computers is likely to design cumbersome systems. 2.

Layers"]},{"title":"of cake,","paragraphs":["soaked"]},{"title":"in liqueurs, axe separated with","paragraphs":["thin layers"]},{"title":"of jam and covered with a thick layer of whipped cream. The layers of a system are hardware, software, appli-","paragraphs":["cation programs, data base formats. daka base contents, and so on. Claims of universality, simplicity, and the like are often no more than the assertion that a Layer of whipped cream can cover anything. Deep probes are necessary to evaluate such claims. 6. If everyone optimizes his own cost effectiveness, the system goes to pieces. The classic example is the way against German submarines in the Nediterranean, Itwas so successful that the Germans moved into the North Atlantic and nearly starved the British. Translation is not the end of the whole system; to raise internal costs can make the system at large much more effective if done right. 7. Brevity counts. The time of the reader has to be reckoned into the cost of the system; translations of key points can be more suitable than full translations. he machine may be more useful in finding passages than in translating them. 8. You cannot make a jumbo jet out of an elephant by pulling its ears. Martin Kay suggested that Hannibal was wiser to buy elephants to cross the Alps than he would have been if he had let a development contract for jet transport. Contrariwise, suitability as a chassis for the future jet is no criterion for selection of a first-stage machine; sooner or later it will be necessary to scrap the whole system and start over. What counts in the first ifistallation is whether or not it works as installed, for however limited a purpose has been selected. 9, Almost everyone hates franslators. They arouse our xenophobia by bringing the enemy into our camp. To give them help in their task, or credit for doing it, is loathsame. 10. Big ideas are easier to understand than little ones. Some examples of big ideas mentioned in the conference are words (as opposed to characters) as objects for optical recognition; syntactic patterns (as opposed to diagnostic contexts) in language processing; and scripts or frames (as opposed to grammatical and syntactic structures) as objects for computers to seek in texts. It might be easier to find that a news story is about a certain frame (detente), and that the source is Sadat. than to translate the whole; and the summary (\"Sadat endorses detente\") might be more helpful to the user than the translation would be. GUIDES 1. A prima facie case has been made for gradual introduction of language-processing capacity into intelligence facilities. 2. System design and cost analysis remain the essential prerequisites to procurement, 3. The design should take into account as 'fully as possible the needs.of users of translations. 4. No adequate reason for selecting a single system and excluding the rest has come to light thus far. 5. The main developmental track for a few years ahead is from character processing (editing systems) to word processing (dictionaries). 6. A plausible further development for the three to seven year prospect is automatic recognition of topic (for example, of requirements), and the mstching of now text against old for partial identification of redundant, and therefore omittable, information. 7. The operational suitability of language-processing systems depends crucially on the smallest details of their design. As yet, only those of clearly superior knowledge, taste, and judgment can be entrusted with the work. 8. Several classes of systems are fundamentally different and cannot usefully be intermingled. Current commercial MT systems, which make no provision for editorial intervention between the earliest and latest stages of processing, are not suitable bases for machine-aided (editorial) systems; and the"]},{"title":"latter are","paragraphs":["not necessarily suitable bases foy full-scale language-processinq systems that may reach installabilfty in as little as ten years if research and development are well supported, SUMMARY NOTES FBIS Se~n i nar"]},{"title":"Jim Mathias","paragraphs":["Mr. Mathias concluded the sum ma@ presentation by"]},{"title":"restating","paragraphs":["some Zommon threads running throughout.
