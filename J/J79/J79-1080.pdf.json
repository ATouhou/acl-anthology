Hence one only needs worry if information comes in whichdoesnotPit them. As opposed to Minsky however the suggestions for new context frames wilX not come from the old ones, but rather from the conflictin8 information. The problem them becomes how potential frames are indexed under the info mat ion which \"suggestsw them.","Understanding every day discourse requires making inferentes from a very large base of common sense knowledge.

This requires, of course. that given a topic, such as trains, or eating. we must be able to acCess its knowledge without going t hroq h averyt hing we know. Hence we are lead in a natural way to something approaching a notion of \"frame\" (Minsky 19f5): a collection of knowledge about a single stereotyped sttuation.","In the above discussion however I have made a rather important slight of hand. Given story we only want to consider those frames \"about\" things tn the story. lbw Ls it that we decide which frames quality' I was able to gloss over this because in most situations the problca, at least at a surface Iwel. does not appear all thst difficult.

This alternative is by no means a strats man as one researcher has in fact explicitly suggested it (Fahlman 1977) and I for one find it a very natural way of thinking about the problem.","The idea behind this mkghod is that we are given oergain clues in the istory about the nature of the correct Erame, and to find the frame we simply intersect the possible frames associated with each clua. To s& how this might work let us Sake a close 1-k at the following example As Jack waawd down the aisle he put a can of tunafish in his basket. The clues here are things like \"aisle\", \"tunafish' etc. Of course, I do not mean to say that it is the English wrds which are the clues, but rather the concepts which underlie the words.

(However this assumes that there Is no vicious interaction betwen frbe dsermination and d lsambigua tion. Given that dieadbiguation depends WU prior frame determinatiop (see (Hayes 1977) for numerous examples) this may be incorrect.) So the input to the frame determin~r will be something like ST-1 (WALK JACK-1 AISLE-1) ST-2 ( PERSON JAC K-1 ) ST-3 (EQUAL (NAME JACK-1 ) \"JACK\") ST4 (EQUAL (SEX JACK-1 ) MALE) ST-5 (AISLE AISLE-1 ST06 (PUT JACK-I TUNA-FISH<@-1 BASKET-1) ST97 (BASKET B&RET-I) The details of the representation do not figure in the paper,"]},{"title":"and","paragraphs":["those which do are fairly uncontroversial.

Under AISLE we mi@t find CHURCH, THEATER, and SUPERMARKET, while BASKET will have LLTTU-RED-RID1 NG-HOOD, and SUPEWA&KET. The point is that none of these elms will be unambiguous, but when we take the intersection the qnly thing which vill be left is SUPERMARKET.","There are, however, problems with this view of things. For one thing it ignores what I will call the \"clue selection\" problem. Put in the plainest fashiqn the difficultiy here is deciding exactly what clues we will hand over to the clue resolution component, and in what order. Sr, in the last e%ample I selected some of the cwtent of the sentence to hand over to the clue resolver, in particular AISLE, and BASKET. This seemed reasonable given that they do tend to stggest \"supermarket\", as desired. But there is more information in the sentence. It was Jack who did all of this. Why not intersect what we know about Jack with all of the rest, or WALK? Or again-supgose something ever so slightly odd ham. such as the basket hitting a qcrewdriver which is on the Eloor. SCREWDRIVER will have vacioua things indexed undqr it, but more likely than not t interkection with the rest of the items mentioned above will give us the null set. For that matter, is there any reason"]},{"title":"w","paragraphs":["only intersect things in the same sentence? The answer here is clearly n6, since there are many examples which require just the opposite. Jack was walking, down an aisle. )Be was pushing his basket.

It is ridiculous to go throqh the entire story col*lectinp; clues and then do a grand intersee tion at t& end","A reasonably natural solution to the clue selection problem huld start with the observation that usually we already have a general frame.

CONSTRAINTS ON THE HYPOTHESIS OF NEW FRAMES","Esrly on we noted that it wag only necessary to worry about a new frame if we received information which did not fit in the old ones. Then when we introduced the two kinds of indecres we noted that we wanted to place events in a sequence of events, and objects in their mica1 local. qis immediately suggests that when w get an unintecgratable action we use the ACTION index on the predicate, while for objects we would use the LOCATION index. However, this is not: general enough in at least two ways.","For one thing, often we will have a non-integratable action where it is not the action frame, but rather the objects inmxved iii the action which suggest the appropriate frame. Our example of someone going over to a phone is a case in point. Here GO tells us nothing, but TELEPHONE is quite suggestive. To handle this the search for ACTION indices must include those which are on OBJECT frames describing the tokens involved in the action. So since Jack is going to something which is a telephone, we look on the ACTION indet af TELEPHONE.","We must also extend om analysis to handle states. Zf we are told that Jack is in a restaurant we must activate RESTAURANTING. 1Tour currqnt analysis (RESTAURANT (THING RESTAURANT-I)) will not do this since it is an OBJECT frame and hence will only be looking for LOCATIONS in which the restaurant will fit. Hence in this case the IN frame must act like the GO frame in looking for ACTION indecies in which it might fit.

I have nothing to say on this aspect of the problem.","There is however one type of example which raises some doubts about the above algorithm.

Here it would seem that the notion of sawing a person in half $8 the crut~al concept which leads us to magic, although the fact that the woman does not seem conc2rned. and the entire thing is happening on a stage certainly help re-enforce this idea.

On one branch would appear MAGIC-PERFORNANCE, bat we would only get to it after many tests, one of which would see if the thing sakd was a person.

The net only saves time when a single test in the net rules out a number of frames. At the present time I have not thought of enough frames associated with SAWING to make this worth while. But as31 suspect this is primarily do to lack of work on my part.

Only the second of these can plausibly be included in RESTAURANTINC.","Given: our algorithm the following will occur. The second line will become something like (IN-LANGUAGE MENU-1 CHINESE).

Once again, to ask such a question leaves the respondent no choice of (potentially) correct answers, violating the conversational convention. More importantly, upon being asked such a question, tfie respondent can infer what the questioner presumes about the context. Question 2A above presumes 2B, but does not presuppose it: 2B is not entailed by the dirsct answer 2C. Nonetheless, a quvtioner must find, 2B assumable to felic~itously ask 2A in a cooperative conversation - t& do otherwise would violate the cooperative convention. Similarly, 3B below is a presumption but not a presupposition of 3A (it is not entailed by 3C). 3A. Did Sandy pass the pqelims? 3B. Sandy took the prelims. 3Cm NO. if a queetioner believes .in the falsehood of a presupposition of a question, the question is inappropriate because s/he must believe that no direct answer can be correct; similarly, if a questioner believes in the falsehood of a presumpti~n, the question is inappropriate because the questioner must know the answer to the question - it is the direct answer that does not entail the presumption. - In short, ------------------------------------------- proposition (in this case, the negation o£ the proposition expressed by a question-direct answer pair) should also entail its presuppositions. Consequently, the truth of a presupposition of a question is normally considered a prerequisite ?or respondent detects that a questioner incorrectly presumes something about the domain of discourse, s/he is required to correct that misimpression. A failure to do so will impl'icitly confirm the questioner's presumption, Consequently, it is not always the case that a correct, direct answer is the most cooperative response, When an incorrect presumption is detected, it is more cooperative to 'correct the presumption than to give a direct response. Such a response can be called a Corrective Indirect Res orse. For example, imagine question Attered in a cooperative conversation when the respondent knows that no departments sell knives. 4A. Which departments that sell knives also sell blade sharpeners? 48. None. 4C. No deparments sell knives. Although 48 is a direet, correct response in this context, it is less cooperative than 4C. This effect is explained by the fact that 4A presumes that some departments sell knives. To be cooperative, the respondent should correct the questioner's misimpression with an indirect response, informing the questioner that no departments sell knives (4C). (The direct, correct response 48 will reinforce the questioner's mistaken presumption in a cooperative conversation through it's failure to state otherwise.) A failure to produce corfective indirect responses is highly inappropriate in a cooperative conversation, and leads to \"stonewallingn - the qjving of very limited and precise responses that fail to address the larger goals and beliefs of the questioner. RELEVANCE TO DB QUERIES -- an answer to be either true or false (for a more detailed discussion see [Keenan 731).

Application to Extensional","paragraphs":["-."]},{"title":"Equivalence - of Intensional Concepts A basic assumption of semantic,net-works is that each concept is represented by a single node and that all information about a concept is reachable from its node. Yet, since Woods' discussion [20], mast Semantic network authors have agreed that a node represents an intensional, rather than an extensional concept. How should we handle the inf~rmation that two different intensional concepts are extensionally equivalent? Let us illustrate this by a story (entirely fictiafial). For the last year we have heard of a renowned surgeon in town, Dr. Smith, known for his brilliance and dexterity, who saved the life of the famous actress Maureen ~e'lt by a difficult heart transplant operation. ~eanw~ile, at several social gatherings, we have met someone by the name of ~ohn Smith, about five feet, six inches tall, black hair and beard, generally -d$sheveled and clumsy. We now discover, much to our ama~ement that John Smith and Dr. Smith are one and the samef In our semantic netwokk, we have one node for Dr. Smith connected to his attributes, and another for John Smith connected to his attributes. What are we to do? Although we now know that John Smith saved the life of Maureen Gelt and that Dr. Smith has black hair, surely we cannot retrieve that infarmation as fast, as that Dr. Smith is a surgeon and that John Smith is 5'6\" tall, If ye were to combine the two nodes by taking all the arcs from one node, tying them to the other and throwing away the firbt, we would lose this distinction, We dpust introduce an assertion, say an EQUI~EQUIV case frame, that represents the fact that Dr. Smith and John Smith, different intensional concepts, are extensi~n~ly the same.1 Haw are we to use this assertion? Ignoring for the moment referentially opaqtte contexts (\"We didn't know that John Smith was Dr. Smith.\"), how can we express the ruledhat if n EQUIV~/'/EQUI~ m, than anything true of n is true of m? Our node based inference rules cannot express this rule because expressing \"anything-true of nn requires quantifying over those higher order case frame preaicates such as AVO 'lhe psychological plausibility of this discussion is supported by the experimees of Anderson and Hastie [I] and of McNabb 191 and MEMBER'C~ASS. One possibility is to YZ use lambda abstraction as Schubert does f12J. Each n-ary htgher order predicate involving some node becomes a unary predicate by replacing that nodle by a lambda vaxiab7e. Thus, \"Dx, Smith saved Maureen Gelt 's life\" becotnes ,an instance of the unary predicate X (x) [a saved Maureen Gelt's life] applied to Dr. Smith. Using a PRED-ARG case frame, it is easy to represent the rule The trouble with this solution is, how' are we to retrieve this information as a fact about Maureen GeLt? Must we also store A(*) [Dk. Smith saved x's life) (Maureen Gelt) 3 This duplication is unsatisfying, An alternative is to include in the path-based inference rule defining each arc-relation the path (EQUIV-/EQUIV)*. For example, AGENT","paragraphs":["+"]},{"title":"AGENT/ (EQUIV-/EQUI V) % and CLASS","paragraphs":["+"]},{"title":"CLASS/( (EQUIV-/EQUIV) */ (SUB-/SUP) * 1 * . Although this solution requires more rules than the lambda abstraction solution, and the rules look complichted, it avoids the duplication of the same assertion in different forms and the postulation of conceptual predicates such as A (s) [x saved Maureen Gelt's life]. Hays' cognitive networks [4;5] include a scheme similar to the one proposed here. Each assertion about Dr, Smith would refer to a different node, =each with an MST (manifestation) arc to a common node. This node would represent the in tension of Dr. Smith, while the others represent Dr. Smith as surgeon, Dr. Smith as saviour of Maureen Gelt, etc. Presumably, when Hays' network learns of the identity of Dr. Smith with John Smith, a new node is introduced with MS arcs from both Dr. Smith and John Smith.3 Dr. Smith and John Smith are then seen as two manifes-tions of the newly integrated Dr. John Smith, Hays presumably uses an MST*/(MST~)* path where we propose an (EQU 19-/EQUI V) * path. ~l~cking referentially opaque contexts seems to require introducing rsZationaZ oempZemen*. For any pat4 P and nodes xaand y, let x& hold just in case a path P from x to y does not exist in the network. * We miqht blocg referentially opaque contexts-by including the domain or range restriction (OBJ'/VERB/MEMBER-/CLASS OPAQUE) in the arc definitions. 8.

Fritzson, personal coanmunicatian] that the implementation may differ from what I have supposed. semantic networks include inheritance (ISA) hierarchies.

We propose that the inheritance properties of these hierarchies be clearly defined by path-based inference rules using the syntax we are ptesenting here or some other well defined syntax.

Predictable Information in Discourse","Despi te the fact that most research on inferential Processeq in comprehension has been concerned with generation of implicit information, much inferentially related information is embod-ied explicitly in cftscourse.

However, pragmatic inferences are only imperfectly predictable.

Similarly, it would nat be considered unusual when relating the events at a birthday party to mention that there was a 'take wi th candles blown out by the celebrant.

However, in a variety of theoretizal orientations, there is a common implication about howrpredictable information would be dealt with: simply out, explicit information, whether predictable or not, receives sufficient processing to be encoded in long-term memory.

It would then seem to be more efficient to devote extra processing effort to the occasions when the information is needed (i.e., by deriving it when remembering) rather than exerting effort toward stable encoding at the time of comprehension.","Experiments on the Representation of Expliqit Inferences","There are considerable problems in designing an empirical test of the hypothesis that explicit pragmatic inference5 in discourse are not represented in long-term memory. If one merely tests memory for the inference, fei lure to remember couTd be attributed to not storing the information or to storing and then forgetting it, if the inference is rememberea', it could be because it was stored and then retrieved, or jt may have been generated at the time of test without having been stored.","Spiro and Esposi to (1977) developed a paradigm not subjkct to the ambiguit~es of interpretation of the more simple design discussed above The primary manipulation gf interest involved subsequentlyrvi tisting the force of an earlier expl;cit inference. if the inference is not stored, certain predictable errors in recalling it should be made.","In the first experiment, subjects were presented stories 'which contained informat ion A, B, and C such that B was strongly implied by A except in the presence of C.

B: The block broke. C: He had had a fight with his wife","earlier. It was impairing his","concentration. C was either presented prior to A and B (C-Before) after A and B, (C-After), or not at all (NO-C). When C was not included in the story, if SPEl is correct, the B element should be taken for granted, processed only superf i-ci-1 ly, and not stably represented. It would be derivable if needed. However, if C is presented.after A and 0, memory for B should be-impaired since B was not stored and C will block its derivation from A at the time of test. On the other hand, if C occurs in the text prior to A and 0, then B is not strongly implied by-A. 8 cannot be taken for granted with the assumption that it can be generated later if needed. Here B should be stably represented and memory for B should not be impaired.","However, if SEl is correct, memory for B should not be affected by whether C is before or after A and B, since B is ,tored whether it 1s imp1 ied by A (C-After) or not implied by A (c-Before). Two object ions to this argument can be made. The information might be stored, but remembering C might lead to a decision that the memory for B must be mistaken (a kind of output interference). However, C is present whether it occurs before or after A and 8, so such an explanation would not accotrnt for differential effects of C-placement. The other possibility is that 8 is represented in C-After, but the representation is altered OJ- corrected when the C informat ion- i s encountered. This possibility was investigated in the second experiment.","In the first experiment, the following ,pre'dictions of the SPEl hypothesis-were tested.

Confidence in errors or the latter kind were also analyzed. If subjects are as confident about these errors as they are about their accurate responses, It would be even more difficult to maintain the hypotheqis that the explicit inferences were represented.","In the No-C condition, B-Mention errors may occur since B would not be represented pccording to the SPtl hypothesis. The more important prediction regarding the No-C condition is that B-Incorrect errors should not occur more often than in the C-Before condition.

The superf i c i at process i ng phenomenon appears most compatible with a schema-theoretic mode of representation. Perhaps variable bindings that are default (or at least high probabil i ty) values are not explicitly instantiated when they are explicit in discourse (but see the discussion of Determinants of Performance Variability below). However, one should not be overly persuadtd by the simplicity 04 such an account. Other types of representation systems could also account for the phenomenon. For example, a spreading activation mode? (e.g., Collins & loftus, 1975) might predict that explicit information is not tagged in memory when it has been recently activated with some greater than criterion strength. This issue will receive further discussion in the next section.","Regarding speed of processing, several possibi 1 ities may be offpmd: the information is actually predicted, perhaps followed by a selective scanning for partial clues of con-f irmation (e.g., the word \"broke\" in the karate champion example; perhaps such checks couM be made in the visual periphery and, when positive, result in saccades that skip the predicted information), or the expectation may be formed after beginning to read the predictable information followed by skipping ahead to the next linguistic unit (\"Oh.

Regarding automaticig, it seems likely that the amount of conscious processing required would be nega-t~vely correlated with the goodness of fit to prior knowledge. Thus conscious attempts to make sense of predictable information would be expected less often. Also, related to the suggestions above regarding expectations and rapldity of processing, the operation of some preattentive process (In the sense of Neisser, 1967) is, a possibility.

However, when the proportion of fit is poor, i,e., some atypical events occur, even typical, predictable events may have to be stored.","Occurrence of superf i cia1 processing is also likely to be affected by the extent to which the system is taxed. When the system is overloaded, as when there i s a large amount of-information to be acquired or the time to acquire the hformation is limited, more superficial processing and leaving of information to be derived probably goes on. Perhaps the system has flexible criteria for derivabili ty, reducing criteria under overload conditions and increasing them when processing load is light (and when demands for recall accuracy are high or' when subsequent availability of the information is limited). Briefly digressing, Shere may be a temptation to confuse superficial processing-of derivable information wtth skimming.

In other words, the same information that might receive more attention while skimming may receive less attention in normal situations if the information is derivable. This will happen to the extent that skimming results in shallow processing of earlier information that is the basis for the derivabiLlty of the later information.","Besides context-based variability in derivability criteria, research in the psychology of prediction indicates the potential operation of a genera1 bias in determining the criterion for derivability and superficial processing. For example, Fi schoff (1 975, 1977) ha3 found that when people are told that some event has occurred, they increase their subjective probabi 1 i ty est irnate of the 1 ikel ihood that the event was going to occur, Similarly, estima-tion af how muEh was known before being- given a correct answer increases when the answer is provided.

Implications for the Nature of Discourse Memory","To the extent that discourse is superficially prqcessed, mgmory must be reconstructive rather than reproduct i ve. Rather than retrieving traces or instantiations of past experienge, the past must be inferred or derived. Just as a paleontologist reconstructs a dinosaur From bone fragments, the past must be reconstructed from the incomplete data expl ici tly stored. Evidence for such reconstructive processes has been provided by Spiro (19771, who found a pervasivk tendency for subjects to produce pred lc table mean ing6chang ing d i-s tort ions and importations in text recall under certain conditions. In general, when subsequently encountered information contradicted cont lnuatlon expectations derived from a target story, the story f requentiy was reconstructed in such a way as to reconci 1 e or cohere wi th the continuation information, This process of inferring the past based on the present was termed accommodative reconstruction. After a long retention interval, subjects tended to be more confident that their accommodative recall errors had actually been-included in the story than they were confident about the accurate aspects of their recall. Why should such gross errors occur and then be assigned such high confidence? Part of the answer surely involves their function in prbducing coherence. Still, lt is somewhat surprising that subjects should be so sure they read information that bore not even a distant inferential relationship to hat they actually did read,","Spiro suggested that the basis for such an effect may be in the way information is treated at the time of comprehension; namely, it is superficially processed and not stored in long-term memory. Then, when remembering, individual s should know (at least tacitly) that considerable amounts of predictable or derivable informat ion they have encountered will not be available in memory, In that case, recall would typically involve deriving a lot of missing information. Accordingly, it would not be surprising that subjects faced with njemories that lack coherence would assume that missing reconciling information was presented but"]},{"title":"only superficial","paragraphs":["1 y"]},{"title":"processed","paragraphs":["at comprehension, The information could then be derived at recalf with high.confidence. Hence the capacity for restructuring the past based on the present. individual Differences","A final caveat should be offered regarding the superfictal processing effect, but also appl icable to al.1 research on xhema-based processes in comprehension and memory. The assumption is usually made that there are no qualita-tive differences between individuals in the manner in which discourse is processed. How-evet, Spi ro and hi s cot leagues have recent l y found that reliable style differences can be predicted in children (~piro & Smith, 1978) and in col lege students (~pira 6 Ti rre, in preeara-tion). Some individuals appear to be more di$- course bound, tending toward over-re1 iance-on bottom-up processes. Others are more prior know1 edge bound, tending toward over-re1 ance on top-down processes. For the adult bottom-up readers, prior knowledge obviously must be used to a certain extent in comprehension. However, where use of prior knowledge is more optional, e.g., in providing a scaffolding for remembexing information (Anderson, Spi~o, & Anderson, 1978), the bottom-up readers capi ta 1 i ze less. Whether the latter type of individual will evince less knowledge-based superficial processing (again an optional use of prior knowledge) Is a question currently under investiga-t ion.
