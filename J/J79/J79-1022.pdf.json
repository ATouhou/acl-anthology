This parser is programmable not only in its syntax, semantics, and their related activities, but also with respect to the modes of operation. The idea of parsing modes diffkrs from other ways of programming parsers in that it is related to the behaviors desired from a parser rather than to its lower level functions. The dozen modes described are roughly independent of one ahother. The main activities of QarseF form a dialectic process of prediction, discovery and construction, all embedded in a higher order control structirre. The modes indicate the behavior of each such activity. This way of programming a parser is seen as a dtep toward representing theories of natural language in a unifiable way, in the sense that various made settings might yield parsers, generators, language inferrers, etc. The matter of unification is hund t6 be non-trivial (i.e. a generator is not just an inverse parser), yet the notion of modes makes it at least tractable.

For these dialogs, context is supplied both by the surrounding task (the task context) and by the surrounding dialog (the dialog context). This paper describes the dis-course component of a speech undetstanding system for task-oriented dialogs. This component evaluates q prop-osed interpretation for an utterance in terms of how well it fits the context surrounding the utterance. In particular, the discourse component identifies the referents of noun phrases and fills in mfssing information in elliptical expressions. Task context is supplied by a model of the subtasks constituting a task and their relationships to one another.

More persuasively it is argued that deaf children learning to sign receive a mixed input of ASL and a signed version of English.

'The presentative movement or why the ideal word order is V.S.O.P.', by Robert Hetzron (346-388). Hetzron's introductory argument goes as follows-. In a discourse no sentence is uttered in a vacuum. Not only are the preceding discourse and situation important in the conte'xt of an utterance, but also he notes that any given sentence may figure prominently in the background of subsequent sentences. When a sentence is constructed so that a certain component of it will be 'given a status of prominence in short-range memory, so that it will dominate the immediate sequel to that particular utterance' (347), the motivation for this promotion to prominence is called the 'presentative function*. In the derivat,ion of a sentence elements marked by the presentative function often end up in a sentence-final position.

Only in this way can one explain the many egregiods typographioal errors, inexcusable editorial changes, and glaring omissions of important materials that are t~ be noted in the book.

I gather also that these omitted tables contained reports of certain information-theoretic statistics such as H or H'. With much effort, a user of this book could construct the frequency distributions from the detailed tabulations, but it is still inexcusable for the printer to have omitted them. But the printer (or the publisher) is not to be blamed for everything. There are also problems with the manuscript, and the research that lay behind it. Questions must be raised about the purposes of the work, procedures, and the methods of analysis. 82 Purpose of the work. At the time the work was undertaken, probably in the early 19601s, it may have been correct to say, as the authors do, that all previous statistical analyses of language had been based on written or printed material. Nevertheless, one can think of exceptions: even the authors cite the study of eelephone speech by French, Carter and Koenig (Bell System Technical Journal, 1930, 9, 290-324), although this study has its limitations. Concurrently with the work reported in this book, a number of statisti'cal studies Q£ spoken language appeared.(e.g., D.

The exteesive comparative analysis of these texts in both their spoken (phonemic) and written (gra*emic) Bonn is also unique. Although one may disagree with the modes of analysis that Carterette and Jones chose to use, we have them to thank fbr making their corpus available fo'r' any other types of analysis that might be desirable or feasible. Are the authors correct, however, in saying they are studying differences between \"spoken language: and \"written language\"?

The authors do not really analyze, however, the ways in which unedited language differs from edited language, nor the ways in which speakers develop strategies of editing their speech.

It seemed to me, having done these computations, that they meant very little. I tabulated zero-order, first-order, and second-order sequential probabilities, esfLmates of information (H), and the like, but it seemed to me that all that was being shown was that - certain phonemes and combinations of phonemes were more frequent than others because of their appearance in words or sequences of words having the higher frequencies. people generate language, I reasoned, not by selecting phonemes but by selecting words and sequences of words; therefore, the frequencies of phonemes and their combinations were mere epiphenomena.
