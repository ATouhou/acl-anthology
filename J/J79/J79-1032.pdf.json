To program it, one describes not just syntax and some semantics, but also--independently--its modes of behavior. The PEDAGLOT formulation of such modes of behavior follows a categorization of parsing processes into attention-control, discovery, prediction and construction. Within these overall types of -activities, control can be specifled covering a number of syntax-processing and semantics-processing operations. While it is not the only possible way of programing a meta-parser, the PEDAGLOT mode-specification technique is suggestive in itself of various new approaches to modeling and understanding same language processing activities besides parsing, such as generation and inference, 7% is wotk was sponsored by through NIH Grant #RR643. It is well known that to process natural language, one needs both a syntactic description of possible sentences, blended in some way with a semantic description bf a certain domain of discourse, and a rather detailed description of the actual processes used in hearing or producing sentences. An augmented transition network (Woods, 1970) is qn example of the blending of syntactic and quasi-semantic descriptions, Here registers would be repositories of, or pointers to, semantics. When used in conjunction with a semantic nqtwork, an ATN can be used 60 parse or to generate (Simmons and Slocum, 1912) sentences. The issue of changing the des'cription of the actual processes used in such systems has been touched on by Woods (in using a 'generation modet), to some extent by Gimmons and Slo~um (usi~g decision functions to control style of generation), and to a larger extent by Kaplari (19751, in his General Syntactic Procdssor, GSP. GSP indeed is one example of a system in which syntax, semantics and to some extent processes can each be usefully defined. If we look at syntax, semantics and processes as three describable components, these systems just mentioned illustrate how thoroughly intertwined they can become-- to the extent that theorists from time to time deny the existence or at least the importance of some one of them. Ignoring that dispute, I would- like to concentrate on the question of being able to comprehensively describe one's theory of language in terms of its syntax, semantics and processes in a way that allows for their necessary and extensive intertwining connections, but at the sane time allows one to describe them independently.

The Dog The general flow of the parser is from top-down, and as the lowest components (symbols in the string) are found, the post-recognition functions that are associated with the rule that recognized them are applied. Tags become associated with sub-parses when the post-recognition operation uses the form [x = y] (in which the value referenced by y is stored as the x tag of the sub-parse). In the example, [DET] and [N] recognize 'The Manf and 'Manf is used as the REF attribute ofi the first NP. In the second S rule, the operation of [SUM = [REF NP']] would be to retrieve the REF tag of the second NP (thus the prime), and to store that as the SUM tag of the final pane. As in most top-down parses, this parser begins with S and its two rules, since S is non-terminal. S is expanded into the two sequences of matches it should perform. This expansion results in various (in this case, two) predictisns of what to find next, When the initial symbol in some rule is a terminal or a predicate, a discovery is called for (in which a match is pexformed, possibly involving the known values of the tags).

Currently, this system has approximately a dozen toodesr and I will present some of them here. Each mode specifies how to handle a certain part of the parsing process. They can be classified into four categories: attention control, prediction, discovery and construction. a, Attention Control Wes: Since the parser operates on a chart of independent events ('parsing questions1), one must give the parser a method of sequencing through them. Thus, one may specify 'breadth-first1 or 'depth-first1 and the appropriate ~echanism will be invoked {this merely involves the way the processor stacks its jobs). A 'best-first"]},{"title":"' option","paragraphs":["is -under development, which, when given an evaluation function to be applied to the set of currently active partial parses, allows the system to operate on the 'best1 problem next, Experi-Bents with this mode have so far been inconclusive. One also can specify when to stop (i.e., at the first complete parse, or to wait until all other ambiguous parses have been discovered). The dis-it~gbiguation routine (which is described as a part of the construction modes) defines which parse is %estl, Further, one may specify a left-to-right or right-to-left mode of how to progress along the string. b. Discovery Modes: The starting point of building a relaxation parser is to specify what to do when an exact match is not made. If the parser is expecting one word and finds another it can look arowd the indicated place in the string to find what- it is looking for, or it can in certain other circumstances simply insert the expected word into t'he string. Thus, under discovery.modes, there are vaxious options: either the parser is allowed to attempt matches in out-of-sequence parts of the string, or nat, And if not, or if no such match is found, the parser may or may not be allowed to make an insertion. So in PEDAGLOT, there is an INSERT mode (and various restricted versions of ft) and a 'where to look1 mode which is used to control the degree to which the parser can try to find out-of-place matches, There are tags associated with-these two specifications, the INSERT tag and the OMIT tag, which are associated with the parses involving insertions and omissions tbat contain the number of insertions made and the number of input symbols omitted in building the parse. There is also a rearrangenient mode. mus, given certain constraints, the parser could be givep 'The Bites Man Dogt and produce a parse for *The Man Bites the Dogt since it would have found 'Man,' by temporarily omitting 'Bites,' but then it looks for and finds 'Bitest and finally, finding no second lthe,fthe,l inserts one [or some other determiner because of the [DET] function]) and finds 'Dog. In a similar way it would try to produce a passive form [i.e., the Man Is Bitten By the Dog) but since this involves more insertions, etc. it would not be chosen. These heuristics are controlled by recording numerical summary tags with each sub-parse that participate in, and are judged1 by the disambiguatic;~~ routines. Similar ideas are used by Lyon (1974). c. Prediction Modes: As Woods (1975) has pointed out, the extent to which a parser's prediction increases efficiency varies with the quality of the expected input. This fact affects greatly our discavBry procedures, since, if insertions are to be made, one aught to be rather sum of one's p~edictions, or risk a combinatorial explosion. In PEDAGLOT, there is a programmable choice"]},{"title":"'","paragraphs":["function that- controls predlctions. Specifically, when the parser encounters a non-terminal symbol, that symbol is the left-hand side of various rules. An uncontrolled pkediction (used by a canonical top-down parser) is to select each such rule as the expansion. Intuitively, however, people do not seem to do this. In-stead, as in an A'I??, they try one and only if that fails, go Into the next. In PEDAGLOT, the choice of which rule to try can be defined as the result of the call to a 'choosef function (or it can be left uncontrolled] , We have des&ned various approaches to such predictions (e.g., a limited key-word scan of the incoming string, and the use of 'language statistics such as the set of rules which can generate the next symbol in the string as their left most symbol). The prediction is currently made once for any given choice point; its outcomes are expected to be an ordered set of rules to try next. d"]},{"title":". Construct ion Modes","paragraphs":[": The phase of parsing in which the parts of the parse tree and associated tag values are formed,"]},{"title":"is","paragraphs":["a place where most of the non-syntactic information (tags] about the string being parsed can come into play. In the first place, new tags can be formed as functions of lower level parse tags tbough a process called melding, Thus, 'nonsense1 can be discovered d pronoun references can sometimes be tied down, In the second place, it is a result of construction that ambiguity is discovered and dealt with, Since these features of parsing deal primarily with semantics (and since, if anyrcthere, sttsntantic representations of the string reside in the tags), most of tb PEDAGLOT construction modes involve tags. One play explicitly meld tag values by using post-recognition operators, or one nay define an 'implicit' melding routine that is associated with the tag names themselves instead of with individual rules. In our example we use this device to implicitly form a simple list of the two REF tags that become associated with the S rule. This implicit melding operation can also include a blocking function, or some reference to a data base. The tags that contain INSERT and OMIT information are used in this way to keep running totals of, and to minimize the munber of such heuristics in the relaxation parsing modes. One may also associate a LIFT function which, when the partial parse becomes complete, specifies a transformation of that tag to be used as The tag of the next higher level parse. Ambiguity is discovered when two parses from the same symbol, cbvering the same string segment axe found. For this case, an AMBIG function is associated with tag names, and it makes a 'value judgement1 of which tag is 'better, hence which interpretation to use. (Other types of criteria can also come into play here such as user interaction, (cf. Kay, 1973). 3. The Uses of Meta-Parsers I ha-re just catalogued some of the parsing modes available in PEDAGLOT. Others, such as Bottom-Up (instead of Top-Down) or Inside-Out (instead of Left-to-Right, etc.), are envisionedlbut not implemented. Since PEDAGLOT is an interactive program, the user can change modes at will, just as he can change syntax or introduce new tags, Thus, the obvious first use af meta-parsers is that one may use them to desisn language processors without having to tie oneself down from the start to say, a depth-first parser, Meta-parsers also have a certain amount of tractibility that parsers that blend all .activities into one huge network may not. Ono may sea at a rather high level what is going to be happening (i.e,, all tags of a certain name will meld together in a certain way, unless the grammar specifies otherwise), If one, however, wants certain foms of local behavior, one may use predicates or functions on individuaQ rules.

This paper describes a system which can play TIC-TAC-TOE, and discuss the game while it is in progress. If the system encounters new words, new expressions, or inadvertent ungrammaticalities, it attempts to understand what was meant, through contextual inference, and by asking ihteliigent clarifying questions of the user. The system then records the meaning of any ne9 words or expressions, thus augmenting its 1inguist;lic knowledge in the course of user interaction, A number of systems tire being developed which communicate with users in a natural language such as English. The ultimate purpose of such systems is to provide easy computer access to a technically Onsophisticated pepon. When such a person interacts with a natural language systemr, however, he is quite likely to use words and expressions which were not anticipated. To provide truly natural interaction, the system should be able to respond intelligently when this happens. Most current systems, such as those of Winograd","paragraphs":["[lo] and Woods"]},{"title":"Ill], are not designed to ;ope with such \"liiguistic input uncertainty.\" Their parsers fail completely if an input sentence does not use a specific, built-in syntax and vocabulary. At the other extreme, systems like ELIZB [93 and PARRY [Z] allow the user to type anything, but make no attempt to fully understand the sentence. The present work explores the tnlddle ground between these extremes: developing a sys.t;em which has a great deal of knowledge about a particular subject area, and which can use this knowledge to make language interaction a flexible, adaptive, learning medium. In pursuing this goal, the present work is most closely related to work being dona in the various speech recognition efforts [5, 7, 8, 121 which ara studying how linguistic and semantic constraints can help deal with the ACOUSTIC error and uncertainty of speech. The adaptive system, however, is designed to deal with a much mors LINGUISTIC type of uncertainty. When people use unfamiliar words or expressions in conversation, we can usually deduce from context what is meant, and if not, we can at least ask intelligent clarifying qu~stions. To allow the machine to do the same, there must be a very flexible interaction of syntax and $emantics in the parsing/understanding process, There must be a different parser organization, and a more flexible use oP","paragraphs":["linguistic and semantic constraints, than is pfesen t in current natural language sys tern"]},{"title":".

It has a (currently limited) set of semantic concepts, and attempts to interpret the user's sentences ih terms of these. The set of semantic concepts is FIXED. The system does not attempt to learn new concepts, merely new ways of describing concepts that are already familiar.","When the system encounters a new word or a new phrasing, it uses contextual information to detername the possible meaning, and to ask clarifying questions which are as intelligent as possible.

(Thus concepts like Vhe 'northeast1 square\" or \"the 'topmost' squarew would ba confusing and not correctly understood.) The present simple system has been developed with two goals in mind: (1) to explore the techniques required to achieve adaptive behavior, and (2) to help fornulate the issues which will have to be faced when incorporating these techniques into a much broader natural language system. 3. OVERVIEW Fig. 1 shows ths various stages that the Adaptive System gees through in understanding a sentence. In this sectian, we shall watch while the system processes the sentence \"Mow came you placed an x in the top right ~quare.~","paragraphs":["( 1) Local Syntactic Processing: In this first stage, the system scans the entire sentence looking for local constituents.

In this instance, the system Finds the two NPs, \"youe and \"an xm, the PP \"in the top right squarem, and the VG nplacedw. (2) Semantic Clustering: At this stage, the clause-level processing starts. Unlike most systems, this clause-level processing is driven by SEMANTIC rslationshigs, rath-er than by syntactic form. It uses a semantics-first kclustssinsg*, with a sscondary use of syntax for cormnents and confirmation+ In this example, all the local constituents found can be clustered into s description of e single concept: that of making a nave, Section 4 describes the mechanics of this stage in more detail.

Therefore the system asks if \"How come someone does somethingw means Vhy does someone do somethingn. The user answers \"yesn, so the system stores this new way of asking \"whyn, and proceeds to answer the question. 4. SEMANTICS-FIRST CLAUSE-LEVEL PROCESSING One of the major differences between this approach to parsing and that of a top-down, syntax-driven system (such as Moods' or Winograd's) is the order in which syntactic and semantic processing is done","paragraphs":["at the clause level.","In a top-dom system, a sentence must exactly match the built-in syntax before semantics can even be called and given the various constituents of a clause, This IS clearly undesirable when one is dealing with input uncertainty, since one cannot be sure exactly how the"]},{"title":"user will phrase his sentence. One would prefer to Bet semantics opera%@ First on any local consituents present, so that it can make a reasonable grgss as to what is being discussed. As semantically-rslated clusters of local constf tuents are found, syntax can be consulted and asked to comment. on the rslative grmmaticality of the various clusters. If there are two competing semantlc inte~pretations of one part of a sentence, and syntax likes one much better than the other, then the \"syntactically pleasing\" interpretation can be pursued first.

The listener must try to relate the words he Rears to his own set of concepts. Language has, presumably, evolved to facilitate this sort of interaction. Therefore it is reasonable to expect that a good deal of the structure of language is in some sense set up to assist in this adaptive process.

At the applications level, the prwram will give a natural ccmmunications interface facility to users of existing interactive data management systems. At the theoretical level, our work shows that the useful infoxmation in a natural-language expression (its \"meaning\") can be obtained by an algorithm that uses no formal description of synt-.

A prototype is currently implemented in LTSP 1.5 on tho IBM 370/145 computsr at System Development Corporation. In a recent article in Scientific, American, Dr. Alphonse Chapanis says, \"Tf truly interactive computer (;ystm are ever to be created, they will ~omehow have to cope with the... errors and violations of format that are the rule rather than the exception in normal human ccmmunication\" [1]"]},{"title":".

In effect, users are required to interact with these system in sme formal language, or at least in a language that has a formal representation in the computer system that a user's expression must conform to (we are thinking, in the latter instance, of Vhampsonls REL, which has an extensible formal representation facility). In addition, most natural-language question-answering systems, including all referenced above, require that a user's data be restruct-wedl and reorganized acwraing to the particular data base requirements of the natural-language system to be used. At the level of artificial intelligence research [ti ,6 ,?'I"]},{"title":", Mere is same interest in systems that","paragraphs":["recognize meaning in natural-language expressions by methods that dd not mire compiler-like syntactic analysi~ of an expression prior to asmantic interpretation. We believe it is possible, practical, and feasible, using new lingufstic processing strategies, to design a natural-language interface system that will permit flexible, intuitive coaansmicatiba with information management systems and other computer programs already in existence. This interface is open-ended in that it has no prejudice about the user's system funckians and can be joined to almost any such system with relatively little effort. It is, in addition, able to infer the meaning of free-form English expressions, as they pertain to the host system, without requiring any formal description or representation of English. THE SEMANTIC INTEREACE ALTERNATIVE The syntactic inflexibiiity of existing natural-language processors limits their usefulness in interactive man-madine tasks. Our approach does not use a collection of syntax rules or equations as they are normally defined. Instead, we construct a dictionary in which we define words in terms of their possible meanings with respect to the particular data base and data management system (DMS) we want to use and according to the possible relations that can exist between data-base and I3MS elements (e.g., an averaging function on a group CKE numbers) in the limited \"micro-world\" of this precisely organized data collection. Words appearing in a user's expression that are not explicitly defined are ignored by the system in processing the expression; an example would be the word \"the,\" which is usually not meaningful in a data management environment. Wa thus avoid the expressive rigidity that formal syntactic methods hposa on tha user and the excesaivcs time and resource consumption that results from the catibinatorial explosions usually produced by such rnethade. We distinguish in their definitions beween two types of words: content words md function worb (or \"operatore\"). Content words are wads whoae 'meaningsw are the objects, events, and concepts that make up the subjects being referred to by users, More precisely, for data axetnagernent systems, these meanings (or \"concepts\") are the field names and entz'y identifiers for *e data b-e and the names for available IHS operations such as averaging, sdng, sorting, comparing, etc. Function words serve as connectors of content words. Their use in natural language is to indicate khe manner in which neighboring conltent words ar'e intended to relate to one another. In the example \"the salary of the secretary"]},{"title":",\" used belaw, \"salary\" and \"secretary,\" are","paragraphs":["content words, and \"of\" is a function word used to connect theta. Many cmntent wor& are context sensitive, In a particular data base, for btmcm, the ward \"salary\" may refer to the data-base field name SECSAL if the saXW frs \"of a secretary,\" but may also indicate the field name CLKSAL if it is a *salary of a clerk.\" In recpgnition of this we therefore define eaah aontent word by a set of one or more pairs of the form ((XI Yl) (X2 Y2)"]},{"title":". . .

Two content warm are consrid=& to bls artmantically related if the intersection of the Xi'a fmtn the definition of one wort! with the Yi's from the definition of U1Q other ira not empty. To get a more intuitive understanding of this process, suppose, again, that a data base contains entries for both secretaries and clerks with salaries fox each. Suppose \"Suzi&' is an instance of a secretary and om\" is an instance of a clerk. We then have three words defined as follms: Suzie ( (SUZIE SECY) ) Torn ( (TOM C-LK) ) Salary ( ( sECY SECSAL) (CLK CLKSAL) ) Processing"]},{"title":"me phrase","paragraphs":["\"Suzie"]},{"title":"' s salary\" would","paragraphs":["intersect the Yi (\" (SECY) \" ) from the definition of \"Suzie\" with the Xi's (\"SECY\" and \"CLK\") from the definition of \"salary.\" The intersection is nan-empty (\"(SECY)\")"]},{"title":", and,","paragraphs":["in discovering the semantic relationship the sense \"SECSALI-' is assigned to the word \"salary.\" Similarly, \"Tan's salary\" assigns the sense \"CLKSAL\" to \"salary. !I A particular bplmentation of the natural-language interface processor operates for a particular DMS/data-base target system. It contains a particular &&ion- created for that target system.

In the analysis of a particular input by our system, two words in context are te~ted using the \"intersection\" method described abave and, if they are found to be semantically related, they are considered candidates for \"connection\" as descrrLbed below. Two words so connected £om a phrase. Function words are defined as operators or processors that perform this semantic test. The definition of one function word differs fm that of another according to its slope (see belaw) and also in that the operational definition of a function word can reject a connection even though the two words may be samntically related. In the operational definition of the function word may be a list of acceptable concepts or a rejection list of unacceptable concepts. In most conceivable data bases, the phrase \"salary in the secretary\" would be thus rejected by the function word \"in. n As the analysis of an input expression proceeds, a \"clumpifig\" of word and phr as e meanings more and more explicitly normally, processing of the entire sentence results in a tree structure made up of the connected senses of all the content words fran the sentence. This result we term the sentence qraph even though the input expression may not be a grammatically cmplete sentence. This sentence graph will be translated into statement. We recognize that the linear ordering of the words in an input expression is not entirely randm and that certain aspects of"]},{"title":"me","paragraphs":["function of syntax must be taken into accorunt. This is done by means of a new and pwerful azgorithm bkd on what we call the syntactic-semantic slope. Linguists generally recognize that whenever two units of meaning are combined, one is semantically domfnant and the other subordinate, as a modifier is subordinate to the modified word.

The slope is positive eir negative as the dominating sub-unit is, respectively, to the right or to the left of the subordinate sub-unit. For example, the phrase \"red herring\" makes a positive slope, thus: HERRING"]},{"title":"/ RED","paragraphs":["and \"the salary of the secre=\" makes a negative slope: S;71LARY Thus, the ~pera~onal meanings of fqnctian words operate on the meanings of nearby content words.

Between any two adjacent content words there is an implicit \"empty\" operator that is a positive operator, as in \"red herring\": RED In general, all prepositions are defined as negative operators. This is equivalent Go the rule used by syntactic processors. The positive empty operator is equivalent to the rule NP+AxxrP3P and athew, while vexbe and conjunctions are defined as peak operators, giving our atatemcnt of rules such errs s+NPvE'NP MP + NP CONJ NP. Each operator has the facility to accept or reject any semantic rejlation accordin9 to the precise definition of the function word for the host data management system. Progressive connection of word meanings and previously connected groups or \"phrase meanings\" results in a tree graph that we call the sentence qraph. For example, the question \"What is ;t;he surface displacement of US. diesel submarines?\" could, for a particular data base, produce from the dictionary a string of content-word and funeion-word definitions that might be represented typographically like this: ( (SUB SURE-DISC) ) <OF> ( (U"]},{"title":". S.

DIESEL Even though this tree, or sentence graph, is created as a result of semantic relationships instead of Eonnal rules of grammar, it still. closely resembles the \"parse tree\" produced by mo~t conventional syntactic language processors. With respect to the user's target data management system, the sentence graph is preci~e and unambiguous and contains enough information for a straightforward translation into the formal query language of the EMS. In SDCrs DS/3 lanwage, for example, the above question would be expressed as PRINT SURF-DISP WHERE TYPE EQ DIESEL AND lXXl EQ U.S. The response to the usex's question will thus be the response frclrn his DMS to the formal query statement. The user's input in this hypothetical example is proper in fom and grammar. However, it need not have been. The request OBTAIN SURFACE DISP FOR US SUBS SUCH AS HAS TYPE EQ DIE=. would produce exactly the same sentence graph and thexefore, exactly the same foml query statement with the same response from the DMS. It is not likely that a syntax-based parser would have anticipated the odd laxxguage-use and grammar of this last request. Without a syntax rule that would alluw for the phrase \"such as has\" such a parser would not look at the semantics involved and would be unable to interpret the request. Our syntax algorithm gets the same results that would be expected fmm the application of syntax rules without the need to anticipate each grammatical construct expected from the user. In overview, the parsing algorithm makes a series of positive, negative, and peak connections based on the operational meanings of the function wards (including the \"empty\" aperator) and on the relations between meanings of the content wort%?. The algoridt-Xlm adheres to the following rules: e 1 Connections between content words are possible only if the result of the intez'sectfon test described &me is non-empty and if this result is not rejected by the operation of the function word perfodng the test.

The sense of \"salary\" is the Yi associated with \"SECY\" in the definition of \"salary,\" hence, \"SECSAL.\" This selection process is reversed for negative aperators, while peak operators employ both kinds of tests, one on each side of the peak. Rule 2: No node in a sentence graph may have more .than one dominating node. That is to say, all connections must result in trees, This Is a canmon asswnptLon consistent with conventional syntax-driven parsers. Rule 3: Given a subtree, a constituent on its left has the possibility of conneation only to nodes of the subtree's positive adjacent slope, and a constituent on the right can connect onLy to the nodes in the adjacent negative slope. Intuitively, this means that if the nodes of a subtree are connected by \"lines\" that are \"opaque bariersrn then a constituent on either side of the subtree may connect to it only on those nodes that it can rlsee.r' It may not connect to nodes on the \"inside\" or the \"fax side\" of the subtree. This is a powerful heuristic rule that eliminates the need to try connections to many syntactically impossible portions of the subtree. In effect this one rule, together with the definitions of the function words, replaces all the syntax rules used by most conventional parsers. Rule 4: In order to minimize disconnection of existing subtree structures (badcup) and still consider all possible connections, the system should, whenever possible, constrztct,subtrees starting from the top and make new connections from belaw. This rule leads to the following algorithm: Scan the consUtuents from left to right making negative connections, then scan from right to left making positive connections. Scan thus back and forth until no more connections can be made. Then make any poasible peak aonnec-tions and repeat the algorithm. Continue this process until all constituents have been connected into a single tree, We have observed that if ambiguities exist under these conditions, they will be semantic and, in all probability. not resolvable by any further processing or analysis of the expression. Therefore. there is no need to carry along temporary multiple construction possibilities, The algorithm may eirher query the user at this point for disambiguation or Wdwt the pxocesging and inf om reason, I.
