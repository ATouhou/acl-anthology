Thus, if the sentence adds to the topicon a referent labelled assert the %Puw--' illocutionary act is one of assertion; the 'misfiring' of an illocutionary act, as when a sentence syntactically in declarative form fails -t:o make an assertion because one of its definite descriptions fails to refer, corresponds to failure to create an assert referent in the hearer's topicon.
