INTRODUCTION The lexicon presented here is being developed as an integral part of a computer question-answering system which answers multiple-choice questians about simple children's stories, It thus must make information readily available for the parsing process, for building an internal nodel OF the story being read, and for making inferences. Knovledge nbout words and knowledge about the world must both be stored in a compact but mediately accessible form. Many decisions must be made, therefore, about the design of the lexicon. The first problem is to decide on an organizing structure, Should Lexical and \"encycloped~c\" information be stored separately or together? Which ltems will have separate lexik3l entries? Which will be included in other entries? What about homonymy and polysemy? What connecting links between words and word senses will be recorded and how? The next problem is to determine a characterization of word meanings. This leads to some deep theoretrcal questrohs What kind of lexical semantic representations are appropriate? What is the structure ot these represefitations? What are the semantic primes, the elements of that structure? The design of the lexical entry is thus subject to theoretical biases as well as the practicas constrajnts of space, retrfeval effkiency, and effective support of rnference-making. The decision to use lexical relations as fundamental elements of the struclture of the lexicon has strongly influenced our design. Relations are wed to encode both semantic and syntactic information, Axiom schemes essential to inferencing are associated with each relation. Relati-1 informatgon makes up.a signifkant part of,the lexical entry, Lexical relations offer significant advantages. They aS.Low us to generalize familiar gnference patterns into axiom schemes. They can encapsulate the defining formulae of the commercial dictidnary. They have an iritwitive appeal which we believe reflects a certain measure of psychological reality. On a practical level they allbw~tls to express both syntactic and semantic informa-tion in a form that is compact and eaay to retrieve. They can be used in many ways. For example, the following paragraph from a test administered to first and second graders-by"]},{"title":", local school system says: (Pl) Ted has a puppy. His name is Happy. Ted and Happy like to play. (Ql) The pet is a: dog boy toy In order to answer this question we need to know what p& means.
