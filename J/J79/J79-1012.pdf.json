Subsequent work (Gardner G Cardner, 1971; I'remack, 1971) demonstrated that colr.munication could be achieved Ey means of visual signs or symbols. Yerkish is a visual language with a lexicon of gsaplric word symbols (lexigrams), each of whicl;l is a combination of discrete recursive-design elements. Each lexigram is represented on one of 125 keys of a keyboard, Sentences are formed by pressing keys in successive order. Sentence length, at present, is limited to seven lexigrams.

Thue Yerkish Lexigrams The original constraints under which the Yerkish language was to be designed were eskentially three. 1) Drawing on the experience of the Cardners (1969, 1971) and Premack (1971), Yerkish had to be a visual language with a lexicon of unitary word-symbols that could be represented singly on the keys of a keyboard. 2) Both lexical items and sentence structure were to be as univocal as possible, because this, on the one hand, would facilitate the automatic parsing of input and, on the other, it was expected to make acquisition of the lariguage easier for our subjects. 3) The structure of Yerkish was to be close enough to English 'to allow word-by-word translation, in order to make participation in communication- events, as well as their evaluation, maximally accessiblk to technicians and observers. For a few weelcs at the very-outset of the enterprise, the author revelled in dreams of an ideal language in which each word was. to be composed of semantically significant pleremes (Hockett, 1961). here"]},{"title":"were","paragraphs":["to"]},{"title":"be","paragraphs":["individual design elements designating the more important recurrent semantic categories, and each concept available in the ~erkish universe of discourse was to be represented by a lexigram (i,e. the visualfgraphic caunterparts"]},{"title":"to","paragraphs":["words"]},{"title":"in","paragraphs":["spoken languages) composed of design elements &ich, in their own right, would designate the major semantic categories to which the concept belonged.

The reason for doing this was, of course, that such a language would have been an invaluable instrument for testing our subject's c'lassificatory skill and processes of concept formation. The dream was soon shattered by fiechn.ica1 res tr.ictions. The feedback projectors above the keyboard had to be such that each one of them could display every lexigsam of the language. Within our budget, this could be achieved only if all lexigrams were designed in such a way that they could be generated by combining design elements of,a common set limited to twelve. Vnder these circumstances it was obviously impossible to maintain the individual design elements semantically constant and a drastic compromise had to be made. By choosing nine graphic elements that could be readi-Ly superimpos-ed, one over the other, and thre6 basic colours, a little additional flexibility was gained (see Table"]},{"title":"1.).","paragraphs":["By \"mixing1' 'the three basic colours we could generate seven discriminable hues.

The main difference between the two, though basically simple, has perhaps not been made sufficiently explicit. An ordinary gfammar is expected to account for all grammatical sentences of the language in a mare or less axiomatic way, i.e. by demonstrating that every possible grammatical sentence is a case under a formally stated rule or set of rules. An interpretive grammar, on the other hand, is not concerned with demonstrating the grammaticality of any sentence, but with transfoming the contept of a given piece of language into a canonical fbrh composed of pre-established semantic elements or modules, It is a \"gr;immarl! in the sense that it consists of rules that govern this transformation, but these rules describe the language only indirectly, since what they actually describe is a model of the language user in the receiving role. (Mote that by \"model\", in"]},{"title":"-- ---","paragraphs":["this context, we intend a processor which, given the same input, will yield the same output as the processor to be modelled, regardless of the means"]},{"title":"it","paragraphs":["employs to do so. ) An interpretive system of this kind, thus, presupposes the grammaticality of its input. But since it is designed to interpret all grammatical pieces of language, it can be used to define","f f operationally as grammatical\" any input that it can interpret, while","11 input that it cannot interpret can be considered ungrammatical\". When designing a correlational grammar for a natural language, it i5 a truly enornous problem to bring the gramarrs interpretive capability anywhere near the interpretive capability of the native user of the language. In the case of an artificial language, hailever, this problem is altogether eliminated, because the lexicon, the rules of concatenation, and the interpretive grammar can be designed all at the same titre. Since there is no native user, who has a universe of experiential content and well-established semantic connections (by means of which this content is linked to linguistic expressions), the designer is free to tailor the lexicon, as well as the syntax of his language, to the universe of discourse he envisages. That is, to a large extent, how Yerkish was designed, expecially with regard to the rules of grammar. The result of it is that the user of Yerkish can communicate in grammatically correct-lexigram strings no more than the correlational grammar of Yerkish can interpret.

Though there were, especially at the beginning, not very mgny things that Lana could \"say'' in Yerkish, she has never tired of saying them. On the practical side, since the interpretive grarmnar was to be implemented in a functioning parser, the universe of discourse was strictly limited by the size of the computer that could be obtained within the budget of the project.

Thus it was essential that the implemented grammar should never occupy all of the available space within the comp'uter. This is"]},{"title":"smll","paragraphs":["the case and we hope to be able to maintain this flexibility for some time to come. Technical Cons txaints There are four ways in which the Yerkish universe of discourse is restricted. First, there is the nunber of lexical Items the system can handle. The present version of the llultistore parser can deal with a maximum of 250 Lexigrams. The interface that links the con-.puter to the keyboard in the experimental chamber is designed for half that number, i.e. for 125. The-keyboard, however, is divided into five panels of 25 keys each and these panels are readily exchafigeable. This means that the subject's vocabulary can, in fact, be extended to 250 items, but only a subset of these, namely 125, will be operative during any one session. (Since Lana at present uses a total of 100 lexigrams, there is still much room for vocabulary expansion.), The second restriction also concerns the vocabulary of lexigrams, but it springs from the grammar of Yerkish and does not limit the number of individual lexigrarns but rather the number of conceptual classes to which lexigrams have to be assigned. Because of its interpretive function, correlational grammar requires a classification of lexical items that differs considerably from the word-classification used by txadi tional dcscr iptive gramars. Lexigrams"]},{"title":", in fact, are classified according","paragraphs":["to certain functional characteristics of the concepts thev designate,"]},{"title":"i. e.,","paragraphs":["according to cognitive characteristics. The lexicon"]},{"title":"with","paragraphs":["which a correlational gramnar operates, therefore,"]},{"title":"is divided,","paragraphs":["not into a few generic and largely rnorphological~y defined classes such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc."]},{"title":", but into a","paragraphs":["much larger number of classes defined in terms of what the designated items can do, i.e,"]},{"title":",","paragraphs":["by the role or roles they play in the cognitive representation of"]},{"title":"experiential situations. In","paragraphs":["the case of \"things1'- this"]},{"title":"is,","paragraphs":["for instance, the kinds of activity which they can perform as actors and the kinds of activity in which they can play the part of patient; and in the case"]},{"title":"of","paragraphs":["\"activities\" it is, for instance, the kinds of change they bring about. In the implementation of the interpretive system, i.e. the parser, it id the characterization of the lexical classes that occupies considerable space, not the individual lexical items. The total number of classes, therefore, has to be decided - a priori. In the present Yerkish parser, the maximum number of lexigram classes is 46. At the time of rkiting, 35 of these classes have been filled (see Table 3). The remaining 11 are still empty, but they can be made operative at any moment by the simple insertion of new lexigrams and the definition of the functional properties uf the items they designate, The third restriction concerns the number of lexigrams that can be strung together to form one message. The amount of data the parser has to take into account during the processing of a given message, obviously, depends to some extent on the number of lexical items of which the message is composed. This dimension corresponds to sentence length in natural languages.
