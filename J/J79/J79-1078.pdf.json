In this format, developed by the LNR research group at The University of California at San Diego, verbs arg represented as interconnected sets of subpredicates. these subpredicates may be thought of as the almost inevitable inferences that a listener makes when a verb is used In a sentence. They confer a meaning structure on the sentence in which the verb is used. To be psychologically valid, thege representations should capture (at least)","1 Similarity of meaning The more similar two verbs seem in meaning to people, the more their representations should overlap,","2 ConfusabUity The more confusable two verb meanings are, the more their representations should overlap.","3. Memory for sentences cantainlng the verb ?he sentence structures set up by the verb's meaning should in part determine the way in which sentences are remembered.","4. Semantic integration The representations should allow for the integration of information from different sentences into discourse structure","5 Acquisition patterns lhe structural partitions in the representations should correspond to the structures children acquire when they are learning the meanings of the verbs","6. Patterns of extension The representations should be extendible so as to reflect the ways in which people interpret verb meanings when the verbs are used outside their normal context,","7. Reaction times The time taken to comprehend a sentence using a given verb should reflect the structural complexity of the verb meaning.","Experiments concerned with predictions 1-5 are described here. The results are promising for a general approaoh of representation of meaning in terms of interrelated subpredicates, but do not clearly distinguish between several similar representations. For example, to test prediction (21, I read people senten~es containing verbs with similar meanings, and asked them to recall the sentences. The deb, =e of overlap in the semantic structures was a good predictor of the number of confusions between sentences. In another sentence-memory experiment (prediction (3)), semantically compl& verbs that provided more underlying interconnections bqtween the nouns in a sentence lea to better memory for the nouns in the sentence than simple genere verbs, or than other complex verbs that did not provide such extra interconnections, To test prediction (5), I tested children's oomprehension of a set of possession verbs. Both the order of acquisition among the verbs and the kinds of errors fitted well wsth an account of the acquisition of verb meaning in terms of interconnected subpredicates.","This research Illustrates a breadth-first approach to testing a representation. In the breadth-first approach, many different psychological predictions are made. Each different area of prediction requires a set of' proceus gsaumptions, and in each case the process assumptions used are those that seem most plausible given previous research in the field. If one representational format can make correct predictions about a number of diffe~ent kinds of paychological phenomena, then that representation stands a greater chance of being generally useful than one which was tested in only one depth-first way.","This paper describes a progrm of research that bests a representational format for verb meaning. This reseacoh grew out of the LNR (Footnote 1) attempt fa the represent the meanings of wdrds in a psychologically satisfying way. Verb meaning seemed a natural place to start for tw~ reasons: (1 ) verbs are important: it is arguable Chat\" they provide the central brganizing semantic stryctu~es in sentence meanings; and (21 verbs are tractable: their meanings are more easily analyzed than tho- of, for example, common nOURs.","Since different disciplines look af! meaning in different ways, it may be w~rthwhile to describe the stance we took, What we wanted was a system of repmsentation in which we could capture our intuitions about what a word typically conveys; or more specifiqally ab6ut the inferences a person normally makes (or believes should be m e)"]},{"title":"\"f:","paragraphs":["when a word is used. The assumption is t at the same representations operate when a person uses the word in speech as when the person comprehends it; however the methodology of experiments). psychology makes it naturql to spend more time pondering the input process than the output process. This approach differs from thinking of meaning in terms of necessary and sufficient truth-conditions, as many phibsophers have done, or from thinking about meaning in generation rather than in comprehension, as many linguists have done. Each of those stances leads to useful intuitions.

The basic notions'of state, change of state, bauae, and so on must be combinable into networks larger than the individual sentence. When two verbs share parts of their underlying structure. this redundanpy should be utilized to comhane the two representations into one diacobrse structure. How can we test whether this happens? One way is to arrange things so that collapsing the redundencies between two verbs should create the representation of a third verb. Then the prediction is that people should usathis third verb in recall.","In a study of semantic integration, I read people short passages and tested their memory by having them fill in blanks (Gentner, 1978).

This view has been fairly well supported by the research presented here, but nevertheless it seems to me an 'oversimplification. There remain a great many questions, some large and some small. (1) Where should the line be drawn around a word's meaning? As Clark and Clark (1977) have put it, is word meaning more like a dictionary or an encyclopedia? The extreme of the dictionary approach would be to take a minimal contrast approach, storing with a word only enough to distingash 4t from all other words. Tmhe extreme of the encyclopedia approach would be to access the entire long-term memory whenewer any word is used. The question is, how to define a reasonable middle ground. (2) What $a the process of expansion into a semantic representation during comprehension?","a) Are there invariable inferences?. When","an incoming wo~d is processed, is there","a set of inferences (auch as the set I","have called the walmost-inevitable","inferencesn that is always made duri.ng","comprehension, or ig there variation in","which inferences get made?","b) If there is variation, is it quantitative or qualitative?

The notion of at least quantitative","variation a seems haFd to avoid. It is a","fairly strong intuition that we process word","meanings with varying degrees of energy","Further, the phenomenon of instantiation","(Anderson, R,C., Stevens, K.C., Shifrin, Z., &","morn, J."]},{"title":", 1977","paragraphs":[") makes it clear that a model of sentence comprehension must allow for qualitative differences in the final set of inferences stored. For example, compare the sentences Rover ate his dinner,","Mr. Pritchwd ate his dinner, T%e verb P;Bf; conveys vaetly different action sequences when used with different qents"]},{"title":",","paragraphs":["though its causal change-of-state structure remains more-or-less constant. It is possible that this qualitative variation can be accounted for by simpZe underlying quantitative processes spreading activation. We may have to settle for a more complex model, in which some parts of a verb's meaning are almost always accessed while other inferences dcvelop out of the interaction of the verb with its context, including its pragmatic context. Id Hewittts (197b) terms, there may be both if-added inferences and if-needed inferences. Where in this model (and whether) we want to draw a line bet~een meaning and knowledge-of-the-world is not at all clear to me, (3) Carrying the noticul of variable yerb meanbng sti&l further, how does metaphorical extension wark? Most common verbs can be used in several related ways. For example, consider the range bf meanings that nlv_e can convey depending on the nbuns it is used with a rose a job. an heir.","Ida gave Sam an excuse a talking to. all his best ideas, the time of his life. Clearly the subpredicate structure varres aoross thew sentences, so much so that some might want to describe this as a wllection of entirely different aenises of the same word. This misses the structural similarities. Some kind -of metaphorical extension of meaning seems a necessary pert of a theory of verb meaning, since it is generally the verb that does most of the adjwting. A series of studies by Albert Stevens and me suggest8 that people faced with an odd aentence assume that some of the subpredicates normally conveyed by the verb are not meant to apply in the sentence at hand A current projeot ia to moW the rules for which subprediodtes apply in different contexts. 4 X have so far treated nouns as nodes in the semantic representation. Clearly in order to analyze sentedce interactions it is necessary to have a representation of noun meaning. Some progress been made with abstract nouns, such as kinahip terms. But the truly nounlike nouns ---basic-level nouns--- resist analysis. 1 believe that these differences in amendability to analysis reflect differences in the kind of meaning that verbs and nouns have, and that a us&ful representation of concrete noun meaning may be quite different from that used for verbs, prepositions and even abstract nouns. (5) There are several aspects of the representational scheme that need further thought. To single out one issue, consider the notion of change of state. The LNR representation represents a verb like gat as conveying a change froas an initial state of possession to a final state of possession. Schank's Conceptual Dependency theory would represent the entire sequence 8s a primitive act. Many generative semanticists have represented only the inchoative part of the chain (the change to the final state) as belonging to the assertion of the verb, consFdering the initial state to be more in the nature of a @resuppositign (e.g. Filbmore, 1966). All these positions seem to me to have merit. The LNR use of change from initial to final state allows a chang;e-of-state verb to hook autoqaticallp with relevant state information. The use of acts as primitives captures the psychological wholeness of change. Thq use of the inchoative captrrres the intuition that people seem more interegted in the results of an event --i.e. in the final state-- than in the setting state.

PART I11 Just to give the reader a feel for the nature of ad hoc thinklag in A1 that I believe to be worth espousing, I will now consider a problem that I have recently been working on. We have had a problem in representing certain kinds of political concepts in our old representation. Since we have been very concerned with the problem of newspaper story understanding it is very important that we be able to handle such concepts in a clean representation that will facilitate computer understanding.","The problem we are attempting to solve can be illustrated by looking at a recent New York Times headline \"Catawba Indians land claim supported.\" The problem here is to be able to represent what \"land claim\" and \"supported\" mean. We know that a land claim is more than what we might use to","Something like \"Indians MTRANS land be possessed by Indians\" is possibly true, but 'it misses the point. A \"land claim\" is in a sense a petition to 4 higher authority to resolve a dispute betwen two patties. That is, the Indians are saying to the U.S. Government, \"this land is OWS\". It may not be possible to infer the particulars of this land claim. Indians have been known to take the land by force, to'file documents in government offices, to Cromplain to newsmen and so on. The important point here is tat we really need not know, and in most cases a reader muld not bother to worry about, exactly which method has been selected. Rather, a reader feels that he understands such a sentence when he has been able to identify the relationships and aims of the parties involved.","A program must recognize &hat a \"land claim1' is a type of petition to a higher authority to resolve a dispute about land ownership. We do not know who presently owns the land, but we know enough about ownersh3,p of property to infer that there is probably a counter petition of some sort. We also know about petitions to authority, They usually get resolved by the authority. In this case then, \"supported\" refers to the decision of the authority in the case.","This information can be represented graphically by a kna of triangle (example 1) AUTHORITY Other","In this triangle (a) represents the dispute between the Indians and the owners of the land, (b) represents the appeal to authority to resolve the dispute nade by the hdians, and (c) represents the authority's decision.","Triangles of this sort bve use in representing any type of dispute.

The important point at this juncture is that thare is an essential similarity across (1). (2) ant ( 3). that the similarity must be represented in some way, and that that similarfty can be exploited for use in an understanding system.","The first representational problem we encounter in trying to make explicit much of what is implicit in the triangle representation is that we will need to design a new set of ACTS to take. care of the various relationships.","In the pr imi t ive ACTS o f Conceptual Dependency we have a system that represents physical actions by using a mall set of basic actions that can combine in various ways to describe detailed or complex actions that underlie seemingly simple Verbs and nouns. The primitive ACTs do not account for intentionality and goals underlying physical adtioo. To account for such things we devised a complex apparatus discussed in Schank and Abelson (1977). If we wish to account for social events, we will need a system of basic social ACTs to represent the social actions that comprise the events. I term these \"basit social ACTS\" rather than primitive ACTs because in the end most social ACTS have some phys$cal manifestatioa, Of ten their physical manifestation is uninteresting however. For example a goverment decision may be MTRANS-ed in a variety of ways. The manner of the MTRANS* (written, ar)nounced in a speech. etc) is often not significant with respect to the overall social effect of the action. Furthermore the MTRAbJS itself is only slightly interesting. The standard inferences from MTRANS apply, but there are some highly significant inferences that need to be made that are not obviously available.","For example, the most significant inference to be made from an authority's decision is that simply by virtue of that decision something has actually happened. That is, a government authorization is a truly performati~e ACT. Thus, if the government says some property is mine. or that a man- is a criminal, then it is so by virtue af their saying it, Similarly other authority figures have the same peer, A professor can say a thesis is finished and a student has a Ph.D. and these things are the case by virtue of his saying it.","Not all authority's decisions are like this to be sure* Sometimes an authority gives an order and that order must be carried out for the decision to have effect"]},{"title":".","paragraphs":["Frequently these orders come about as q result of a governmental decision or authorization.

We will take it for granted that meaning is to be characterized in tenns of structured relationships between discrete symbols. The first question, hen, is just what these sy~n~mls are. There are three basic positions which have been taken: LINGUISTIC. In many older accounts of meaning, the only entities which take part in the formal structure arc the entities of language: wol ds, morphemes, phrases, and sentences. The dictionary is an account of meaning within this tradition. The meaning of a word is expressed in terms of structures made up of other words, without any direct appeal to concepts which lie outside the latlguage. PSYCHOI~OGICAL.

A more cautious stance is taken by most theorists who work within the generative linguistics paradigm. They argue that the symbols of their fohnal semantic theories need not correspond to functional psychological entitles. The symbols and structures play a role* similar to that of postulated theoretical entities in physics, such as neutrirros and probability waves. A system based OR them is justified in terms of its resulting overall sfmplicity and ability to account for the observable phenomena, not by finding psychologi~l correlates for its individual terms. This view shares with the psycholo~ical view the notion of lexical decomposition.

It has been defined and exploited by Lewis (1969) and Schiffer (1972) for dealing with close cousins of the problem we have raised here. Mutual knowledge is Schifferl-s term, while Lewis' term for the same thing is common knowledge. We have opted for Schiffer's term since it seems more transparent and less open to miainterpretatiqn.

Second, it is unthinkable that speakers and listeners assess mutual knowledge by working serially, statement by statement, through the infinity of statements that make up mutual knowledge. But they surely assess it somehow, as the first conclasFon seems to require. The inevitable conclusion is that they use some gort of heuristics. We will consider two families of such heurzstics--truncation heuristics and co-presence","The stickler in assessing mutual knowkdg~ statements is that thete is an fnf inity of such statements, and that is too many to check. What if people checked only a few of them--like the first four? The task could thenbe carried out in a finite, even short, amount of time.

And when she does make an error, Bob will often look puzzled or ask for clarTfication, which will allow her to repair-her reference. Indeed, repairs are quite frequent in spontaneous speech as if speakers might be doing just that. So people could assess only a truncated @art of mutual knowledge. Heuristics of this kind will be called truncation heuristics. - Are these heuristics plausible as the way people normally assess mutual knowledge? We believe not. Our doubts lie in two areas. First, it is not easy to deal with statements as complicated as (4). rt is implausible that people check these statements per se. Second, the evidence needed to verify such statements anyway suggests a radically different family of heuristics. In vershn 4 of our movie scenario, Ann didn't believe that Bob knew that she knew that he knew about Monkey Business, a vgolation of knowledge statement (4). Version 4 is co~plicated. Not only did we haye a-hard time creating it, but people have a hard Zime grasping it, for it is difficult to keep track of who knows what. Statements like (4) are difficult not because of their syntactic form, but because they describe reciprocal relat ions be tween two people. whereas ~ohn:~ean knew that Nixon knew that Haldeman knew that Magruder knew that McCord had burgled OfBrien's office is fairly comprehensible, John Dean knew that .Nixon knew that John Dean knew that Nixon knew that McCord had burgled O'Brien's office is not. Although when we need to we can figure out fourth order reciprecal relations--not just the statements themselves, it seems highly implausible that we do so robrinely . But what counts as evidence for the truth of statements like (I), (Z), (3), and (-415 Take statement (3), Ann knows that Bob knows' that Ann knows about R. Obviously, Ann wonf t have this statement per .se already stored in memory. She doesn't go thujiucigh life creating statements like this for every object she or anyone elge might want to refer to. Rather. what she needs to verify (3) is a piece of evidence from which she can deductively or inductively infer it. Imagine that she and Bob had gone to Monkey Business together. It is hard to think of better evidence than this that she could appeal to for the truth of (3). Of course, the inductive rules by which she infers (3) from this evidence -need to be spelled out, but that doean't sound impossible.","paragraphs":["The fact that Ann and Bob eaw the movie together, however, is more useful evidence even than that.

She would be better off looking for that single piece of evidence that could in principle confirm them all. Indeed, that is the foundation assumption of the next family oE heuristics We will take Up, the co-presence heuristics.","Consider the following strategy. When people make or interpret a definite reference, they try to assure themselves of mutual knowledge of the referent by searching for evidence of what we will call triple co-presence.

Strategies like this will be called"]},{"title":"co-","paragraphs":["presence heuristics. To see how they are reasonable, we wilt look at first principles.","When Lewls and Schiffer hit on the notion of mutual knowledge, both recognized the need for a finite means of handling the infinity of statements. Their sblutions were essentially the same. If A and B make certain assumptions about each other's rationality, they can use certain kinds of evidence, or states of affairs, to infer that each one of the infinite number of statements in mutual knowledge is true. But how? We get some hints from a concrete illustration of mutual knowledge devised by Schiffer.","The scene: Ann and Bob are sitting across a table from each other, and there is a single candle between them. Both are looking at the candle, and both see the other looking at it too. The proposition is that there is a candle on the table. Consider the scene from Ann's point of view. Clearly, she has direct evidence for the truth of (1): (1) Ann knows that p. But she also sees that Bob has his eyes open and is looking simultaneously at her and the candle. That is, she has evidence that she and Bob are looking at each other and the-candle simultaneously. we will call this the simultaneity assumption. Indeed, she assumes that he is not only looking at her and the candle, but also attending to them. We will call this the attention assumption. Finally, she assumes that Bob is normal and in her shoes he would be drawing the same conc~usions she is. We will call this the rationality assumption. But if Bob is attending to the candle and is rational, he has evidence for (1'): (I' ) Bob knows that p. This, however, is Arm's conclusion, and so she has evidence for (2): (2) Ann knows that Bob knows that p. But if Bob is rational, he will be drawing the inference that corresponds to hers--his equivalent of (2)--namely (2') : (2') Bob knows that Ann knows that p. Once again, this is Ann's conclusion, and so she has evidence fox (3) :","(3) Ann knows that Bob knows that Ann knows that P, In like fashion, Ann would be justified in itera-r-ing this process through the remaining knowledge statements (4) through inCinity, and Bob would be justified in doing the same for his","So Ann has reason to believe that she and Bob mutually know that there is a candle on the table. Fitst, there is the \"direct\" evidence. She directly perceives that there is a candle oh the table and that Bob is simultaneously looking at both her and the candle. Second, there are her assumptions about the situation. She assumes that Bob is consciously attending to her and the candle, that he is doing so at the same time she is, and that he is rational. The upshot is that ghe has no reason to believe that she couldn't confirm the knowledge statements as far down the list as she wanted to go. She is therefore justified in claiming mutual knowledge. Indeed, since nothing she doesn't kow herself can be mutual knowledge, and since she can assume Bob is chronically rational, all she needs to do normally is search for evidence df her and Bob simultaneously attending to each other and the candle on the table. With this we have the essence of the co-presence heuristics: To assess mutual knowledge, people search for evidence of triple co-presence--an event in which A - and B are simultaneously attending to each other noting the same evidence for p. In equation form: Co-presence"]},{"title":"+","paragraphs":["Assumptions = Mutual knowledge","The co-presence heuristics both solve the mutual knowledge paradox and make intuitive sense. kJen we assure ourselves of mutual knowledge, it is unlikely that we check for a series of pieces of evidence, even as few as the truncation heuristics might let us get away with. More likely, we check for a single piece of evidence of just the right kind. The candle example suggests that what we check for is evidence of triple co-presence. Varieties 6f Triple Co-presence","There are many different kinds of evidence people may use for the triple co-presence of the speaker, listener, and rererent. Some of these constitute strong evidence for triple co-presence, and others constitute weak evidence. That is, some kinds rightly give people a lot of confidence that the referent is mutually know, whereas other kinds do not. As reflected in aur. equation, there is a trade-off between the evidence and the assumptions. The stronger the evidence is, the fewer assumptions ate needed to infer mutual knowledge. Conversely, the fewer assumptions that are needed, the stronger the evidence is considered to be. The strongest evidence requires the fewest, or weakest, assumptions-.","The corneretane of our argument is this. The prototypical kind of evidence for mutual knowledge is physical co-presence, very much as illustrated in Schif fer's caridle example. It is the strongest possible evidence, the one requiring the fewest auxiliary assumptions, and all other kinds are weaker in one way OP another. What follows is a tentative classifi#tion of these varieties of triple co-presence,","1. Physical co-presence. Ann, Bob, and the candle are an exampae par excellence of physical co-presence. Not ooly are the three of them physically present together, but Ann can readily assume that B6b is attending to this fact, is doing so at the same time she is, and -i?s rational. All three auxiliary assumptions are necwsary. If she believed B6b was catatonic, or hypnotized the right way, or very near-sighted, for example, she wouldn' t want td assume physical cossresence"]},{"title":". Once Ann has assured herself of the direct evidence and these assumptions, she is warranted in inferring mutual knowledge of the candle and can refer to it as the candle. There are two distinct types of physical co-presence. Ann may refer to the candle while it is still physically co-present with them, as in The candle is romantic, isn't it?* Or she may refer4to the candle some time after it has been co-present with them, as in The candie was romantic, wasn' t it? These two types could be called immediate - and delayed physical co-presence. The first kind, on the face of it, is the stronger evidence. When physical co-presence is synchronous with the definite reference, Ann can be sure that she and Bob mutually know about the candle at the time she is referring to it. She doesn't have to count on Bob's remembering the past incident of physical co-presence, as she doea in the delayed kind. The-assumptidns Ann would need fn order to infer mutual knowledge from immediate physical co-presence are these: simultaneity, attention, and rationality. She would need an additional one fof the delayed case: simultanef t;y , attention, rationality, and memory. Simultaneity, attention, and rationality refer to the assumptions we have described earlier. Memary refers to the additional assumption for delayed physical co-presence: Ann must assume that Bob can and will recall the earlier incident of their physical-co-presence. So far so good. The stronger the evidence, the fewer assumptions Ann needs in order to make her definite reference. Immediate physical co-presence has one fewer requirement than delayed physical co-presence . 2. Linguistic co-presence. Many rhings we refer to have never been physically co-present. They-are often things we or someone else has mentioned in convarsation. Imagine Ann saying to Bob I bought a candle yesterday. Her utterance of 5 candle is a locutionary act that posits for Bob the exhtence of a particular- candle in the real world. If Bob hears and underdtands a candle correctly, he knows abopt the candle's existence at the very same time as she posits it. It is as if Ann has placed the candle on the stage before the tw6 of them so that it would be physically co-present. So when Ann utters a candle and Bob simultaneously understande it, the two of them can be said to be- 63 in the linguistic co-presence of the ca~dle. Once Ann has established this, of course, she cari make a definite reference to it, as in The","paragraphs":["- pandle cost me plenty.","Linguistic co-presence is weaker evidence for mutual knowledge than physical co-presence. Seeing ib believing--hearing about something isn't. To begin with, linguistic co-presence requires the assumptions of simultaneity, attention, and rationality. Ann and Bob must be attendieg to Ann's utterance af a candle stmultaneously, and both must be rat5onal. And like delayed physical cow presence, linguistic co-preaence requires memry"]},{"title":". For Ann to refer tb the candle, she ha8 to count on Bob's tecalling the earlier ipcident of linguistic co-presence with her uttering of a candle. But there is an additional assumption we wila call understandability. Ann must assume that Bab will penetrate her indefinite reference, a candle, and understand thac she is sincerely positing the candle's existence. She must assume that Bob understands her, and he must assume that she believes he does. 3. ,Indirect co-presence. Imagine Ann saying to Bob I bought a candle yesterday; the wick is made of cotton. In uttering a candle Arin has established the linguistic co-presence of him, her, and the candle, but-ndt of him, her, and the wick. How, then, can she refer to the wick? She has ta assume that when Bob accepts the existence of the candle, he wili also accept the existence of its wkck. This way, by uttering a candle; Ann has established what we will call the indirect co-presence of her, Bob, and the wick. The inferences required in indirect co-presenc~ are often much stronger than those needed for wick (see Clark, 1977; Clark","paragraphs":["& Naviland, 1977). Ann can refer to something that is only libely to be associated with a thing she has already established, or-even only possibly associated with it. She can tell Bob: I bought a candle yesterday, but the wrapper was torn; or I bought a candle yesterday, an4 the hayberry smelled great. Candles don'"]},{"title":"t necessarily","paragraphs":["'","come in wrappers nor are they often made of bayberries, yet these are parts she expects Bob to infer on the basis of her definite references to them. So what is established may be only the likelihood or possibility of a thing being co-present with the speaker and listener. Its certain existence is established only with the definite reference itself.","Indirect co-presence is parasitic. It has to be established via some other type of co-presence-- for example, physical or linguistic-co-presence. Before Ann can say The pric,e was $3 of a candle, she must .already have established the candle's co-presence. She and Bob couAd be looking at it, for physical co-presence, or she could have just mentioned it, for linguistic co-presence. For the moment we will assume that indirect co-presence is always established via either physical or linguis tic co-presence"]},{"title":". There is both a strong and a weak case or-in- direct co-presence. Instead of saying The price waB S3, Ann could have said The price of the candle was","paragraphs":["$3, providing a much more certain reference. She wcrtlld have made it explicitthdt the price referred to is that of the candle and not of something else. Bob would then have had no trouble inferring that there was one hnd only one price associated with the candle. They both could then assume that they mutually knew about the price. This case may be so direct that it aught to be placed in a separate category. For now we will treat it as a vWy strong kind of indirect co-presence.","To infer mutual knowledge from indirect co-presence, Ann and Bob need all the assumptions of physical or linguistic co-presence, whichever is the parasite's host, plus one we will call ass~ciativit~. They have to assume that each othef is capable of entertaining the certainty, likelihood, or possibility of a particular part or role being associated with the thing whose ca-presence has already been established. The hierarchy still works as expected. Indirect co-presence, because of its added assumption, is weaker evidence for mutual knowledge than either physical or linguistic to-presence,","4.. Cultural co-presence. Even when Ann is not acquainted with Bob, she can assume there are particulars the two of them tnutually know. The basic idea is that there are things everyone in a cul-ture knows about. She reads newspapers, and so does everyone else in her culture. So Bob and she can mutually assume that they bbth read newspapers. Ann can then take the fact that John Dean, Michael Doonesbury, and Billy Jean King have been prominently mentioned in the newspaper a5 good evidence that she and Bob mutually know about these people. This is an instance of what we will call cultural co-presence. Certain particulars are assumed to be universally known in a cultural milieu--they are culturally co-present for everyone in tt-- and that is taken as evidefice that everyone in the milieu knows about them.","The trick, df course, is to judge cultural milieus. Ann may think that she and Bob mutually realize that they are both high school graduates, or drug dealers, or nineteenth century history buffs, or New Yorkers, or telephone operators, or some combination of these, and her assumptions about cultural co-presence will change accordingly. If her assessments are accurpte, her definite reference is likely to succeed, and if not, it isn' t.","Cultural co-presence doesn't appear to belong to the same hierarchy as the previous three types of co-presence. For one thing, it is relatively permanent, whereas the other three are relatively transitory. Culturally known particulars take time to become familiar and to lose familiarity. Teddy Roosevelt is familiar to Americans today, just as he was 75 years- ago. Particulars known by physical, linguistic, or indirect co-presence have o~ly Eleeting familiarity and then only to specific pairs of people. M~tual~knowledge about these particulars is easily established, but also easily lost. For another thing, cultural co-presence is parasitic on other forms of mutual knowledge. For Ann to establish that she and Bob mutually know that they belong to the same cultural subgroup, she must find evidence of triple co-presence sf that fact. She might establish it, for example,"]},{"title":"-","paragraphs":["through linguistic co-presence, as in, What do you know--we're-both New Yorkers.","To infer mutual knowledge from cultural co-presence, therefore, people need assumptions that are not comparable with those of the other three typos. Take Ann's reference to Hoover Tower in a convelsation with Bob. First,.she must assume that she and Bob mutually know that they belong to a particular cultural subgroup, say Stanford University students. We will call this assumption cultural membership. How Ann justifies this assumption, however, will not be simple. Like other types of mutual knowledge, it must be based on evidence of some kind of co-presence. Second, she must assume that virtually everyone in this cultural milieu takes it for granted that they ail know about Hoover Tower. We will call this assumption universality of knowledge. The paucity of these assumptions should not fool us inro thinking ehat cultural co-presence is strong, for they,hide a tangle of complex justifications based on other pieces of evidence and ather assumptions. It is best to treat cultural co-presence as incommensurate with the other three.","With cultural GO-presence we have come to the last of the major kinds of co-presence. Not every kind of evidence for7mutual knowledge, however, can be neatly classified as one of these four types. Some appear to require a complex combination of them, and not surprisingly, they provide intuitively weaker evidence for mutual knowledge. Reference Diaries","If people assess mutual knowledge via triple co-presence, they must have a memory full of facts about triple co-presence. What do these facts look like? How are they represented? How are they asdesSed? If mutual knowledge is critical to defifiite reference--as we have suggested--then questions like these ought to be central to any theory of speaking, listening, or memory. Indeed, the arguments we have offered lead to a rather provocative conception of memory representation and ntemory search. It is provocative in, that some of its critical properties are absent from most CUP-rent models of comprehension and memory.","Most investigators have assumed that in processing definite reference People search memory for the particulars actually referred to. Take Ann's reference to Monkey Business* On hearing this Bob would search memory for a referential index to the intended referent Monkey Business. This index is a stand-in, so to speak, for the movie itself. Although the current models of comprehension differ in their specifics, virtually all of them assume this kind of search forthe intended referent. That includes Anderson (1976), Clark and Haviland (1977), Kintsch (1974), Rumelhart, Lindsay, and Norman (1972), Schank and Abelson (1977), and Winograd (1972), to name just a few.","But if people use some kind of co-presence heuristics, then all of these models are incorrect--or at least incomplete. The point is that Bob cannot search memory for the referent alone. That would hardly guarantee that it was mutually known to him and Ann, as it must be for her reference to be legitimate. Rather, he must search Ebr an event that involves not only the referent but also Ahn and him. That is, it must be an event of triple co-presence--of physical, linguistic, indirect, or cultural co-presence, or of some combinati~n of these four types. In none of the current models just mentioned does the listener search for such an event.","Previous models of comprehension have treated search t?rrough-memory as if it kere a search through a telephone book. In a definite reference like the man in thered shirt we are told the name and address af the individual we want to get hold of. Our ta3k is to search the telephone book for his number, our direct connection to him, his referential index. With the co-presence heuristics-, memory must be more like a diary, more like the personal log Nixon kept of everything he did and experienced during his years at the White House. As before, in the man in the fed shirt we are told the name and address of the indi9idual we want to get hold of. But to find him we must search our diary for an entry that provides evidence of the co-presence of the speaker (say, Gertrude), us, and an individual of that description. The diary entry must show that we were physically or linguistically co-present, or that we were co-present in some other sense. That is, we must search in every case for an event. This 1s-far more complicated tharr searching the telephone book, with or without yellow pages, for the hight number.","The diary, of course, cannot be used alone. We also need histories and atlases to refer to John Dean, the Second Worfd War, the decline and fall of the Roman Empire, and Ch-ina, particulars that are culturally co-present. And for indirect CU-presence we will also need texts on science, medicine, engineering, and law. To know that candles have wicks we need to look up facts about the engineering of candles.","What we need, in summary, is a diary of the significant events in our own personal experience, supplemented by cultural histories and. atlases for cultural co-presence and by various reference texts for indirect co-presence. Such a diary coritains a record of the events we will need for assessing co-presence. Anything less than a diary will be too little.

Furthermore, why does, for example, (8) not succeed in comrnun icat i ng the refusal? (8) MY mother is an opera singer. Perhaps one should reject (8) on some very general grounds.

Third, the conclusion of the chain contains the information appropriate for a direct response to the, Initiating event, an event that need not itself be a linguistic one (as It is in the present example).

The most important thing is that the hearer assumes that the speaker 1s constrained in what he says in just the kind of way that I have indicated. The hearer, therefore, attributes to the speaker some plausf ble chain of reasoning. However, the hearer may not have all the knowledge that is available to the speaker (he may not know that he is on a diet, for example). Cbnsequently, he may have to make inferences of his own in order to reach some of the premises required. This would be true if, for example, the response to the offer of cake had been (12) rather than (10). Sometimes these inferences are incorrect and one understands correctly what was intended, but for the wrong reasons, or one misunderstands It al-together. As we shall see, this fact, that the hearer's interpretation is only probabilistically determined, has some impbrtant consequences for the speaker's selection of his utterance.","The most crucial clalm that I wish to make about the thain of reasoning is this. Assuming that the speaker does not choose to express hlmself directly (for Whatever reason), then wf thin the limits of the context, any of the premises or subconclusions in the chain from the Initiating event to the (dtrect). conclusion can function as more or less easi4y Ifiterpretable surrogates for the conclusidn--any of the steps can constitute an indirect speech act appropriate to the direct sp3ech act that constitutes the conclusion. Thus, ?ny of (lo), (ll), (12), (13), and (14) can serve as Indirect response to the offer. And, if some other response is made, it must be able to serve as a step in a similar chain of plausible reasaning. If it cannot, it is an inappropriate response. It is p~ecisely these constraints that prevent (8) from be-~ng a possible indirect response to the offer, since there is no basis of shared knowledge that will normally permif a hearer to reconstruct an argument in which (8) figures to be relevant on the chbin from initiating event to conclusion.","An important question that now needs to be answered is why do people use language indirectly in the first place, and why, given that they can choose from a restricted range of indirect comnunicative acts, do they select the ones they do. Why, for example, would a speaker choose (10) instead of, say (12)? The answer to the first part of the question depends on exactly what kind of indirect language act is being used. For example, metaphors may be used for purposes of communicative economy, comnunicative vivid-ness, or even comnunicative possi bi 1 i ty (see Ortnny, 1975). With indirect speech acts, the answer is very often that the speaker gets ''two for the price of one.\" For example, he can, with one utterance, not only refuse the offer, but also satisfy certain social conventions by providing a good reason for his refusal,,or at least hlnting at one. As Searie (197'5) points out, in an indirect speach act'thp speaker intends both the sentence me-g and the speaker meaning to be recognized bwhe hearer. So, indirectness affords economy- well as, often, politeness and sensitivity.","There remai ns .,le quest ion of why a spwaker should select we form over ahother. The answer again lies in the fact that the communication of the literal meaning of the indirect language act is intended, Some of the knowledge that is needed to construct the reasonlng chain may be more publicly available than other knowledge reqdired. Thus, most people know that\\peopld on diets ought not to eat fattening things (depending on the purpose of the diet, of course). Consequently it can be assumed that a hearer has more ready access to that fact than to the fact that the speaker is on a diet (which possibly very few people know). Thus, the speaker's selection of the particular language act can teke advantage of his beliefs about what the hearer is likely to know. It can also take advantage of the fact that some of the choices seem to have a stronger force than others. This is a complex issue.

Surely, what is pragmatic and what is not cannot come down to performative verbs. Yet, if it is to be broader than that, what criteria are to be used to separate the semantic from the pragmatic? The old notion of semantics as entailment is certainly to@ restrictive to be useful as a model of natural language processing, but the new notion of pragmatics seems to amount to little more than the notion that language processors are* rational beings who engage their reasoning processes in language comprehension and production just as they do in perception and actfon. Even the not ion of a speech act seems to have very fuzzy boundaries unless ft is trivialfted by In-voki ng psychologl cal I y *ininterest ing surface structural aspects like the presence ot absence of perforhat ive verbs.","Distinctions between different cJasses of linguistic ~henomena are usually difficult to maintain in any-rigid way, particularly if they are supposed to have psychological correlates. This is true of the distinction between syntax and semantics, of that between semantics and pragmatics, of that between literal and nonliteral, and of that between descriptions of entailment, and descriptions of Inference. As usual, clear cases are easy to recognize, but there Is always a large grey, undecided area in the middle where the classification Seems sterile. In the case of the distinction bemebn descriptions of entailment and descriptions of itlference, the problem is exactly the same as the classical philosophical one that plagues the analytic/synthetlc distinction. This is hardly an accident since my distinction is really no more than the analytic/ synthetic distfnctlon in disguise. Maybe all that needs to be said is that some inferences (e.g. ones based str,ictly on the rules of logic) are generally easier to make than others. If this is right then it merely means that some relationships between descriptions and their intended referents are more transparent than others. Nobody could object to that.","The last question I want to deal with is the psychological status of my claims, particularly-with respect to the inference patterns that I have proposed. My position is not that it is a necessary condition for the comprehension or production of a definite description of inference that a person actually construct such a chain of reasoning. My claim is only that it should be possible to do so--there has to exist some determinable connection between the predicate underlying the definite description and the discourse in which the description occurs. But, being determinable and being determined are different things. As a matter of fact, there are of ten other clues that wi 11 permit the hearer to make a good guess about the referent's identity, distpurse topic being one of them. It is almost qertalnly the case that people sometimes do go through some such reason; ng process as I have out-lined, and if and when they do not, they could probably be induced to do so by being asked suitable questions about what they took the referent to be, and why it was reasonabte or plausible to do so.

When sentences are fdrmea into units of twb or more sentences, certain words refer back to othet referring Qxpresslons in the previous sentences. Among the words which can be used to refer to the real world as well as to refer back (which is called thb process of co-raterence) are _noun phrases containing a definite article, such as the (cglled defnps, hereafter). Several aspects of com~rehension of defnps are open problems:","1.) What is the definition of the reference of a defnp? That is, what to we mean by reference irr computational linguisitics~","2.) How are defnpst which are used to co-refer into a discourse distinguished from those which refer to real world objects outside the discourse?","3.)

What different ways can defnps be used to co-refer to other entitles in the discourse?","5.) How can co-referenq of'defnps be detected?","6.) What inferences and data structures will be needed, for the detection process? The work of Winograd 1197 1 I, Charniak 119721 and Rieger [I9731 suggest that inferencing is. crucial to the interpretation of co-reference.","This paper presents a viewpoint from which to answer theseauestibns based on the concept of focus, as developed by Grosz [1977) and the author (Bullwinkle 119771). This paper extends' Grwz' work by qstablishing a framework for communication and a set of rples for use of focus in discourse. The approach taken here represents an alternative to the inference driven schemes of Charniak and Rieger. 2. Tb Communication Pracass ad Focus","The description of the communication process given here contains fout simple assumptions which are generally true and will be taken as true in this work First, the speaker is assumed to be communicating about something. This assumption implies that the speaker is not speaking gibberish, that there are referring expressrons and either requests, questions, assertions or acknowledgements beinq made. The something which the communication is about will be called the focus of the discourse? Second, the hearer is assumed to be able to identify what the focus qf the discourse is. The speaker wants to communicat_e about something., and for the communication to occur, the hearer must be able to dist~nguish what the speaker is communicating about. Third, the speawr is not trylng to confuse or deceive the hearer. The-speaker uses referring expressions with the intention of referring to someone or something, or with the intention of describing something or some event. In Gricean3 terms, the bywrd is \"Be perspicuous.\" The final assumption claims that the speaker assumes the hearer knows certain knowledge about the real-world which can be referred to during the communication process. Recent research (Cohen [1978]), as well as the well known work of Searle [I9691 and Austin [I9621 describe models of the speaker's knowledge of what the hearer believes. In this chapter, the weakest form of such a model 16 assumed: the speaker assumes the hearer has enough real-world knowledge in common with the speaker to know the entities which the spebRer refers to, and that knowledge is what the speaker draws on in constructing a message 40r a hearer. These four assumptions will play an important part in the discussion of co-reference interpretatioh which follows. 1. I wOn .use the term speaker to refw to the producer of a spoken or written drscourse and hearsr to refer to the receiver of the discourse. 2. 1 don't want fo suggest that only one thing can be communicated in a dlscourse, for speakers do direct their attention from one thing to another. For the moment, I will speak 9f the focus as the first center of rttention in a speaker's dlscourse. 3. Grice, HP. \"Logic and Conversatlbn\" etc.","This paper makes the claim that the focus acts as m indax function for referring expressions. For those referring expressions which are anaphoric, the focus indicates where to look for an anfecendent, For those referring expressions which are names or descriptions of things in the world, the focus acts as a generation center for a process that chooses a r'epresentatian. of a real world entity vihich fits the name or description. However, the focus of a discourse alone is not sufficient to produce theWndexing behavior. The focus must be used hr cmiunction with a hierarchical semantic network of associations. The network will indicate what other concepts are related to the focus. It is a codification of some of the general knowledge speakers and hearers have about the real world. The network is a dynamic structure because the hearer adds to hisfher general knowledge in the process of interpreting a piece of discourse, Focus must also act with a third piece of computational machinery, an inferencing mechanism. It is used to infer from general knowledge and some suppositions that a certain proposition is true.","An example will be helpful here. In the discourse below, thb focus of discussion is the meeting of DO-1.","00-1 1 want to schedule a meeting with Ira. 2 It should be at 3 p.m. 3 We can get toget her in his office. 4 Invite John to come, too. All four sentences give information about the focussed entity. Thus in DO both sentences 3 and 4 make no direct reference to the meeting of 00-1. As human hearers, we know that these sentences are related to the rest of 00 because-they give information about the focus meeting. In 00-3 there are three clues which connect this sentence 2nd the rest of the discourse: the use of get together, the a-reference of we to the participants of the meetfng, and his office establishing a place fop a meeting. DO-4 intraduces an additional participant which can be surmised from the use of invite,%nd the fact that the ellipsis of the went that John IS invited to is the focus.","A piece of the hierarchical net needed hr DO is given below in figure 1. A prototypd meetings has associated places, times, participants, and purposes. The relation between meeting and place is one of occurrence while the relation between meeting and purposes is one of causality. When tXt-1 is encountered, the hierarchical net grows a new member: an instance sf meeting from 00-1. It inhe* associated entities of meetings and some specific values tor the participant entdty. 00-2 induafes that something (callbd it) will occur at a particular time. The focus of 00-1 is meetihg, so the focus, meeting, is proposed as the antecedent o! it. To Fig. 1.

Indeed they do, so the proposal of meeting as antecedent of it is accepted.","The explanation about the use of focus is not really so simple because the focus of a discourse changes. The interpretation of focus requires a means of recognizing that the focus has changed to some other entity. In 00' the focus begins on meeting, but the it in W-3 has my office as its co-referent, not the meet~ng. Detecting this co-reference requires a means of noticing a shift of focus and using the inferencing mechanism to confirm the choice of to-referent, Focus shift detection will not be discubsed here; the reader is referred to Bullwinkle [I9771 for a discussion of focus shift where the term \"sub-topic shift\" is used.","W-1 I want to schedule a meeting with George, Jim, Steve and M~ke. 2 We can meet in my office. 3 It's kind of small, but the *meeting won't last very long enyway. 3. Ratferame jn Computational Term","The theory presented here distinguishes two kinds of rafat.ring The first is an idernal reference between a noun phrase and some pre-exlstlng database object. That database object represents a real world entity. 10 Figure 2 below internal reference links the noun phrase NPl wJimmy Carter\" to a representation of Jimmy Carter (who is described as presrdent of the US, etcll. How the noun phrase and the database object refer tq the real world is the classical semantic problem of reference (cf. Kripke [I9721 amng others) and is beyond the scope of this work Tha other kind of referring is co-reference. Co-reference links a nounghrase to another noun phrsse.

T,o answer the first question above, the beaker must decide that names are rea~rting expressions. To answer the second question, the barer must decide 1) whether Julius Caesar refers uniquely und 2) what conceptual entity in the heamr's memory represents the hearer's real-world referent. These two decisions together with the initial assumptions appear to make &necessary and sufficient conditions for comprehension since by deciding that Julius Caesar refers uniquely and choosing a conceptual entity, the hearer has decoded what entity the speaker was referring to.","There are, however, situations where the hearer's choices to the above decisions and the speaker's intended referent do not coincide. Suppose the hearer decides that Julius Caesar refers uniquely and refers to Julius Caesar, who W&E a Rodan emperor. The speaker may also have intended it to refer uniquely, but to the author% deceased cat, whose name was Jul~us Caesar. Now there are three possibilities; either the hearer knew about Julius Caesar the cat, but decided the expression referred to Julius &he emperor, or the hearer only knew about the emperor, or fhe hearer didn't know of either. In the last case, the hearer \"found\" a referent by a chance from randomly linking up the name and some memory representirtion. The last possibility does not fit a description of reference comprehension of any kind. Randomly hooking up information from one's memory t@ what appears to be a referring expression may be e cognitive act, but intuitively no one would call it reference comprdhension.","In the case wh~re the hearer only knew about the emperor, it seems safe to conclude that the reference may C have been comprehended, but incompletely. As we shall see, there are many other clues In communicstion aboul the referent of terms than those given by refsrrin~ expressions in isolation. Without these, reference comprehenslon is incomplete because the h&er has no merne of knowing whether s/hs may have the wrong referent. Even with the best set of clues, the hearer may still choose Julius the emperor, Hsre ws will say that comprshqnsion has tdkan place, completely but incorrectly, because the barer hrs used all the relevant communication knowledge to decodt, the speaker's message. What can be concluded is that the speaker's rules for reference generation and/gr the spmaker's knowledge bf the hearer is faulty (thereby contradicting the speaker's assumption above).","In the ease where the hearer knows of both possibilities and; ch~uses the incorrect one, the hearer may have erred due t@ hilqrs to fotIow other cammunicatkn ctves or again because the epedket's rules and knowledge were lacking.

An expression wilt be. considered incompletely comprehended if the hearer fails to use all the communication cues available at the time the communication occurs.","So far 1 have not considered the possibility of error on the patt of the hearer because of the hearer's beliefs. Suppose, for example, that the hearer believes the speaker hates to even speak of cats. Then the hearer may conclude that Julius Caesar is most likely a reference to the emperor of Rome. I am not going to consider this possibility in the forthcoming discussion; instead I wili restrict the discussion to cues from the communication process. Hearer beliefs raise a separate set of philosophical as well as con)pi&ational problems and entends the scope of this study too broadly. However, the issues are significant In the total picture of reference and co-reference comprehension.","In the remainder of this paper I will consider co-reference comprehensioh just from the hearer's point of view. Thus in discussing referential and co-referential exptessrons, I will be concerned with a model of how the hearer disambiguates these expressions used in drscdurse.

The problem is not only whether a particular defnp actually denote$ a real world object$ it is alsb a question of whether tha defnps Is intended to refer at all. Even more surprising, a defnp may be used to refer, but the speaner may not intend for the hearer to know the referent of the defnpr the defnp form Is used to indicafe that the referent is knowable, but possibly not significant for the communication at hand, OonneUan [19?7f points out that some defnps are used attributively. If we happen upon Smith who lies dead with foul wounds, one can say Fmith's murderer is insane.* Used attributively, Smlth's murderer does not refer to anyone, and the phrase does not dpscribb a pprticular person. It is as if to say, Smrth was murdered and the murderer, whoever that may be, is insane. Thys the speaker using an attributive defnp does not assume that someone fits the description, whereas with a referential defnp the speaker expects the hearer to realize who Is being pointed to.","The other distrnct~on a speaker can make is to use a defnp to indicate that the referent is knowable. Thus if OW says: (1) Larry read a ID̂of l~ngu~strcs in the hospUal, (2) Carry read a lot of linguistics in a hosp~tal, the (2) usage is not the same as the (1). While the hearer doesnot know which hospital the hospital refers to, it is clear it refers to some particular one.

Where defnps in isolation are often ambiguous on the generic-specific ~Iassification, in discourse context, this rarely occurs since the focus provides the class type for the defnp.

Returning to the discussion of focus-shift earlier, a referring expresslbn following the focus is either co-referential to the focus or introduces an entity which is the potential new focus of the discourse. The difficulty with phrases like the fa;ry tde book is that one cannot tell if it is intended to co-refer, or because it is somewhat different from the focus, intended to be used as a potential new focus.

An example of generic set-elerneit co-reference is given below with both a singular defnp focus and a plural unspecified focus.","01 7-1 The Aust railian aborigine represents an almost ext lnct hunter-scavenger social group. 1' Austra~llan aborigines represent an slmost extinct hunter-scavenger social group. 2 The abor~g~ne in the southern sections of Austrajlia sometimes gathers food, but the other aborigines do not.","Inferred generic co-references also occur. -In 018, the ow- of a motorcycle is a generic defnp:","CN8-1 Alronso was in an accident with a motorcycle last week. 2 I think thp owner of a motorcycle ought ta be required to take &wing lessons. The owm of a nrblarcycle is generically related to the first sentence by m inference of what happened to the agent. The same kind of machinery ttrd is used for specific inferred co-references can be used for making these inferences as well. HOW can generic inferred co-references be distinguished tom specific inferred co-reference? A drictly generic defnp as in 018'2 remains generic. Those defnps which are u-ambiguous at the sententral levd, as wlth 010-2, can be dissmbiguated as specific because of the relation to the focus.","The use of *a semantic network with a focus afid inference mechanism results in a computational theory of co-reference which makes use of representation properties such as prototype of ~rrtit~es, hierarchical connections and associative links between entities in the representation. The use of focus for co-reference rilles such as the EllC rules, implicit backwords co-reference rules and inferred co-reference relies on this net representation. An l~ference mechanism is necessary both to verify"]},{"title":".","paragraphs":["co-reference predictions and to test suppositions used in inferential to-reference.
