ABSTRACT Toward a rational model of discourse comprehension","J. L: Morgan","Center for the Study of Reading","and","Department of Linguistics university of Illinois","Models of discourse br text often treat connected discourse in a manner analogous to the treatment of sentences in traditional and generative grammar; i.e. as a formal. object to be decoded by means of c~rtain formal operaaions. I point out in this paper that even where this view is not explicitly proposed, it is often implicit. Against this common view I argue that the only kind 05 discourse model that is likely to succeed is one that is built around two important hypotheses: first, that the key to d~scuurse comprehension is the attempt to infer the deta'ils of the plan that the speaker/ writer follows in constructing khe text; secondj that a large portion of the work of a discourse comprehension model should be derived from a theory of practical reasoning. I will sketch the outline of a model (or more accurately, a ~chema for a large class of possible models) that incorporates these suggestions, pointing out the rdle of practical reasoning processes, and arguing that notoriously confused nottons like \"gicves/'new1' and I1&xpected inforrna~ion~~ can wly be made sense of in such a model.

Path-Based and Node-Based Inference in Semantic Mctworks>k","Stuart C. Shapiro","Department of Computer Science","State University of New York at Buffalo","Amherst?, New York 14226 ABSTRACT","TWO styles of performing inference in semantic networks are presented and compared, Path-based inference allows an arc or a path or arcs between-two given nodes ko be inferieed from the existence of another specified path between the same two nodes. Path-based inference rules may be written using a binary relational calculus notation. Node-based inference allows a structure of nodes to be knferred Erom the existence gf an instance of a pattern of node structu~es. Node-based inference rules can be constructed in a semantic network using a variant of a predicate calculus notation. Path-based inference is more' efficient, while node-based inference is more genera,l. A method is described of combining the two styles in a single system in order to take advantage of the strengths of each. Applications, of ~aeh-based inference rules to the representation of the extensional equivalence of intensional cohcepts, and to the explication of inheritance in hierarchies are sketched, - ;'c Preliminary version of a paper to be presented at \"Theoretical Issues in Natural Language Processing,\" the 1978 annual meeting of the Associatian for Computational Linguistics, UrbanalChampaign-, Illinois, Juw 25-27, 1978. Processing of Inierences","Rand Spiro and Joseph Esp~slco University of Illinois Abstract The I~ypothesis that pragmatic inferences @presented in ~ext are taken for granted, superficially processed, and not stably or enduring1 y represented in nlemory was invcstlgatcd. Stories were read which in sorne contii t i~ns contained inforniation vitiating the iniplicational force of explicit1 inferences. The vit iat fng informat ion was presented eittrqr before of- after thc inferences. In Experiment I, errors ir memory for the inferences were prevalent in th~ \"aftert' but not the \"beforet1 condition. Two kinds of errors were made: saying the inference had not been presented in the story; or, if it was remembered as having been presented, alter~ng the specific content of the inference to produce the opposite f what was actually presented. The latter errons produced coherence with tii'e vitiating information, and subjects were not able to differeptiate these errors from correct responses. In Exp~riment~ 11, the results of Experiment I were replicated, ar~d a \"spontaneous correction\" interpretat ion was rejected. The results of bath experimenlts combine to suppfct the hypothesis of superficial processing and unstable representat ion of expl ici t inferences.
