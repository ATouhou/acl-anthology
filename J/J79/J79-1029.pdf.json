More recently, Power (1974) has also investigated how svstemic pramnar can be used to ,analvse natural language. There have, however, been no attempts to use a computer to investi.gate systemic grammar itself. As Friedman (1971) says, in introducing her computer model of transformational grammar, adequate natural lanquage grammars are bound to be so complex that some mechanical aid in investigating their ~ro~erties will be mandatory. The aims, then, of develo~ing a computer model of svsteric prammar are threefold. First, the model enables the Rrammar to be tested, i.e. it enables contradictions, amhip,uities and incomnletenesses in the grammas to be found. Pecondlv, the model enables systemic grammar itself to he imnroved, slnce the consequences of adfustinp parameters and rules can be more easilv followed.

Also, some rules specify that tktb functions must be conflated, i.e. bath functions apply to the same immediate constituent. (Further details of these an? the following rules ape given later when the program is discussed.) The application of the feature-realisation rules provides an unordered sot of functions, some of which may be conflated. (2) structure-buildinp rules These rules expand and arder th?a set of fwnctions to provide the structure of the item. Structure-building rules are themselves of four kinds, which in the simplest case are of the following form: (-a) addition rule3: \"if function y (or some combination of functions) is present, then so must be function z (oassibly conflated with other Functions 1\".","(b) conflation rules: \"if some condition expressed in terms - ~ of functions is satisfied then some function must be conflated with certain other functions\".
