In recent artificial intelligence literature dealing with computational linguistics, it has been used to ref= to any conjecture given a set of facts. The conjecture my be -true or false. In -this sense, \"inferencet' includes mre than formally deduced statements. This paper considers a subclass of inferences, known as presupposition and entailment. We exhibit many of their pmperties. In particular, we demanstrate how to compute them by structural means (e.g. -tree transformations). Fwther, we disc~s their computational properties and their mle in the semantics of natural language. A sentence S entails a sentence S1 if in every context in which S is true, St must also be true. A sentence S presupposes a sentence S\" if both S itself entails St' and the (intermal) negation of S also entails S\". The system we ha* described computes this subclass of inferences while parsing a sentence. It uses the augnated transition network (ATN). While parsing a sentence, the Am graph retrieves the tree tr,ansformations from the lexicon for any words in the sentence, and applies the tree sfo or mat ion to the appropriate portion of the semaritic representation of the sentence, to obtain entailments and presuppositions. Ftrther, when a specific syntactic cons-truct having a presupposition is pamed, the Pfl3 generates the corresponding presupposition using tree -formations. That presuppsition and entailment are inferences is obvious. However, the requirement in their definition that they be independent of the situation (all context not represented structurally) is stmng. Hence, it is clear that presupposition and entailment are s-trictly a subclass of inferences. As one would hope in studying a res-tricted class of a more geneml phenomenon, this subclass of inferences e~bits several computational and linguistic aspects not exhibited by the geneml class of inferences. Some of these are 1) presupposition and entailment seem to be tied to the definitional (semantic) st~ucture ad syntactic structure of language, 2) presupposition and entailment e&ibit complex interaction of semantics and syntax; they exhibit necessary, but not sufficient, semantics of individual words and syntactic constructs, and 3) forthe case of presuppositibn and entailment,there is a na-1 solution to the problem of knowing when to stop drawing inference&, which is an importan-tr problem"]},{"title":"in","paragraphs":["inferencing, in genm."]},{"title":"The term \"inference\"","paragraphs":["has been used"]},{"title":"in","paragraphs":["many ways."]},{"title":"In recent artificial intelligence","paragraphs":["litemtire dealing with cqutational linguistics, it has been used to refer to any conjecture given a context (for instance, the context developed from previous text).
