At the present time what is needed more than anything else in the area of language translation is an understanding of the fonnal nature of semantics, its relation to syntax in language description, and its role in translation. I believe this paper provides some of the basis for that understanding. Incidentally, the reader might have observed that the definition of phrase-s tructure semantics in Section 1 provides for solutions to the semantic projection problem (cf Katz and Fodor"]},{"title":"(1964),","paragraphs":["and Langendoen (1969))"]},{"title":".","paragraphs":["The reqder is certainly aware by now, if not before, that thew are many grammars and semantics for a given language.
