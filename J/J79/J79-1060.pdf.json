An overview is given of a system for generating pitch contours for a sentence from a Junction Grammar semantico-syntactic representation. Section I also in-ludes a description of an extension of Junction Grammar whi& defines an object called an articulation tree, correspondtng to each junction tree. A junction tree contains semantico-syntactic information but no lexical information. An articulation tree 3 contains segmerital information about each lexical item and suprasegmental or prosod lc informatiofi combining the lexical items ihto prosodic units. Semantic distinctions in junction trees are recoded as distinctions in the prosodic structure of articulation trees and then articulation Vrees are used to generate pitch contours. Junction trees and articulation trees are included as figures for several sentences. Sectqon I1 describes-how pitch contours are generated, including the recoding of junction trees as articulation trees, the assignment of ~nitial and final pitch levels and pitch at nuclear syllables, apd how the generated contours are combined with analysis parameters and synthesized into speech. It should be noted that the junctlon trees are entered manually rather than by automatic analysis, in the cur~ent implementation. The te*t includes several graphs of natural pltch contours as well g~ contours generated by the computer system. The pitch contour system produces a synthesis output foL each reading of a sentence. Thirty-five sentences, some with natural, some with hand-drawn, and some with machhe-generated pitch contours were evaluated for naturalness and \"intelligibility\" of intonation in four types of tests. Results of testing several subjects showed that the generated pitch contours were judged nearly as natural as hwnan-produced contours, and except for some specific problems involving duration, the generated contours were intelligible in the sense of causing the listener to perceive the intended reading of the sentence. The text lncludes a quantitative summary of the results of the evaluation.

These contours mvst have a certain degree of \"human fidelity\" if the synthetic speech is to sound natural, that is, not too machine-like. The pitch contours in currently operational text synthesis systeqs are still not perfectly natural-sounding and thus computer generation of pitch contours is a topic of current intel'est. This intere,st is shown, for example, by Allen as he discusses pause and duration in text synthesis and then goes~on to say: If temporal control presents great problems in the description of speech, then the problems of fundamental frequency $fO), or pitch control, are at least as difficult, Once again, problems arise due to the fact that the £0 is correlated with many factors, including vowel tongue height, previous consonant, breath group contour, syntactic and semantic content of words, whether a sentence is a questfon, intonation effects, and word boundary glottalization.","(Allen, 1976: 440) Given the need for further research in pitch control, a question remains of how to approach the problem. The authors feel it is important to work within a linguistic model that interrelates semantic and phonetic phenomena. Later on in Allen's article he makes the following statement (which coincides with our philosophy): The current use of sophisticated means for pitch recording, coupled wf th increased interaction between linguistics and speech resesrchers, should, however, lead to significantly improved pitch control programs which are based on sound linguistically motivated theory. (Allen, 1976: 441) The need for interation between linguistics and speech research is further explained by Umeda (1976: 450): The message realization forms one structure as a whole. Its constituents-acoustic realization, higher level prosody, and syntax-semantics-interact ~ith each other very closely; a decision niade at any level derives immediately from the obtained result at the level above, and afferts 2 decisgon at the level below. The remainder of this section consists of a survey of some of the current work in this area in the USA (at MIT, Bell Labs, and Stanford University), in Germany, and in the USSR. Then the section will conclude with an introduction to the present research. A."]},{"title":"MIT At MIT, Allen","paragraphs":["(1976) is working on pitch control as an element in his overall plan to produce a system capable of producing synthetic sp,eech from unrestricted English text. He points oqt that although a syntactic and semantic analysis is needed, nb existing automatic algorithm can provide that analysis reliably for entire sentences of unrestricted text. So he has elected to do a local analysis of the sentence first and then tie together the local analyses into a sentence level analysis if possible. The analyzer is thus designed so that if at some point complete sentence analysis is blocked, the partial analyses are still useful in generating the pitch contour and other prosodic controls such as duration and pause. In response to toe need for a theoretical framework for relating a text and its pitch contour, Allen is using the ideas of Halllday (1970) (e.g. discourse focus) to ,&~vestigate such questions as when and why elements of a verb string are stressed. For example, he no'tes that the sentence \"A farmer was eating the carrot1' will receive emphasie on \"eating\" if'it is in response to a questJon about what the farmer is doing. Allen currectky notes that: The discovery and coordination of all these effects 1s a large and continuing effort, and it is clear that substantial setnantic and discourse-level knowledge is needad to correctly predict prosodic parameters.\"","(Allen, 1976: 441) B.

TTis method for: generating the pitch contour was to record several sentences of the specified type using random words and to average the natural pi'tch contours to obtaiq prototype contours. Then the contour far each word was approximated by a fourth ~rder polynomial to \"facilitate linear stretching and compressfon of the fundamental frequency contour. 11 Oli3e reports that by ushg this pitch contour generation system, <n c~njuncfion with a word concatenation schesrie in which the words are stored in linear predictor coefficient (LPc) code, the synchesized sentences were of high quallty Umeda, at Bell Labs, is also concefned with pitch contours,","11 8sserting that Among acoustic companents, pitch (the fundamental frequency of the voice) shows the a~st direct relation to higher level prosody, stress and boundaries\" (Umeda, 197'6: 448).

D. Germany","paragraphs":["Complementary to pitch contour generation, is the study of the perception of pitch contours. In Germany Isacenko and Schadlich (1970), performed an interesting series of experiments on the perception of German intonation. Natural sentences illustrating different intonation patterns were recorded and monotonised at various fundamental frequencies (e.g. 150 Hertz and 178.6 Hertz). Then the tapes of the monotone versions were cut and spliced at various points. The spliced tapes thus had an artificially simplified intonation of exactly two tone levels. The team found that they could change the way listeners perceived certain ambiguous sentences by changing only the points at which tone switches occurred."]},{"title":"E.","paragraphs":["USSR In the USSR, fiaavel et! al. (1976) have also performed some experiments in manip~lating pitch contours while leaving other parameters constant. They are interested in finding ways to \"decrease the amount of in£ ormation necessary for the description of pitch curves without distorting the parameters interpreted by man as prosodic characteristics of a sentence.\" They base this search on the assumption that man has only a limited short term memory available for storing the pitch contour and so makes decisions concerning the prosody of a sentence by extracting prosodic features which contain considerably less information than that needed to reconstruct exactly the same pitch contour. They conclude from these experiments that decisions such as declarative versus interrogative are based on the position of the rise or fall in pitch and not on the difference in pitch from high to low. They also conclude that in determining emphasis, the position of the peak value of the second derivative of the pitch contour is very significant. F.

(4) What synthesis technique should be used to incorporate the prosodic controls into a working system (e.g, LPC synthesis, formant synthesis, or articulatory synthesis)?

The J-tree (a semantico-syntactic representation) is consistent with the version of Junction Grammar described by Lytle (1975). The A-tree (a phonological representation) is eonsistent with Junction Phonology (Lytle, 1976), except that the internal structure of the V3 nodes is not shown. This A-tree specifies that the sentence is to be pronounced in two units \"John\" and \"drove to the store1', and \"drove to the store\" is further divided into ' \"drove\" and \"to the store.

As for the pitch confour, a left subjunction causes a dbwnward pitch shift. Similarly, a right subjunction causes an upward shift. The extra subjunction at the top of the A-tree is available for adding prosodic feature specifications relevant to the entire sentence. The A-tree system of representation is very flexible and a different A~tree could be used if it were decided to group the elements of the sentence differently. At the bottom of Figure 9 is a simplified version of the A-tree, which is used throughout the rest of this paper to make the trees easier to read. But it should be noted that the computer implementation uses the trees in their full form. Having described the J-tree and A-tree for the neutral form of \"John drove to the store,\" we now consider how the trees differ for the four other versions shown in Figure 1. In versions b, c and d we stress \"John,\" \"drove\" and \"to the storett respectively. This stregs is the reflectton of an implicit frame I1 modifier in the J-tree (see Figure 10). For example, according to Junction theory, when the context is \"lho drove to the store?\", \"~ohn\" is implicitly modified by a right interjunction which indicates that John has been selected out of a set of possibilities. A possible explicit frame I1 modifier would be: \"Of the persons who ~ight have gone to the store, John drove to the sto-e.

In this full system, J-trees adjusted (transfered) for the target language vould be needed as well as fully specified A-trees. The A-trees would include the internal structure of the V3 nodes, and the information in the A-tree would be converted into parameters that drive a functional analog of the vocal cords and tract.

Generally speaking, syllables have as their nuclear component a coatinuous phoneme wlth vocalic properties.
