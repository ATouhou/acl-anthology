Let me also add that nothing I said was meant to deny that the cammercial MT companies like his own have done-excellent work, and that I wish them well in the future. But Whether they have solved the MT problem for natural language in the sense in which that problem was understood the last time round this cycle in the Fifties and Sixties, is another matter, and I remain to be convinced. For thoge who have just joined in, let me remind them that the intractable problems its first phase were word sense anibiguity, case ambiguity (of prepositions,","and referential ambiguity (roughly, pronouns). Anyone who. claims to have solved thoseproblems without making any general theoretical claims about natural language in the process is either dealing with restricted languaqe, or is in much the same position as one who arrives to demonstrate a perpetual motion machine. In the latter case, he is entitled to a respectful hearing, but there is nonetheless a certain scepticism in the audience. No amount of talk about millions of dollars spent, or important contracts obtained makes that hard fact any softer, Mr. Scott says. that UN treatises shaulsd be a test case of what is natural, rather than restricted, language. I quite agree, and if his system can translate an unseen UN treatise chosen by a neutral party to the satisfaction of a neutral audience then I will back down. He is careful not to say he has done it, and I personally believe that LETTERS he cannot do it, armed with a phrase structure grammar. a semantic categorisation system and nothing more. The reasons why are set out in any standard paper on Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language. They involve the essential role of semantic structures, inference and knowledge of the world in understanding and so in translation. I will be happy to send him a bibliography.

Another mode of intervention uhich is more direct, is peovided by the presence of functions acting on the enumeration procedures by which the system counts ~ff solutions. For example, the system analyzes all possible segmentations starting with a given segment beginning with the segmentations containing most characters. An intervention at this level makes it possible hot to analyze but to reject sub-segmentations of P segment. The analysis of the segment \"UNE\" can, for example, reject the analysis of the subsegment \"UN E\" (Observe that the segmentation of the word \"chacune\" will then be obtained as GAC UNE because th8 segmentation"]},{"title":"CHACUN E","paragraphs":["will. be rejected as a subsegmentation of \"UNE\" This problem can easily be resolved because these functions appear in the rules of the grammar and are consequently conditional.

This calculation corresponds above all with a conditianal modification of the label C or current state starting from the label A or argument state. The condition for the evolution of this label is such that if no evolution is possible then the corresponding segmentation Ls rejected. This condition can refer to the labels of the preceding analyzed words and can condition its result on the analysis of the following form. Thus for example in the course of the analysis of the word \"LA\" in the sequence \"il la voit\", the segmentation taking \"la\" as article can be rejected. The transfer of information to different labels can be realized through assignmenttothe following label S. When this label has been assigned in the course of the analysis of a word the analysis of the follow'ing word will begin with the assigned label instead ef the null label. The final result of the system is a labeled tree.

This system manipulates labeled trees of the type described above (labeled trees produced by the ATEF or other system). To construct a transformational grammar with this system two complementary elements are necessary: the set of rules used defines the set of prfmitives of the system for a given application The set of grammars and the definition of their linkage defines the mode of use of the primitives The definition of a transformation rule defines a mode of potential transformation of the tree considered. A rule is defined by a le'fthand part representing the subtree to be modified and a righthand part defining the resulting subtree. For example, let the following be two rules: ART NMC ART [UM~ ART NMC NMC ART On the tree resulting from the analysis by the ATEF system of the senterice \"une irresistible jeune femme rousse\", we will have the following applications: une irrgslstible jeurre femme rousse irresistible .ibunz GT*' rousse -","art. edj. adj.

PHENOMENOLOGICAL LEVEL. This is a question of degree of explicitness. Here Schank s system is distinctive. Wilks's opinion is that the amount of detailed inference that a system may perform must be llmited not to go beyond 'commpn sense'.. As an example he mentioned Schank's analysis of the action of eating (performed by moving the hands to the mcuth) and de- 1 scribed it as Ugoing too far from the meaning' of eating, whatever that may be, towards generally true information about the act which, if always inferred about all acts a£ eating, will carry the system unmanageably far. . . . There clearly is a danger of taking inferences to a phenomenological level beyond that of common sense,\" he concluded. TUTORIAL ON COMPUTATIONAL SEMANTICS 55 DEGOUPLING. The issue is whether the actual parsing of text fnto an understanding system is essential.. Charniak and Minskr believe that this initial parsing can be decoupled. In Wilks's","paragraphs":["opinion this is not so, because he belkeves semantic analysis to be fundamental"]},{"title":"and because many of the later inferences would actually have to be done already, in order to have achieved the initial parsing. Also the problem of systematic ambiguity may be met much more efficiently with a system that does not decouple the parsing from","paragraphs":["rhe inference procedure. AVAILABILITY OF SURFACE STRUCTURE."]},{"title":"In first and second generation systems it is generally accepted that word-sense is a. closely associated with the surface structure of the sentence, but Schank has made a point of the-nonavailability of the surface structure, on the grounds that an ideal representation should be totally independent of the input surface structnre and words. In connection with this claim of Schank's, Wilks pointed out two things: in many cases the order of the sentences in.a text is part of its surface structure, and this information should be available in some way. The other point conceined the form of =epresentation employed Wilks was not sure that a structure of primitlves. is sufficient for specifying and distinguishing word senses adequateLy without transferring information specifically associated with the input word. APPLICATION. This concerned the way in which different systems display, in the structures they manipulate, the actual procedures of application-of those structures to input text or TUTORIAL ON COMPUTATIONAL SEMANTICS dialogue Here the most distinctive. system is that of Wfnograd where the procedural notation, by its nature, tends to make clear the way in which the structures are applied. In","paragraphs":["hi6 view, as stated in some of his more recent writings, the control structure of an understanding program is itself of theoretical significance, for only"]},{"title":"with a control structure, he believes, can natural language programs of great size and complexity remain perspicuous. FORWARD INFERENCE. IS it neaessary to make massive forward inferences as one goes through a text., as Charniak and Schank do, or can one adopt some laziness hypothesis' about understanding and generate deeper inferences only qhen the system is unable to solve, say, a referential problem by more superficial methods? Charniak's argument is that, unless forward inferences are made during the","paragraphs":["analysis, the system will not in general be able to solve ambiguity or reference problems that arise later. Wilks had some theoretical difficulties. tn arguing against this view, and he admitted the difficulty of defining a degree of forward inference that aids the solution of later semantic problems without going int~ unnecessary depth THE JUSTIFICATION OF SYSTEMS. Finally Wilks tried to contrast. the different modes of justification implicitly appealed to in terms of the power of the inferential system employed, of the provision and\"formalizatfon, of a system's actual performance, and of the linguistic or psychological. plausibility of the proffered system of representation."]},{"title":"TUTORIAL ON COMPUTATIONAL SEMANTICS 57 In","paragraphs":["his conclusion"]},{"title":"Wilks","paragraphs":["concentrated on those areas where the greatest problems within the field"]},{"title":"of A1","paragraphs":["are found.
