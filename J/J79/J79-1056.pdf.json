Thus The window hit would be ill-formed on that view because, although it contains the obligatory object, it contains neither the agent nor the instrument of the hitting, However, (3) The window broke would be perfectly well-formed with respect to the frame for 'break', This sort of case analysis 1s normally zalled deep case *to distinguish it from the surface case manifestation of word inflections in Greek, Lati'n and German etc. It should be noted, too, that here, as through-out the paper, no attempt is made to stick to the actual list of case names used by any author, since these vary sd much from one to the next, and no point of principle hangs on arYy particular list of cases, ~illrnore' s linguls tic theory is, naturally enough, a generative one in that the procedures it suggests would be those for generating sentences from an underlying structure of a verb plus its case argument values.

In this paper, I Ishall concentrate, as is normal if not desirable in A1 and computational linguistics, Qn questions of analys~s rather than generation. The general problen in analysis (that is not emphasised in generation) is that of the selection restrictions on the cases, which can be illustrated by looking at the simplest of the systems using case analysis (Simmons 1973). Simmons wishes to map all of the sentences (4) (7) onto the same semantic network because a11 four, in some sense, refer to the szme event: (4) John broke the window with a hammer (5) John broke the window (6) The hammer broke the window (7) The window broke All are perfectly well-formed with respect to the franc for \"break1' given earlier. Simmons parses such sentences using an augmented transition network (Woodst1970) and a notion of case paradigm due to Celce-Murcia (1972). This paradigm, for active forms of a verb llke \"break\", has the form: (8) AGENT"]},{"title":"* OBJECT INSTRUMENT AGENI * CBJECT","paragraphs":["INSTRUMEIJT"]},{"title":"*","paragraphs":["OBJECT OBJECT A The lines of (8) are patterns that must match input word strings in left right order so as to assign the cases they contain, The lines of (8) match each of (4)"]},{"title":"-","paragraphs":["(7) in turn, where marks the posltion of the verb (break) in each line of the paradigm, The lines of (8) are no more than the possible case combinations allowed by the case frame","11 for \"break\" together with an analytic version of the subject selection rule\", which always makes the Agent the first (subject) item In any line of the paradigm (8) in which it occurs, There is no need for the lines of (8) to be ordered In their application to input sentences, although there is one additional. item of information required before they can be applied at all: the selection restrictions, These tell us what it is to be an agent of \"break\": in Simons's scheme a noun marked ANIMATE, The selection restrictions attached to the cases in (8) are essential t~ the application of the paradlgrn, for only thus could we know that \"~ohn\" in (4) was matched by ACZENT in the flrst line of (8). It should be noted that the restriction of AGENT in (8) to nouns m%rked ANIMATE is not necessarily a restriction peculiar to 'break', but rather to the class of verbs for which (8) is the (active) paradigm. Conversely, the ANIMATE restriction on AGEPU'Ts in (8) IS not necessarily on AGENTS as such although it might turn out to be so, These points will be important when we come to Chamiak's arguments later. Notice too, that there are not two different ways In which a sentence can be ill-formed with respect to the paradigm: one with respect to selection restrictions and one with respect to the case frame (as has been argued by Bruce 1975). The case frame expressed by the paradigm, and the corresponding selection restrictions are indivisible. So, for example, (9) John broke is ill-formed with respect to the case frame for \"break\" as explained earlier, However, if we look at that fact in procedural /terms, such as those provided by Simmons' paradigm, we cannot deem that failure as one of matching a line of (8) as distinct from (Bruce's view) not meeting the select~on restr~ctions PHYSOB"]},{"title":",","paragraphs":["say, on the case OBJECT on the fourth line of (8).

In (34) John shot the girl ~ith a rifle the underlying primitive is PROPEL which 5oms the center of any conceptualization for \"shoot\".

In ~chank's scheme Instrumental case iz~volves the insertion of another primitive action into the conceptualizationo gut that is not essential to rhe present point which is that, for Schank, PROPEL \"expects\" an instrument, and criteria can be postulated such that a rifle will fit those criteria, in a way that hair will not, as in (35) john- shot the"]},{"title":"6irl","paragraphs":["with long hair.

SENATE SCIENCE REID TECHNqLbGY COE1MITl'EE AE~P@WIZATIQN The Scnate in recent bearlngs considered three alternative plans to re-structure its complex syqtom of 174 subco~fttees which relate to science and technology. The Temporary Selecr committee to Study the senate Conmittee System is- focusing on this ated by considering primarily three alternative plans which, if adopted. wolrld bd subject to furyeher nodif'cation. The first plan would retain the existing committee organization, but would significantly reduce. the number of committee members and reorganize committee jurisdic~ions . This plan inuolves se~eral~diffeerent options, one of which would create a Committee on Science and Technology which woula have jurisdiction over science, engineering and technolog (including aeronautics and space) its oversight jurisdiction would enconpars the new White house Office of Sciettce and Technolagy Policy, the Naeional Bureau of Standards, the National Science Foundatipg r and the Congressional Office d Technology Ass~ssmeM. The second plan would consolidate the existing thirtr -one committees into twelve standing committees, with a possible option to again create a Cornif tee on Science and Technology.. The third plan would create five broad co~1ttees on goyernnient humah, natural and financial resources, apd on defense and for~ign policy, each of which would have responsibilities for relcv~t agcqcies in the Executive Branch. The Senate is expected to deal with these proposals when the 95th Congress convenes next year.
