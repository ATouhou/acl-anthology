A part-whole relation is used in Figure 4 to show the relation of \"handle\" to \"axe\". This relation differs from other eyntagmatic relations in that it connects nodes of the same type, emge, two entities. A case can be made for this relation to be considered a paradigmatic relation; for the present it has been put in with the syntagmatic mainly because it is not used by the process of inheritance, of which more later. Discursive RelatLons Propositions do not occur in isolation. They are tied together in cognition in a number of ways. The spatial, temporal, and causal connections are characterized by$iclcursive ares. Intuitively th~e are relations between whole propositions and it is to fail to capture this feeling if, say, a cause relation directly link8 two event nodes. Modality nodes are uaed to represent situations in Which the whole proposition la involved. Though schematically linked to an event node; conceptually the modality belonse to the whole propoeition. Discursive arca relate the modalities of propositions. Thus \"Mary slapped John because he chased her\" is represented as in Figure 5.

Others (Schank, 1975a; Halllday","paragraphs":["&"]},{"title":"Haaan, 1975) distinguish three kinds ~f causation: reason, result, and purpose. The single cause relation of the encyclopedia models the first tw direcrly. Purpose (or enabling) causation is seen as separable into cauae together wf th a desire for the consequent. For example, a cup may fell causing it to break. The fall could be accidental or it could be deliberate with the purpose of breaking the cup . The same causal relation exists between the actions in both cases, but the analysis of the putposive situation will in-lve \"desire\". Time arcs do permit subdivision.

This definiens is encoded in rigure 6. \"Tragedy\" names a single node.

In general there nay be any number of levels of modalities related by part-whole. To complete the association of the definiendum with its deftniens, a metallngual (PEL) arc links the former to the appropriate modality in the latter, Figure 6. If any situation matches the definiens, then the abstract term is appropriate. The process of matching will be discussed later. The definiendum can also be any concept, the choice is fdiosyncrattc; there is no reason why this device cannot be used with apparently non-abstract concepts, for example, a dog could be \"man's best iriend\" for sowk, in contrast with a non-abstrabt definition of \"canine","paragraphs":["animal\" Wn-abstract definitions have the form \"genus-specificata\".
