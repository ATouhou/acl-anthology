ON A SYNTAX ANALYSIS METHOD FOR DEPENDENCY GRAMMARS IN A SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEM SHUN-ICHI TAKEYA The importance of linguistic information for successful speech recognition has long been aoknowledged. In most systems, however, word segmentation is performed sequentially from the top of the input utterance (i.e, left-to-right), and use of syntactic information is mainly intended to constrain which words are to be matched with input. Such a scheme oft& comes to a deadlock, when it encounters an extremely indistinct part in an utterance. This paper proposes a system in which a syntax analyzer uses a top-down, breadth-first strategy. We use a dependency grammar to describe syntactic structures. Dependency grammars were introduced by Hays and, in comparison with CG grammars, (1) can represent directly relations between terminals, (2) nonterminals correspond to word classes, (3) every expansion of a nonterminal produces a word corresponding to it. These features, especially (2) and (3) , are very convenient for speech recognition. Namely, using a top-down parsing, we can analyze input by catching words successively. The physical inputs for our system are utterances of the sentences which are generated by a dependency grammar. The first part of the system processes an input utterance according to its physical features; the output is an incomplete phoneme sequence"]},{"title":"Q.","paragraphs":["The second part processes"]},{"title":"Q","paragraphs":["under the control of part 3 and brings out a word sequence: Part 3 chooses an initial nonterminal and continues to expand nonterminals."]},{"title":"At","paragraphs":["each expansion, part 3 attempts word matches in Q.

FERRARI AND 1 PRODANOF The MD, i.e. a list bf lemmatized form$ of Italian, was conceived both as an instrument in the procedure of lemmatization and as the nucleus for research. This initial precept has demanded, inter alia, our cotnplete neutrality in relation to all thoeries. The list of entries has been defined a priori as the largest possible. All forms have been generated; archaic, popular, and rare ones included. Every record was provided with the information defining both some relationships between lemmas and different linguistic subsets to which they belong. An updating procedure, adding missing words and new information, has been set up. The creation of computational models implies a change of our original theoretical neutrality. From this point of view, the MD ceases to be a simple list of lexical units and must be considered as a machine composed of a nucleus of data and a series of procedures working various lirrwistic levels. The dictionary is situated between lexicology, motphology syntax and semantics. Between the latter two, the boundary is not precise, but from the theoretical and practical views, no refined analysis is possible wlthout using 8 dictionary. It is particularly important to have a partially autonomous idea of the dictionary as a unitary image of lexical competence. In practical terms it is possible to associate with each lexical unit information which represents lexical competence and also may be interpreted algorithmically dnd converted into specific codes for each level of analysis.

SECTIQN 2.3 This paper describes a framework for a unif$.ed approach to four major problems: Integration of contributions and interactions of multiple knowledge sources; cooperation; evaluation; and attention to avoid thrashing among a number of competing alternatives. These problems result from entering the large space of possibilities in a language with error prone, imprecise knowledge. In the attempt to develop speech understanding for a substantial subset of natural English these problems have been unavoidable. We choose the phrase as the basis for integration; it is the natural unit of structure and meaning. A parse net brings together all*attempts to construct a particular category of phrase starting or ending at a particular location in the input. To reduce the cost of evaluation, heuristic methods are used to search the parse net for a bes't path. To shift attention when the first selection leads to poor results, our system first puts words in focus when an incomplete phrase including them is selected for processing, and then inhibits work on other phrases that are incansistent with the focus, by lowering the priority of tasks. If a phrase in conflict with focus overcomes the bias against it. the system's attention shifts to a new focus. Illustrations of the use of this framework for language understanding are drawn from the speech understanding system being developed jointly by SRI and SDC. SECTION 2.4 SEMANTICS IN AID OF AUTOMATIC TRANSLATION THOMAS R.

SAM incorporates one dynamic response technique. 'Why' questions demand that a causality be identified; but we can ask for the causation behind acts that did not take place. Since the static memory representation does not embody information about nonactivities, some dynamic processing is needed. Such a question makes sense only if there is a possibility that the questioned event could have happened. SAM can generate paths of this type; to see these ghost paths, we point to the places where interferences or unusual things occurred and tell SAM to generate default paths from the immediately prior points. Once an act in question is found in a ghost path, we can answer by tracing the ghost path back up to the branch point and returning the interference or unusual occurrence. Use of ghost paths is a dynamic response technique. Ghost paths do not carry information about everything that didn't happen, but I would claim that they contain everything you need to know. An intelligent program should know when a question is out of line; a program which has access to ghost paths will be able to recognize and process reasonable questions.

The version of SAM on which this paper is based consists of an analyzer to convert surface text into a Conceptual Dependency format; a script applier to build up a story representation, postprocessing programs to construct summary or paraphrase or answer questions; and a generator to render these structures into natural language. A co-routine control regime was selected to simulate close coordination among deep condeptual and input/output processes. We emphasize here the operation of the script applier. SAM can handle references to three sources of knowledge in a uniform manner. \"General knowledge about a situation\" is contained in the scripc itself as a network of patterns with embedded roles. !'Specific knowledge about a situation\" becomes accessible when a situation is invoked. \"Quasi-logical\" knowledge is obtained by inferences. The primary scriptal constructs used to control access to world knowledge are static context, a high-priority search list of patterns to match new inputs, and the script paths themselves. The paper discusses application of tHese constructs in interaction among modules. SECTION 3.2 APPLICATION DE TECHNIQUES RELEVANT DE L.

A measure of the morphological homonymy appearing in the paradigms of grammatical categories is given by the index of morphological homonymy. According tothis index, nouns and adjectives are organized by couples of two or three noun or adjective forms, this behavior being found within the distribution classes and the elementary graohnatical categorfes as well. With respect to the verb, the number of elementary categories is much bigger, mainly beacuse of the graphical aspect varying from one petson to the other.

Thus, it is surprising that so little work on abstractions of the context free parsing problem has been done by computational linguists This paper reports the results of such an investigation which Are strikingly at variance with widely held beliefs on the subject. The major evaluation criteria for any algorithm are the amounts of time and space it requires for its worst case. Thus, the first question is what aspects of a contekt free parser allow it to achieve polynomial, rather than exponential, parsing (the limiting case achieved by enumerating all SECTION 6 59 finite derivations). Although many different properties (including \"parallel\" searching, the avaidance of backtracking, etc.) have be& proposed, it is shown that one such property, use of a well formedlsubstring table both holds for all known polynomial parsers, and can be shown to be sufficient in and of itself to produce polynomial behavior."]},{"title":"(A","paragraphs":["parser has the wellformed substring property bff the results of analyzing any substring of the input in t&ms of some nonterminal of the grammar are recorded so that such an analysis is performed at most once, irrespective of how many times the analysis may be used during the parsing.) The proof proceeds by showing that the search space for such a parser is polynomially bounded, without reference to the order in which it is ~earched. Furthermore, the specific bound placed on the search space allows the cubic bound for Chomsky Normal Form grammars, and the quadratic bound for linear grammars to be shown as corollaries of this result. The WFS result is very surprising given the wide range of algorithms that have been proposed to achieve this effect. It specifically refutes the widespread conjecture that backtracking parsers are inherently exponential. It implies that other aspects of the algorithm may be chosen independently to optimize other aspects of performance, while the WFS preserves the polynomial bound.

On the other hand, as there is no procedure for determining whether an arbitrary cfg is ambiguous, it is highly desirable that the same parser used in the general case have quadratic behavior on an unambiguous grammar.

(The top down strategy precludes linear bounds for the LR(k) grammars but, as outlined above, this is not considered a drawback.) Furthermore, the use of depth first search results in very good performance on highly ambiguous grammars. Consequently, although the worst cas* is still cubic, the parser rarely approaches this bound for inputs accepted by the grammar. Three major concIusions are drawn from this study. First is the paramount importance of the WFS table for any algorithm dealing with languages with context free subsets. The strong evidence for its necessity and sufficiency for polynomial parsing ivdicates that natural language systems should strive for a structure that permits efficient use of this device. Second is the irrelevance of many of the issues that have SECTION 6 6i3 been claimed to be of major importance in this area. Fi'nally, based on these conclusions, the recursive descent algorithm was developed. Because of its top down approach and its close parallel to the generative model of context free grammar, it is easily both understood and proven correct. Because of' its use of the WFS table and depth firsiz search, it is as efficient as any parsing algorithm known. For both these reasons it is suggested both as a pkdagogical tool and as a practical context free parser. SECTION 6 -1 THE TRAVEL BUDGET MANAGER'S ASSISTANT The program is a vehicle for studying natural language text and speech understanding. Its task is to aid in planning and allocating money for trips. It needs a diverse array of knowledge about acoustic signals, phonetics, syntax, semantics, travel budgets, etc. For this system to be comprehensible, debuggable, and capable of improvement, it must be clean, understaridable and efficient in organization. Each component can be developed and tested independently, yet can interact conveniently with the others. The flow of information between components is explicit. Four components (Syntax, Semantic Interpreter, Retrieval, and Audio-Response Generator), together with the System Controller, function as a corrlplete text understanding system. In processing spoken input, 'the System ControlLer activates the real-time interface to acquire the qignal, th,en the signal processing component to compute phrameters, then the Acoustic Phonetic Recognition component to produce a segment lattice for input to the Lexical Retrieval component. Control then passes tothe Speech Understanding Controller which uses the Syntactic, Semantic, Lexical Retrieval, and Verification components to arrive at a mbdel of the-utterance. In this paper we consider explicit representation of interaction and information flow ainong compofients; isolation of factors which determine how and when interactions should occut; and evaluation of component effectiveness.

We treat natural language utterance's to be run in our brains. The environrnenf contains the data bases representing the knowledge and abilities of the person. In every moment of discourse we have at least one environment, that of the narrator; in reported speech we have a choice of at least two, since that of the person referred to is available.

SECTION 7.3 ANALYSIS OF JAPAJNESE SENTENCES BY USING SEMANTIC AND CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION.. M. NAGA~ AND J.

When we find a conjunctive postposition, we search out the word in the following string with deepest semantic similarity to the head preceding the postposition, The meanings of analyzed sentences are represented in the form of a semantic network (Sirmn~ns et al.). We search it to find words for empty case elements. A trap list holds pending questions until later sentences can answer them The parser is an ATN; semantic and contextual functions are programmed in LISP 1.6. Results for sentences from a junior high school chemistry textbook range around 90%.

We start by regarding wery sentence as having a (possibly de-leted) perfamative verb which characterizes the speaker's intent and the illocutionary force of the utterance.

The content of the proposition, however, is but one* of the communicative functions of the speech act marked in the Fo contour. We present extensive evidence that modalZty items, used to represent. the speaker \"S attachment to the truth value 4 of the prc~asition, are characteristically marked by Fo since they fulfill the interpersonal function in the communicative act.

Since these effects are largely Independent of the position of the modality item, they can be predicted from knowledge of the presence alone of these interpersonal markers Once the ideational and interpersonal communicative functions have been represented in the Fo contour, it $till remains to inchud~ textual or discourse effects due to focus-shifting transformations and shared knowledge with the 1ia tener (s) To study these phenomena, another corpus was recorded by three speakers.

Examples include \"A carrot was eaten by the farmer.\" and \"Never has the farmer eaten carrots. 11 Once again, we show that each of these transformations is as-sociated with a chasacteristic Fo gesture, which is urilized by the speaker to display to the listener(s) the focus of the utterance. Xithin this corpus, the effect of new and old information is also studied, including repeated items, pronouns, and ellipsis. As expected, it is the new items that form the focus and receive Fo accent. From these studies, a comprehehsive model fox Fo contours is derived, which accounts for a wide variety of speech act phenomena, as described above.

A decision algorithm is given which is almost the same for the four levels, except that the constraints to be taken into account at some steps are of different strength. Moreover, the algorithm gives, as a secondary result, the possibility of rewriting the two given grammars, i'f similar, in such a way that the structural equivalence implies a 1:l correspondence between the rules of the rewritten grammars.
