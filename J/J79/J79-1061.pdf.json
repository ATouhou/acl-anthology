INTRODUCTION There are a number of extant computer programs which interact intelligently with human interrogators, but all do so in a way we characteriee as \"unnatural\". By \"unnatural,\" we mean that they converse in a way significantly unlike two normal adult humans do.

As an example of a \"natural\" and an \"unnatural\" dialogue, imagine two computer programs (CPs) conversing with a human (H) in which each CP already knows \"THE BOY O~JNS A BALL.\" One CP is \"natural\" (NCP); the other is \"unnatural\" (uCP)"]},{"title":".","paragraphs":["(One may find fragments of responses from esisting programs in those responses we have labelled as \"UCP.\") H: The ball is red.

From this short, simple dialogue some of the characteristics which distinguixh \"natural\" dialogue can be seen: \"natural\" language understanding processes are able to work with partial and overlapping information, are able to retain ambiguity until disambigation is needed, are able to perform \"short\" chains of deductions, are able to engage in common sense reasoning, and are able to pose reciprocal questions to the human to confirm expectations. Reasons for trying to instill a certain degree of \"humanness1' to computer proBrams should be obvious--to facilitate their acceptance, to extend their use, and to make them more pleasant to deal with. People will be much more willing ro work with a computer program if it gives the appearance of being humanoid itself, whether the kernel part of Che program concerns CAT, MIS, or whatever."]},{"title":"- 7-","paragraphs":["We have developed a computer program called JIMMY3 which embodies some of the abave set of characteristics of a \"natural1' language processing system so as to demonstrate its feasibility, usefulness, and potential power. The implementation has necessarily been largely ad hoc, but as Lindsay [6] notes, this is not altogether bad. Mewell [7] proper1.y records that there is a tradeoff between generality and power. Like Lindsay, we deliberately eschew the general in favor of the specific. In the interests of replicability and extensibility, we also provide a reasonably complete description of the inards of JIMMY3. 1.1 MAJOR GOALS The focus of this work has been on three problems: a) the development ~f a memory structure useful for engaging in a dialogue with a person, b) the development of procedures that can easily and accura-tely determine the meaning of input text, and c) the development of procedures for the generation of output. As contrasted with more conventional models for language understanding where input is decoded in terms of concepts and then mapped into memory, this model storcs surface structures more or less intact without any conversion. This approach simplifies both the input processing and output generation phases of the system. However, it does necessitate the use of complex memory matching procedures during the answer-producing phase-of understanding. For parsing, several ad hoc rules were developed for applxing a metric to measure \"meaningfulness.\" Using this procedure, several different interpretations of the input are examined. The one having the highest \"score,\" as determined by the metric, is selected as the proper meaning. Most memorymodels and undez'standing systems do not have elaborate .facilities for the creatibn of output that is interesting or stimulating to conversation. Output production by this program approaches solutions to three relafed problems: a) what information should be used in the 9esponse to a given input, b) how a response can be structured so certain parts are emphasized an$ c) how B Tesponse can be made tp appear natural in the sense of being like a similar remark a person might make. 1.2 SAMPLE DIALOGUE To get a feeling for the types of responses the currentJy Implemented program CBn produce, the following short dialogue is presented. Note that with only the capability for answering W-questions implemeqted, a continuing dialogue is not very easy to obtain. Three explicit facts existed in remory at the time of this conversation. They were: 1) BRANDT -JELL OWNS A RED BOOK. 2) BRANDT MAXWELL OWNS A BLUE BOOK. 3) JIMMY3 KNOWS BRANDT MAXWELL.","(this computer model has been dubbed JIMElY3) The dialogue is given in upper case with commentary in lower case.

JIMMY3 must find out who it is talking with in orderr to translate the pronoun \"I\" to facilitate memory searching. p : BdANDT MAXWELL. OK. BR@DT@MAXWELL is rtcognized as a legitimate name. The @ in BRANDT@EWLL is used to indicate the combining of two or more words to form a Separate erttity. In the above example, the names BRANDT and WELL are recognized as first and last names, respectively, that, when appearing together, are interpreted as the full name, BRANDT@MAXWELL.","W YOU KNOW MSNE?","YES, YOU. Parsing is accomplished by matching input to templates consisting of (ACTOR ACT OBJECT) describing the different meaning senses for main verbs. This question is parsed using the (PERSON KNOW PERSON) definition of KNOW. On input, YOU is translated to JIEIMY3 (which has ISA PERSON as one of its properties). Memory is matched against the (JIMMY3 KNOW PERSON) pattern which yields the match (JIEIMY3 KNOWS BRANDT@MAxwELL)'. Output procedures then cdnvert the match into-the given response. DO YOU KNOW BILL MAXWELL? NO. The search using (JIMMY3 KNOW BILLeMAXWELL) yields no match. Under other circumstances a failure of thjs type would produce an answer of \"I DON'T KNOW\".

In these systems, the other features of a complete language understanding system assume a background position since the main emphasis is the memory model itself.

It is not based nn case grammar in a strict sense, but stores informat5on in a form more closely related to surface Qtructures utilizing only three main components: actor, act and object. Although this development was influented to a limited extent by Anderson and Bower's model [I], it was shaped In actual design by the parser Osed by Wilks (gce below) which attempts to find meaning by searching for triples. Wilks' work was also influential in the development oP the parser. 1.3.2 LINGUISTIC PARSERS In the area of linguistic parsers, there are currently four different methods betng used. They are: a) semantic triples, b) augmented transition networks, c) procedures and d) pat tern matching. These can be described most easily by examining specific examples of each. The parser developed by Yorick Wilks [17, 181 is based on identifying triples composed of an actor, an act and an object. Input is parsed by applying trial templates to the input and identifying candidates to fill the three slots in a template. The association of an input word with a template slot is made by consideratiom of the -12-semantic relationship between the input word and the requirements of the slot, The closer the relationship, the better the match, and therefore, the better the parse. The choice between several potential parsings of an input string is detennined by a scheme for computing the qemantic density of the parse based on the dumber and types of matches that are obtainkd by filling the slots in the triple. Assuming English is a redundant language, tbe parse having the greatest density is the one which contains the most interconnections and, therefnre, is the one to be accepted as the correct parse. An important feature of Wilks' system is that syntactic properticis of words take a role secondary to that assumed by the semantic properties. Thus it is possible to determine t.he meaning of input which is ill-formed and grammatically ipcorrect. Augmented transition networks have been used for &me time as a method for parsing. The principal system utilizing this method is the NASA lunar rocks system developed by Woods [20]. The parser used by th LNR group [lo] is of similar design. While this technique is very flexible in allowing a large grammar to be consistently modelled, most implementations of it have been strictly syntactic. Little attempt has been made to incorporate semantic knowledge into the parsing. Without semantic knowledge, and using the strict grammatical rules embedded in the transition ne'tuorks, this approach is really very brittle. It is not capable of handling ungrammatical input with much success. -in-Clqsely related to the augmented transition network approach is the use of procedures to describe a gramar as exemplified hy Winograd's program [lg]. This system is also predominately syntactic in nature. All information about the grammar is represented in terms of actual toutines whioh are invoked during parsing. The input analyzer used in Colby's Artificial Paranoia modbl. [5] is essentially a pattern matcher which uses a few tricks to normalize all input to short strings whibb it hopes to recognize. It is not really either syntactically or semanrlcally based but depends mostly on transformations to reduce input to simple, empirically derived, recognizable forms. The power of this approach lies in its ability tg accept even the most ungrammatical input and relate it tc sodething which is already known. Thus, there is a given context in which all input is interpreted-- the context of what the model knows and wants to continue talking about. 1.3.3 OUTPUT GENERATION Perhaps the work on output production which has most influenced the current program is the model by Colby [5]. As described in the previous section, input is recognized by reduction to simple identifiable patterns which can be matched to prestored strings in the program's memory. Also included in the memory are corresponding sets of strings which are to be used as output. Fixed responses are selected based on the current state of the program's self model; the state of its mgdel of the person and the previous conversation. This technique gives the appearance of a normal, humanlike dialogue. Thfs approach is successful because conversation is always di-rected-in one particular, very narrow, direction by the way input is understood. The context is fixed and must not deviate from a single 2.

The parsing procedure is driven by heuristics to do a search of the most IikBly parse networks. In case of ambiguity, several parse networks can be passed to the !uemurymatch routine.

The response Is generated by procedures operating on the memory matches. The value of the match score determines generally what the response content should be.

MEMORY. This is the model's long term memory--essentially a collection of interrelated nodes. A node is the smallest packet of information in MISElORY that can Be referenced by a single pointer (either a WORDLIST pointer or a pointer from another node.) The information contained in a node may describe or modify a single word or symbol or may be a collection of relations connecting several nodes into a more complex structure. information stored in nodes describing single words is varied and includes such items as part of speech, inflectional variations and subset or superset names. Other types of data, for exampld, events and statements of fact, are formed by nodes that contain polnter structures relating other nodes in a predetermined fashion. TENPORARY STRUCTURES. There are three basic memory structures of a transient nature that can exist during the processing required to determine meaning and produce an answer. They are: a) the parse network, b) the memory match structure, and c) the output production list.

Another example of a chain is the list of color nodes: RED, BLUE and GREEN. A singly linked list exdsts through these nodes but in addition, each of the three points back to the node for COLOR--the node which points to the first color in the list. The more important links currently used to form chains are described next. DEFN. The DEFN link is used to tie together all nodes that represent different definitions for a word.

However, they are one of the major substructures appearing in MEMORY so will be considered here briefly. These nodes or collections of nodes are the data strings which are used to drive the parser and in that capacityl will be described later. Essentially they contain ordered lists of semantic categories representing potential modification patterns for words, These lists are applied by the parser to determine semantically acceptable word strings in the input that can moaify other word strings. For example, a noun would have a list describing the types of adjectives that could modify it. Tor adjectives, there would be a list of potential adverb types. Each definition of every word in MEMORY that is to be recognized during parsing of input must have attached to it a semantic rnudification node. In cases where many words have the same node, the structure for semantic modification is implemented as a chain through-all words having the same modification requirements. 3.4 NODES Nodes in MEMORY are represented as fixed-size blocks of contiguous disk or core locations and are the smallest units of MEMORY that can be referenced. Each node is composed of links and variable length attributes which may be data or pointers to other nodes. All the space allocated to a node does not have to be used. In fact, most nodes use only part of their allocated space to contain attributes; the remainder is empty (zero). The current model uses a size of 8 words for its nodes. (This size was not determined ebnpirically as the optimum size but was, instead, selected because of disk hardware considerations,) The first word of every node in MEMORY is used for bookkeeping and, therefore, is not available for storing -26-attributes. Contained in the first word is the node number itself, an indicator of &he kind of node plus a pointer that gives The next word of the node available for use as a 3 Lnk or variable length attribute.

There are eight different kinds of nodes in memory, each with its own function. The Kinds are TYPE, SIMPLE GENERIC, ACTION GENERIC, CONTUT GENERIC, SIlPLE.INSTANCE, ACTION INSTANCE, CONTEXT INSTANCE and SEMANTIC MODIFICATION. Each ha@ a different purpose in the representation of information in MEMORY. Briefly, their purposes are as follows. The TYPE node is used as the reference point between the WORDLIST. and MEMORY. The three GENERIC nodes are used to specify syntactic and semantic information associated with words and substructures given by the INSTANCE nodes. The INSTANCE nodes are used to represent actual instances of words or facts. SEMANTIC MODIFICATION nodes are used to cdntain information required by the parser to help direct its selection of the modification patterns during parsing of the input.

SIMPLE nodes reprebent single words, ACTION nodes are used to represent triples and CONTEXT nodes are used for preposf tional phrases. TYPE.

The <DO> component is found only in DO-questions. The question mark and period are the only terminating punctuation symbols currently allowed. All of these components are expanded in Table 2 in a BNF-like format. Additional restrictions currently imposed upon the input are the following: 1. No relative clauses are allowed. 2. No compound units (subject, verb, etc.) are allowed. Elements in Table 2 enclosed in < > are non-terminal elements of the grammar. Such elements- enclosed in ( ) are optional. In the definition of <ACTOR> and <OBJECT>, the left and right modi-Eication is to the imediate left or right of the word being modified. In the case of <ACT>, however, the <adverb> and <context phrase> modification can occur anywhere in the sentence. Usually the single word modifiers are adjacent to the ACT but do not have to be. The <context phrase>s usually appear at the beginning of the sentence or somewhere after the ACT. In the case of the last five definitions in Table 2, i.e., cleft modification> through cadverb>, there are restrictions on the nodes which are applicable at that point in the parsing. Some examples of the types of modification allowed are: cleft modification> of a noun a blue animal book cleft modification> of an adj ective a very blue sky <right modification> of a noun a friend of mlne in June to the house yesterday not 4.2.2 SEMANTICS AND SYNTAX Semantics and syntax have been integrated throughout the parsing procedure so that both work together in the selection of appropriate words and phrases out of which the parse network is constructed. When matching an ACTION GENEP.IC node to the input, syntax is used first to identify nouns as potential ACTORS and OBJECTS. Then the semantic acceptability of each is verified by comparing the word with the semantic class specified by the trtple. Syntax is checked by a simple matching of the part of speech. Proper word order within a grammatical subunit IS maintained automaticall by the way the modification requirements are set up. A word is deemed semantically acceptable if it matches the semantic class listed as a requirement, or if a word upward in its hierarchy matches the semantic class. For example, suppose the candidate is BRANDT and the required semantic class la PERSON. In the hierarchy containing BRANDT we have BRANDT (ISA) BOY (ISA) PERSON. At that polnt there is a match on PERSON, so BRANDT would be semantically acceptable. -36-4.2.3 PRONOUNS, AMBIGUITY AND UNDEFINED WORDS The currently implemented version of the program provides for only very simple treatment of pronouns, On input, \"I\" pronouns (I, Me, MY, etc.) are translated to the name of the person talking. \"YOU\" pronouns are translated to JIMMY3. Similarly, on output, the person's name and JIMMY3 are translated back to \"YOU\" and \"I\", respectively. Ambiguity ie not a problem in this model. If two parse networks have identical scores, ambiguity is resolved by the memory matching scheme. All networks are matched against lremory in the attempt to locate an answer. If several matches come out equally likely, they can all be reported. This simple-minded approach works well by relating the input to what the program knows. Throughout the program, undefined words in the input are ignored. However, their text representations are saved so they can be printed later to help explain, say, why the program was unable to interpret the input. As illustrated by one line of the sample conversatian in section 1, the response to \"DO I HAVE AN OLD BOOK?\" was \"YES. A RED ONE. I DON'T KNOW WllhT OLD MEANS.\" T11e input was interpreted as if it had been \"DO I HAVE AN BOOK?\". 4.3 PARSING ALGORITHM There are two operations performed on the Input text before it 1s actually parsed: a) preprocessing of the text In an effort to 11 standardize\" it and b) the determination of the type of input recelved so the proper parsing technique can be selected. -37-4.3.1 PREPROCESSING OF THE: INPUT TEXT The first operation perfonaed on the input is the translation of each defined component to its TYPE node pointer to MEMORY. Undefined input items are converted to null pointers. After the translation to TYPE node pointers, the input is checked for standard greetings or cliches that usually elicit a standard response. Examples are \"IIELLO. HOW"]},{"title":"ARE","paragraphs":["YOU?\", \"HI\", \"GOODBYE\", etc. The second type of preprocessing is the attempted reductioh of words and phrases to simpler forms. This approach can be used for the reduction of slang, misspelled words, idioms, names, etc. Stoled in the TYPE nodes for input items that can be reduced are context strings in which an item can occur plus its replacement form. 4.3.2 DETERMINING TYPE OF INPUT This part of the parsing algorithm 2s where the kznd of input, i.e., DO-question, IS-question, Wh-question, declarative statement, etc., is deter mined. Questions can be detected by the presence of the question mark at then end. Discrimination of questions into classes of YES-NO, or Wh-is determined almost completely by the first word of the question. The only questions not correctly classifled by this approach are those with inverted order, e.g., \"IiE ASKED A QUESTION, DIDN'T HE?\" and hypothetical questions, e.g."]},{"title":",","paragraphs":["\"IF I ASK A QUESTION. WHAT WILL YOUR ANSWER BE?\". Any input that ends with a period and does not begln with a verb 18 classifled as a statement, Text that does not end with either a question mark or a perlod is xejected with a request that the person supply punctuation with his input. 4.3.3 PARSING A DO-QUESTION OR STATEMENT The DO-question and the statement are parsed in identical fashion after the DO-word which begins the question is stripped off and the final punctuation ia thrown away. An exhaustive approach to parsing has been selected for implementation rather that one designed to use prediction coupled with backup facilities. This decision was made partly on technical grounds--the inherent difficulty in implementing such a parser in FORTRAN. A more important consideration, though, was the attractiveness of working with the input as a whole using the matching of templates (GENERIC ACTION nodes) rather than parsing in a serial fashion whereby components are recognized in some left-to-right decoding process. The algorithm in Figure 5 describes how the parser works.

Apply left modification to the ACTOR, i.e., form a noun group that consiste of the ACTOR plus all its modification that lies to its immediate left. This includes all adjectives and determiners. 2. Apply left modification to the OBJECT. This process is identical to that used to get left modification of the ACTOR. 3. Find CONTEXT modification of the ACT.

Find right modification for the OBJECT. 6. Locate single word (adverb) modification of the ACT, This process works from right to left through all remaining unattached words of the input. As each modification is identified, nodes are attached to the grow ing parse network. Simple modification nodes are attached using the MODIFY attribute; phrase modif~cation is constructed using a CONTEXT substructure and attached with a CNTXT attribute. Upon completing the parsing, the score far the newly constructed parse network is colnpared with the score for the previous best network. The higher scoring one is retained to the next iteration. The scheme developed for scoring a parse network is as follows: 1. 4-3 is added for both the actor and the object when they are identified. A network with a null object would get only +3 for its actor. 2. Add $1 for each single word modifier. 3. Add +1 for each prepositional phrase. Note that this is just the preposition plus its object. Modification of the object scores additional points. 4. After the network is created, subtract +1 for each word of the input, including undefined words, that was not used in the creation of the network. Upon termination of the algorithm, there will be a \"best\" parse network which represents the meaning of the input. In case several networks had the same \"best\" score, then disambiguation of meaning is deferred, to be resolved according to the memory matching process described in sectlon 5. To detect and control the parsing of \"garbage1' Input, there is a threshold value for the parse network score that must be exceeded before the parse will be accepted. The current threshold value is zero. A parsing that does not exceed this value 1s rejected and leads to the response of To illustrate the way the parsing algorithm works, consider the questxon DOES BRANDT OWN A RED ANIMAL BOOK?

Similarly, the set of OBJECT candidates contains BOOK since BOOK (MA) THING. Now, in step (6), the only possible combination of ACTOR and OBJECT, (BRANDT OWN BOOK) is formed and passed to step (7) where the skeleton of this network is formed. In step (8) the procedure for adding modification is applxed. There is no left modification possible for BRAEIOT. llowever, for BOOK, there are three words, ANIMAL, RED and A, to ~ts left that have not been used in the parse so far.

The strategy used in MEMORY searching is similar in one respect to the parsing procedure.

Kowever, unlike the exhaustive process used in obtaining a parse, the memory searching procedurt is rather Gelective and does not examine all, or even a large part, of MEMORY. -44-5.2 THE MEMORY MATCII STRUCTURE 5.2.1 GENERAL STRUCTURE For each match attempted between a parse network and an ACTION INSTANCE node in MEMORY, a complete, new memory match structure is generated.

These linked lists are used for collecting information about word modification. 5.2.2 ACTOR, ACT AND OBJECT COllPARISON RESULTS Three of the registers, corresponding to the ACTOK, ACT and OBJECT comparison results, form the heart of the memory match structure. In each register is recorded the exact kind of match between input and MEMORY. Three values are contained for the ACT comparison results: a pointer to the SIMPLE GENERIC node in )EMORY for the ACT aiven in the parse network, a pointer to the list which has the comparison between the modifiers of input and of the METIORY structure, and an indicator pf the type of match. Five possible types of matches can occur for ACTs. 1. (+O) No match. 2. (+5) Exact match. 3. (+4) The input and MEMORY ACTs are synonyms. 4. (+4) The input and MEMORY ACTs are antonyms. 5.. (+0) The ACT was missing from either the input or the MEMORY node. The registers for ACTOR and OBJECT are identical. Like the ACT, they contain three items of information: a pointer to the SIMPLE GENERIC node for the ACTOR in the parse network, a pointer to the modifier list and the match type indicator. The match type indicator for the ACTOR is divided into three subunits. First, the number, singular or plural, of the ACTOR is given. Second, the type of reEerence t0 the input ACTOR is xecorded as either a apecific instance (i.e., it referred to a particular instance of the ACTOR) or as an indefinite reference (referred to a class of ACTORS rather than a specific one).

(-I-0) ACTOR missing from either input or MEMORY. 5.2.3 WORD MODIFICATION RESULTS Registers of the match structure corresponding to the ACTION, ACTOR, ACT and OBJECT nodes can all have modifier lists attached. The word modification list is singly linked; each ifem on the list is given by two registers and represents a single modification, either single word or phrase. All words or phrases that modify, say, the ACTOR, will be on the satne list.

The search ie restricted to ACTION INSTANCE nodes in E-RY that have either the same or a closely related ACTOR. The object of the algorithm is to obtain a small set of the best matches of the parse network with an ACTION INSTANCE node in MEMORY. To handle ambiguous input, i.e., multiple parse networks, the matching procedure must be repeated for each network passed on by the parser (see seep (1)). Unpromising networks are eliminated in steps (2) and (3). Synonym and antonym lists are compiled in step (4). The termination criteria for MEMORY searching is the discovery of a suitable match or the exhaustion of the set of suitable ACTORS used to direct the search. The adequacy of the match between input and MEMORY is the memory match score--the accumulation of many component scores which measure the silpilarity of corresponding parts of two structures. The term$nation criterion for a suitable match is based on the value of this score relative to the network's maximum possible score determined in step (2). The threshold foL a \"suitable1' match is currently set at 70 percent of the maximum )ossible score. The number 70 is not perfect in any sense but was selected in a trial-and-error fashion. 5.3.2 SELECTING SUITABLE ACTORS The selection of actors to Control the range of the search procedure is designed to provide a reasonable set of nodes closely related to the input ACTOR. This selection procedure is used pnly when no ACTION INSTANCE nodes with the input ACTOR produce sufficiently good matches. -50-There are five alternate bethods, described below, for getting new ACTOR candidates. Not all of these five are always used, however. The ones to use and the order in which they are to be applied is determined by the mode and number of the input ACTOR. 1. Search memory of ACTION INSTANCE nodes of the form \"ACTOR1 BE ACTOR2\" where either ACTOR1 or ACTOR2 matches the input ACTOR exactly. Collect the unmatched members of all these nodes for use as new ACTOR candidates. For example, suppose the ACTOR, BRANDT, was not successful at generating a good match.

In order for this procedure to work, the mode of the input ACTOR must be known. This is deterained as follows:","1. An ACTOR is indefinite if a) it is an indefinite proqoun, b) it has modifiers but none is a definite determiner (the, this, these, that, tlxose) or c) it is plural and has no modifiers.","2.

PRODUCTION OF OUTPUT 6.1 OVERVIEW Problems to be solved before \"natural\" sounding output can be produced) are 1. what information should be used in the tesponse to a given input, 2. how should the response be structured so certain parts are ptoperly emphasized and 3. how can the response be made to appear natural in the sense of being like a similar remark a person might make? Clearly, there are many factors which play a part in how a person decides what to say at any tine during the course of a conversation. Such factors include the place of occurrence, the reason for the conversation, the roles assumed by the participants, the type of information passed and the motives of the partidpants. These factors have nbt been studied, indeed, have not even been exhaustively identified, during this research. What has been done, however, is the development of a few simple procedures that will generate reasonable sounding answers to DO-questions based on the results .of memory search. 6.2 THE OUTPUT PRODUCTION LIST The only temporary structure created duriilg tile output phase is a simple doubly linked List of elements representing the words and punctuation of the answer to be printed (see Figure 8)."]},{"title":">","paragraphs":[": :[function] : : [function]"]},{"title":"1->. - \\ I","paragraphs":["[function"]},{"title":"] 1","paragraphs":["Figure 8: Structure of the output production list As the output production routines analyze the relevant memory match structures, they produce the output; production list an element at a time.

The procedure that is used to detect that situation and produce a response currently worm as follows: 1. If input was not parsed, respond with \"1 DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT.\" Then print all undefined words in the form: I DON'T KNOW IdliAT word1 (OR trord2 OR wrd3"]},{"title":". . .","paragraphs":[") IIISANS"]},{"title":".","paragraphs":["\" For example, the input \"DOES BRANDT RIDE A BICYCLE?\" would generate the response \"I DON'T UUDERSTAND THAT.

If the input is parsed, but there was a poor, or no, memory match, then check the 'GENERIC node for the ACT to see if we respond with \"YES\", \"EIO\", \"I DON'T KNOW\" or some \"canned\" response. What is searched for is an attribute which is some-times present in ACT nodes and is the answer to be given when no match is found with kCMORY. An example is the. ACT \"KNOW\". If the program is asked \"DO YOU KNOW x?\" and x is not in MEtlORY, then the response will be \"NO.\" rather than \"I DON'T KNOW. If the input is parsed and there is a good memory match then the following steps wilt be executed. 3. Check the OBJECT. If there isnone and one is'required by this ACT then, if there are undefined words, print \"I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT.\" plus the undefined words. If there are no undefined words, print \"I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOUR USE OF act.\" Substitute the current ACT in the output for \"act\""]},{"title":".","paragraphs":["4. Check the ACTUK. If it is not directly related to the input ACTOR but is a member of the same set Ci.e., ~r: was selected during the memory search for producing actors as given in section 5.2.3), print \"I DON'T KNOW.\" Iiowever, in this case, do not terminate the output production here. Pass the good memory match structure involving this actor on to the next procedure to be used to produce more output, As an example, the input \"DOES BILL IIAVE A BOOR?\" would generate the response \"I DON'T KNOW. BRAlJllT US A RED BOOK.\" 5. Check the ACT. If it does not match, print \"I DON'T KNOW.\" plus the undefined words, f f any. 6.3.2 DETERMINING MODE OF RESPONSE The answer to a DO-question has an optional interjection of YES or NO which precedes the answer and is determined as follows: 1. Set the mode to YES unless the MEMORY ACTOR is a subset of the input ACTOR. In that case, the response slrould not have either YES or 'NO. This will occur when specific data are being used to answer a question of a general nature. For example, the input \"DO PEOPLE OWN TlIIIJGS?\" would be answered by \"RRANDT OlnqS A RED BOOK.\" The YES is omitted since tilc question I~as not been answered in general. Do not continue examination of the match for contradiction when this occurs. 2. Search the memory match structure looking for contradictory data that would change the mode from YES to NO. If thc input ACT matched an antonym, set the mode to NO. 3. Check the first level modifiers of the ACT. Look for contradiction, i.e., modifiers from the same set that are mutually exclusive. If any are found, reverse the setting of the mode. For example, the input \"DID LIRANDT PLAY OUTSIDE?\" which would match the MEMORY node, {'BRANDT PLAYED INSIDE.\" would have a negative mode since INSIDE and OUTSIDE are mutually exclusive. 4. Check the OBJECT for conflicting modifiers. Also change mode if the OBJECT is not directly related to the input OBJECT but is an element from the same set as the input OBJECT. This will be the case when matching objects such as GFEEN I300K with YELLOW BOOK or OLD BOOK with NEW BOOK. 5. Finally check all single word modifiers of the ACT that were present only in the input or IMblORY looking for negative modifiers. These would be words like NOT, NEVER, etc. 6.3.3 PRODUCING A NORMAL NiSWER At the top level in this procedure is the decision of how much of the answer to print. The rules used are: a) if the answer is an exact match of the input with respect to the three. major components, don't print anything except for the YES or NO, b) if the answer is an-exact match except for the OBJECT, then print only the ~BJECT or C) i.f the ACTOR or ACT does not match, then print the- whole MEMORY node given by the memory match structure. The list elements representing the output to be printed for the ACTOR or OBJECT are generated by the following procedure. 1. Add themneric node for the ACTOR (OBJECT) to the end of the output production list. Set its function type to SUBJECT (OBJECT). 2. Put the modifiers into tlie list inunediately in front of tile ADTOR (OBJECT). Use only modifiers that were present in the'blEMORY node or that rnatched between MEMORY and input. These modifiers are contained in the linked list attached to the memory match structure for the ACTOR (OBJECT). 3. Put an article before the modifiers, if required. 4. Add prepositional modification of the ACTOR (OBJECT) at the end of the list. Thi$ is accomplished by adding the preposition followed by the prepositional object. Then the modification on the preppsitional object is added be,tween the two. 5. If the ACTOR (OBJECT) is the same for both input and lfE3fORY but some Input-only modification exists, then add \"BUT NOT\" plus the input node and the input-only modifiers. An example of this is where \"A BLUE BOOK BUT NOT NU ANIMAL BOOK\" is given in response to \"DO I HAVE A BLUE ANIMAL BOOR?\" 6.3.4 EWCIBG OUTPUT GRhEalATICAL The procedure used to fix up the output examines the elements of the output list and, using the word functions as specified in those elements and the properties given in the words'"]},{"title":"GENERIC","paragraphs":["nodes, attempts to apply the. four rules beluw: 1.

An indefinite article (A or AN) is always used; tlie one to be selected is given by the follow'fng rules : 1. uon't use an article if the word modified is a pronoun or a proper name. 2. Otherwise, select A or AN according to the first letter of the word it will precgde. Following the completion of this operation the output is printed. 7. DISCUSSION 7.1 1USITLTS 7.1.1 OUJECTIVES MET The objectives of this research, as restated from section 1, are the development of three components able to carry on a \"natural\" dialogue with humans: an extefidible memory model, procedures for determinine the meaning of the input and procedures to allow the model to converse \"naturally\" with a human. The current design of memory, although a start in the riglit direction, is far from complete. Thexe is mucll that cannot now be represented with the structures available. However, the design of memory is flexible. Extensions can be added to represent more complex surface structures via INSTANCE nodes and also to capture more of the underlying structure of the word meanings themselves in terms of GENERIC nodes. Other features that an extended memory model vill need are the capabilities for supporting more elaborate question answering, the probessing of imperatives and the integration of new information into the"]},{"title":"-5 7-","paragraphs":["existing structures. We believe that the current design will allow such procedures to he developed. The parser now implemented does a reasonably good job -on the restricted input glven it. The basic parsing philosophy, i.e., the selection of one of several possible networks based on semantic density, is believed to be a sound way to approach the problem of determining meaning. The development of output generation procedures has just started. The currently implemented procedures are not general or powerful enough tb handle more than a few. specialized situations. Work is required in this area to first develop a large number of specific rules from which more general rules can be deduced. We have identified ten features which characterize \"natural\" language understanding processes. Specifically, they are the ability. to: (1) Work with partial in£ ormation (to make plausible inferences about missing information, e.g., default values from frames), (2) Work with overlapping and conflicting information (not to reject it out of hand, or seek only consistent information, or to assign all truth value F, but to sift through it to reject that which"]},{"title":"-","paragraphs":["based on experience or knowledge"]},{"title":"-","paragraphs":["is implausible or to temporarily suspend judgement), (3) Retain ambiguity until disambituation is absolutely called for, (4) Perform \"short\" chains of deductions, (5) Engage in common sense reasoning (i.e., there is knowledge of the properties of commonplace objects, events, etc .), (6) Pose questions in order to confirm expectations or to elicit more information about some subjact matter of personal interest, (71 Construct, modify and extract information from a model of the intentions, interests, skills* motiyations, etc., of the other party, -58-"]},{"title":"(8)","paragraphs":["Interrogate and update a similar model of the attitudes, beliefs, abilities, goals, etc., of itself,"]},{"title":"(9)","paragraphs":["Be sensitive to the plausibility"]},{"title":"of","paragraphs":["information received (see Norman's \"Charles' Sickens\" problem, discussed later), (10) Be aware of the context in which the conversation is occurring (~lonnan's \"Empire State Building\" problem, discussed below, identifies one kind of con-text; the roles of the parties involved, e.g., parentchild, teacher-student, superior-subordinate; bureaucratic officialcliea, is a second context; other context types are no doubt resent), With JIEIMY3 we have only begun to address this list of attributes.

The answer to this questidn is plrbbably no. In the more restricted sense of, can the program relate the input to something it already knows, the answer is yes. All input surface structures are matched during the question answering phase to slrnilar structures in memory. However, given a single iiput in isolation, the program does not understand what it means. It has no definitions for individual words.

This is not a theoretical shortcoming; it simply a question of implementation effort. Hodeuef, there are problems ,with fmparser Zrrespective of this major limitation. These problems are quite often related to deficiencies in the memory structure. The parser will currently fail if it does not find a semantically acceptable parse. In cases such as this, it should be allowed to find, instead~, a syntactically acceptable parse that would be marked as a semantic anomaly. Undefined words are now ignored. The ability to make reasonable predictions about the function and meaning of undefi~ed words would be desirable. 7.2.3 OUTPUT PRODUCTION The most serious limitation in the production of output has been the lack of time to develop more extensive procedures. Examples of new rules that are not yet implemented that could be used to produce answers are the following: 1. Use more than one memory match structure to produce the answer. Curreptly only the best one is used. For example, the question \"DOES ANYONE HAVE A RED TOY?\" could be answered by combining the two memory matches, \"BRANDT IUVE RED BOOK\" and \"JENA HAVE RED BALL,\" to get \"YES. JENA HAS A RED BALL AND BRANDT HAS A RED BOOK,^̂ 2. Several equally good memory matches could be combined to produce a single answer t~llich contains a compound actor or object.

These two matches, \"BRANDT IlAVE, RED BOOK\" and \"BTLANDT HAVE BLUE BOOK,\" could be combined to form the response \"YES.

The~Empire State Building probfem refers to the context and scope of any particular question. The question, \"Where is the Empire State Building?\" requires different answers depending on the context of the conversation. To paraphrase Norman's response: If asked the question in Russia, the answer most likely would be \"In the United States.\"; if asked by an adult in Europe, \"In New York City.\"; if asked by someone in New York City, then \"On 34th Street.\" would be appropriate. From these examples, it is obvious that much more is involved in developing a language understanding system that answers questions \"naturally\" than just the ability to parse input correctly, look up an answer and report it.

Simmons. 1970 and Becker, 1975). But the models currently in operation (e.g. Winograd, 1971) already consume all available high-speed memory in large computer systems. Lexical relations as developed by Raphael (1968), Apresyan et al. (1971), and Simmons (1973) provide a method of storing lexical information in more compact form. While Schank (1973) and Wilks (1975) both claim that there i's a fixed universal set of semantic primes, we argue in opposition, follbwing the Russians and Miller and Johnson-Laird (1976), that the set of lexical relations is open-ended; our system is designed to add new relations whenever a lexical regularity is noticed.","Our lexicon is being developed as an integral part of a computer question-answering system which answers multiple-choice questions About simple children's stories.

Montague (6,4) developed a variety of intensional logic as a representation for natural language. In his formalism, individual words can be defined as funcri~ns expressed in terms of intensions, i.e. variables and procedure names. Syntsctic reldtions in English are tranqlated into function applications in intensional logic. These function applications bind the intensions to specific interpretations."]},{"title":"In this way","paragraphs":["the meanings"]},{"title":",of","paragraphs":["indivPdua1 words are composed into the meaning of the sentence.

Ilowever, the binding mechanism is not fixed, but as with Van Bmdcn & Kowalski, it is a search for a chain of inference which culnlinates in an expression involving the geheral predicate.
