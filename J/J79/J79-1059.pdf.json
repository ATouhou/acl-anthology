He noted that the hybrid concept should be retained \"because some service offer i ngs have mixes of both computing and communications functions ,It not retained because of uncl car deflni tions.","Since \"hybrid services wi 11 become even more common In the future,\" Hopewell con-tinued, el fmination of the hybrid concept w] 1 l \"inevitably suppress innovation because any services that have communications functions inextricably bound into them wit 1 be defined as subject to regulation,\" The speaker concluded that he saw no \"technological or economic reason for the regulation of the resale industry.\"","In his presentation on \"Research Topics in Computer Communlcat ion,\" Vintan Cerf summarized technological factors influencing the development of computer communications: the availability of wideband transmission media; the use ,of computers to control the switching and allocation of transmission bandwidth; the trend toward all -digi tal telephone networks; and interconnection of computer commun i cat ions networks.","Cerf said the \"technology is leading away from separate, distinct narrowband services ..,toward integrated wideband services.

Since this review is being prepared for the American Journal of Computational Linguistics, it will be presented in a somewhat unusual format. Instead of beginning at the beginning of the book, I shall start by discussing what seem to me to be the book's highlights for the computational linguist Only after that discussion shall I deal with the gerleral plan of the book and with other specific parts of it The book's ten chapters are intended to be capable of being read independently of one another, although most readers will want to peruse Chapter 1 ahead of any other in order to understand Salton's underlying theme for the book Of the ten chapters, those most immediately relevant to computational linguistics are undoubtedly the last two, plus Chapter 3. The last two are part of a section called \"Dynamic Information Processing,\" in which Salton connects basic concepts in file organization and language processing with their potential applications in the dynamic library (about which more is said below) At the heart of computational linguistics, Chapter 9, \"Language Processing,\" condenses into 49 pages a frank evaluative review of the state-of-the-art in this field Salton links the research in the field with its potential for applications to information systems by saying: A content analysis system going beyond the identification of individual terms . . . requires at least three parts: a descrlptlon of an area of 'discourse in terms of basic entities, or concepts, of importance in this area, including also the main logical-semantic relation-ships that must be identifled between these entities; a llnguistlc REVIEW DYNAMIC INFORMATION AND LIBRARY PROCESSING 50 theory based on appropriate characterizations of lexical items and on grammatical and semantic rules that would underlie the language analysis system; a set of procedures capable of generating for each acceptable input string a deep structure specifying the linguistic-semantic relations between entities obtained from the linguistic analysis, as well as the logical-semantic relations derived From the encyclopedia, With the stage thus set, Salton presents a moderately detailed and highly readable overview of recent and current approaches to natural-language analysis, with an ample supply of examples The chapter's bibliography can serve as a list of the highlights in computational linguistics during 1963-1973 Not everyone will agree with Salton's somewhat pessimistic view of the usefulness of computational linguistics for information systems in","paragraphs":["the"]},{"title":"near future","paragraphs":["(i e"]},{"title":",","paragraphs":["10-20"]},{"title":"years), but all will find thls chapter a masterful presentation In Chapters 3 and 10, Salton enlarges the horizons of computational linguistics beyond its most frequent area of concern, for whcih one might better use the narrpwer name of \"algebraic linguistics\", by discussing what I like","paragraphs":["to"]},{"title":"call \"quantitative linguistics\" --another part of computational linguistics, broadly considered Chapter 3, \"Automatic Indexing and Abstracting\", treats methods by which it is possible to assess progranmrmatically the probable use-fulness of wordb and phrases as indicators of","paragraphs":["the"]},{"title":"content of documents.

Each cluster is identified by a representative cluster profile, or centroid, somewhat akin to the center of gravity of a set of mass points. A cluster centroid is simply a weighted set of terms derived from the document vectors (index-term sets) included in the corresponding cluster. A clustered file is then similar in concept to a normal classified lib-rary file except that the document classes are automatically generated and some overlap may exist betweed classes, that is, certain documents may be included in more than one class. Furthermore, in the case of the clustered file it is easy to rearrange the cluster composition by moving documents from one class to another if it should prove useful. A search in a clustered file is carried out in several steps: first, each query is compared wlth the index file of centroid vectors; then, for thosg centroids exhibiting a sufficiently high similarity wlth the query, the individual document vectors in the corresponding c~usters are examined, and the document citations are ranked for output purposes In decreasing query-document order."]},{"title":". .","paragraphs":["It is clear that the \"depth\" of the search, as measured by the number of query-document comparisons, can be controlled in a clustered file because it is possible to search only the \"best1' cluster --the one exhibitfng the hlghest query-centroid similarity--or the top two clusters, or the top ten, as'may be required. Moreover, since all document vectors and citations belonging to a given cluster are stored adjacently in the same storage area, for example, on the same track or cylinder of a given disc assembly, only one access operation is needed for each docum- cluster, as opposed to one access for each document citation in aa inverted file.

A conversation involves individuals who participate in process of problem solving, learning, and understanding with respect to a set of topics. All psychological observations are observations of conversations, a1 bei t with very restricted domains. The stable organization of conversations is characterized as a set of procedures (program-like entities) that are executed in particular processors such as bra~ns or computing machines. Thus a conversation involving 2 human beings is conceived as a set of procedures executed in parallel in physically distinct proceSsors. One characterization of the individual is the M Individual, or mechanically characterized individual;-a physically distinct individual. The P Individual is def~ned as follows: I) a concept is a procedure for reproducing a relation, 2) a memory is a procedure for reproducing a concept, 3) a P Individual 1s a procedure for reproducirrg a class of memories. A P Individifil, as a procedure, is run or executed in some M Indiv~dual, but there is not necessarily a 1-to-1 corresp~nde~lce between P Individuals and M Individuals. Thus a conversation is a P Individual distributively run in 2 (or more) M individuals.
