However, he continues a closely related confusion by using the same relation, HAP, between tokens (a token of GIRL and a token of HAIR) as between types (the types BIRD and WING). This is incorrect because the interpretation of x HAP y cannot be consistent. In same cases, it is \"x has y as part\", and in others it must be \"each x has a (distinct) y as Scragg gives some insight ink0 the data structures for implementing senantic networks and so encourages the reader to 140k beyond the usual pictorial representation.

For example, if the possibility of rain activates the umbrella demon, how do we understand \"Jack began to worry when he realized that every-one on the street was carrying an umbrella\" [p. l36]? The basic problem seems to be that PLANNER requires one to distinguish one of the propositions of an inference rule as a paktern, burying the others inside the theorem. It does not allow all of the propositions to be treated as patterns, as necessary (as is allowed by the semantic network deduction rules of f 181 )"]},{"title":". Next Charniak discusses McDermottb TTOPLE [I4]. The","paragraphs":["interesting features discussed are TOPLE's sets of possible worlds and its performing inferences in order to s~pply suppmt for believPng new inputs. He also discusses RiegerQs inference program [16], concentrating on Rieger's belief in massive read time inferencing and his classification of sixteen types of inferences. Finally, Charniak discusses the influential, though controversial theory of frames. He cdrnpares frames to demons and finds frames preferable. Papinq Enqlish-lI by Yorick Wilks (30 pages) This chapter is a continuation of Parsinq English I. Apparently, they were originally written as one chapter. then separated for no obvious reason. In this chapter, Wilks warns that, \"'parsing' is being used not only in its standard sense in mabhematical, and ccsmputational linguistics\" [p.155], but includes building some meaning structure representation of the surface 1anguaqe. This kind of passing Wilks definitely favors: \"The thesis behind this chapter"]},{"title":"... is that parsing is essential to s system...","paragraphs":["The arqwment is not only that parsinq provides test of proposed structure, for that secondary, bat that the parsing procedures define what the significance of the proposed structure is\" lp.179, italics in original]. Milks first discusses three \"second generation\" parsing systems- The keyword and pattern parser of Colkiy et ale's PARRY [6:7;9], Wilks' own preferential semantics system based on \"formulas\", \"templates\" \"parapbates\" hnd \"inference rules\", and ~iesbeckk parser for the MARGIE system [17] About tep pages are spent on Wilks' system, more than any other system discussed in the book. Wilks considers all the systems discussed in this chapter to use \"frames\", Me feels, \"the key point about any struc&tltures are to be called farme-like is that they attempt to specify in advance what is going to be said, and how the world encountered is going to be organizedmm.

The chapter ends with a nine page comparison of systems ten different dimensions: level of representation; trality of information; the phenomenBlogical level of bferences; decoupling of parsing and inference: exhibition of ner of appkicLaion to input texts; amout of fqmard inferencing; odularity; scale of representation; connection ui4& real world procedures; justification of adequacy. Psychology of Lanquaqe and Memory by Walter F. Bischof (19 pages) *The intent of this chapter is twofold: first it should ptovide the non-psychologist with some basic concepts and so- important experimental findings in the field of psycholinguistics and the psychology of memory. The second goal is to take a close look at the nature of psychological nts and psychological evidence' [p, 1851 . This is done from an ahitedly biased point of view: \"the topics ehosen for review were chosen more because of","paragraphs":["threia: popularity in AI than because of their relative importance in Computational Sema'nli cs psychologym [194]. The topics include association theory, experiments designed to test the psychological reality of phrase-structure and transformational rules, memory of meaning versus memory of syntax, short term and long term memory, the Collins and Quillian model [8] sf hierarchicas hemory organization. Although the discussions are brief, the choices are good for the iOtended audience. Bischof is not only salective in his view of psychology, but highly skeptical: \"the student of Af should be able to see from the diseussisn here that the ability of psychology to design and carry out experiments which will give clear and indisputable res%lts is very limited, and that their ability to provide a safe and clear insight into human language understanding is similarly limited\" [p.191). Therefore. \"A1 is well advised not to over-estimate the importance of psychological arguments\" [p.201] * by Yorick Wilks (29 pages) In this chapter, Wilks is mainly interested in discussing and comparing the work of Richard Plontag~e and Ladwig Wittgenstein. \"These philosophers have been chosen not so much for their influence on our shject matterr whkch has been small, but because their views are diametrically opposed on the key issue of formalization\" 1p.2051. His belief is \"that the influence of Wittgenstein ha@ been Largely beneficial while that of Montaque has been largely malign\" [p. 2051"]},{"title":". First Wilks introduces some basic topics from the work of Lelbniz, Frege, Russell, early Wittgenstein, Carnap, and Tarski. As in the previous chapter, the discussions are brief but the topics well chosen. His introduction to Montague is via the analysis of the sentence \"Every man loves some woman\". Montague is always difficult, but Wilks' presentation is relatively easy to follow and is done without introducing the la&da calculus. His discussion of Wittgenstein is intendedr \"simply to give a flavor, to those unfamiliar with","paragraphs":["him, of what Wittgensteic has to offer\" [p.222!

Definite noun phrases (DEFNPs) are the most frequently used means of expressing old information. Context plays a crucial role in identifying the reference of DEFNPs and the system uses a focus space partition to represent this context.

As filtering (by both semantics and discourse) is dependent upon the structures assigned to subphrases d the input, filtering and structure building are combined. If any of various checks and restrictions in the structure-building process recognize an anomalous comdition in a structure being built, then the structure building fails, and this failure, acting as a filter, serves to reject the phrase combination. 3) The semantic component may make predictions concerning what words or syntactic contructions are likely to occur in other parts of the utterance.
