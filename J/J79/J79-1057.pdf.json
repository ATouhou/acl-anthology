The Text-to-Speech System A system to convert unregtricted printed text to speech has been under development for several years at M.I.T. 1,2,3 The approach has been to model the proces-s employed by a nat'ive speaker of English when reading aloud. In order to develop correct computational algorithms for the pronunciation of English words, it has been necessary to reflect the basic nature of linguistic processes. Consequently, considerable emphasis has been placed on the development of morphological and phon~logical analysis, stress patterns, parsing systems and prosodic correlates. It i$ possible, using the current system, to convert any English word or string df words in a textual representation to intelligible speech. In order to effect this conversion, a number of subsystems are utilized including mo~phological analysis, letter-to-sound rules, stress rules and phonemic speech synthesis. Prosodic studies are now in grogress; experimental parameters for fo contours and timing patterns will soon be included In %he system. The letter-string which represents a word is usually converted to a phoneme string in preparation for speech synthesis by a process of morpholop,ical analysis. Amorph lexicon c-ontnininq approximately 11,000 entries has been drv~l loped and is ilsed in ron jrinct ion with n rnorph dec*ompos it ion algorithm. Included in the lexicon are two major classes oE rnorphs. One","I1 11 I I class is composed of roots such as trust\" and snow, i .c. ; words which cqlr occur alone, and bound roots such as -ceive perceive, receive, connive), rot- (rotary, rotate, rotor) and -miss- (dismiss, missive, permiqsiveness). A£ fixes make up the second class and may be attached either to roots or tc bound morphemes. Accompanying each lexical entry is its phonemic representation, its morph class and its part(s) of speech. Algorithfnic decomposifion of letter-strings models the pr~cedure used by a native speaker when confronted by a word which he does not immediately recognize or has previously not encountered. If the word is not immediately","1 I recognizable, i,e., if ~t is not in the le~icon\" of the native speaker in its entirety, an attempt will be made to break it apart into its constitu'ent morphs. Such a process is probably used when oAe reads a word skh as \"antidisestablishmentarianism,\" earthrise\" or \"cranappley for the Tirst time The algorithm also models the ability to recognize mutations such 2s the dropping of a fLbal silent"]},{"title":"i el4","paragraphs":["(observe"]},{"title":"-","paragraphs":["observance), the doubling of a final consonant (red-reddest') and the substitution of ti1 for final [yl preceding vocalic suffixes (glory"]},{"title":"-","paragraphs":["glorious).

The text-ro-speech system includes a phonological model having a two-phase structure: the first phase is 3 set of rules which converts letters to phonemes, and the second is an algorithm for placement of stress on the converted phonemes. This system has been implemented ;In RCPI, on n DEC PDP-9 and on a PDP-10 inbMAC LISP. Onp might ask why, with a set of letter-to-sound rules available, it is necessary to have a lexicon. There hre three reasons; all are restrictions which must be imposed om any viabl'e letter-to-sound system. -First, it has been observed that high-frequency wotds perhaps because of extensive use, do nbt always follow letter-to-sound rules. For example, the only instance in which a final Lf] is pronounced"]},{"title":"as /v/","paragraphs":["is in the word \"of If The letter [w]","9 I following a consonant is generally pronounced like the [w] in sweett1 or \"tw~ll,\" but in the word \"two\" it is not pronounced at all. A study5 of the 200 most frequent words in English according to the Bl'own corpusb as made to determine their regularity of pronunciation. It was found that although the regular case is that a final [el preceded by a single consonant (other than [rJ) lengfhhns the preceding vowel, four of the 200 words, i.e., \"haveft (compare","It \"behave, \" \"shave\")"]},{"title":",","paragraphs":["one, 11 I1 I I some\" and come,\" (compare \"ldne,\" \"ode\") are exceptions. The case of initial [th] is even more irregular among high-","I-- frequencyword$. I'n most English words, initial ;th j is unvoiced as in","If Jf 11 \"thistle, fKin,\" \"thesis., However, twelve of the 200 words began with voiced [thl. Secondly, it must be recognized that the fetter~to-sound rules which operate within a morpheme, do not, ~ecessarily apply across morph bounddries. In particular, the pronunciatian of compounds tequires a lexicon. Such-words as \"hc&house\" or \"potherbff might etherwise appear to contain the consonant cluster lth], and the motph-final srlent e] in \"houseboatf1 would certain1 y not be silent if the word were not recognized as a compound. The application of letter-to-sound rules must therefore be restricted to words containing no more than a single root. Thirdly, foreign words which retain their original prmunciation must be lexical entries. The entries may be made in the same way a native speaker of English muld add a foreign word to his vocabulary, i.e., by pronouncing it as if 13 were an English word (using English letter-to-sound rules) until informed of its correct pronunciation, and then plaCing it in his mental lexico?. It is apparent, then, that both morphnlogical and phonological systems are necessary and that together, in sequence, they can provide a phonemic representation for any English word presented for conversion to speech. Although, at present, there is no ingergction between the decomposition and letter-to-phoneme algorithms, a more highly efficient System could be developed in the future. The size of the lexicon could be reduced, f6r example, by app.l!ication of stress placement rules to the output 8f the decomposition algorithm or by omitting unnecessary phonemic representations The c~nversfon of a letter string to a phoneme string in the letter-to-sound program prdceeds in three s-ges. In the first stage, prefjxes and suffixes are detected, (cc. Figure I) Such affixes appear' im the list.of phonological rules.

Unnecessary. If the [a] is preceded by a /w/, this rule will never be reached; if preceded by a vowel, a rule for vowel digraph9 will already have- applied. Using this method. rules may be stated simply and without redundancy. Development of the set of phonological rules was begun by informal 8 inspection and reference to published works, e.g., Venezky. By ,a process of extensive statistical analysis, other rules were added and ordered appropriately. The. principal source of words was the Merriam Websteb .Pockef 9 Dictionary. A computer print-out was generafed in which all words containing each letter and each specified cluster of letters were isolated. Within each category, words were sorted alphabetically according to the riglit-hand context of the letter(s) under considaration. In addition, walker's rhyming dictionary lo was used to determine pronunciation of suffixes and the ef fect of suffixation on preceding phonemes. Words from Lb Brown Corpus, the I1 12 Heritage Engllsh Dictionary ahd Stedman's Medical Dictionary have heed used in testing procedures.

Application of the rules proceeds in two phases. The first phase cons is.^̂ of the application of three-ordered rules which are applied cyclically, first to the root, then to the root and left-most suffix,combined. The process continues with one more suffix adjoined to the string under consideration before each cycle begins until the end of the word is reached. This cyclic phase is devoted solely to the placement of primarLy stress. The second, non-cyclic- phase, includes the appli-ion -to the entire word of ordered rules and reduces all but one of the primary stress marks to secondary or zero stress.

However, until parsing methods are further developed, it will not be possible to take advantage of known parts of speech. 15 For this reason, the Main Stress Rule is currently applied to all roots. The suffixes referred to in Condition (2) fall into two categories. Some suffixes are marked to force stress to be placed on either the final or the penultimate syllable of the root and suffixes under consideration. This placement of stress replaces the MSR on the cycle in which the special suffix is the right-most morph.
