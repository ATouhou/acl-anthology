CONCORDANCES AND DICTIONARIES The obvious and inmediate task for the humanities is the assemblage of concordances and dictionaries. Two kinds of program are presented in Mitchell's book 1) the program which simply gets the information out and prints on order, and 2)","paragraphs":["the"]},{"title":"program which uses the information in some kind of analysis. It is not surprising that a concordance and a dictionary of Shakespeare would be an early choice. M. Spevack, H. J. Neuhaus, and T.

Another kind of limitation, boundaries of a theory, may be discovered at any time. For example, semantic field theory is an attractive method of organization of meaning. The difficulty is that, extended beyond certain neatly arranged categories, where distincti,ns are clear, the method becomes unmanageably complex. E. R. Maxwell and R. M.

STYLISTICS Beyond cataloging, the most urgent need for the computer in the humanities is in stylistic studies. We have already mentioned the establishment of definitive texts. Several studies Review: Computers in the Humanities 13 recently completed promise to make determination of authorship more certain. One is W. M. Baillie's \"Authorship attribution in Jacobean dramatic texts,","paragraphs":["\" in"]},{"title":"Computers -- in the Huplanities . Baillie investigates two texts of Shakespeare s and two of Fletcher's, looking for automatic distinctions in the dialog of the two writers.

From","paragraphs":["!the"]},{"title":"information he forms a graph that shows s,ome consistency in discrimination between the two playwrights. Baillie is aware of at least some of the difficulties in establishment of authorship. 1) The plays are not totally consbtent. In certain scenes the distinction is negative, that is, the norms of one playwright are replaced by the norms of the other. Such scenes are not destructive to the credibility of the method, ,ht rather they open up new quest5ons of style and author-ship. 2) The project is based on the assumption that a writer has an identifiable style, an assumption which is yet to be proved. 3) In a play each character may have a style distinct from others and from the author's personal style. That personal quality may or may not be given to any one or more characters and may have only an indefinite effect on the style of all of the characters. 4) Any stylistic study in breadth must assume that over a period of years a writer's s-tyle will change, that he may revise an earlier writing and so create a problem in authorship. All of Review","paragraphs":[":"]},{"title":"Computers in the Humanities 14 these difficulties must be considered, but not as insurmountable. It is just such complexities which make the use of the computer urgent and probably essential. Another who attacks the prbblem of authorship is J. R. Allen, in \"On the authenticity of the Baligant episode in the Chanson - de Roland1'. His method is different: he makes a judgment on the basis of the frequencies of high frequency lemmata. In six out of nine cases the Baligant episode vaties significantly from the others.

Any stylistic study is conducted in a vacuum unless two items are in comparison, for example Writer A in Poem X vs - Writer A in Poem Y, or Writer A vs - Writer B, or Writer A vs - Writer A + ten years. Eventually norms of a sort will be established. D. Ross, in \"An EYEBALL view of Blake% Songs - of Innocent-e -- and Experience\" establishes standards of \"simplicity\" against which other poets' work can be measured. He makes a stylistic compa fison of she two poem sequencw, Songs of - Innocezlce and Songs - of Experiense, making use of EYEBALL, which produces for","paragraphs":["him"]},{"title":"an \"augmented text,'' noting for each word syllable length, graxnma tical category and function, and location in clause, sentence, and text.

Martindale, who considers categories of thought, as represented by vocabulary items, and in \"The semantic significance of spatial movement in narrative verse: patterns of regresshe imagery in the Divine Comedy,\" he finds evidence of stylistic progression. He mslPause of the Regressive Imagery Dictionary (RID) which lists 3647 words \"divided into thirty-six categories designed to tap primary process and secondary process thinking","paragraphs":["\""]},{"title":"His measures are secondary process thought, i.e., logical, reality-oriented, and goal-directed, in contrast with primary process thought, which is more primitive, free-associative, and sensation- and drive-oriented. One last thing we note here is a direction toward a new meeting place between disciplines.. I. A. Morton, in \"Analysis of tonal music at the level of perception,\" describes a system of tonal analysis which deals with harmonic relationships between chdrds in similar contexts.

The suggested approach employs a structuring of the user's conceptual reference spaces into sets of \"action primitives\", peculiar to the type of computer-aided task involved. An interactive command language can then be regarded as the range of some transformation on the user's set of action primitives. The nature and efficiency of that transformation, in conjunction with the inherent number of mental association links, are hypothesized to have direct relationships to the level of required mental work. The user's delay or \"think time\", expended immediately preceding command utilization, is one measurable quantity that should be useful as a work level indicator.

Computers and the Problems of Society was conceived to formulate the problem and meet the challenge of the humanistic use of computers. The focus is not on social probbms generated by computers. Instead, it is on the constantly growing need far computers to heip ameliorate significant social problems. Accordingly each chapter is organized In two sections: First, what are the leading soclal problems In the given area? and Second, how can computers help people to understand and solve these problems? 562 pages, hardcover, $1 5.00 PLANNING COMMUNlfY INFORMATION UTlUllES edited by Harold Sackman and 8.

The computer press and the general news media regularly report on computer systems which have been destroyed by natural disaster, breached by malicious individuals, or have failed to perform their assigned function during times of peak loading. The questions of privacy and personnel data banks have been discussed in the United States Congress, in international tribunals, and are the subject of dozens of bills pending in legislative bodies throughout the world. The goal of this manual is to allow each individual computer center manager to assess his needs for security and to become aware of the steps taken by others faced with similar problems. This manual covers topics such as personnel, physical security, operating systems, access controls, programs, communications, storage, input/ output, supplementary topics and insurance. 850 checklist questions are provided which explore an organization's strengths and weaknesses. The resulting self-audit will describe the status of your organization in its own natural environment. This is the'flrst volume in a series of System Review Manuals. Order yours today!

What does a programmer do? When is a programmer primarily a coder, an operator, a systems analyst, or a member of another occupation which requires programming? Are programmers professionals, paraprofessionals, or technicians? Nobody has attempted to answer these questions for the industry as a whole except the U.S. De partment of Labor, who, in 1971, for the purpose of enforcing the wages and hour rules, declared that programmers are not professional. Company personnel job descriptions, already in existence, could be examined as a logical starting point in finding answers to these questions. However, those written by programming managers and personnel people are usually unmeticulous, out of date, little used, and change from company to company. Further, they are attempts by management to describe what their program-men are supposed to do and have little correspondence with what programmers say they do in their work. The results of this study are expected to be used by management personnel of computer programming organizations to develop programmer posi-tion descriptions to fit their specific needs. The results are also expected to provide the basis for development of comprehensive examinations for programmer certification, Finally, the study should represent an initial milestone in the continuing personnel regearch into the nature and evolution of occupations in the computer field. 196 pages, softcover, $1 0.00 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASlS ANNUAL MEETlNG edited by Ranas Zunde Contains all 49 contributed papers which were presented at the 37th ASlS Annual meetln held October 13-1 7, 1974 in Atlanta, Georgia The Theme-"]},{"title":"9","paragraphs":["nformatlon tltilkles-ernpha-BiLBdtb~gRdl#eOf#~Mo~t~W systems tuquimd by large segments of the general public (ag , news Informatlop systems) 278 pages, Volume 11, $17 50 CHANGING PATTERNS IN INFORMAnON RETRIEVAL: PROCEEDlNGS OF WE 10TH ANNUAL NATIONAL INFORMATfON RETRIEVAL COU-OQUIUM edited by Carot Fenicbel The State-of-the-Art was reviewed In four major area8 of information science User Behavior, Strategies for Organlzing and Searching, Technology for Storage end Retrieval, and Information as a Product 192 pages, $15 00 SURVEY OF COMMERCIAUY AVNLABLE COMPUTER-READABLE BlBUOGRAPHtC DATA BASES edited by John H Schnelder, Marvin Whmen, Stephen E Furth This survey of data bases provldes a detailed two-page form on each of 81 data bases deemed suitable for SDI use For each data bases information Is given concerning subject matter, contact person, availab~lity, cost, and so forth 181 pages, $1 0 50 KEY PAPERS IN INFORMATION SCIENCE edited by Arthur W, Elias Each of the 19 papers in thls essential collection Is an acknowledged classic in the information science field The papers were selected_ with the objective of maWng the collect~on a useful textbook for teachers and students of information sdence 223 pages, $1 0 00 KEY PAPERS ON THE USE OF COMPUTER-BASED BIBLIOGRAPHIC SERVICES edited by Stella Kennan A jolnt publication of ASlS and the National Federation of Abetracting & lndexlng Service8 The volume contains selected papers on the use and evaluation of computer-based sewices An editorial commentary which accompanies the key paper6 indicate6 the reasons for their lncluslon In this speclal collection $1 0 00 OMNIBUS COPYRIGHT REVISION;
