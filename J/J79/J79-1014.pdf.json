This compares with a detailed traditional verb class system that makes 47 distinctions and could not be contained in the space available. Floyd H. Billings, Jr. Brigham Young University Proceedings of the [BYU] Linguistics Symposium, 1973 In junction grammar representations of sentence structure, the relations between lexical items is logical but not linear. Lexical ordering rules are thus independent from the syntactic representation. Some rules can be assigned by know ng which junction rule is involved e.g. in English the rule joining a preposition to its object is always left-to-right, but in German prepositions have to be clqssified as either preceding or following. A second type of ordering rule involves the operands of a junction rule being more closely related to each other than to any outside element. An example is the processing of articles; an unmodified noun immediately follows the article, but is realized elsewhere when the noun is modified.

One of the representations is based on the familiar method of generating sentential forms of the language, and the other is based on the Cocke parsing algorithm. An augmented theorem prover is described which permits recognition of recursive languages. The state-transformation mebhod developed by Cordell Green to construct problem solutions in resolution-based systems can be used to obtain. the parse tree. In particular the end-order traversal of the parse free is derived in one of the representations. The paper de-fines an inference system, termed the cycle inference system, which makes it possible for the theorem pjover to model the method on which the representation is based. Thee general applicability of the cycle iriference system to State-space problems is discussed.
