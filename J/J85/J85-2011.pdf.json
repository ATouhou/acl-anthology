The 1985 conference is jointly sponsored by the Cognitive Science Society, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, and the Biological Sciences Division of the Office of Naval Research. The conference will be held immediately preceding the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), which will be held at the University of California, Los Angeles. MAJOR ADDRESSES Endel Tulving, Department of Psychology, University of Toronto; Allen Newell, Department of Computer Science, Carnegie-Mellon University; Shimon Ullman, Laboratory for Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Roger Schank, Department of Computer Science, Yale University.","In addition, the conference will feature state-of-the-art symposia in Language, Learning, and Perception. Speakers so far scheduled to appear include: Bob Berwick, Ken Wexler, Jim McGaugh, Jaime Carbonell, Dave LaBerge, Gary Lynch, Pat Langley, Michael Posner, Don Hoffman. AEROSPACE APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 16-19 September 1985 Dayton Convention Center, Dayton, OH The annual AAAIC '85 Conference will be held in Dayton to establish the present state of the art in artificial intelligence in selected areas of importance. Each session will be keynoted by a prominent researcher who can authoritatively differentiate between present capabilities and research requirements. Practitioners have been selected and invited to present papers on their work by conference chairpersons in conjunction with keynote speakers. This will be an annual conference structured to encourage maximum interaction between participants during sessions and social events. Conference attendance is limited. Exhibits will be open to the public. FEATURED SPEAKERS Among the notable speakers with expertise in the area of artificial intelligence, the agenda will include Dr. W. Bledsoe, MCC; Brig. Gen. P. Bouchard, Vice Commander, Aeronautical Systems Division; Dr. B. Chandrasekaran, Ohio State University; Dr. M. Fox, CMU; Dr. T. Garvey, SRI; Dr. V. Lesser, University of Massachusetts; Prof. D.
