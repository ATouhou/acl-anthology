SPECIAL CONFERENCE A special conference on FUTURE AND IMPACTS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE will be held in conjunction with this meeting (see below). FUTURE AND IMPACTS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 1-4 April 1986 Vienna, Austria to be held in conjunction with the preceding meeting This Conference is a sequel to a meeting held in Laxenburg, Austria, on the same topic. Among its participants were: Margaret Boden, Ron Brachman, Stefano Cerri, Nils Nilsson, Peter Raulefs, Tibor Vamos. Its proceedings, Impacts of Artificial Intelligence: Scientific, Technological, Military, Economic, Societal, Cultural, and Political, [R. Trappl, Ed.; North Holland, Amsterdam and New York, 1985] will form the basis of this Conference.","The aim of this Conference is to help determine and assess future developments and impacts of AI in order to avoid potential damage and to encourage socially helpful and economically useful AI research and applications. It is addressed to - the concerned AI researcher, - the decision-maker in private companies, government,","and funding institutions, and - everybody who wants to know more about the poten-","tial risks and benefits of AI for her/his life.","This Special Conference will consist of presentations by invited speakers, notably leading AI researchers; contributed papers; panels; and general discussions.","The Proceedings of the Special Conference will be published separately and should include highlights from the discussions. They may be ordered at the Conference.","This Special Conference is supported by the International Federation for Systems Research (IFSR). PAPERS: Colleagues who wish to contribute papers to the Special Conference are asked to follow the same rules as given for the Eighth European Meeting on Cybernetics and Systems Research (see above).

The 1985 conference is jointly sponsored by the Cognitive Science Society, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, and the Biological Sciences Division of the Office of Naval Research. The conference will be held immediately preceding the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), which will be held at the University of California, Los Angeles. MAJOR ADDRESSES Endel Tulving, Department of Psychology, University of Toronto; Allen Newell, Department of Computer Science, Carnegie-Mellon University; Shimon Ullman, Laboratory for Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Roger Schank, Department of Computer Science, Yale University.","In addition, the conference will feature state-of-the-art symposia in Language, Learning, and Perception. Speakers so far scheduled to appear include: Bob Berwick, Ken Wexler, Jim McGaugh, Jaime Carbonell, Dave LaBerge, Gary Lynch, Pat Langley, Michael Posner, Don Hoffman. AEROSPACE APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 16-19 September 1985 Dayton Convention Center, Dayton, OH The annual AAAIC '85 Conference will be held in Dayton to establish the present state of the art in artificial intelligence in selected areas of importance. Each session will be keynoted by a prominent researcher who can authoritatively differentiate between present capabilities and research requirements. Practitioners have been selected and invited to present papers on their work by conference chairpersons in conjunction with keynote speakers. This will be an annual conference structured to encourage maximum interaction between participants during sessions and social events. Conference attendance is limited. Exhibits will be open to the public. FEATURED SPEAKERS Among the notable speakers with expertise in the area of artificial intelligence, the agenda will include Dr. W. Bledsoe, MCC; Brig. Gen. P. Bouchard, Vice Commander, Aeronautical Systems Division; Dr. B. Chandrasekaran, Ohio State University; Dr. M. Fox, CMU; Dr. T. Garvey, SRI; Dr. V. Lesser, University of Massachusetts; Prof. D.
