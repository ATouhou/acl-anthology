The first sheet should give the title, the name(s) and address(es) of the author(s), a brief abstract, and a list of keywords, to help in the assigning of referees. DEADLINE FOR FULL PAPERS: 1 JANUARY 1986 Late papers will not be reviewed. Authors will be notified of referees' decisions around the middle of March 1986. Final copies, for photo-reproduction, will be needed by the middle of May 1986. Copies of the conference proceedings will be provided to every-one attending.

Cognitive scientists are invited to submit papers or posters on substantial, original, previously unreported research. All papers and posters will be reviewed by experts in appropriate topic areas. Acceptance will be based on originality and significance of the reported research, as well as on the quality of its presentation.

Madeleine Bates, ACL President, presided. ACL85 Meeting Report Bill Mann, Program Committee Chair, reported on special features of the program. The Committee was divided into two Panels, one devoted to theory, the other to applications. A deliberate attempt was made to encourage more submissions in the latter category, but they were not forthcoming. Forty of the 61 papers submitted were accepted. A tutorial program was introduced for the first time at a regular ACL meeting (one had been held at the Conference on Applied Natural Language Processing in 1983, and COLING84 had a \"mini-summer school\" during the week preceding that conference). The exhibits program was larger and more extensive than the one at COLING84, with a number of demonstrations from university and industry groups. [NOTE: The final attendance figures show that 363 people registered for the meeting. The 332 page proceedings is available from the ACL office at $15 for members, $20 for nonmembers. The tutorials also proved to be quite successful: 83 attended the Parser tutorial by Jonathan Slocum; 62 were at Prolog by Fernando Pereira; 16 at Speech by Beatrice Oshika and Jared Bernstein; 58 at Interfaces by Norman Sondheimer and Madeleine Bates; and 112 at Unification by Stuart Shieber.] Secretary-Treasurer's Report Don Walker reported that income for the year 1984 exceeded expenditures by almost $50,000 ($178,579 against $129,080), resulting in accumulated assets of $153,927 for the period. Some progress has been made toward setting up cost centers, but it is still not possible to allocate expenses accurately. With that qualification, proceedings sales and conference income help offset losses to the membership account. However, the largest source of income is the distribution of surplus from the National Computer Conference by AFIPS, an amount almost equal to the ACL surplus. Preliminary figures for the first half of 1985 show an even greater surplus, but relatively few expenses have been incurred yet for the year. The total number of personal members at the end of the year was 1355, down slightly from 1983. Institutional membership was up slightly, to 325.
