The full first name and initial of each author should be provided, followed by the corresponding institutions and complete mailing addresses. Manuscripts must be submitted in English.","The paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. It should state the objectives of the work, summarize the results, and give the principle conclusions and recommendations. It is preferable that the abstract not be in the first person, and it should not contain any mathematical notation or cite references. Work planned but not completed should not appear. Since the abstract will be used to select appropriate referees, it is essential to make it as informative as possible.","References should be listed alphabetically by author at the end of the paper according to the following style, where the naming convention is 'Surname, Firstname Initial.' and multiple authors are separated by semicolons, the last one being preceded by \"and\": Article in iournal: Name. Year. Title (in initial capitals). Periodical-name (identified by underlining or italics) Volume(Issue-number): page#-page#.

Alternatively, the complete reference can be enclosed in parentheses, for example \"The system EZPARSE (Smith and Jones 1963) ...\".","Footnotes should be avoided as much as possible. Whenever it does not impede the logic or readability of the paper, footnote material should be integrated into the text. When necessary, they should be numbered consecutively from the beginning of the article and appear at the bottom of the page on which they are referenced.","Notation should be selected so as to simplify the phototypesetting process. Also, figures should be devised with consideration for whether they would require one column or two columns in the text. All figures in the final manuscript will be the author's responsibility. For initial submission of papers for refereeing, the figures should be integrated into the text as much as possible, rather than being inserted at the end of the document. Original line drawings must be drawn in black ink on white paper; the lines should be heavy enough to reproduce well. Photographs should be in black and white on glossy paper. Computer printout is net acceptable for figures; any such copy should be redone in a comparable type font.","CL is interested in esploring the use of electronic submission for the final manuscript, for those able to produce and transmit copy in that form. We are prepared to handle both tape and network transmissions. For such a submission, it is essential to reduce the problems entailed in introducing format commands. The easiest situation for our Production Editor at present is to eliminate all such commands, separating sections that are handled differently by blank lines. It is, of course, essential to aEcompany the electronic transmission with a graphic version that indicates the preferred format. It should be recognized that deviations from personal preferences may occur in the interest of ensuring a more consistent style for our journal (see below). Electronic submissions should be sent directly to the Production Editor at the mailing or net addresses provided on the inside front cover.","In order to have consistant handling of the various text elements in articles appeanng in COMPUTATIONAL LINGUSTICS, the following conventions will be used. Please mark your manuscript or copy of your paper accordingly. Note that punctuation marks will follow closing quotation marks unless the punctuation mark is a part of the quoted material."]},{"title":"Italics","paragraphs":["• emphasis We want to determine just"]},{"title":"why","paragraphs":["this happens.","• words or sentences used within the text For example,"]},{"title":"persuade","paragraphs":["controls the subject of its complement, as in We"]},{"title":"persuaded John to leave.","paragraphs":["• foreign words or phrases not in common use in English One would italicize"]},{"title":"pieta","paragraphs":["but not per se.","• book titles as described in Chomsky's"]},{"title":"Aspects of the Theory of Syntax.","paragraphs":["Indicate words to be italicized by undersconng them if they are not already italicized in the copy you submit.
