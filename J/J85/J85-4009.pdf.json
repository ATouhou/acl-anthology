Recently, we have broadened it to allow us to reach people whose current financial situation makes it impossible for them to join the Association. One recent member in this category, a student in India, provides an appropriate model to justify this form of participation. He states that when he is further along in his graduate studies, he will reimburse the International Fund for its support. While there should be no requirement to do that, it is a way of ensuring that access to these sources of information are made widely available. If anyone knows of others in similar situations in any part of the world, please provide the ACL office with names and addresses. And do not hesitate to make contributions directly to the International Fund to enable us to extend this program. SPECIAL ISSUE ON COURSE CONTENT IN CL Robin Cohen is soliciting information for a special issue of Computational Linguistics that will focus on the content of computational linguistics courses. Her interest is in what topics are covered, what references are used, the format chosen for teaching, and the workload assigned. For further information, or for electronic submission of your information: Robin Cohen Computer Science University of Waterlook Waterloo, Ont. N2L 3(31 CANADA rcohen%water@waterloo.csnet or ihnp4!watmath!waterIrcohen Cohen's survey will complement the Directory of Graduate Programs, which was published in 1983. A second edition of that Directory is also in preparation. Formal solicitation of information will begin in January 1986.
