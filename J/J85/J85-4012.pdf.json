The paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must be submitted in English. Submissions may be made in any of the following categories: PAPER: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in computational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The length of a paper depends on its content, but we suggest that manuscripts be limited to forty double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of twelve journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed, being read by at least two members of the editorial board and usually by an additional expert in the particular subject area.","The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the author certifies the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publication to another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Editor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the case of a \"work for hire\", by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978 U.S. Copyright law. TECHNICAL CORRESPONDENCE: This category includes short articles reporting preliminary results of some project in progress, or the results of other studies of interest to the readership. Technical correspondences should not generally exceed eight double-spaced pages. Each technical correspondence is reviewed by at least two members of the editorial board before acceptance. LETI'ERS TO THE EDITOR: This includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these contributions for inclusion. Five copies of papers, technical correspondences, and letters should be sent to the Editor: James F. Allen, CL Editor Department of Computer Science The University of Rochester Rochester, NY 14627 arpanet: ACL@ROCHESTER Anyone interested in reviewing a book, or in suggesting a book for review, should contact the Book Review Editor; publishers may also submit copies of books for review directly to the Book Review Editor: Graeme Hirst, CL Book Review Editor Department of Computer Science University of Toronto Toronto, CANADA M5S 1A4 arpanet: GH@TORONTO.CSNET The Finite String Editor should receive (a) copies of technical reports and reprints of papers published elsewhere - or at least citation information and abstracts of such items and of books and monographs; (b) summaries of research in progress - of particular interest would be perspectives on the activities at a particular institution; (c) announcements of meetings of potential interest to the membership; and (d) personal notes (e.g., honors, moving, changes in status).
