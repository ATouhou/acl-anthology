The sponsors of this project are interested in assessing the state of the art of IUI/NLP and in identifying ongoing research for possible funding.","An important part of this survey is the establishment of a Clearinghouse hosted on a PC in dBase II format. The Clearinghouse will allow researchers and companies alike to access information about ongoing projects.","If you are currently working on a NLP or IUI project, please let us know and we will send you our questionnaire. In return, we will make the result of the survey available to you. As a further benefit, your project will be included in upcoming publications (ACL, ACM, etc.) related to the Clearinghouse.","We hope you will be able to cooperate and help us to establish this needed network of people/projects in the area of IUI/NLP.
