{"sections":[{"title":"Book Reviews Briefly Noted","paragraphs":["fully, and with a pedagogically attractive style, it discusses topics related to expert systems (e.g., representation, rules, shells, explanation, and confidence factors) as well as topics related to natural language processing (e.g., conjunctions, inflection, left-recursion, question-answering, and scoping). All of this combines to provide a very concrete, yet readable, introduction to these fields. It achieves this through examples, woven with explanations that are clear. All coded examples have just enough odd details to reassure us that they have survived a process of close scrutiny and debugging.","Chapter 2 is of special note. \"A Prolog to Proiog\" by John Sowa is perhaps the best informal introduction to Prolog I have ever read. I found it both thorough and complete, but written in a style that makes it pleasant and delightful to learn. Pure Prolog techniques are applied to several classic and novel artificial intelligence problems. Simple, direct comparisons are made to standard logic (with quantifiers), to Pascal record structures, and to relational data bases. Unification is explained with a few simple examples and criteria for reversible predicates are given.","Chapter 3 discusses more advanced programming techniques in Prolog. Here, the book departs slightly from its concentration on classic artificial intelligence problems to discuss the more mundane issues of Prolog itself: data structures, unification, control structures, labels, and metavariables. Later in the chapter, techniques for representing and searching graphs and trees are presented along with a worked-out example of alpha-beta pruning. Throughout the book, principles of good Prolog programming style are emphasized. At the conclusion of this chapter, these are summarized into a neat list of 11 guidelines. Warnings about side effects and the judicious use of cuts are similarly presented.","Syllog (from \"syllogism\") is described in Chapter 4; it represents an expert system shell embedded in Prolog. It features some interesting ideas for implementing the interpreter based on backchain iteration which, when run, leads eventually to a fixed point representing the answer. Several sample expert systems built from Syllog are also presented in the chapter. PLANTDOC, for example, is a MYCIN-like system that diagnoses disease in garden plants. It serves to illustrate reasoning using confidence factors, frames, and explanation techniques.","In Chapter 5, the book presents a score of methods for constructing syntactic structures from inputs, a particular semantic model, and a set of techniques for mapping syntactic structures to semantic forms. It demonstrates the ease with which input sentences can be coerced into logical expressions of meaning (expressed in \"Logical Form Language\"). Much of this chapter has appeared in recent research articles by McCord and, to his credit, he is able to clearly present solutions to some rather complicated ,issues.","In the chapter, definite clause grammars (DCGs) are introduced first. Since these are so clean and elegant in their simplicity, they nicely introduce some of the mechanisms for natural language processing in Prolog. Next, modular logic grammars (MLGs) are introduced and shown to allow for a greater degree of modularity between syntax and semantics. The bulk of the chapter is dedicated to deriving solutions to a variety of problems using MLG. The range of issues and the degree of detailed discussion are impressive. In the conclusion, a natural language question-answering system for a university data base is presented.","I have very few criticisms of the book. It is based entirely on IBM Prolog with little or no effort to provide information about other implementations of Prolog. An appendix is provided which serves as a type of reference manual for IBM Prolog. Perhaps the book could be more generic, but then I feel it would undermine its reliance on concrete examples that the reader can confidently run. Most readers will not find this to be a difficult problem and the slight effort required to overcome the problem is well worth it. I found very few errors and all were very minor (e.g., missing existential quantifier on page 49). They never detract from what the author is saying.","I was impressed with this book. Much of the credit for this certainly belongs with the editor, Adrian Walker, who does a marvelous job of weaving together a coherent book from the contributions of his coauthors. The credentials of the supporting cast are equally impeccable. I found many enjoyable segments in the book. Although an appendix is provided which discusses the logical basis of Prolog and Syllog, I think it would be difficult to use this book for the logical fundamentals of Prolog, as the authors suggest. However, it is certainly an important reference and could easily be used as a textbook in support of a course on artificial intelligence, Prolog programming, expert systems, or natural language processing.

Linguists and psychologists formulate theoretical models and empirical analyses of the influence of such factors as on various levels of language processing. These relate specifically to syntactic and semantic parsing, lexical selection, and text production. The issue of \"hearer orientation\" in language use lies at the forefront of interest in this anthology, and is tackled from such different fields as linguistics, text linguistics, formal semantics, social psychology, psychology of language, artificial intelligence, and second language acquisition.","--From the publisher's announcement The contents of the volume are: Language processing in social context: An interdisciplinary view, by Rainer Dietrich and Carl F.
