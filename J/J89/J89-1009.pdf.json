{"sections":[{"title":"Book","paragraphs":["Reviews Briefly Noted several potential mechanisms that might be used in these cases, such as focusing (Sidner 1979), or preference semantics (Wilks 1975), but none of them were implemented.","Unfortunately, although early semantic analysis is an intuitively plausible approach, and Mellish explores it thoroughly, there are basic questions about its generality and extensibility that are left unanswered. For example, the system is unable to handle some very central aspects of language, such as negation (\"The ends of the string are not fixed\") and generic reference (\"A string has two ends\"). These problems arise from a basic assumption in this system that noun phrases have specific referents, and the system falls short when this assumption is not met. If these problems are inevitable consequences of early semantic analysis, then it is hard to see how early semantic analysis could be used in a realistic system. Mellish owes the reader a discussion of these issues and not just a statement that handling them would require a major revision.","Another disappointment is that there is no attempt to integrate work done in the paradigm of focusing and centering (Grosz 1977, Sidner 1979, Grosz et al. 1983) with this approach. While this work may not have come to the attention of Mellish while he was doing the original work (1978-81), a detailed discussion of the relevance of the focusing work to his work would have been immensely valuable in the present volume. For example, the notion of focusing (or the related concept of centering (Grosz et al. 1983) can provide constraints on referents (as suggested by Rich and Luper-Foy 1987) and may be able to do some of the work that Mellish assigns to domain-specific reasoning. Typically, work in the focusing and centering paradigms has not been concerned to any great extent with the role of domain-specific reasoning. Because of this, an integration of these two approaches would have been very valuable.","It would also have been interesting to see a discussion of the pros and cons of using techniques like focusing versus domain-specific reasoning in cases where either could do the job. The exploration of early semantic analysis would also have been much more valuable if Mellish had spent more time discussing the implications of this work for future work in computational linguistics. Does he believe that the shortcomings in coverage that he points out mean that this work is just an interesting blind alley? Are there parts of the work that provide insights that should be used in future systems? Discussions of these questions would have been very helpful.","MeUish is refreshingly clear and explicit about the limitations of his work. There is also a very useful and detailed discussion of some relatively unexplored types of noun phrases. For example, the program described here has good coverage of some interesting types of plural noun phrases, such as specific plurals with indefinite cardinality. An example of this is \"Small blocks, each of mass m, are clamped at the ends and at the 58 center of a light rod\". I am not aware of any other work that addresses the problems of handling these kinds of noun phrases to this extent.","This book contains some detailed information about the program, including algorithms, actual code, and traces of execution, which are very useful for understanding what is going on.
