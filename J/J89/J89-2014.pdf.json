The authors' broader purpose, however, is to develop a general theory of surface representation that can capture salient facts about prosodic structure in all languages and provide a suitable input to phonetic rules. --From the publisher's announcement BOOKS RECEIVED Books listed below that are marked with an asterisk will be reviewed in a future issue.","Readers who wish to review books for the journal should write, outlining their qualifications, to the book review editor, Graeme Hirst, Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada M5S 1A4.
