This model includes a formal definition of the syntactic structures and hence the sentences generated by the grammar. Realization rules (the rules by which the set of features, computed by the network traversal, are assembled into an English sentence) are not fully treated, though an outline is given of how they could be formulated in a first-order sorted logic.","Chapter 6 describes the implementation of SLANG, and Appendix B contains some sample sentences it generated. Appendix A contains a tutorial of the OPS5 production language.","One serious shortcoming mars the overall message of the book. This is the inadequate treatment of presentential planning issues. It has become increasingly clear over the last decade that realization--i.e., the formulation of smallish chunks of information as individual sentencesmis but one half of the problem of generating language, the small half at that. The other half involves the collection and organization of material into such chunks, a much less well-understood problem.","This is where the book disappoints. Patten's approach is to use the systemic notion of register--that is, roughly, the characteristics of a particular interaction between interlocutors, situated in time and place--to control the problem-solver-generator by setting crucial choice point values in the grammar network. This operation is called preselection. Once these values have been set, the remaining features are all fully determined and the production rules take care of their collection. Leaving aside the fact that Patten's interpretation of register is highly controversial in systemic linguistics, its use in the book significantly weakens the force of his claims. Naturally, one expects an account of the process of constructing various registers and of determining which points in the grammar registers should minimally control (or if not, how one is to go about making the remaining problem-solving decisions); one expects to find if not a full theory of register, at least a description of the theory underlying register. Almost no such information is given; instead, appeal is made to some text planner to construct, using information on the \"semantic stratum\", the appropriate values for preselection of appropriate values. Fragments of examples of semantic strata are given, one for a mother-child interaction and one, in an appendix, for a building task, but many questions about their status remain unaddressed: What is a semantic stratum? What information can it contain? How complete are the given strata? Do all mother-child interactions obey the given distinctions? Of the thousands of other locutions with which the mother could chastise and threaten, why are precisely the given sentences generated? What would control further variation? And so forth. The lack of develop-ment of a notation with which to control generation--an input notation, in some sense--is a serious shortcoming. Computational Linguistics, Volume 15, Number 2, June 1989","The book's strong points are, therefore, its accessible introduction to systemic grammar, its demonstration that a grammar can be implemented by production rules and treated in a problem-solving paradigm, its formal model of a systemic grammar, and the OPS5 tutorial. The reader will come from the book having learned something about all these matters, though not necessarily convinced that it describes the best paradigm for generation. Still, it is a valuable addition to any collection of books about the art of generating sentences by computer.

Boston: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1988, xvii + 178 pp. (The Kluwer International Series in Engineering and","Computer Science; Natural Language Processing and","Machine Translation) ISBN 0-89838-255-6, $39.95 (hb) Frederking describes a prototype natural language interface with two special features. First, the system is integrated in the sense that all processing--syntactic, semantic, pragmatic---is performed in the one module, written as a set of production rules. Second, there is particular attention to the resolution of elliptical utterances in the dialogue.","Frederking claims that \"no other system can handle the range of ellipsis phenomena\" (p. 5) that his can, though this is not backed up with any point-by-point comparison with other research. For example, the extensive work of the Linguistic String Project (e.g., Sager 1981; Sager, Friedman, and Lyman 1987) is never mentioned. It is also claimed that the system's virtues \"arise naturally from an approach that roughly corresponds to models of human natural language processing\" (p. 160), although there is no consideration of any psycholinguistic models. Webber's (1978) work on verb-phrase ellipsis is not discussed (though there is passing mention of her formal approach to discourse representation); Frederking apparently rejects Webber's conclusions as to what representations and processes are required in VP ellipsis resolution but doesn't say why.","The content of the book is Frederking's Ph.D. thesis from Carnegie Mellon University, with only the addition of an index and a change of title. (In the thesis title, \"integrated\" qualified \"model\", not \"dialogue\"; the significance of the change is unclear.) Only a small part of the book (20 pages) discusses theoretical aspects of the work; the bulk concerns details of the implementation in OPS5 (58 pages), and long annotated traces of the program (54 pages), with introduction, literature review, and conclusions taking the remaining space. Thus conference or journal publication might have been more 127 Book Reviews Books Received appropriate, with publication of the thesis as a technical report and by University Microfilms sufficing for the few readers who require the gory details.--G.H.
