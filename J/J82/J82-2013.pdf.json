{"sections":[{"title":"Guidelines for Submissions","paragraphs":["Manuscripts submitted to the American Journal of Computational Linguistics should be typed on 8.5x11-inch paper, double-spaced throughout, including footnotes and references. The paper should begin with an abstract of approximately 100 words. The language in which the manuscript is written must be English.","Footnotes should be numbered consecutively. Whenever it does not materially impede the logic and readability of the paper, footnote material should be included in the text. References should be listed alphabetically by author at the end of the paper. The preferred style is:","Surname, Initials (, and Surname, Initials) year","article title, or book title in italics.","periodical name in italics or publisher,","volume, number, pages or city, state/country: pages A portion of a book should have its title in quotes and then give the book information as above after an introductory \"In'. Editors should be indicated by ~Ed.\" after the final initials (for example, In Johnson, T.J. and Bullock, A.B., Ed., Teleology,) Whenever possible, callouts of references in the text should have the form Author(s) surname(s) date, for example, \"Smith and Jones 1963 show .... \"","The length of papers submitted for publication in the AJCL is determined by author requirements. However, our objective is to insure that as many worthy papers as possible will appear in each issue. Therefore, we would prefer that papers do not exceed 10 Journal pages in length. (This is the equivalent of approximately 40 double-spaced typewritten pages.)","Each paper submitted is fully refereed, being read by at least two members of the Editorial Board and usually by an additional expert in the particular subject area. Upon request to the Editor, an author's identity may be withheld from the referees.","The submission of a paper to the AJCL for refereeing means that the author certifies the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or accepted for publication by any refereed journal; nor is it being refereed elsewhere. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Editor at the time of submission.","The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by at least one of the authors (who agrees to inform the others, if any) or, in the case of a \"work made for hire,\" by the employer. The form for copyright transfer will be sent to the responsible author, who must return it signed to the Editor before the paper will be finally accepted. This written transfer of copyright is necessary under the 1978 U. S. Copyright Law.","Preferably, the final version of an accepted paper will be submitted in machinereadable form, such as a file on magnetic tape. Authors will be given instructions as to how to prepare such a file. In general, notation should be selected so as to simplify the phototypesetting process. Also, figures should be devised with consideration for whether they would require one column or two columns in the final Journal form. Any drawing required is the author's responsibility. After publication, fifty free reprints of an article are provided to the authors.","Five copies of manuscripts should be sent to the Editor:","James F. Allen","Computer Science","University of Rochester","Rochester, NY 14627","(716) 275-5288","Contributions of other types of material are sought, also, such as copies of technical reports and papers for abstracting purposes, review copies of books, advance announcements of meetings, personal notes (such as honors and job changes), letters to the editor, and short technical notes. All items should be sent to the Editor at the address given above."]}]}
