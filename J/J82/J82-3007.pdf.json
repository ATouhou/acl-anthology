Coverage for the United States and Canada is reasonable, although probably not complete. However, there is relatively little information from Europe and Asia, and none at all from Australia and Africa. The following items are required: the name of the institution, its address, and an appropriate telephone number for contact; the graduate degrees awarded and the departments awarding them; the faculty members involved in CL, their departmental affiliations and research areas; CL courses with names and numbers; any special programs; current or recent research projects of interest; and computational facilities.

Epstein, former director of the Medical Computer Science Research Group at the National Library of Medicine's Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communication, his friends have established the SCAMC/Epstein Memorial Fund. The fund will be used for an award to be given to students of medical computing. Proposed ideas for the award range from an annual SCAMC student paper competition to a scholarship, depending upon the amount contributed. SCAMC is the annual Symposium on Computer Applications in Medical Care.","Marty's long and distinguished career as a computer scientist in the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps at the National Institutes of Health began in 1964. Over the years, he served as a staff member of three NIH components: first, at the Division of Research Services; later, at the Division of Computer Research and Technology; and last, at the National Library of Medicine. His extensive knowledge of both medicine and computer science, and his ability to communicate effectively with people in both disciplines, made him a particularly valuable contributor to the field of computers and medicine.","Marty was a long-time member of the Association for Computational Linguistics. While on leave from NIH at the University of California, San Francisco, he developed MEDINQUIRY, a system that provided physicians with natural language access to information from patient medical records. He was continuing work on that project, as well as on a number of related efforts, at NLM at the time of his death. The goal of all his research was furthering biomedical communication. His accomplishments throughout his career constitute significant steps toward that objective.","Donations to the fund are tax-deductible.
