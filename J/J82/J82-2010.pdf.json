Authors should clearly indicate to what extent the work is complete and, if relevant, to what extent it has been implemented. A summary exceeding eight double-spaced pages in length may not receive the attention it deserves.","All submissions will be read by the program committee, which is chaired by Mitchell Marcus, Bell Laboratories, and consists of Philip Cohen, Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corp., Lauri Karttunen, University of Texas, Austin, William Mann, USC/Information Sciences Institute, Robert Moore, SR! International, Ann Robinson, Symantec, and Robert Wilensky, University of California, Berkeley.","Authors will be notified of the acceptance of their papers by March 7, 1983. Full-length versions of accepted papers submitted by April 18, 1983 will be included in the Proceedings of the Conference.","Local arrangements are being handled by Jonathan Allen, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, MIT, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139 [phone: (617) 253-2509; ARPANET: ja@mit-ai].","For other information regarding the annual meeting, contact: Don Walker (ACL), Artificial Intelligence Center, SRI International EJ278, Menlo Park, California, 94025 [phone: (415) 859-3071; ARPAN-ET: walker@sri-ai]. Call for Papers - IJCAI-83","The Eighth International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, IJCAI-83, will be held in Karlsruhe, West Germany, on August 8-12, 1983. There will also be a two-day Tutorial Program from AISB and GI on August 7 and 8, 1983.","The IJCAI conferences are the main forum for the presentation of Artificial Intelligence research to an international audience. The goal of IJCAI-83 is to promote scientific interchange, within and between all subfields of Artificial Intelligence, among researchers from all over the world. The conference is sponsored by International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence, Inc., and co-sponsored by Gesellschaft for Informatik (West Germany), the Society for the Study of Artificial Intelligence and the Simulation of Behaviour (Britain), and Nederlandse Vereniging voor kunstmatige Intelligentie (The Netherlands).","Papers concerning all aspects of Artificial Intelligence will be considered. Complete drafts, in English, should be received by the program chairman by February 1, 1983. Final versions of accepted papers will appear in the conference proceedings.","The refereeing and the sessions will be organized around the following subfields: Automatic Programming, Cognitive Modelling, Expert Systems, Knowledge Representation, Learning and Knowledge Acquisition, Logic Programming, Natural Language, Planning and Search, Robotics, System Support, Theorem Proving, and Vision.","In addition to the contributed papers, the program will include several invited papers, panel discussions, and special interest sessions. Suggestions for these should be sent to the program chairman.","The conference will also include program demonstrations and exhibits. Submissions and requests in these categories should be directed to the local arrangements chairmen. Program demonstrations will not be refereed.","Submissions to the technical program and program enquiries should be sent to the program chairman: American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 8, Number 2, April-June 1982 87 The FINITE STRING Newsletter Announcements Alan Bundy Department of Artificial Intelligence University of Edinburgh Hope Park Square Edinburgh, EH8 9NW, SCOTLAND (44-31) 667-1011 ext 6507","Enquiries about program demonstrations and exhibits","should be sent to the local arrangements chairmen: Graham Wrightson, Joerg Siekmann, and Peter Raulefs Institut fur Informatik 1 Universitat Karlsruhe Postfach 6380 D-7500 Karlsruhe 1, WEST GERMANY (49- 721) 608-3975","General enquiries should be directed to the General","Chairman: Saul Amarel Computer Science Department Hill Center/Busch Campus Rutgers University New Brunswick, New Jersey 08903, USA (1-201) 932-3546","Information about special inexpensive travel arrange-","ments can be obtained from: Kandeler Reisebtiro GmbH HauptstraBe 55, P.O. Box 1267 D-6744 Kandel, GERMANY (07275) 2018 or 2019 Announcements ACL Book Series","A new book series has been announced by the Cambridge University Press. It is entitled Studies in Natural Language Processing, and has Aravind K. Joshi as the General Editor.","The Association for Computational Linguistics is sponsoring this series of monographs, texts, and collections of papers on scientific and scholarly topics which represent the range of professional activity of concern to its membership. Methods of investigation include the algorithmic, mathematical, and heuristic methods of formal linguistics and artificial intelligence, and the experimental methods of cognitive psychology and psycholinguistics.","It is anticipated that books to appear in the series will be of three general types: research monographs, textbooks, and collections of papers. Research monographs, aimed at the professional reader, will be detailed reports of significant research projects or literature reviews of a size beyond the compass of a journal article. Appropriately revised doctoral dissertations of particularly high quality may be considered for inclusion in the series in this category.","Courses in computational linguistics are becoming increasingly common in departments of linguistics and computer science, and there are so far few, if any, suitable textbooks. Students must rely largely on scattered journal articles and instructors' lectures. Proposals for texts by authors of established reputations in the field will be entertained. A text might be in the nature of a general survey, or might concentrate on one of the major subareas of research.","The third category of books will be collections of papers. These will in no case be proceedings of general meetings or otherwise heterogeneous collections. Rather, each will be a thematically coherent set of research reports bearing on a single, well-defined topic of current significance, assembled under strong direction and control by an editor or editors who will be responsible for the quality of all the contents, and who will provide a unifying introduction. Such a collection might result from a symposium on a particular topic, to 'which the participants submit written papers. Or chapters on various aspects of important problems in a particular area may be especially commissioned by a volume editor. Collections of already-published papers, in cases where the subject is a major and significant one, the papers represent definitive treatments of particular approaches to it, and the papers are in scattered and perhaps not readily available sources, may occasionally be considered.","The Editorial Board for the series consists of: Jonathan Allen, M.I.T., Jaime Carbonell, Carnegie-Mellon University, Eugene Charniak, Brown University, Paul Chapin, N.S.F., Phil Cohen, Fairchild, Inc., Martha Evens, Illinois Institute of Technology, Joyce Friedman, University of Michigan, Maurice Gross, University of Paris, Barbara Grosz, SRI International, George Heidorn, IBM Research, Ronald Kaplan, Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, Hans Karlgran, KVAL, Sweden, Lauri Karttunen, University of Texas, Austin, Martin Kay, Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, Jan Lansbergen, Phillips Research Laboratories, Eindhoven, Wendy Lehnert, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, William Mann, USC/Information Sciences Institute, Mitch Marcus, Bell Laboratories, Makoto Nagao, Kyoto University, St~mley Petrick, IBM Research, Ray Perrault, University of Toronto, Ellen Prince, University of Pennsylvania, Chris Riesbeck, Yale University, Jane Robinson, SRI International, Naomi Sager, New York University, Peter Sgall, Charles University, Prague, Candy Sidner, Bolt Beranek and Newman, Norman Sondheimer, USC/Information Sciences Institute, Fred Thompson, California Institute of Technology, Walter von Hahn, University of Hamburg, Donald Walker, SRI International Bonnie Webber, University of Pennsylvania, 88 American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 8, Number 2, April-June 1982"]}]}
