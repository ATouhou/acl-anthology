When we took over as editors pro tern., we inherited a number of papers in the process of being reviewed by referees or being revised by authors, but no papers in final form awaiting publication. The process of keeping after referees to turn in their reviews, encouraging authors of conditionally accepted papers to make necessary revisions, and producing the final version of revised papers in camera-ready form has proved to be much more tortuous and time-consuming than we anticipated. Consequently, this first issue of 1982 is coming out in October. Prospects for future issues are brighter. We now have in hand the proceedings of the workshop on \"Applied Computational Linguistics in Perspective\", jointly organized by NRL, ACL, and NSF and funded by ONR, which took place June 26-27, 1981, at Stanford University. We also have a number of accepted papers being revised by their authors. Consequently, it is expected that the April-June issue will follow close on the heels of this one.","We are happy to report that our interim editorship is over, and that James Allen of the University of Rochester will be taking over on a permanent basis starting with the third issue of 1982. Future contributions should be sent to him at the address given on the inside back cover. It is clear that one or possibly two issues of 1982 will have to appear in 1983. Our goal is to limit this to the last issue of 1982, and with the cooperation of reviewers and authors, this should be possible. We will delay the thanks we owe to everyone who has assisted us until the next and (for us) final issue. In the meantime, we would like to thank you readers for your patience, and to encourage you to hang in there; more issues are on the way."]},{"title":"F. J. Damerau and S. R.
