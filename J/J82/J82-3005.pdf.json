The values for 1982 are not indicative, since many people send dues in late, and no reminder notice has yet been mailed. Reflecting on the closeness of the membership drive to the target 1500 requirement for continuing membership in the American Federation of Information Processing Societies, the Executive Committee has approved a 20th Anniversary new member dues rate of $10 for 1982. Those present at the business meeting were asked to inform people about the new rate and encourage them to become members. The Executive Committee also established an International Fund that will be used to provide membership and publications for people in countries where it is difficult to use national currencies for international transactions. Again, those present at the business meeting were encouraged to contribute and to inform others about the existence of the new fund. [The membership figures for 1977, 1978, 1979/80, 1981, and 1982 (through June 11) are appended to these Minutes.]","Candy Sidner (a member of the Membership Committee), reflecting on the cost and effort entailed in the membership drive (carried out under Jim Moore's general direction), suggested that such drives might best be conducted every five years. Walker noted that there are still major groups in microcomputers and in office automation that have not yet been contacted. 150 American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 8, Number 3-4, July-December 1982 The FINITE STRING Newsletter Minutes of the 1982 ACL Meeting Other Meetings","Lance Miller announced that the two sessions held at the AFIPS Office Automation Conference in April had been successful.

Paul Chapin was responsible for the organizational work associated with its development. Members are encouraged to contribute manuscripts for consideration. European Chapter","Harry Somers described the motivation behind the establishment of a European Chapter for the ACL. Its primary objectives would be to simplify dues payment and to provide an opportunity for European members, few of whom can attend the ACL annual meetings, to have an opportunity to get together. It would also provide a mechanism for simplifying the distribution of mailings to European members. The establishment of a chapter required amending the ACL Constitution; draft copies of the proposed revisions were circulated to the membership earlier in the Spring. Robinson asked for approval of the proposed amendments, and they were affirmed unanimously. [A copy of the revised ACL Constitution is appended to these minutes.] She remarked that the Executive Committee, now authorized to establish chapters, would meet the next day to approve a constitution for the European Chapter.
