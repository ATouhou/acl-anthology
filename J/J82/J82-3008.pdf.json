A system named KAMP is described that is capable of producing English sentences as part of a plan to enlist the cooperation of another agent in achieving a goal involving a change in the physical state of the world. The planner uses knowledge about the different sub-goals to be achieved and linguistic rules about English to produce sentences that satisfy multiple goals through the realization of multiple illocutionary acts.

Dividing Up The Question Answering Process Marc Luria Division of Computer Science Department of EECS University of California at Berkeley Berkeley, California 94720 Proc. 1982 AAA/ Conf., Aug. 1982, 71-74.","This paper describes a question answering program which divides question answering into two separate processes: answer formation and answer expression. Rather than gathering possible answers and choosing the best among them, the program accesses the database and finds all components of possible answers, e.g. a causal chain, and then passes this information to an expression program which formulates a proper answer. Argument Molecules: A Functional Representation of Argument Structure Lawrence Birnbaum Department of Computer Science Box 2158 Yale Station Yale University New Haven, Connecticut 06520 Proc. 1982 AAA/ Conf., Aug. 1982, 63-65.","Understanding an utterance in an argument crucially requires determining the evidential relations it bears to prior and subsequent propositions in the argument. The memory representation of an argument should, accordingly, indicate which propositions a given proposition counts as evidence for (a support relation) or against (an attack relation), and which propositions support or attack it in turn. The representation of an argument can thus be viewed as a network of propositions connected by support or attack relations (an argument graph). Although this sort of representation can be motivated simply by the need to represent the content of an argument, it seems natural to ask whether such argument graphs might further possess any useful structural properties, abstracted from the specific propositions they relate.

This paper Salience as a Simplifying Metaphor for Natural Language Generation David D. McDonald and E. Jeffery Conklin Department of Computer and Information Science University of Massachusetts Amherst, Massachusetts 01002 Proc. 1982 AAA/ Conf., Aug. 1982, 75-78.","We have developed a simple yet effective technique for planning the generation of natural language texts that describe photographs of natural scenes as processed by the UMass VISIONS system. The texts follow the ordering on the scene's objects that is imposed by their visual salience -- an ordering which we believe is naturally computed as a by-product of visual processing, and thus is available -- for free -- as the basis for generating simple but effective texts without requiring the complex planning machinery often applied in generation. We suggest that it should be possible to find structural analogs to visual salience in other domains and to build comparably simple generation schemes based on them. We look briefly at how one such analogy might be drawn for the task of tutor-ing novice PASCAL programmers. Conceptual Dependency and Montague Grammar: A Step Toward Conciliation Mark A. Jones and David S. Warren Department of Computer Science State University of New York at Stony Brook Stony Brook, New York 11794 Proc. 1982 AAA/ Conf., Aug. 1982, 79-83.","In attempting to establish a common basis from which the approaches and results can be compared, we have taken a conciliatory attitude toward natural language research in the conceptual dependency (CD) American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 8, Number 3-4, July-December 1982 159 The FINITE STRING Newsletter Abstracts of Current Literature paradigm and Montague Grammar (MG) formalism. Although these two approaches may seem to be strange bedfellows indeed with often noticeably different perspectives, we have observed many commonalities. We begin with a brief description of the problem view and ontology of each and then create a formula-tion of CD as logic. We then give \"conceptual\" MG translations for the words in an example sentence which we use in approximating a word-based parsing style. Finally, we make some suggestions regarding further extensions of logic to introduce higher level representations. Event Shape Diagrams D. L. Waltz Coordinated Science Laboratory University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Urbana, Illinois 61801 Proc. 1982 AAAI Conf., Aug. 1982, 84-87.","\"Event shape diagrams\" are proposed as a representation for capturing the nuances of meaning of verbs that describe similar events. These diagrams represent timing, causal relationships between case roles, and typical value ranges for role fillers. Event shape diagrams are expressed in terms of primitive predicates and timing information that we believe could be computed by perceptual systems, and are intended to be a step toward the eventual connection of language systems to perceptual (vision, hearing, and touch) sensing systems. The diagrams are capable of representing modification of verbs by adverbs, can support judgments of the degree of plausibility of various interpretations of a sentence's meaning, and may be useful in figuring out the meaning of certain kinds of metaphors. An Explanation for Minimal Attachment and Right Association Robert W. Milne Air Force Institute of Technology AFIT/ENG Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433 Proc. 1982 AAAI Conf., Aug. 1982, 88-90.","This paper describes the principles of Right Association and Minimal Attachment and explains how the Sausage Machine and ATN describe these principles. It is then shown that these two models cannot explain these principles. It is then shown that a production system grammar can both describe these principles as well as suggest why they must be true. A Synthetic Approach to Temporal Information Processing Mark D. Grover TRW Defense Systems One Space Park Redondo Beach, California 90278 Proc. 1982 AAAI Conf., Aug. 1982, 91-94.","A representation and processing scheme for temporal (time-based) information is presented. Previous computer science approaches to temporal information processing are analyzed. Linguistic analysis of tense, aspect, and temporal adverbials provides motivation for an automated general temporal understanding system. A synthetic approach is proposed, combining possible-worlds branching time theory with inertia futures, elements of Montague Grammar, a fourvalued logic and the interval semantics time model. Key portions of the model are implemented and demonstrated in a PASCAL program. Word Sense and Case Slot Disambiguation Graeme Hirst and Eugene Charniak Department of Computer Science Brown University Providence, Rhode Island 02912 Proc. 1982 AAA/ Conf., Aug. 1982, 95-98.","The tasks of disambiguating words and determining case are similar and can usefully be combined. We present two cooperating mechanisms that each work on both tasks: MARKER PASSING finds connections between concepts in a system of frames, and POLAR-OID WORDS provide a protocol for negotiation between ambiguous words and cases. Examples of each in action are given. The cooperating mechanisms al-low linguistic and world knowledge to be unified, frequently eliminate the need to use inference in disambiguation, and provide a usefully constrained model of disambiguation.

Toward Connectionist Parsing Steven Small, Gary Cottrell, and Lokendra Shastri Department of Computer Science The University of Rochester Rochester, New York 14627 Proc. 1982 AAAI Conf., Aug. 1982, 247-250.","The parsing of natural language is the product of dense interactions among various comprehension processes. We believe that traditional models have greatly underestimated the richness of these interactions. We propose a model for low-level parsing which is massively parallel, highly distributed, and highly connected. The model suggests a solution to the problem of word sense disambiguation which is psychologically plausible and computationally feasible. The paper outlines the general connectionist paradigm followed by a brief description of a three-level network to do parsing. Finally we trace through an example to illustrate the functioning of the model. Why Do Children Misunderstand Reversible Passives? The CHILD Program Learns to Understand Passive Sentences Mallory Selfridge Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science University of Connecticut Storrs, Connecticut 06268 Proc. 1982 AAAI Conf., Aug. 1982, 251-254.","As children learn language they initially misunderstand reversible passive sentences as if they were active sentences. This error is an important clue to possible mechanisms by which children learn to understand passives in general. This paper reports on how the CHILD program learns to understand passive sentences, initially misunderstanding reversible passives as it does so. It presents an explanation of children's performance based on CHILD, and presents a number of predictions which follow from this explanation. Plan Understanding, Narrative Comprehension, and Story Schemas William F.

Here, \"complex\" entails the coordination, application, and search of many distinct sources of knowledge during both comprehension and question answering. This paper concentrates only on those structures and processes which interact with affect situations. The affect component in BORIS is not a separate module, but rather a series of structures and processes which arise as various lexical items are encountered during narrative comprehension and question answering (Dyer, 1981b).

GIST English Generator Bill Swartout use/Information Sciences Institute 4676 Admiralty Way Marina del Rey, California 90291 Proc. 1982 AAAI Conf., Aug. 1982, 404-409.","This paper describes a prototype English generator which can produce English descriptions of program specifications written in Gist, a program specification language being developed at ISI. Such a facility is required because although Gist is a high level specification language, specifications written in it, like those in all other formal specification languages, are unreadable. There are several reasons for this unreadability: strange syntax; redundancy elimination; lack of the-matic structure; implicit remote interactions; no representation of the motivation or rationale behind the specification; and a strict reliance on textual presenta-tion. The current generator deals with the first two problems and part of the third. Our plans for dealing with the rest are outlined after a description of the current generator. Automatic Schema Acquisition in a Natural Language Environment Gerald DeJong Coordinated Science Laboratory University of Illinois Urbana, Illinois 61820 Proc. 1982 AAAI Conf., Aug. 1982, 410-413.","This paper outlines an approach to schema acquisi-tion. The approach, called"]},{"title":"explanatory schema acquisi-tion","paragraphs":["is applicable in problem solving situations and is heavily knowledge-based. Basically, learning is viewed as a fundamental part of the understanding process. Understanding a situation for which there is no exist-ing schema involves generalizing the new event into a nascent schema. The new schema is then available to aid in future processing. This approach to learning is unique in several respects: it is not inductive and so is capable of one trial learning, it does not depend on failures to drive the learning process, and it is incremental and learns comparatively slowly. The learning procedure is outlined briefly with an example, a taxonomy of situations involving explanatory schema acquisition is given, and there is a brief discussion on the scope of the learning mechanism.

Recognizing Humor in Newspaper Cartoons by Resolving Ambiguities Through Pragmatics Lawrence Mazlack and Noemi M.

Captioned cartoons derive their humor from a sudden incongruity which'can be made to follow by a human being who can automatically use stored world knowledge to resolve the ambiguous situation. Likewise, computer analysis of natural language statements also needs to successfully resolve ambiguous situations. Computerized understanding of dialogue that takes place between humans must not only include syntactical and semantical analysis, but also pragmatical analysis. Pragmatics consists of an understanding of the speaker's intentions, the context of the utterance, and social implications of polite human communication.","Computer techniques have already been developed to use restricted world knowledge in resolving ambiguous language use. This paper illustrates how these techniques can be used in resolving ambiguous situations arising in cartoons. Pragmatic Factors in Pronoun Reference Assignment Valerie C. Abbott and John B. Black Cognitive Science Program Yale University New Haven, Connecticut 06520 Proc. 4th Ann. Conf. Cog. Sci. Soc., Aug. 1982, 70-72.","Identifying factors that influence pronoun reference assignment is a challenge to anyone attempting to characterize the process of language understanding. Because a pronoun itself carries only a small part of the meaning that the understander is expected to assign to it, he or she must use contextual information to assign the pronoun an unambiguous referent. Characterizing aspects of the context which are used for this purpose is an active area of psychological research.","Many recent studies have considered the role of syntactic context, that is, the effect of structural constraints on pronoun reference in a fragment of text, typically a sentence, without recourse to constraints which might be found in the meaning of the text. In-vestigators have also examined the role of semantic factors within sentences in directing the assignment of referents. The studies reported here focus on the use of pragmatic constraints in resolving anaphoric pronouns. We are concerned with characterizing two major sources of contextual information in paragraphlength texts, and evaluating their influence on pronominal reference assignment.

Bi-directional inference resuits from the interaction between forward and backward inference and loosely corresponds to bi-directional search. We show through an example that, when used throughout a session of related tasks, bi-directional inference sets up a conversational context and prunes the search through the space of inference rules by ignoring rules which are not relevant to that context.

We use a particular spreading activation or active semantic network scheme, called connectionism, which consists of a massive number of appropriately connected computing units that communicate through weight-ed levels of excitation and inhibition. We show how a number of classical problems in the theory of schema-ta might be approached in a new way.

Careful analysis of a wide range of sample texts reveals that such decisions are often based on complex evaluations of the interpretation being constructed, and sometimes cause the reader to construct and discard a number of intermediate inferences before settling on a final interpretation for a text. This paper describes Judgmental Inference theory as a proposed scheme of evaluation metrics and mechanisms, derived from examination of inference decisions arising during text understanding.

Salveter Department of Computer Science State University of New York at Stony Brook Stony Brook, New York 11794 Proc. 1982 European A/ Conf., Ju/y 1982, 244-249.","Although a great deal of research effort has been expended in support of natural language (NL) database querying, little effort has gone into NL database"]},{"title":"update.","paragraphs":["One reason for this is that in NL querying one can tie nouns and stative verbs in the query to database objects (relation names, attributes and domain values). In many cases this correspondence seems sufficient to interpret NL queries. NL update seems to require database counterparts for active verbs, such as"]},{"title":"hire, schedule","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"enroll.","paragraphs":["We suggest a database counterpart for active verbs, which we call verbgraphs, that may be used to support NL update. A verbgraph is a structure for representing the various database changes that a given verb might describe. Oth.er possible uses of verbgraphs include specification of de-faults, prompting of the user to guide user interaction, and enforcing database integrity constraints. An Informative, Adaptable, and Efficient Natural Language Consultable Database System Jean Francois Pique Lab. de Biophysique Faculte de Medecine Timone Universite Aix-Marseille II Marseille, FRANCE Paul Sabatier N. Inteligencia Artificial Dept. de Informatica Universidade Nova de Lisboa Lisbon, PORTUGAL Proc. 1982 European AI Conf., July 1982, 250-254.","Within a unique formalism, logic is a powerful theoretical basis allowing one to represent a database and to express the different types of processing -- syntactic, semantic and deductive --","involved when this database is consulted in natural language. In this framework we describe a complete system using a three-truth valued logic, rigorously defined. This logic allows a very fine representation of question semantics and lays the theoretical basis for the creation of an informative system consulted by casual or non-expert users. We compare the performance of our system with that of related ones, and outline possible extensions. Taking the Initiative in Natural Language Data Base Interactions: Monitoring as Response Eric Mays, Aravind K. Joshi, and Bonnie L. Webber Department of Computer and Information Science Moore School of Electrical Engineering/D2 University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104 Proc. 1982 European AI Conf., July 1982, 255-256.","This note is intended as a status report on our ongo-ing work in the area of natural language interaction with dynamic knowledge bases. Specifically, we discuss that portion of our research involving the offer by the question-answering system to monitor for future changes in the knowledge base. Applying a Chart Parser to Speech Understanding Guenther Goerz ERZE Univ. Erlangen-Nuernberg Erlangen, W. GERMANY and Neuropsychiatric Institute University of California, Los Angeles Los Angeles, California Proc. 1982 European AI Conf., July 1982, 257-258.","We describe GLP, a chart parser that will be used as a SYNTAX module of the Erlangen Speech Understanding System. After a brief outline of the speech system's architecture we introduce the concept of chart parsing. The parser itself realizes a multiprocessing structure using an agenda, which easily allows the application of various parsing strategies in a transparent way. Finally we discuss which features have to be incorporated into the parser in order to process speech data: direction independent island parsing, handling of scores, and the interaction with higher level components like SEMANTICS. HOW to Write a Story Masoud Yazdani Cognitive Studies Programme University of Sussex Brighton, ENGLAND Proc. 1982 European AI Conf., July 1982, 259-260.","A scenario for story writing is presented which attempts to improve that of TALE-SPIN. The overall model presented attempts to simulate Goal Directed Behavior of characters as well as intentions of the story written. The scenario of a computer program ROALD based on a sub-set of the model is presented. American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 8, Number 3-4, July-December 1982 167"]}]}
