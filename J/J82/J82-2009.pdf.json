Papers are being solicited on linguistically","and computationally significant topics, including but","not limited to the following: • syntax, parsing, and language generation, includ-","ing aspects of linguistic theories relevant to com-","putational models, = computational semantics, including logic, refer-","ence, anaphora, and metaphor, ° discourse analysis and speech acts, . representation of knowledge, deduction, and plan-","ning as related to language understanding or","production, ° speech analysis and synthesis, ° machine translation, machine-aided translation,","and automated dictionaries, • formal foundations of computational linguistics, • applied computational linguistics, and • software tools for computational linguistics.","An author wishing to present a paper should submit six copies of a five to eight page summary, double-spaced, by February 1, 1983 to: Mitchell Marcus, 2D-443, Bell Laboratories, 600 Mountain Avenue, Murray Hill, New Jersey, 07974 [phone: (201) 582-3948].","It is important that the summary contain sufficient information, including references to relevant literature, to convey the new ideas and allow the program committee to determine the scope of the work. Authors should clearly indicate to what extent the work is complete and, if relevant, to what extent it has been implemented. A summary exceeding eight double-spaced pages in length may not receive the attention it deserves.","All submissions will be read by the program committee, which is chaired by Mitchell Marcus, Bell Laboratories, and consists of Philip Cohen, Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corp., Lauri Karttunen, University of Texas, Austin, William Mann, USC/Information Sciences Institute, Robert Moore, SR! International, Ann Robinson, Symantec, and Robert Wilensky, University of California, Berkeley.","Authors will be notified of the acceptance of their papers by March 7, 1983. Full-length versions of accepted papers submitted by April 18, 1983 will be included in the Proceedings of the Conference.","Local arrangements are being handled by Jonathan Allen, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, MIT, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139 [phone: (617) 253-2509; ARPANET: ja@mit-ai].","For other information regarding the annual meeting, contact: Don Walker (ACL), Artificial Intelligence Center, SRI International EJ278, Menlo Park, California, 94025 [phone: (415) 859-3071; ARPAN-ET: walker@sri-ai]. Call for Papers - IJCAI-83","The Eighth International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, IJCAI-83, will be held in Karlsruhe, West Germany, on August 8-12, 1983. There will also be a two-day Tutorial Program from AISB and GI on August 7 and 8, 1983.","The IJCAI conferences are the main forum for the presentation of Artificial Intelligence research to an international audience. The goal of IJCAI-83 is to promote scientific interchange, within and between all subfields of Artificial Intelligence, among researchers from all over the world. The conference is sponsored by International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence, Inc., and co-sponsored by Gesellschaft for Informatik (West Germany), the Society for the Study of Artificial Intelligence and the Simulation of Behaviour (Britain), and Nederlandse Vereniging voor kunstmatige Intelligentie (The Netherlands).","Papers concerning all aspects of Artificial Intelligence will be considered. Complete drafts, in English, should be received by the program chairman by February 1, 1983. Final versions of accepted papers will appear in the conference proceedings.","The refereeing and the sessions will be organized around the following subfields: Automatic Programming, Cognitive Modelling, Expert Systems, Knowledge Representation, Learning and Knowledge Acquisition, Logic Programming, Natural Language, Planning and Search, Robotics, System Support, Theorem Proving, and Vision.","In addition to the contributed papers, the program will include several invited papers, panel discussions, and special interest sessions. Suggestions for these should be sent to the program chairman.","The conference will also include program demonstrations and exhibits. Submissions and requests in these categories should be directed to the local arrangements chairmen. Program demonstrations will not be refereed.","Submissions to the technical program and program enquiries should be sent to the program chairman: American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 8, Number 2, April-June 1982 87"]}]}
