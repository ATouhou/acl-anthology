Program of the Applied Natural Language Processing Conference","A conference on Applied Natural Language Processing, sponsored by the Association for Computational Linguistics and the Naval Research Laboratory, will be held Tuesday, February 1, through Thursday, February 3, 1983, at the Miramar-Sheraton Hotel in Santa Monica, California. This special conference will focus on the use of computational linguistic techniques to solve real world problems. The conference will be limited to 300 participants. In addition to presentations of technical papers, there will be demonstrations of working systems and exhibits of special purpose processors, tools and other materials that support natural language processing. In conjunction with the conference, a tutorial program will be offered on Monday, January 31.
