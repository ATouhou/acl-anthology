Campbell develop a philosophical theory of action that is distinguished by its identification of an action with \"those and only those properties intended of the event caused by the intentional state of the agent [who performs the event]\" (p. 14).","The book is divided into two main parts. In the first part, Chapters 1--4, the authors develop their theory of action. Chapter 1 begins by reviewing the main alternative theories of action, 'grading' each in terms of how well it meets a set of five criteria that the authors feel constitute desiderata for any such theory. For example, they claim that any useful theory of action should model actions as the right type of thing to participate in a causation relation, and should provide a basis for moral appraisal. Not surprisingly, Coval and Campbell find all the alternatives lacking on at least one of the criteria. They then present their main idea--that actions should be seen as objects that explicitly reveal their own intentional cause--and suggest that a theory built around this idea will successfully meet all five criteria. Chapters 2-4 are devoted to the working out of this theory.","The second part of the book consists of a chapter (Chapter 5) that describes a computer program called PRAGMA, the Practical Rational Agency Machine. PRAGMA was designed to test the consistency of the authors' theory. A PRAGMA user inputs the description of \"an agency case\", i.e., some agent-generated event. PRAGMA guides the user by asking a series of questions about what the agent intended, what actually occurred, what the agent believed about the relationship between what was intended and what occurred, and so on. PRAGMA can then use this information to determine whether, according to Coval and Campbell's theory, the event should be considered to be an (intentional) action, or whether instead it should be considered unintentional or mistaken or inadvertent. The system does this by performing pattern matching using the input information, which it stores in a data structure called an Object Frame, and a set of definitions of mistake, inadvertence, etc., given in terms of the slots of an Object Frame.","Coval and Campbell's prose is often an-noyingly turgid, and their convoluted notation for representing actions, intentions, de-sires, and the relations between these is unlikely to appeal to the computer scientist. In addition, although there remain many difficult and fascinating open questions surrounding linguistic pragmatics, it is not clear that the main theoretical move made in this book, to wit, shifting the boundary between intention and action"]},{"title":"simpliciter,","paragraphs":["will be of much immediate use in addressing those"]},{"title":"questions.--Martha E.

And Peter Kahrel gives an in-depth explanation why this is the case. In its latest versions (WordPerfect 5.1 and WordPerfect for Windows), the program supports about 1900 different characters, including characters with diacritics for many Latin-alphabet European languages, the Greek, Hebrew, and Cyrillic alphabets, and two Japanese scripts. Kahrel explains how you can have all these characters at your fingertips. Advanced users will learn how to tailor the keyboard to their needs, how to modify existing fonts, and how to create new ones.","According to Kahrel, WordPerfect offers 20 language modules. This includes four modules for English (American, Australian, British, and Canadian), two modules for German (Standard and Swiss) and Portuguese (Brazil and Portugal). A complete language module contains a hyphenation module, a spelling checker, and a thesaurus. (Some language modules are not complete.) Kahrel not only explains how to use the hyphenation module and the spelling checker, but also how to customize and extend each to personal needs.","The great advantage of the WordPerfect setup is that you need only one copy of the general word processing system, and you can buy the language modules separately. You can even apply different language modules within a single document.","The book is a must for every linguist working with WordPerfect. It presupposes basic knowledge about the software, but it will certainly give the novice a good taste of what WordPerfect offers to authors of multilingual documents. It will provide the experienced WordPerfect user with many insights into the linguistic aspects of the software.","With the book comes a disk containing the WordPerfect macros that are introduced in the book. I tested two of them. The first changes all footnotes and endnotes of a document to regular text, appending it at the end of the file. The macro did not work properly on my computer, but I could fix it within minutes. (Readers who need the fix may write to me at volk@informatik.unikoblenz.de.) The second macro transliterates Greek texts into Latin texts, and it worked nicely.--Martin Volk, University of Koblenz-Landau Lexical Semantics and Knowledge Representation James Pustejovsky and Sabine Bergler (editors) (Brandeis University and Concordia University) Berlin: Springer-Verlag (Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence, edited by J6rg Siekmann, Volume 627), 1992, xii + 381 pp. Paperbound, ISBN 3-540-55801-2 and 0-387-55801-2, no price listed This book contains revised versions of most of the papers held at the first workshop of the ACUs Special Interest Group on the Lexicon (SIGLEX) at Berkeley in June 1992.
