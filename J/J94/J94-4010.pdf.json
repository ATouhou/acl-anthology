{"sections":[{"title":"Briefly Noted Towards High-Precision Machine Translation: Based on Contrastive Textology John Laffiing","paragraphs":["Berlin: Foris Publications (Distributed Language Translation Series, edited by Toon Witkam), 1991, xiii + 178 pp. Hardbound, ISBN 3-11-013388-1, DM 98.00 High-Precision Machine Translation is defined in this book as machine translation for dissemination, with particular emphasis on choosing a target-language term that not only adequately renders the source language term, but also is the going term in the particular sub-language of that text. The high-level goal is to produce translations that read as fluently and as competently as text on the same topic written in the target language. The introduction argues for separating linguistic from world knowledge, claiming that linguistic knowledge alone can yield fullblown semantic modeling, at least within the somewhat limited domain of a sub-language. The author claims that semantic modeling is required for machine translation and sets his sub-language to be party political programs in German. This sub-language, he argues, is rich enough to be more than a toy domain but stylized enough to limit the size of the dictionary to be developed.","Chapter 2 details the importance of the co-text for disambiguation and the important role of coherence and cohesion in the reception of text, thought to be embodied in a thesaurus of synonyms. Chapter 3 then tears into the \"sentence-based\" approach of most traditional machine translation systems because it leads to a statistical determina-tion of the equivalence of isolated signs in two languages and cannot yield pragmatic equivalence. Chapter 4 introduces some of the technical contributions of the book. A dictionary of thesaural relations of 200 nouns is compiled for the selected \"corpus\" of party programs of 60,000 words. The stylistically pure corpus is intended to yield stylistically adequate thesaural relations, i.e., pragmatically equivalent translations. Disambigua-tion proceeds by weighting and counting co-occurrence of the noun with any of the synonyms, near synonyms, or significantly co-occurring adjectives of the analysis dictionary that occur within a window which varies from four words to seven sentences, depending on the phase of the attempted disambiguation process. Three phases with in-creasingly relaxed constraints on the matching procedure are possible; the process stops when disambiguation is achieved.","A separate transfer dictionary is described in Chapter 5, again of the form of thesaural relations paired with translation equivalents, now for the noun in question when occurring in the environment of one or more of the contextually relevant terms. These translation equivalents are found by poring over \"parallel texts,\" by which Laffiing means texts of the same sub-language and style that address similar points. Chapter 6 summarizes the effort as based on linguistic principles and points out several shortcomings, such as not testing the system on texts that were not part of the corpus from which the dictionaries were compiled, differences in performance when dealing with (wordy) party programs (good performance) and (concise) party manifestos (worse performance), and lack of any attempt to put together the proposed translation equivalents to actually produce a target-language text.","The book presents these ideas awkwardly hidden in a text that violates all the expectations I have for a computational linguistics volume. The algorithms and procedures are not declared explicitly; the data are not described in detail; no attempt at evaluation of the procedures or the resulting dictionaries is made; the discussion of the literature focuses on old work (Schank's original scripts are discussed at length) and tends to set up straw men for easy rebuttal. The tone is at times unnecessarily polarizing. But most aggravating is the style of presentation. The author does not state his points clearly and gives no data-supported arguments for and against his claims. Instead he selects disembodied quotes from a wide range of authors to stand in for what he wants to say. These quotes are frequently in German, sometimes in French, without any translation. The work of the quoted authors is not summarized and does not always lend credence to the point Laffiing has in mind. (Most amusing to me was the use of a quote by Pustejovsky to exemplify how \"R. Schank and others involved on the Yale Project argue that connectivity is only implicit in a text...\" [p. 48].)","The system is implemented on a PC in Basic, and much of the (little) technical discussion centers on working around these ar-677 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 4 tificial limitations. The presented dictionaries appear to have been compiled by hand from some corpus analysis (concordances are hinted at) and (arbitrarily?) refined until they perform the task of disambiguating occurrences in the corpus and suggesting the most suitable translation for that word (or phrase).","The 22-page bibliography (over 10% of the length of the book!) was out of date even at the date of publication (1991), the newest reference being from 1989. But with its focus on older and European publications, it does provide a complementary set of references that are often unavailable in North American libraries (and publications). The usefulness of this extensive bibliography is, however, lessened by the fact that the text cannot be trusted to serve as an annotation to it.","Overall, the book leaves the reader with the uneasy feeling of having missed out on a thorough introduction into interesting research and having been forced to read through a thesis.--Sabine Bergler, Concordia University Current Issues in Computational Linguistics: In Honour of Don Walker Antonio Zampolli, Nicoletta Calzolari, and Martha Palmer (editors) (Universit~ di Pisa; Istituto di Linguistica Computationale del CNR, Pisa; and the University of Pennsylvania) Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1994, and Pisa: Giardini editori e stampatori in Pisa (Linguistica Computazionale, volume IX-X), 1994, xxv + 594 pp, Hardbound, ISBN 0-7923-2997-X, $74.00; Paperbound, ISBN 0-7923-2998-8, $39.001 \"This collection of papers is dedicated to Don Walker, a kind, gentle soul, and a man of intelligence and vision whom we have been privileged to know and to work with.

This led to one of his most interdisciplinary roles, as a primary mover in the push to standardize the acquisition and tagging of electronic text, an endeavor that brought together people from fields as distinct as publishing, the humanities and computer science.
