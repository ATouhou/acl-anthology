{"sections":[{"title":"ACL DUES STATEMENT","paragraphs":["Note LATE PAYMENT FEE for Renewals after 15 March; Institutions Subscribe through MIT Press Membership in the Association for Computational Linguistics is for the calendar year;, it includes the ACL journal Computational Linguistics, reduced registration at most ACL-sponsored conferences, and discounts on ACL-sponsored publications. Institutional memberships were discontinued in 1988 when MIT Press began publishing the journal; instead, institutions should subscribe to the journal through MIT Press Journals, 55 Hayward Street, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; 617:253-2889. Back issues and proceedings are available only from the ACL Office, except that institutions should backorder journals from 1988 on through MIT Press. An order form is on the other side of this statement. The change in publishing required establishing a late payment for renewals made after 15 March, because of the extra mailing and handling costs. The late payment fee does not apply to new members. Dues and back order payments can be made in Europe and Japan as well as the U.S.; read the directions under the heading PAYMENT below carefully. Identify your institutional affiliation if it is not part of your address. Also please provide your telephone number and computer network address. FULL NAME ADDRESS INSTITUTION TELEPHONE COMPUTER NETWORK & ADDRESS Please correct any errors in the label provided. Provide prompt notification of address changes; copies returned because of bad addresses will not be remailed until a $3.00 postage and handling fee is remitted. MEMBERSHIP DUES FOR 1989: Dues for Personal Members are $25. Couples with the same mailing address may become Joint Members for $30; they will receive only one set of publications, but each will be eligible for all other member benefits.

Neural computation is a rapidly growing field that is attracting researchers in neuroscience, psychology, physics, mathematics, electrical engineering, computer science, and artificial intelligence. Researchers within these disciplines address, from special perspectives, the twin scientific and engineering challenges of understanding the brain and building computers. The journal serves to bring together work from various application areas, highlighting common problems and techniques in modeling the brain and in the design and construction of neurally-inspired information processing systems. By publishing timely short communications and research reviews, Neural Computation will allow researchers easy access to information on important advances and will provide a valuable overview of the broad range of work contributing to neural computation. The journal will not accept long research articles. The fields covered include neuroscience, computer science, artificial intelligence, mathematics, physics, psychology, linguistics, adaptive systems, vision, speech, robotics, optical computing, and VLSI. Neural Computation is published quarterly by The MIT Press.

P.R., Ann Arbor, Mi. 48106 Guidelines for Submissions","paragraphs":["Manuscripts submitted to Computational Linguistics should be typed on letter-size paper (8.5 by ll inches, or A4), double-spaced throughout, including footnotes and references. The paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must be submitted in English. Submissions may be made in any of the following categories: PAPER: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in computational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The length of a paper depends on its content, but we suggest that manuscripts be limited to forty double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of twelve journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed, being read by at least two members of the editorial board and usually by an additional expert in the particular subject area.","The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the author certifies the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publication to another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Editor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the case of a \"work for hire\", by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978 U.S. Copyright law. TECHNICAL CORRESPONDENCE: This category includes short articles reporting preliminary results of some project in progress, or the results of other studies of interest to the readership. Technical correspondences should not generally exceed eight double-spaced pages. Each technical correspondence is reviewed by at least two members of the editorial board before acceptance. LETTERS TO THE EDITOR: This includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these contributions for inclusion. Five copies of papers, technical correspondences, and letters should be sent to the Editor: James F. Allen, CL Editor Department of Computer Science The University of Rochester Rochester, NY 14627, USA ARPANET:acl@cs.rochester.edu Anyone interested in reviewing a book, or in suggesting a book for review, should contact the Book Review Editor; publishers may also submit copies of books for review directly to the Book Review Editor: Graeme Hirst, CL Book Review Editor Department of Computer Science University of Toronto Toronto, CANADA M5S lA4 CSNET:gh@ai.toronto.edu The Finite String Editor should receive (a) copies of technical reports and reprints of papers published elsewhere - or at least citation information and abstracts of such items and of books and monographs; (b) summaries of research in progress - of particular interest would be perspectives on the activities at a particular institution; (c) announcements of meetings of potential interest to the membership; and (d) personal notes (e.g., honors, moving, changes in status).
