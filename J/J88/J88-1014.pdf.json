{"sections":[{"title":"ACL 1988 DUES STATEMENT AND MEMBERSHIP APPLICATION","paragraphs":["Institutions Now Order Journals from MIT Press; New LATE PAYMENT FEE for Late Renewals Membership in the Association for Computational Linguistics is for the calendar year; it includes the ACL journal Computational Linguistics, reduced registration at most ACL-sponsored conferences, and discounts on ACL-sponsored publications. Beginning in 1988, MIT Press will publish the journal. This change will not affect personal and student memberships, which will continue to be handled by the ACL; however, institutions now must subscribe to the 1988 journal from MIT Press Journals, 55 Hayward Street, Cambridge, MA 02142-1399, USA; (617) 253-2889. Back issues through 1987 and proceedings will continue to be available only from ACL. An order form is on the other side of this statement. The change in publishing makes it necessary to introduce a late payment fee for renewal payments made after 30 April, because of the extra mailing costs. Dues and back order payments can be made in Europe and Japan as well as the U.S.; read the directions under the heading PAYMENT below carefully. Identify your institutional affiliation if it is not part of your address. Also please provide your computer network address. FULL NAME ADDRESS INSTITUTION COMPUTER NET ADDRESS Please correct any errors in the label provided. Provide prompt notification of address changes; copies returned because of bad addresses will not be remailed until a $3.00 handling fee is remitted. MEMBERSHIP DUES FOR 1988: Dues for Personal Members are $25.00. Couples with the same mailing address may become Joint Members for $30.00; they will receive only one set of publications, but each will be eligible for all other member benefits.

The paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must be submitted in English. Submissions may be made in any of the following categories: PAPER: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in computational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The length of a paper depends on its content, but we suggest that manuscripts be limited to forty doule-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of twelve journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed, being read by at least two members of the editorial board and usually by an additional expert in the particular subject area.","The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the author certifies the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publication to another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Editor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the case of a \"work for hire\", by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978 U.S. Copyright law. TECHNICAL CORRESPONDENCE: This category includes short articles reporting preliminary results of some project in progress, or the results of other studies of interest to the readership. Technical correspondences should not generally exceed eight double-spaced pages. Each technical correspondence is reviewed by at least two members of the editorial board before acceptance. LETTERS TO THE EDITOR: This includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these contributions for inclusion. Five copies of papers, technical correspondences, and letters should be sent to the Editor: James F. Allen, CL Editor Department of Computer Science The University of Rochester Rochester, NY 14627 arpanet: ACL@ROCHESTER.ARPA Anyone interested in reviewing a book, or in suggesting a book for review, should contact the Book Review Editor; publishers may also submit copies of books for review directly to the Book Review Editor: Graeme Hirst, CL Book Review Editor Department of Computer Science University of Toronto Toronto, CANADA M5S IA4 arpanet: GH@TORONTO.CSNET The Finite String Editor should receive (a) copies of technical reports and reprints of papers published elsewhere - or at least citation information and abstracts of such items and of books and monographs; (b) summaries of research in progress - of particular interest would be perspectives on the activities at a particular institution; (c) announcements of meetings of potential interest to the membership; and (d) personal notes (e.g., honors, moving, changes in status).
