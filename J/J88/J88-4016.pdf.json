{"sections":[{"title":"Announcement and Call for Papers NEURAL COMPUTATION First Issue: Spring 1989 Editor-in-Chief Terrence Sejnowsk| The Salk Institute and The University of California at San Diego Neural Computation will provide a unique interdisciplinary forum for the dissemination of important research results and for reviews of research areas in neural computation. Neural computation is a rapidly growing field that is attracting researchers in neuroscience, psychology, physics, mathematics, electrical engineering, computer science, and artificial intelligence. Researchers within these disciplines address, from special perspectives, the twin scientific and engineering challenges of understanding the brain and building computers. The journal serves to bring together work from various application areas, highlighting common problems and techniques in modeling the brain and in the design and construction of neurally-insplred information processing systems. By publishing timely short communications and research reviews, Neural Computation will allow researchers easy access to information on important advances and will provide a valuable overview of the broad range of work contributing to neural computation. The journal will not accept long research articles. The fields covered include neuroscience, computer science, artificial intelligence, mathematics, physics, psychology, linguistics, adaptive systems, vision, speech, robotics, optical computing, and VLSI. Neural Computation is published quarterly by The MIT Press.

The paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must be submitted in English. Submissions may be made in any of the following categories: PAPER: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in computational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The length of a paper depends on its content, but we suggest that manuscripts be limited to forty double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of twelve journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed, being read by at least two members of the editorial board and usually by an additional expert in the particular subject area.","The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the author certifies the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publication to another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Editor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the case of a \"work for hire\", by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978 U.S. Copyright law. TECHNICAL CORRESPONDENCE: This category includes short articles reporting preliminary results of some project in progress, or the results of other studies of interest to the readership. Technical correspondences should not generally exceed eight double-spaced pages. Each technical correspondence is reviewed by at least two members of the editorial board before acceptance. LETTERS TO THE EDITOR: This includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these contributions for inclusion. Five copies of papers, technical correspondences, and letters should be sent to the Editor: James F. Allen, CL Editor Department of Computer Science The University of Rochester Rochester, NY 14627, USA ARPANET:acl@cs.rochester.edu Anyone interested in reviewing a book, or in suggesting a book for review, should contact the Book Review Editor; publishers may also submit copies of books for review directly to the Book Review Editor: Graeme Hirst, CL Book Review Editor Department of Computer Science University of Toronto Toronto, CANADA M5S IA4 CSNET:gh@ai.toronto.edu The Finite String Editor should receive (a) copies of technical reports and reprints of papers published elsewhere - or at least citation information and abstracts of such items and of books and monographs; (b) summaries of research in progress - of particular interest would be perspectives on the activities at a particular institution; (c) announcements of meetings of potential interest to the membership; and (d) personal notes (e.g., honors, moving, changes in status).
