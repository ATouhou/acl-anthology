The crucial point about this statement is, obviously, the notion of \"practical natural language grammars\". As mentioned before, Tomita's algorithm is intended for a subset of context-free grammars. In particular, it is not able to handle cyclic grammars, e.g.: S ---> S S ---> x and turns out to be less efficient than Earley's algorithm with \"densely\" ambiguous grammars, such as: S ---> SSSS S ---> SSS S---> SS S ----> x Although it seems unlikely that any natural-language grammar contains cyclic rules or dense ambiguities, the limitations of Tomita's algorithm with regard to natural-language grammars remain somewhat unclear.","The major arguments for the usefulness of the algorithm are, therefore, empirical. Both Tomita's and Earley's algorithms have been implemented and tested against various grammars and sentences. The grammar of English most used in the experiment has about 220 rules, and the set of test sentences is made up of both actual and invented examples, more than 50 in number. The results of the experiment show that Tomita's algorithm is significantly faster than Earley's algorithm in practical applications. Moreover, its parsing time and space remain tractable when the length of an input sentence, the number of parses, or the size of a grammar increases.","The book is composed of 10 chapters and several appendices. Chapters 1 through 6, apart from some introductory remarks, provide an informal description of the algorithm, illustrated with plenty of clear examples; a formal specification (which is not necessary, however, to understand how the algorithm works); a comparison of Tomita's algorithm with other context-free parsing algorithms; and finally a description of the experiment mentioned above. The appendices give, among other things, the correctness proof of the algorithm, as well as programs, grammars, and test sentences used in the experiment.","Chapters 7, 8, and 9 constitute a relatively independent part of the book. They suggest some practical applications of Tomita's algorithm, such as left-to-right on-line parsing, interactive sentence disambiguation by asking the user for the preferred interpretation of the sentence in question, and interactive machine translation of small documents, letters, etc. To a wide circle of readers involved in computational linguistics, this part of the book may be even more interesting than the others. The core of the book, on the contrary, seems to be of great importance for those who deal in practice with natural-language parsing rather than those who observe the advances in this field from the outside.

BRIEFLY NOTED Editor's note: Frequently, the need has been felt for a longer treatment of books that on the one hand do not warrant a full review, but on the other hand merit more than a bare appearance in the list of books received. Often, such books are those that are important in related fields such as theoretical linguistics and will be reviewed in the appropriate journals, but which may have relevance to computational linguistics as well. Sometimes, it is simply the case that a mere listing by title and author does not convey enough information to let the reader know whether the book may be in their area of interest. In addition, popular works or books of oblique interest to the field may merit a brief notice.","This new section will answer this need by giving brief notices of books. Most often, books appearing in this section will not have a review per se; rather, just a summary of the book will usually be given--based on that of the author or publisher, in the case of monographs, or through the table of contents in the case of collections. Such a treatment reflects the book review editor's judgment that the book is worthy of attention, but is not necessarily an endorsement of the content. Short opinions may also be given in some cases, where the nature of the book calls for an evaluation but not a full review.

A theory of morphological objects is developed in Chapter 2. Chapter 3 defends the claim that morphological objects are a proper subset of the syntactic atoms, presenting the authors' reconstruction of the important and much-debated Lexical Integrity Hypothesis. A final chapter shows that there are syntactic atoms that are not morphological objects.","--From the publisher's announcement NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING IN THE 1980s: A BIBLIOGRAPHY (CSLI LECTURE NOTES 12) Gerald Gazdar; Alex Franz; Karen Osborne; and Roger Evans (University of Sussex, Sussex, England) Center for the Study of Language and Information, Stanford","University, Stanford, CA 1987, vii + 236 pp. Distributed by the University of Chicago Press ISBN 0-937073-26-1, $29.95 (hb); ISBN 0-937073-28-8,","$11.95 (sb) The aim of this book is to make available, in a readily accessible form, bibliographic information about the vast majority of 1980s publications in the field of natural-language processing (NLP) and computational linguistics.

The purpose of this book is to bring the reader to a point from which he or she may easily read and evaluate ordinary research in formal semantics.

Although it is an introduction to natural-language processing, it is not a textbook. Rather, it is addressed to readers in neiglhboring disciplines, and, indeed, intelligent lay readers, who want to know more about the field, its successes, its issues, and its problems, without the technical density or pedagogical style of a textbook. That is not to say that McTear shies away from technical detail; on the contrary, the book contains plenty of it, and goes quite deeply into many issues. But it is detail to produce thorough understanding, not to teach the reader to write their own programs. Only a minimal knowledge of linguistics and computing is assumed.","McTear's presentation is comprehensive; he covers the early history of the field, syntax, semantics, issues in knowledge representation, and problems in extended discourse-- McTear's own area of research.

In clear and stimulating analyses Mel'~uk promotes syntactic description in terms of dependency rather than in terms of more familiar phrase-structure. The notions of dependency relations and dependency structure are introduced and substantiated, and the advantages of dependency representation are demonstrated by applying it to a number of popular linguistic problems, e.g., grammatical subject and ergative construction. A wide array of linguistic data is used--the well-known (Dyirbal), the less known (Lezgian), and the more recent (Alutor). Several \"exotic\" cases of Russian are discussed to show how dependency can be used to solve difficult technical problems.","The book is not only formal and rigorous, but also strongly theory-oriented and data-based. Special attention is paid to linguistic terminology, specifically to its logical consistency. The dependency formalism is presented within the framework of a new semantics-oriented general linguistic theory, Meaning-Text theory.","--From the publisher's announcement GRAMMAR IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF TEXTS (OPEN LINGUISTICS SERIES) James Monaghan (ed.)
