A Note from the Editor It is a great pleasure for me to see the journal now being published by the MIT Press. We have managed to do this without having to change the way the journal relates to the ACL. The journal remains a membership benefit of the ACL and all renewals, address changes and other correspondence for individual memberships will be with the ACL offices as before. Institutional members, however, will now be dealing directly with the MIT Press. Submissions to the journal should continue to be made to the appropriate editor as indicated on the inside back cover.","This first issue of Volume 14 is late due to the complexities involved in changing our production procedure. We are already in production on the next issue, however, and expect to be caught up by the end of the year. The journal will then appear on its regular quarterly schedule with Volume 15. The irregularity of publication this year should be a minor inconvenience compared to the longterm benefits of these changes.","Because of the excellent growth of the journal in the last two years, we have now made the finite string into a separate publication in order to allow more space for technical papers. In general, there will be the equivalent of four full technical papers in each issue, an expanded book review section, plus the occasional technical correspondences and letters to the editor. In addition, abstracts of current literature will continue to be included in the journal, while site reports, announcements, and the calendar of upcoming events will be in the new Finite String newsletter.","There are two exciting special issues to appear in this year's volume. Issue 14-2 is a special issue consisting of five papers on tense and aspect edited by Bonnie Lynn Webber. Issue 14-3 will be another special issue consisting of five papers on user modelling edited by Alfred Kobsa and Wolfgang Wahlster. It also contains an extended discussion section on the relationship between user models and discourse models. I personally find special issues particularly valuable and actively encourage anyone who has a suggestion for a topic, or who would be interested in editing such an issue, to please contact me.","It is a time of great transition for the ACL. Our membership continues to grow and the amount of activity in the field, as measured by the number of quality submissions to the journal and the ACL conferences, is increasing dramatically. The reorganization of the journal is an attempt to respond to the new needs of the society. If you have any suggestions for new features you would like to see in the journal or Finite String, or have comments or criticisms of our current format, please let us know. James Allen, Editor"]}]}
