(University of York, Yorkshire, England) London, England: Academic Press, 1984, xvii + 293 pp. ISBN 0-12-504580-8, $32.00 (hb) The aim of this book is to share some of the knowledge acquired from research into human-computer interaction with those at the sharp end of the design process, principally the systems engineers and programmers. If effective interactive products are to be built and sold, all personnel involved in the design process must be aware of the basic principles involved: it is not enough to simply consult a specialist when problems arise.","--From the publisher's announcement","The papers in this volume are the following:","Part 1: The User as a Processor of Information Visual Perception: An Intelligent System with Limited Band-","width by Peter Thompson Reading: Extracting Information from Printed and Electron-","ically Presented Text by Charles Hulme Human Memory: Different Stores with Different Character-","istics by Neil Thomson Thinking and Reasoning: Why is Logic So Difficult? by Neil","Thomson","Part 2: The Use of Behavioural Data How and When to Collect Behavioural Data by Andrew","Monk Statistical evaluation of behavioural data by Andrew Monk Example of an Experiment: Evaluating Some Speech Syn-","thesisers for Public Announcements by John Waterworth","and Antony Lo","Part 3: The User Interface Work Station Design, Activities, and Display Techniques by","Peter Reid Dialogue Design: Characteristics of User Knowledge by Nick","Hammond and Philip Barnard User Interface Design: Generative User Engineering Princi-","ples by Harold Thimbleby Future Uses of Future Offices by G.

The text is reproduced from copy run off","on a daisy-wheel printer. Although the print quality is good,","the text is right-justified without hyphenated word breaks.","This results in large spaces between words, making the text","difficult to follow with the eye, especially as the lines are","unleaded. Thus the book violates the most basic rules of text","design (e.g., Chicago 1982: 567-569; Craig 1980: 127-131).","This is rather surprising in a book concerned with human","factors, especially as one of the chapters (Hulme's) is largely","concerned with factors in the legibility of printed text.","--G.H.
