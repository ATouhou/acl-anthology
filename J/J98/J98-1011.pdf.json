We thereforewelcome submissions to the journal on THEORETICAL, DESCRIPTIVE OR COMPUTATIONAL ASPECTS of any of the following topics: - machine translation and machine-aided translation - human translation theory and practise multilingual text composition and generation - multilingual information retrieval - multilingual natural language interfaces - multilingual dialogue systems - multilingual message understanding systems - corpus-based and statistical language modelling - connectionist approaches to translation compilation and use of bi- and multilingual corpora - discourse phenomena and their treatment in (human or machine) translation - knowledge engineering - contrastive linguistics - morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics - computer-aided language instruction and learning - software localization and internationalization - speech processing, especially for speech translation - phonetics, phonology - computational implications of non-Roman character sets - multilingual word-processing - the multilingual information society (sociological and legal as well as linguistic aspects) - minority languages - history of machine translation. We would also welcome your suggestions about other features you would like to see in this journal, for example, special issues, squibs, topical comment.

The scope of the journal is the logical and computational foundations of natural, formal, and programming languages, as well as the different forms of human and mechanized inference. It covers the logical, linguistic, and information-theoretic parts of the cognitive sciences. Examples of main subareas are Intensional Logics including Dynamic Logic; Nonmonotonic Logic and Belief Revision; Constructive Logics; Complexity Issues in Logic and Linguistics; Theoretical Problems of Logic Programming and Resolution; Categorial Grammar and Type Theory; Generalized Quantification; Information-Oriented Theories of Semantic Structure like Situation Semantics, Discourse Representation Theory, and Dynamic Semantics; Connectionist Models of Logical and Linguistic Structures. The emphasis is on the theoretical aspects of these areas. The purpose of the journal is to act as a forum for researchers interested in the theoretical foundations of the above subjects and their interdisciplinary connections, with an emphasis on general ideas increasing coherence.

Besides publishing Computational Linguistics, the ACL holds international meetings (annually in North America, biennially in Europe) where the state-of-the-art in natural language processing research and development is presented. Recently, special interest groups on the Mathematics of Language, the Lexicon, Parsing, Generation, Computational Phonology, Multimedia Language Processing, and Very Large Corpora have been formed: others are likely to be added.
