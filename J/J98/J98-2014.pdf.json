{"sections":[{"title":"Briefly Noted Referential Communication Tasks George Yule","paragraphs":["Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates (Series on Second Language Research: Theoretical and Methodological Issues, edited-by Susan Gass and Jacquelyn Schacter), 1997, ix+125 pp; hardbound, ISBN 0-8058-2003-5, $36.00; paperbound, ISBN 0-8058-2004-3, $17.50 Referential Communication Tasks offers, in a small format (125 pages), a general survey of experimental settings and scientific background on communication studies centered on specific activities in which the speakers are observed for their ability to achieve tasks rather than solely for their linguistic productions. It thus offers a basic and introductory insight to research and experiments that put the notion of reference at the core of their interest. Here the focus is generally on experiments in the broad field of L2 studies. Though the author does not really insist on the theoretical backgrounds of the different studies being presented, it is made very clear that the language that is being described is that spoken spontaneously in situations (especially in L2 contexts) in which speakers might not even be able to correctly designate the objects they want to refer to and therefore need to develop linguistic and other communicative strategies to circumvent their difficulties. It is thus important to remember that reference is not simply \"some kind of connec-tion between words and things\" but rather, as stated in the first chapter of the book (\"Overview\"), \"an action through which a speaker (or writer) uses linguistic forms to enable a listener (or reader) to identify some-thing.\"","Apart from the second chapter (\"The development of (L1) referential communication\"), which is too short to be really informative, the book is centered on three main sections, dedicated respectively to the main trends, the experimental settings, and the study viewpoints associated with referential communication tasks. First, Chapter 3 (\"Principles and distinctions\") lists the main parameters--from the point of view of what is to be elicited as well as the task format-- that are to lead an experimenter towards the design of a specific experimental setting adapted to his research interest. The author then presents (Chapter 4, \"Materials and procedures\") in a rather exhaustive way the different kinds of situations that have been used in the literature to conduct referential task studies, ranging from object identifica-tion to instructional map tasks (which are well known in the computational linguistics community). Finally, Chapter 5 (\"Analytic frameworks\") quickly surveys the possible viewpoints that the researcher may take to consider the linguistic productions resulting from the different experimental frameworks presented in the book, insisting on communication strategies, interactive repair mechanisms, and communicative outcomes.","Even though the book is far from presenting a theoretical insight into the field, as a whole it provides a wide and extensive overview of experimental materials and principles that, considered from the point of view of computational linguistics, would be of in-terest to anyone interested in dialogue studies in which reference plays a central role. Since the book seems to be intended to provide the basics of some research methodology, one may regret that the literature that is mentioned contains so few associated basic readings, which could have been most valuable for young researchers starting in the field of communication research. Still, its small format makes it worth reading and even to have within reach for those of us who at some point or another have to deal with, or even produce, experimental data. --Laurent Romary, Loria-CNRS Vagueness: A Reader Rosanna Keefe and Peter Smith (editors) (University of Cambridge and the University of Sheffield) Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 1996, vii+352 pp; hardbound, ISBN 0-262-11225-6, $35.00 We use vague language without difficulty. Yet, if asked whether a vague word applies to a particular object, we might be at a loss. Is that man tall? If he is 195 cm, clearly yes. If he is 165 cm, clearly no. But in many intermediate cases, we simply can-not say. Vagueness also presents theoretical problems, among them the so-called sorites paradoxes. It would appear that a man who is a fraction of a millimeter shorter than a 339 Computational Linguistics Volume 24, Number 2 tall man is tall. But then, with repeated application of this principle, it seems to follow, paradoxically, that since a 195 cm man is tall, so is a 165 cm man.","The difficulties surrounding vagueness have ramifications within artificial intelligence. We might wish to include vague representations in knowledge bases, and in computational linguistics we will certainly have to come to terms with vagueness. Questions immediately arise about how to represent vague sentences and what to infer from them. To answer these questions, an account of the meanings of vague sentences is needed.","Rosanna Keefe and Peter Smith have compiled a collection of classic papers on vagueness. Three ancient writings provide historical perspective; fourteen others chart the development of the contemporary discussion of vagueness throughout this century. Contributions that might be of special in-terest to researchers in artificial intelligence include Kit Fine's \"Vagueness, truth and logic,\" which sets out the supervaluational approach to vagueness. This approach is supposed to account for vagueness while preserving classical logic. Kenton Machina defends the approach to vagueness through fuzzy logic that was pioneered by Zadeh and Goguen. Dorothy Edgington criticizes this approach and suggests an alternative many-valued treatment. Max Black explores the idea that the applicability of a predicate to an object is a matter of degree, determined by the applicability judgments of the language community at large. Carl Hempel provides a pointed criticism of his proposal. Other selections are philosophically rich but might only indirectly address the concerns of the artificial intelligence community.","Keefe and Smith contribute a substantial introductory chapter that expounds and evaluates these and other approaches. They discuss the sorites paradox and its significance for logical accounts of vagueness; they describe the epistemic view, according to which vague predicates are sharply defined but speakers are necessarily uninformed about their boundaries; they evaluate the various alternatives to this view, including supervaluational accounts, three-valued accounts, and multivalued accounts; and they outline the recent debate over the existence of vague objects. The chapter extensively refers to relevant material that does not appear in the anthology.","This balanced and comprehensive collection will be a standard reference for many years to come.--Alice Kyburg, University of Wisconsin, Oshkosh Natural Language Processing with ThoughtTreasure Erik Thomas Mueller (Signiform) New York: Signiform (www.signiform.com), 1997, x+343 pp; spiralbound, ISBN 0-9660746-0-2, $50.00 \"The ThoughtTreasure platform was created with the long-term goal of human-level comprehension in mind.

A central theme of this collection is that the philosophy of language, or at least a core portion of it, has matured to the point where it is now being spun off into linguistic theory. Each section of the book contains historical (twentieth-century) readings and, where available, recent attempts to apply the resources of contemporary linguistic theory to the problems under discussion. This approach helps to root the naturalization project in the leading questions of analytic philosophy. Although the older readings predate the current naturalization project, they help to lay its conceptual foundations. The main sections of the book, each of which is preceded by an introduction, are 'Language and Meaning,' 'Logical Form and Grammatical Form,' 'Definite and Indefinite Descriptions,' 'Names,' 'Demonstratives,' and 'Attitude Reports'.\"--Froin thepublisher 's announcement"]},{"title":"Ways of Scope Taking Anna Szabolcsi (editor)","paragraphs":["(University of California, Los Angeles) Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers (Studies in Linguistics and Philosophy, edited by Gennaro Chierchia, Pauline Jacobson, and Francis J.
