Although the field thus described is so extensive that a complete listing of relevant topics is precluded, at least the following specifically fall within it: - traditional areas in the philosophy of language such as meaning, truth, reference, description, entailment, speech acts - traditional areas of linguistics such as syntax, semantics and pragmatics (when the studies are of sufficient explicitness and generality to be also of philosophical interest) - aspects of artificial intelligence concerned with language such as computational linguistics and natural language processing - systems of logic with strong connections to natural language: modal logic, tense logic, epistemic logic, intensional logic - philosophical questions raised by linguistics as a science: linguistics methodology, the status of linguistics theories, the nature of linguistic universals - philosophically interesting problems at the intersection of linguistics and other disciplines: language acquisition, language and perception, language as a social convention.
