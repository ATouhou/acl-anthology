First, the authors argue why machine translation is so difficult.

Then, they review current technologies, historical perspectives, and theoretical issues such as syntax and grammar formalism. The most interesting and important discussion in this chapter is the section \"Translation Strategy.\" First, the authors refer to the controversial argument concerning the comparison between the transfer approach and the interlingual approach, but they claim that \"the issue of interest is not whether to pursue a transfer or an interlingual approach; the issue is which levels of analysis are necessary, and how to arrive at a representation suitable for generation of a target text\" (p. 82).","From this point, and by considering many examples of translation mismatch that imply the impossibility of"]},{"title":"a naive interlingual scheme,","paragraphs":["the authors propose a new architecture called \"translation by negotiation.\" In this architecture, some interlingual representation is still supposed, but it does not require that an in-variant representation that will be the same for the translation of a source sentence, or text, into any other language can be found at any time. There are three components: an an-alyzer, a generator, and a negotiator. The an-alyzer delivers to the negotiator an interlingual representation. The negotiator hands the interlingual representation to the generator. In some (or rare) cases, the generator can find the phrase in the target language that has exactly the same interlingual representation. In other cases, the generator reports to the negotiator error information such as the overspecification or underspecification of the in-put interlingual representation. Now, it is up to the negotiator to decide whether the error is fatal or not. When it is not so serious, the translation is accepted, but when it is serious, the negotiator has to solve it by some other means, such as referring to the context. In Chapter 2, the authors also discuss other topics: an overview of nonlinguistic translation approaches such as the stochastic approach and the example-based approach, and a comprehensive survey of current machine translation systems. These would also be quite informative to a reader.","Chapter 3 is devoted to introducing speech-recognition technology and speech-synthesis technology, and Chapter 4 contains recommendations for the Verbmobil project.

These descriptions would be a good introduction for a reader who wants to see a general overview of speech-recognition technologies. As for speech synthesis, most pages are given 272 Briefly Noted to prosody processing and voice conversion.","Most of Chapter 4 consists of technical and planning recommendations for the project. However, the discussion of target domains would be informative to those researchers who are interested in the corpus-based approach.","As the authors pointed out, this book is not a feasibility study, and unfortunately, there is only a little description of those technologies, such as contextual processing or integration of speech and language processing, that are some of the key technologies for speech translation.
