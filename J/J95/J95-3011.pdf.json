Increasingly, its crucial relevance is recognized in all areas of natural language research. High formal standards have been set as it has striven to meet the growing need for computational and empirical adequacy. This process has been aided by the intense interdisciplinary exchange and cooperation that has simultaneously occurred, setting new standards for the field as a whole and working towards a true integration. The editors and advisory board of the Journal of Semantics are composed of internationally established specialists, and the journal is firmly rooted in the interdisciplinary study of natural language semantics, with linguistics, psychology, philosophy, and artificial intelligence as the major contributing disciplines.

The paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must be written in English. Contact the editor regarding the possibility of electronic submission. Submissions may be made in any of the following categories: Papers: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in computational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The length of a paper depends on its content, but it is suggested that manuscripts be limited to forty double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of thirty journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed, being read by at least two members of the editorial board and usually by an additional expert in the particular subject area. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the author certifies the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publication to another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Editor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the case of a \"work for hire,\" by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978 U.S. Copyright law. Letters to the Editor: This category includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the readership.
