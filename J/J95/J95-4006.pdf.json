It is designed to give an overview of the state of the art of MT, to discuss some key issues of this technology, and to provide us with an outlook into the future.","In my opinion, this aim has been fully achieved by the authors. As a teacher of MT in a university degree course for technical translators, I find the book highly advisable as a broad overview and first introduction for students. Apart from a few small flaws, it is one of the most enlightening MT books for this readership in the past few years.","Its most prominent characteristic is that it adopts the viewpoint of MT users-- translators and end users who wish to 'lift the lid' on what happens inside an MT engine, and prospective buyers who want to distinguish between what can reasonably be expected from this technology and the sometimes exaggerated claims of researchers or vendors. Existing prejudices and misinformation are done away with. This is why the book should, in my opinion, be required reading for students of translation and, especially, students of computational linguistics who want to develop machine translation systems.","An overview is given from all the fields of knowledge and research that are necessary for the description of MT problems. Topics include MT history, integration of MT engines into the translation workflow, MT architectures, knowledge representation (on all relevant levels of knowledge), MT dictionaries, translation problems, input standardization, MT evaluation, and possible future developments. Approaches from artificial intelligence, however, such as that of 'scripts and frames' for example, should, in proportion to their relevance in modern MT research, have been given somewhat broader room not only in the last chapter on 'future developments,' but in the chapter that deals with knowledge representation problems of the present.","The book's plain language and logical construction also make it easy to grasp for non-native speakers of English. A summary at the end of each chapter facilitates keeping the thread during continuous reading, while also enabling selective (re-)reading. The annotated bibliographies in each chapter are a most useful aid to those who are interested in finding more detailed publications for special fields of knowledge."]}]}
