Paperbound, ISBN 0-8058-1526-0, $36.00 A notorious problem with computational linguistics is that there is no path into it. The usual CL course presumes a strong background in both linguistics and computer programming--an unlikely combination, especially for students who came to linguistics from the study of languages and literature.","This textbook presupposes no background in either subject. It can be used to give a taste of Prolog programming and natural language parsing to students with no computer experience. Prolog is introduced through simple logic puzzles, and then applied to bibliographic databases, morphological paradigms, and simple parsers. The author takes care to warn students about typ-ing errors, endless loops, and other computer pitfalls that they might not be primed to recognize. An accompanying diskette includes a freeware Prolog interpreter for the IBM PC, together with program source code usable in any Prolog implementation.","The disadvantage of this slow, gentle approach is that even by the end of the book, neither Prolog nor parsing has been covered in depth. Despite the book's title, only a few grammar rules are presented. Basic parsing techniques such as DCGs and difference lists are not introduced; instead, a typical grammar rule is: vp(X) :- append(A,B,X), v(A), np(B). Feature structures or their equivalent are not used, nor is any mechanism for semantic in-terpretation indicated.

One might call this the 'semantic form' of expressions (p. xi, italics in the original). The book begins with \"three chapters in which I survey the contributions made by linguistics, logic and computer science respectively to the representation of meaning\" (p. xii). These three chapters are not easy to understand, principally because of Potts's obtuse style, an example of which is that in-stead of saying \"'either P or Q' is false if 'P' and 'Q' are both false; otherwise, it is true,\" he says, \"we lay down that a proposition having the structure represented by 'either P or Q' is to be accounted false if a false proposition is substituted for 'P' and a false proposition for 'Q', but is otherwise to be accounted true\" (p. 53). These chapters are also outdated. In particular, the chapter on computer science, discussing the work of researchers whose goals are the closest to Potts's own stated goals, is mainly a review of work as of the seventies. There are citations to several of the papers in Findler (1979), but only three to more recent research publications: Hayes (1980), Sowa (1984), and Hobbs and Shieber (1987). Perhaps the most valuable aspect of these three chapters is Potts's criticisms of some of the work he surveys. Of course, some of the problems noted have been corrected in literature that Potts hasn't yet got around to reading.","By the end of the three survey chapters, Potts has introduced two techniques that he 427 Computational Linguistics Volume 21, Number 3 then develops into his own representation-- categorial grammars and graphs as representation formalisms. He takes the categorial analysis to be the prior of the two, with his graphs, which he calls categorialgraphs, being the clearer representation of sentence mean-ing. Unfortunately, \"formalism\" and \"clearer\" must be taken with a grain of salt. Potts never formally defines his categorial graphs, let alone gives a formal semantics for them. Although I have had extensive experience read-ing, interpreting, and devising graphical representations of meaning, I could not understand the details of Potts's graphs. But then, neither, apparently, can he: \"The relationship between semantic and syntactic structures has not been spelled out, so that it is not fully determinate what our semantic representations represent at the syntactic level\" (p. 168).","The four substantive chapters are useful for the linguistic issues that they address, even if they are not useful for the representation scheme that they develop. These issues, which must eventually be faced by all knowledge representation formalisms that aspire to complete coverage of natural language in-clude: quantifier scope; pronouns; relative clauses; count nouns, substance nouns, and proper names; generic propositions; deictic terms; plurals; identity; and adverbs.","Appropriately, the book does not end on a note of claimed accomplishment, but on a note of work yet to do: \"The purpose of a philosophical book is to stimulate thought, not to put it to rest with solutions to every problem ... It is still premature to formulate a graph grammar for semantic representation of everyday language... The representation problem is commonly not accorded the respect which it deserves\" (p. 288). Many people agree, and have, accordingly, produced a vast literature that Potts is apparently not familiar with. (Some relevant collections are Cercone and McCalla 1987, Sowa 1991, and Lehmann 1992.) Nevertheless, Potts is still correct when he suggests that there is much work left to do.--Stuart C.

It is organized thematically, with a good index and a glossary of some 80 items. There are many discussions of domain definition; in particular, it is steadfastly argued that pragmatics and linguistics do not overlap (de-spite a nice slip in presupposition in a head-ing on page 500 referring to \"Pragmatics and the rest of linguistics\" [\"La pragmatique et le reste de la linguistique\"]). I regretted the almost complete absence of references or discussion on semantics (except for Fauconnier), semiotics, social psychology and cognitive psychology (except for the classical ground-ing in sociolinguistics), literary studies, and recent cultural critical theories. Likewise, power, gender, and cross-cultural differences 428 Briefly Noted (Wierzbicka 1991) are not mentioned. If the view of pragmatics is to exclude the study of language-in-use from the reach of linguistics, then these companion areas should be at least considered in a book of this sort. The eighteen chapters cover a variety of topics: truth-conditionality, context and reference, mental spaces, logical and nonlogical connectors, discourse laws and conversational postulates, presupposition, implicature, argumentation, Ducrot's theory of enunciation, deixis, vague concepts, metaphor, narration, coherence, and discourse analysis and conversation analysis (Moeschler's favorite topic: 1985, 1989). The work mentions many European authors, while strangely apologiz-ing for mentioning many Americans. Some references to the latter deserve updating (e.g., Putnam has changed, and Fodor has explored new directions). Moeschler and Reboul are close to Ducrot on enunciation, and especially to Sperber and Wilson for their theory of relevance (1986), an approach on which they have just published a book (Moeschler, Reboul, Luscher, and Jayez 1994). Grice, Fodor, and Searle are extensively discussed.","I resented the absence of 'computational pragmatics'--if it can be called that--as in human-machine communication. One would have expected a discussion of the contributions of, say, Bunt (e.g., 1994), Cohen (e.g., Cohen, Morgan, and Pollack 1990), Hovy (e.g., 1993), McKeown (e.g., 1985), Wilks and Ballim (1991), and many others. Instead the book argues that \"technicians of informatics have been designing their own linguistics, which amounts to a technique applied to language rather than a science of language\" [\"les techniciens de l'informatique [ont 6labor6] leur propre linguistique, qui se r6sume a une technique appliqu6e au langage plus qu'a une science du langage\" (p. 497)]. The fact that models, when original, are implemented, certainly does not detract from their quality; quite the contrary.","In sum, the book has to be acknowledged as a comprehensive one on \"core\" pragmatics, and a well-written and well-argued initiator, navigator, and reference work. It compares favorably with Levinson's (1983) textbook.--Jean-Fran~ois Delannoy, University of Ottawa"]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Bunt, Harry (1994). \"Context and dialogue control.\" Think, May 1994, 19-31.","Cohen, Philip R.; Morgan, Jerry; and Pollack, Martha (editors) (1990).

She considers not only the coherence of the wordstream of a text but also the effects that layout and document design have on the perception of textual coherence. Her basic point is that sensing textual coherence is a matter of gestalt perception, much the same as our perception of unity and structure in visual and auditory stimuli. For example, the perception of relevance, with bridging inferences where necessary, is like gestalt vision, where we fill in the missing pieces. In the case of coherence, the knowledge that is used includes linguistic, pragmatic, social, and idiosyncratic world knowledge.","According to Campbell, the cohesive elements by which the producer of a text establishes coherence and continuity in a text are governed by two main principles:"]},{"title":"similarity","paragraphs":["of structure and elements, and"]},{"title":"proximity.","paragraphs":["Campbell shows how these relate to the gestalt perception of structure, through metaprinciples of"]},{"title":"reinforcement","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"conflict.","paragraphs":["For example, similarity can create a background against which dissimilar things can be foregrounded.

In such systems, the problem of maintaining cohesion and coherence in the text produced becomes much larger than merely ensuring that coreference links are felicitous.
