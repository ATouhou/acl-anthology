Here's a thick volume that shows that one can also lick several Herculean problems of semantics, but only if one is willing to display the equivalent of Sisyphean labor. It reports work by Hans Kamp and Uwe Reyle, who have been busy for the last thirteen years or so grappling with such problems and finding clever answers.","If you are a semanticist you already know that anything Kamp writes matters. Now that there is a book in which he appears as the principal author, I'll make the sensible prediction that this two-part magnum opus will make history. It (and a sequel in the making; see below) will be consulted as an essential reference for years to come, and will surely join the ranks of distinguished books such as Montague's celebrated Formal Philosophy (1974), Dowty et al.'s orderly presentation of Montague's ideas (1981), Barwise and Perry's elegant Situations and Attitudes (1983), and Devlin's lucid reworking (1991) of the latter.","And all this despite the fact that Kamp and Reyle wrote a textbook (a term used here in a nonderogatory way)--one that includes exercises, painstaking historical analyses, and that has a careful, top-down design for the classroom. The book is aimed at students (researchers are also students!) with varying degrees of proficiency in semantics; in fact, it even includes the material necessary for those who were never exposed Computational Linguistics Volume 21, Number 2 to semantics and formal logic. (Witness Kamp and Reyle's remark (p. 4): \"[W]e ended up writing a book without prerequisite.\")","From Discourse to Logic tells, in glittering composition, the story of Discourse Representation Theory (DRT), a particular way of thinking about the semantics of natural language. DRT owes its origins to Kamp's consistent efforts to solve two important problems: (i) donkey anaphora, and (ii) tense and aspect. The first problem has to do with sentences such as If Hitler owns some book, he burns it: the anaphoric connection between some book and it is hard to justify in the light of the logical meaning of some. The second problem, especially manifest in French, has to do with the difficulty of explaining the nuance between the pass6 simple and the imparfait--two morphologically distinct past tenses. 1","Kamp and Reyle trace the enigmatic nature of these problems to the static perspective that classical (model-theoretic) semantics provides. It is true that Montague's vision (going back to Frege) to characterize linguistic expressions in terms of referential relations was a breakthrough of a very high order. However, questions of anaphora and aspect require another dimension, the dimension of what is commonly known as 'interpretation': the process by which a speaker assigns a meaning to the strings of signs or sounds that she reads or hears. Kamp and Reyle's theory of meaning attempts to use both the Montagovian outlook and the interpretive outlook in a truly integrated fashion. Accordingly, DRT can be thought of as a remedy to the one-sidedness of the classical paradigm by combining its truth-conditional perspective with the interpretation-oriented world-view.","Here's a structural summary of the book: • Part 1 Chapter 0. Preliminaries (51 pp.) Chapter 1. DRT and Predicate Logic (81 pp.) Chapter 2. Quantification and Connectives (92 pp.) Chapter 3. Loose Ends (72 pp.) Part 2 Chapter 4. The Plural (178 pp.) Chapter 5. Tense and Aspect (207 pp.)","Chapter 0 offers a very instructive (informal) discussion of fundamental ideas about logic and semantics, and their natural relationships. It also defines a phrase structure grammar (enriched with assorted syntactic features) that is used to explicitly describe the details of DRT. The grammar is not all-encompassing but then again, it is not a toy either. Chapters 1 and 2 give a formal, systematic presentation of the theory; the core of these chapters is a famous paper of Kamp's (1981). Additionally, they offer lengthy discussions on negation, and disjunction and conjunction, respectively. Chapters 4 and 5 extend these into new realms, namely, plural constructions, and tense and aspect, respectively. Chapter 3 serves as a bridge between Chapters 1 and 2, and Chapters 4 and 5. It deals with reflexives, proper names, and scope ambiguity, to name a few. Construction of Discourse Representation Structures (DRSs) are given for plurals and tensed sentences in Chapters 4 and 5, together with detailed model 1 Aside: This reminds me of the last words of Dominique Bouhours, French grammarian: \"I am about toy--or I am going tc~Ktie; either expression is used.\" 266 Book Reviews theories. In order to understand the essentials of DRT, Part 1 is probably sufficient; however, to see DRT at work one should study Part 2 in detail. In fact, this is where one can see the real power of DRT, as applied to realistic problems.","I must note that Kamp and Reyle intend to publish a sequel to the book under review. This sequel will contain, among others, the following topics:","• implications of DRT for certain issues in the philosophy of language and philosophical logic • the proof theory of the formal representations used by DRT • the theory of propositional attitudes • the theory of verbal communication, of mutual information, etc.","Finally, I would like to draw the attention of the reader to another excellent book that complements the volume under review rather nicely. This is the thoughtprovoking treatise of Asher (1993), which presents a novel approach and scrutinizes the ways we refer to 'abstract objects' (things like propositions, properties, states of affairs, and facts) in natural language discourse. Asher devotes about 50 pages to a crash course on DRT and then uses this framework to give a semantic analysis of eventuality (an object that is either some kind of event or state) and abstract object-denoting nominals in English.","Yogi Berra once said \"95% of this game is half mental.\" I think his remark also applies to semantics. Traditionally, semantics has been conceived as a primarily philosophical discipline with little to prescribe but much to analyze. However, Asher's book is also important for the readers of this journal because of its due regard to implementational aspects. The following excerpt (Asher 1993, p. 11) affirms this: Finally, DRT is a major semantic framework for which implementation has been a consistent goal. Careful attention to the DRS construction process has yielded computational implementations of the theory relatively easily, and fragments of the DRS construction algorithm now run in LISP and PROLOG at a variety of sites in the US and Europe.","Go and read From Discourse to Logic and follow up with Asher's book. This will be a demanding experience, but you won't regret it. In the end, you'll know a great deal about one of the most original and influential semantic theories of our time (I think the primary competition comes from Situation Semantics), and furthermore, you'll encounter along the way many interesting problems with a strongly computational flavor.
