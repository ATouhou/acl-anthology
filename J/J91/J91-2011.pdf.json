Turning to recent work in cognitive linguistics and discourse analysis, Croft argues that the syntactic functions represent universal ways of conceptualizing experience for the purpose of communicating information in language.","Croft then applies this hypothesis to grammatical relations between the verb and its dependent subject, object, and oblique noun phrases, arguing that one cannot account for cross-linguistic patterns of marking using semantic roles such as \"agent\" or \"instrument.\" He proposes instead an \"idealized (prototypical) cognitive model\" of verb-meaning based on causal relations among participants in the action that human beings use in conceptualizing events, which largely determines the choice of subject, object, and oblique forms.-- From the publisher's announcement"]},{"title":"Entities and Indices M.Jo Cresswell","paragraphs":["(Victoria University of Wellington) Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1990, xi + 274 pp. (Studies in Linguistics and Philosophy 41) Hardbound, ISBN 0-7923-0966-9, $79.00, £45.00, Dfl 130.00 How is one to represent the meaning of a sentence such as Everyone who is actually rich might have been poor?

[This is] the first comprehensive introduction to logic, language, and meaning that includes on the one hand a very fine introduction to logic, starting from the beginning, and on the other hand brings up at every point connections to the study of meaning in natural language, and thus serves as an excellent introduction and logical background to many of the central concerns of semantics and the philosophy of language as well.","This book is pedagogically beautifully designed, with the central developments very carefully introduced and richly augmented with examples and exercises, and with a wealth of related optional material that can be included or omitted for different kinds of courses (or self-teaching) for which the book could very well be used: I could imagine tailoring very fine but slightly different courses from it for inclusion in a linguistics curricu-1 Copyright (D 1991 The University of Chicago.

I think the authors have done a superb job of combining pedagogical user-friendliness with the greatest at-tention to rigor where it matters.","One very noticeable difference from familiar introductory logic texts is the inclusion of accessible introductions to many nonstandard topics in logic, ranging from approaches to presupposition and many-valued logics to issues in the foundations of model theory, and a wide range of more advanced (but still very accessible) topics in Volume II. The book thereby gives the student an invaluable perspective on the field of logic as an active area of growth, development, and controversy, and not simply a repository of a single set of eternal axioms and theorems. Volume II provides an outstanding introduction to the interdisciplinary concerns of logic and semantics, including a good introduction to the basics of Montague grammar and model-theoretic semantics more generally.","I first became acquainted with this book in its Dutch version during a sabbatical leave in the Netherlands in 1982-83 ....

The two chapters on speech recognition, which together make up half the book, reflect the particular viewpoint that (1) pattern matching using dynamic programming techniques seems to be a short-term solution that is inextricably linked to word-based templates and therefore is not easily applicable to very large or open vocabularies; and (2) that we can anticipate the imminent emergence of high-accuracy speech recognition systems that identify sub-word phonetic units based on the kind of knowledge that has been accumulated over the last several 250 Briefly Noted decades' work in acoustic phonetics. Even by 1986 or 1987, it should have been clear that there was no necessary link between dynamic programming pattern-matching algorithms and closed vocabulary applications, and that the prospect for high-performance speech recognition systems based on acoustic phonetic expertise was dim and getting dimmer. This renders the speech recognition portion of the book somewhat less useful than it might be. Still, one of the speech recognition chapters offers an excellent review of dynamic time warp (DTW) recognition theory and practice, and the other is a wonderfully comprehensive review of the acoustic characteristics of English consonants.--Jared Bernstein, SRI International"]},{"title":"Applied Computer Translation [journal] Tony McEnery (editor)","paragraphs":["(Department of Computing, University of Lancaster) Sigma Press (1 South Oak Lane, Wilmslow, Cheshire, England SK9 6AR), quarterly from January 1991 ISSN 0960-0825 Library and corporate subscriptions: £60.00 in the U.K., $120.00 elsewhere; individual subscriptions at half price. \"This journal aims to promote and examine three things, namely machine translation, computer-aided language learning, and the relationship of those two areas to one an-other and other relevant disciplines.
