The new format allows us to substantially reduce the cost of production of the journal. It also eases the way toward better electronic submission of manuscripts as the journal is now produced in I~TEX. We are able to use manuscripts in I6TEX directly as the starting point for production. In the near future, we will be releasing a I6TEX style file for the journal so that authors may use these style files from the start. This not only reduces production costs, but also allows the authors more direct control over the final appearance of their papers.","The journal is receiving more submissions than ever. We received fifty submissions in 1990, a significant increase over 1989. Yet in the first six months of 1991, we already have fifty-six submissions! Part of the gain is because of two special issues currently under review, but even without those papers we have an increase in submissions over last year's rate. To handle the higher volume, we plan to put more papers in each issue. To make space for these papers, we are discontinuing the Abstracts section. The number of submissions to the Abstracts section has dropped considerably in the last two years, indicating that the section no longer fills a need.","The other major change is that we will be introducing a new section to replace the Technical Correspondence section. Squibs and Discussions, edited by James Pustejovsky and Robert Ingria, will start with issue 18:1. This section is intended for results or data that are not yet amenable to treatment in a journal paper, but which contribute to the practical working knowledge of researchers in the field of computational linguistics. The section will allow the rapid dissemination of new observations and data that can contribute to our understanding of natural language, even when these data and observations are not yet fully analyzed. A more detailed description of the new section appeared in the last FINITE STRING Newsletter. James F. Allen 111"]}]}
