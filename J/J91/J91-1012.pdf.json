{"sections":[{"title":"Oxford New! Computers and Human Language GEORGE W. SMITH University of Massachusetts, Boston k_Yffering an inquiry into the nature of language from the perspective of computing, Computers and Human Language synthesizes recent research in linguistics, computer science, and experimental psychology as it explores the major computational approaches to language. Among the topics considered are the computationally tractable, symbolic basis of language, the mental lexicon as repository of knowledge, the elegantly recursive structure of syntax, and the compositional nature of meanings, together with the segmentation, focus, and hierarchical construction of extended discourse. This text also explores such up-to-the-minute subjects as neurally-inspired computing, parsing and psychological plausibility, the controversial representation hypothesis, and the ramifications of discourse \"focus.\" With its clear, engaging style and gradual, systematic exposition, Computers and Human Language makes the fast-moving world of computational linguistics accessible to the beginning student. 1991 496 pp.; 87 illus, paper $16.95 cloth $39.95","paragraphs":["Prices and publication dates are subject to change.","To request an examination copy, write on school letterhead giving full course information, including course name, level, expected enrollment, and your decision deadline, to:"]},{"title":"Oxford University Press ATTN: College Sales Coordinator 200 Madison Avenue • New York, NY 10016 Special Offer- Save 20% The Cambridge /ACL Series Studies in Natural Language Processing Aravind Joshi, Editor","paragraphs":["This series of monographs, texts, and edited volumes is published in cooperation with the Association for Computational Linguistics."]},{"title":"Relational Models of the Lexicon","paragraphs":["Representing Knowledge in Semantic Networks","Martha Walton Evens, Editor 400 pp. Tables/line diagrams","36300-4 Hardcover $34.50 £27.50"]},{"title":"Machine Translation Theoretical and Methodological Issues Sergei Nirenburg, Editor","paragraphs":["360 pp. Tables and line diagrams 33125-0 Hardcover $52.50 £30.00 33696-1 Paper $19.95 £12.50"]},{"title":"The Linguistic Basis of Text Generation Laurence Danlos","paragraphs":["250 pp. Some line diagrams 32938-8 Haxdcover $42.50 £30.00"]},{"title":"Semantic Interpretation and the Resolution of Ambiguity","paragraphs":["Graeme Hirst 275 pp. Tables and line diagrams","32203-0 Hardcover $32.50 £25.00"]},{"title":"Memory and Context for Language Interpretation Hiyan Alshawi","paragraphs":["200 pp. Some line diagrams 34059-4 Itardcover $32.50 £25.00"]},{"title":"Systemic Text Generation as Problem Solving","paragraphs":["Terry Patten 275 pp. Some line diagrams","35076-X Hardcover $34.50 £25.00 Available in paper..."]},{"title":"Computational Linguistics An Introduction","paragraphs":["Ralph Grishman 225 pp. Many line diagrams","31038-5 Paper $14.95 £ 8.50"]},{"title":"Spatial Cognition","paragraphs":["An Interdisciplinary Study of the Prepositions in English","Annette Herskovits 225 pp. Tables and line diagrams 26690-4 Hardcover $37.50 £27.50"]},{"title":"Natural Language Parsing","paragraphs":["Psychological, Computational,","and Theoretical Editors: David R.

In the course of this research many linguistic formalisms have been adopted. This book provides a snapshot of the state of the art in natural language. It gathers the leading U.S. and European NLG researchers and sets them in the context of five themes--text planning, linguistic realism, building realization, building descriptions, and connectionist approaches.
