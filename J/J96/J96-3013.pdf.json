The broader topic of the book is the conceptualization of space and the editor's intention is to shed light on this by bringing together people working on the mental interpretation of prepositions. The editor is particularly interested in the computational processing of prepositions.","There are 14 papers in the book, falling under the following headings: Introduction (by Zelinsky-Wibbelt); lexicalization patterns of prepositions; semantic categorization of prepositions and context; contrastive implications of prepositions; and image understanding and prepositions.","Zelinsky-Wibbelt gives an excellent introduction to the book by motivating the importance of looking at the semantics of words in general and prepositions in particular. She points out that if we are not able to make the right semantic distinctions, then natural language processing, machine translation, and vision processing will be futile. I like the fact that she has seen that prepositions and their meaning lie at the junction where language and vision processing meet and this is certainly a focus of much of this work of late (McKevitt 1995-96). It is certainly becoming clear now that spatial relations between, and reference to, objects in the world lie at the center of integrated artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and vision processing (Olivier 1995).","The volume focuses on two major paradigms: Cognitive Grammar, whose followers are Lakoff (1987) and Langacker (1988), and the two-level approach to semantics followed by Bierwisch and Lang (1989). In Cognitive Grammar, it is recognized that all mental experience is gained from physical experience functioning in a physical environment and that prepositions and hence spatial expressions can function as higher-order mental models for abstract and complex situations. Abstract concepts are metaphors of concrete spatial predications. In the two-level approach, a distinction is made between objects that are"]},{"title":"inherently oriented","paragraphs":["(e.g., coin, book), and thus have meaning independent of their orientation in context, and those that are"]},{"title":"canonically oriented","paragraphs":["(e.g., wardrobe, chest, tower), and thus don't; and of course there are neutral objects (e.g., ball, cube, star). The two-level approach is axisbased and object-oriented, and focuses on the speaker's line of sight and the orientation of objects, whereas the Cognitive Grammar approach focuses on how the speaker's intentions and perspective constrain his or her conceptualization. Cognitive Grammar is more concerned with how cognitive, biological, and pragmatic principles underlie how the speaker attributes salience to objects in a given scene. Lang has a paper in this book but neither Lakoff nor Langacker do.","In my view, Jorg Schirra's paper stood out in the book; it focuses on the integration of language and vision processing with respect to reference semantics for spatial expressions (especially geometric relations). He introduces the project VITRA (Visual TRAnslator), which started in 1985 and which examines the relations between speaking and seeing. CITYTOUR and SOCCER are two systems constructed in VITRA that transform visual perceptions into language. SOCCER simultaneously analyzes and describes in German short scenes from soccer games like live radio reports. This involves perceiving the locations and movements of the ball and players, interpreting movements with respect to conventions of soccer games (especially plans and intentions), and selecting which events to utter in what sequence. The spatial relations considered are close to (German) prepositions and the location of an object is relevant only relative to other objects\" positions. Probability clouds are used to give meaning to relations between objects such as being in, near, and in front of. The dense centers of such clouds mark those positions rated as good examples for the relations.","This book is worth reading for those who are interested in machine translation and the integration of natural language and vision 450 Briefly Noted processing, and the spatial relations, reference to the world, and grounding of representations that this entails.
