For languages like English one can assume, to a first approximation, that word boundaries are given by whitespace or punctuation. In various Asian languages, including Chinese, on the other hand, whitespace is never used to delimit words, so one must resort to lexical information to \"reconstruct\" the word-boundary information. In this paper we present a stochastic finite-state model wherein the basic workhorse is the weighted finite-state transducer. The model segments Chinese text into dictionary entries and words derived by various productive lexical processes, and--since the primary intended application of this model is to text-to-speech synthesis--provides pronunciations for these words. We evaluate the system's performance by comparing its segmentation 'Tudgments\" with the judgments of a pool of human segmenters, and the system is shown to perform quite well. 1. The Problem Any NLP application that presumes as input unrestricted text requires an initial phase of text analysis; such applications involve problems as diverse as machine translation, information retrieval, and text-to-speech synthesis (TTS). An initial step of any text-analysis task is the tokenization of the input into words. For a language like English, this problem is generally regarded as trivial since words are delimited in English text by whitespace or marks of punctuation. Thus in an English sentence such as I'm going to show up at the ACL one would reasonably conjecture that there are eight words separated by seven spaces. A moment's reflection will reveal that things are not quite that simple. There are clearly eight orthographic words in the example given, but if one were doing syntactic analysis one would probably want to consider I'm to consist of two syntactic words, namely I and am. If one is interested in translation, one would probably want to consider show up as a single dictionary word since its semantic interpretation is not trivially derivable from the meanings of show and up. And if one is interested in TTS, one would probably consider the single orthographic word ACL to consist of three phonological words--/eJ s'i ~l/--corresponding to the pronunciation of each of the letters in the acronym.

Most languages that use Roman, Greek, Cyrillic, Armenian, or Semitic scripts, and many that use Indian-derived scripts, mark orthographic word boundaries; however, languages written in a Chinese-derived writing system, including Chinese and Japanese, as well as Indian-derived writing systems of languages like Thai, do not delimit orthographic words. 1","Put another way, written Chinese simply lacks orthographic words.

Twentieth-century linguistic work on Chinese (Chao 1968; Li and Thompson 1981; Tang 1988, 1989, inter alia) has revealed the incorrectness of this traditional view. All notions of word, with the exception of the orthographic word, are as relevant in Chinese as they are in English, and just as is the case in other languages, a word in Chinese may correspond to one or more symbols in the orthog-1 For a related approach to the problem of word-segmention in Japanese, see Nagata (1994), inter alia. 2 Chinese ~--~ han4zi4 'Chinese character'; this is the same word as Japanese kanji. 3 Throughout this paper we shall give Chinese examples in traditional orthography, followed immediately by a Romanization into the pinyin transliteration scheme; numerals following each pinyin syllable represent tones. Examples will usually be accompanied by a translation, plus a morpheme-by-morpheme gloss given in parentheses whenever the translation does not adequately serve this purpose. In the pinyin transliterations a dash (-) separates syllables that may be considered part of the same phonological word; spaces are used to separate plausible phonological words; and a plus sign (+) is used, where relevant, to indicate morpheme boundaries of interest. 378 Sproat, Shih, Gale and Chang Word-Segmentation for Chinese raphy: ,K."]},{"title":"ren2","paragraphs":["'person' is a fairly uncontroversial case of a monographemic word, and ~]"]},{"title":"zhongl-guo2","paragraphs":["(middle country) 'China' a fairly uncontroversial case of a digraphemic word.

For example, suppose one is building a TTS system for Mandarin Chinese. For that application, at a minimum, one would want to know the phonological word boundaries. Now, for this application one might be tempted to simply bypass the segmentation problem and pronounce the text character-by-character. However, there are several reasons why this approach will not in general work:","1.

TTS systems in general need to do more than simply compute the pronunciations of individual words; they also need to compute intonational phrase boundaries in long utterances and assign relative prominence to words in those utterances. It has been shown for English (Wang and Hirschberg 1992; Hirschberg 1993; Sproat 1994, inter alia) that grammatical part of speech provides useful information for these tasks. Given that part-of-speech labels are properties of words rather than morphemes, it follows that one cannot do part-of-speech assignment without having access to word-boundary information. Making the reasonable assumption that similar information is relevant for solving these problems in Chinese, it follows that a prerequisite for intonation-boundary assignment and prominence assignment is word segmentation. The points enumerated above are particularly related to TTS, but analogous arguments can easily be given for other applications; see for example Wu and Tseng's (1993) discussion of the role of segmentation in information retrieval. There are thus some very good reasons why segmentation into words is an important task. 379 Computational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 3","A minimal requirement for building a Chinese word segmenter is obviously a dictionary; furthermore, as has been argued persuasively by Fung and Wu (1994), one will perform much better at segmenting text by using a dictionary constructed with text of the same genre as the text to be segmented. For novel texts, no lexicon that consists simply of a list of word entries will ever be entirely satisfactory, since the list will inevitably omit many constructions that should be considered words.

The model incorporates various recent techniques for incorporating and manipulating linguistic knowledge using finite-state transducers.

A Brief Introduction to the Chinese Writing System Most readers will undoubtedly be at least somewhat familiar with the nature of the Chinese writing system, but there are enough common misunderstandings that it is as well to spend a few paragraphs on properties of the Chinese script that will be relevant to topics discussed in this paper.","The first point we need to address is what type of linguistic object a hanzi represents.

Following the system devised under the Qing emperor Kang Xi, hanzi have traditionally been classified according to a set of approximately 200 semantic radicals; members of a radical class share a particular structural component, and often also share a common meaning (hence the term 'semantic'). For example, hanzi containing the INSECT radical ~ tend to denote insects and other crawling animals; examples include ~"]},{"title":"wal","paragraphs":["'frog,' ~"]},{"title":"fengl","paragraphs":["'wasp,' and ~"]},{"title":"she2","paragraphs":["'snake.'

While the semantic aspect of radicals is by no means completely predictive, the semantic homogeneity of many classes is quite striking: for example 254 out of the 263 examples (97%) of the INSECT class listed by Wieger (1965, 773-76) denote crawling or invertebrate animals; similarly 21 out of the 22 examples (95%) of the GHOST class (page 808) denote ghosts or spirits. As we shall argue, the semantic class affiliation of a hanzi constitutes useful information in predicting its properties. 3. Previous Work There is a sizable literature on Chinese word segmentation: recent reviews include Wang, Su, and Mo (1990) and Wu and Tseng (1993). Roughly speaking, previous work can be divided into three categories, namely purely statistical approaches, purely lexical rule-based approaches, and approaches that combine lexical information with statistical information. The present proposal falls into the last group.","Purely statistical approaches have not been very popular, and so far as we are aware earlier work by Sproat and Shih (1990) is the only published instance of such an approach. In that work, mutual information was used to decide whether to group adjacent hanzi into two-hanzi words. Mutual information was shown to be useful in the segmentation task given that one does not have a dictionary. A related point is that mutual information is helpful in augmenting existing electronic dictionaries, (cf. 4 To be sure, it is not always true that a hanzi represents a syllable or that it represents a morpheme. For example, in Northern Mandarin dialects there is a morpheme -r that attaches mostly to nouns, and which is phonologically incorporated into the syllable to which it attaches: thus"]},{"title":"men2+r","paragraphs":["(door+R) 'door\" is realized as"]},{"title":"mer2.","paragraphs":["This is orthographically represented as ~ so that 'door' would be ~, and in this case the hanzi ~t~ does not represent a syllable.

(See Sproat and Shih 1995.) However, the characterization given in the main body of the text is correct sufficiently often to be useful. 381 Computational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 3 Church and Hanks [1989]), and we have used lists of character pairs ranked by mutual information to expand our own dictionary.","Nonstochastic lexical-knowledge-based approaches have been much more numerous. Two issues distinguish the various proposals. The first concerns how to deal with ambiguities in segmentation. The second concerns the methods used (if any) to extend the lexicon beyond the static list of entries provided by the machine-readable dictionary upon which it is based. The most popular approach to dealing with segmentation ambiguities is the maximum matching method, possibly augmented with further heuristics. This method, one instance of which we term the \"greedy algorithm\" in our evaluation of our own system in Section 5, involves starting at the beginning (or end) of the sentence, finding the longest word starting (ending) at that point, and then repeating the process starting at the next (previous) hanzi until the end (beginning) of the sentence is reached. Papers that use this method or minor variants thereof include Liang (1986), Li et al. (1991), Gu and Mao (1994), and Nie, Jin, and Hannan (1994). The simplest version of the maximum matching algorithm effectively deals with ambiguity by ignoring it, since the method is guaranteed to produce only one segmentation. Methods that allow multiple segmentations must provide criteria for choosing the best segmentation. Some approaches depend upon some form of constraint satisfaction based on syntactic or semantic features (e.g., Yeh and Lee [1991], which uses a unification-based approach). Others depend upon various lexical heuristics: for example Chen and Liu (1992) attempt to balance the length of words in a three-word window, favoring segmentations that give approximately equal length for each word. Methods for expanding the dictionary include, of course, morphological rules, rules for segmenting personal names, as well as numeral sequences, expressions for dates, and so forth (Chen and Liu 1992; Wang, Li, and Chang 1992; Chang and Chen 1993; Nie, Jin, and Hannan 1994).","Lexical-knowledge-based approaches that include statistical information generally presume that one starts with all possible segmentations of a sentence, and picks the best segmentation from the set of possible segmentations using a probabilistic or cost-based scoring mechanism. Approaches differ in the algorithms used for scoring and selecting the best path, as well as in the amount of contextual information used in the scoring process. The simplest approach involves scoring the various analyses by costs based on word frequency, and picking the lowest cost path; variants of this approach have been described in Chang, Chen, and Chen (1991) and Chang and Chen (1993). More complex approaches such as the relaxation technique have been applied to this problem Fan and Tsai (1988). Note that Chang, Chen, and Chen (1991), in addition to word-frequency information, include a constraint-satisfication model, so their method is really a hybrid approach. Several papers report the use of part-of-speech information to rank segmentations (Lin, Chiang, and Su 1993; Peng and Chang 1993; Chang and Chen 1993); typically, the probability of a segmentation is multiplied by the probability of the tagging(s) for that segmentation to yield an estimate of the total probability for the analysis.","Statistical methods seem particularly applicable to the problem of unknown-word identification, especially for constructions like names, where the linguistic constraints are minimal, and where one therefore wants to know not only that a particular sequence of hanzi might be a name, but that it is likely to be a name with some probability. Several systems propose statistical methods for handling unknown words (Chang et al. 1992; Lin, Chiang, and Su 1993; Peng and Chang 1993). Some of these approaches (e.g., Lin, Chiang, and Su [1993]) attempt to identify unknown words, but do not actually tag the words as belonging to one or another class of expression. This is not ideal for some applications, however. For instance, for TTS it is necessary to know 382 Sproat, Shih, Gale and Chang Word-Segmentation for Chinese that a particular sequence of hanzi is of a particular category because that knowledge could affect the pronunciation; consider, for example the issues surrounding the pronunciation of ~ ganl/qian2 discussed in Section 1.","Following Sproat and Shih (1990), performance for Chinese segmentation systems is generally reported in terms of the dual measures of precision and recall. 5 It is fairly standard to report precision and recall scores in the mid to high 90% range. However, it is almost universally the case that no clear definition of what constitutes a \"correct\" segmentation is given, so these performance measures are hard to evaluate. Indeed, as we shall show in Section 5, even human judges differ when presented with the task of segmenting a text into words, so a definition of the criteria used to determine that a given segmentation is correct is crucial before one can interpret such measures. In a few cases, the criteria for correctness are made more explicit. For example Chen and Liu (1992) report precision and recall rates of over 99%, but this counts only the words that occur in the test corpus that also occur in their dictionary. Besides the lack of a clear definition of what constitutes a correct segmentation for a given Chinese sentence, there is the more general issue that the test corpora used in these evaluations differ from system to system, so meaningful comparison between systems is rendered even more difficult.","The major problem for all segmentation systems remains the coverage afforded by the dictionary and the lexical rules used to augment the dictionary to deal with unseen words. The dictionary sizes reported in the literature range from 17,000 to 125,000 entries, and it seems reasonable to assume that the coverage of the base dictionary constitutes a major factor in the performance of the various approaches, possibly more important than the particular set of methods used in the segmentation. Furthermore, even the size of the dictionary per se is less important than the appropriateness of the lexicon to a particular test corpus: as Fung and Wu (1994) have shown, one can obtain substantially better segmentation by tailoring the lexicon to the corpus to be segmented. 4. The Proposal Chinese word segmentation can be viewed as a stochastic transduction problem. More formally, we start by representing the dictionary D as a Weighted Finite State Transducer (WFST) (Pereira, Riley, and Sproat 1994). Let H be the set of hanzi, p be the set of pinyin syllables with tone marks, and P be the set of grammatical part-of-speech labels. Then each arc of D maps either from an element of H to an element of p, or from c--i.e., the empty string--to an element of P. More specifically, each word is represented in the dictionary as a sequence of arcs, starting from the initial state of D and labeled with an element S of Hxp, which is terminated with a weighted arc labeled with an element of E x P. The weight represents the estimated cost (negative log probability) of the word. Next, we represent the input sentence as an unweighted finite-state acceptor (FSA) I over H. Let us assume the existence of a function Id, which takes as input an FSA A, and produces as output a transducer that maps all and only the strings of symbols accepted by A to themselves (Kaplan and Kay 1994). We can 5 Recall that precision is defined to be the number of correct hits divided by the total number of items selected; and that recall is defined to be the number of correct hits divided by the number of items that should have been selected. 383 Computational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 3 then define the best segmentation to be the cheapest or best path in"]},{"title":"Id(I) o D*","paragraphs":["(i.e.,"]},{"title":"Id(I)","paragraphs":["composed with the transitive closure of D). 6","Consider the abstract example illustrated in Figure 2.

Evaluation In this section we present a partial evaluation of the current system, in three parts. The first is an evaluation of the system's ability to mimic humans at the task of segmenting text into word-sized units; the second evaluates the proper-name identification; the third measures the performance on morphological analysis. To date we have not done a separate evaluation of foreign-name recognition. Evaluation of the Segmentation as a Whole. Previous reports on Chinese segmentation have invariably cited performance either in terms of a single percent-correct score, or else a single precision-recall pair. The problem with these styles of evaluation is that, as we shall demonstrate, even human judges do not agree perfectly on how to segment a given text. Thus, rather than give a single evaluative score, we prefer to compare the performance of our method with the judgments of several human subjects. To this end, we picked 100 sentences at random containing 4,372 total hanzi from a test corpus. 14 (There were 487 marks of punctuation in the test sentences, including the sentence-final periods, meaning that the average inter-punctuation distance was about 9 hanzi.) We asked six native speakers--three from Taiwan (T1-T3), and three from the Mainland (M1-M3)--to segment the corpus. Since we could not bias the subjects towards a particular segmentation and did not presume linguistic sophistication on their part, the instructions were simple: subjects were to mark all places they might plausibly pause if they were reading the text aloud. An examination of the subjects' bracketings confirmed that these instructions were satisfactory in yielding plausible word-sized units. (See also Wu and Fung [1994].)","Various segmentation approaches were then compared with human performance: . . . A greedy algorithm (or maximum-matching algorithm), GR: proceed through the sentence, taking the longest match with a dictionary entry at each point. An anti-greedy algorithm, AG: instead of the longest match, take the shortest match at each point. The method being described--henceforth ST. Two measures that can be used to compare judgments are: . . Precision. For each pair of judges consider one judge as the standard, computing the precision of the other's judgments relative to this standard. Recall. For each pair of judges, consider one judge as the standard, computing the recall of the other's judgments relative to this standard. Clearly, for judges J1 and J2, taking J1 as standard and computing the precision and recall for J2 yields the same results as taking J2 as the standard, and computing for h,","14 All evaluation materials, with the exception of those used for evaluating personal names were drawn from the subset of the United Informatics corpus not used in the training of the models. 393 Computational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 3 Table 2 Similarity matrix for segmentation judgments.

We therefore used the arithmetic mean of each interjudge precision-recall pair as a single measure of interjudge similarity. Table 2 shows these similarity measures. The average agreement among the human judges is .76, and the average agreement between ST and the humans is .75, or about 99% of the interhuman agreement. 15 One can better visualize the precision-recall similarity matrix by producing from that matrix a distance matrix, computing a classical metric multidimensional scaling (Torgerson 1958; Becker, Chambers, Wilks 1988) on that distance matrix, and plotting the first two most significant dimensions. The result of this is shown in Figure 7. The horizontal axis in this plot represents the most significant dimension, which explains 62% of the variation. In addition to the automatic methods, AG, GR, and ST, just discussed, we also added to the plot the values for the current algorithm"]},{"title":"using only dictionary entries","paragraphs":["(i.e., no productively derived words or names). This is to allow for fair comparison between the statistical method and GR, which is also purely dictionary-based. As can be seen, GR and this \"pared-down\" statistical method perform quite similarly, though the statistical method is still slightly better. 16 AG clearly performs much less like humans than these methods, whereas the full statistical algorithm, including morphological derivatives and names, performs most closely to humans among the automatic methods. It can also be seen clearly in this plot that two of the Taiwan speakers cluster very closely together, and the third Taiwan speaker is also close in the most significant dimension (the x axis). Two of the Mainlanders also cluster close together but, interestingly, not particularly close to the Taiwan speakers; the third Mainlander is much more similar to the Taiwan speakers.","The breakdown of the different types of words found by ST in the test corpus is given in Table 3. Clearly the percentage of productively formed words is quite small (for this particular corpus), meaning that dictionary entries are covering most of the","15 GR is .73 or 96%.","16 As one reviewer points out, one problem with the unigram model chosen here is that there is still a tendency to pick a segmentation containing fewer words. That is, given a choice between segmenting a sequence abc into abc and ab, c, the former will always be picked so long as its cost does not exceed the summed costs of ab and c: while; it is possible for abc to be so costly as to preclude the larger grouping, this will certainly not usually be the case. In this way, the method reported on here will necessarily be similar to a greedy method, though of course not identical. As the reviewer also points out, this is a problem that is shared by, e.g., probabilistic context-free parsers, which tend to pick trees with fewer nodes. The question is how to normalize the probabilities in such a way that smaller groupings have a better shot at winning. This is an issue that we have not addressed at the current stage of our research. 394 Sproat, Shih, Gale and Chang Word-Segmentation for Chinese .,¢ o~ E o d o = o c; o o + antigreedy x greedy o current method o dict. only • Taiwan 4, Mainland","o","i","i","i","i","i -0.3 -0.2 -0.1 O.O 0.1 0.2 Dimension 1 (62%) Figure 7 Classical metric multidimensional scaling of distance matrix, showing the two most significant dimensions.

Nonetheless, the results of the comparison with human judges demonstrates that there is mileage being gained by incorporating models of these types of words.","It may seem surprising to some readers that the interhuman agreement scores reported here are so low. However, this result is consistent with the results of experiments discussed in Wu and Fung (1994). Wu and Fung introduce an evaluation method they call nk-blind. Under this scheme, n human judges are asked independently to segment a text. Their results are then compared with the results of an automatic segmenter. For a given \"word\" in the automatic segmentation, if at least k of the human judges agree that this is a word, then that word is considered to be correct. For eight judges, ranging k between 1 and 8 corresponded to a precision score range of 90% to 30%, meaning that there were relatively few words (30% of those found by the automatic segmenter) on which all judges agreed, whereas most of the words found by the segmenter were such that one human judge agreed. 395 Computational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 3"]},{"title":"Proper-Name Identification.","paragraphs":["To evaluate proper-name identification, we randomly selected 186 sentences containing 12,000 hanzi from our test corpus and segmented the text automatically, tagging personal names; note that for names, there is always a single unambiguous answer, unlike the more general question of which segmentation is correct. The performance was 80.99% recall and 61.83% precision. Interestingly, Chang et al. report 80.67% recall and 91.87% precision on an 11,000 word corpus: seemingly, our system finds as many names as their system, but with four times as many false hits. However, we have reason to doubt Chang et al.'s performance claims. Without using the same test corpus, direct comparison is obviously difficult; fortunately, Chang et al. include a list of about 60 sentence fragments that exemplify various categories of performance for their system. The performance of our system on those sentences appeared rather better than theirs. On a set of 11 sentence fragments--the A set--where they reported 100% recall and precision for name identification, we had 73% recall and 80% precision. However, they list two sets, one consisting of 28 fragments and the other of 22 fragments, in which they had 0% recall and precision. On the first of these--the B set--our system had 64% recall and 86% precision; on the second--the C set--it had 33% recall and 19% precision. Note that it is in precision that our over-all performance would appear to be poorer than the reported performance of Chang et al., yet based on their published examples, our system appears to be doing better precisionwise. Thus we have some confidence that our own performance is at least as good as that of Chang et al.

For example, the Wang, Li, and Chang system fails on the sequence ~ nian2 nei4 sa3 in (k) since ~ nian2 is a possible, but rare, family name, which also happens to be written the same as the very common word meaning 'year.' Our system fails in (a) because of ~ shenl, a rare family name; the system identifies it as a family name, whereas it should be analyzed as part of the given name.","Finally, the statistical method fails to correctly group hanzi in cases where the individual hanzi comprising the name are listed in the dictionary as being relatively high-frequency single-hanzi words. An example is in (i), where the system fails to group ~i~ lin2yang2gang3 as a name, because all three hanzi can in principle be separate words (~f4 lin2 'wood'; ~ yang2 'ocean'; ~ gang3 'harbor'). In many cases these failures in recall would be fixed by having better estimates of the actual probabilities of single-hanzi words, since our estimates are often inflated. A totally non-stochastic rule-based system such as Wang, Li, and Chang's will generally succeed in such cases, but of course runs the risk of overgeneration wherever the single-hanzi word is really intended. Evaluation of Morphological Analysis. In Table 5 we present results from small test corpora for the productive affixes handled by the current version of the system; as with names, the segmentation of morphologically derived words is generally either right or wrong. The first four affixes are so-called resultative affixes: they denote some property of the resultant state of a verb, as in ,~,~T wang4-bu4-1iao3 (forget-not-attain) 'cannot forget.' The last affix in the list is the nominal plural {r~ menO. 2° In the table are the (typical) classes of words to which the affix attaches, the number found in the test corpus by the method, the number correct (with a precision measure), and the number missed (with a recall measure). 6. Discussion In this paper we have argued that Chinese word segmentation can be modeled effectively using weighted finite-state transducers. This architecture provides a uniform framework in which it is easy to incorporate not only listed dictionary entries but also morphological derivatives, and models for personal names and foreign names in transliteration. Other kinds of productive word classes, such as company names, abbreviations (termed ,~ suol-xie3 in Mandarin), and place names can easily be 20 Note that -j~ in ,~--~,~ ~ is normally pronounced as leO, but as part of a resultative it is liao3. 398 Sproat, Shih, Gale and Chang Word-Segmentation for Chinese handled given appropriate models. (For some recent corpus-based work on Chinese abbreviations, see Huang, Ahrens, and Chen [1993].)","We have argued that the proposed method performs well. However, some caveats are in order in comparing this method (or"]},{"title":"any","paragraphs":["method) with other approaches to segmentation reported in the literature. First of all, most previous articles report performance in terms of a single percent-correct score, or else in terms of the paired measures of precision and recall. What both of these approaches presume is that there is a single correct segmentation for a sentence, against which an automatic algorithm can be compared. We have shown that, at least given independent human judgments, this is not the case, and that therefore such simplistic measures should be mistrusted. This is not to say that a set of standards by which a particular segmentation would count as correct and another incorrect could not be devised; indeed, such standards have been proposed and include the published PRCNSC (1994) and ROCLING (1993), as well as the unpublished Linguistic Data Consortium standards (ca. May 1995). However, until such standards are universally adopted in evaluating Chinese segmenters, claims about performance in terms of simple measures like percent correct should be taken with a grain of salt; see, again, Wu and Fung (1994) for further arguments supporting this conclusion.","Second, comparisons of different methods are not meaningful unless one can evaluate them on the same corpus. Unfortunately, there is no standard corpus of Chinese texts, tagged with either single or multiple human judgments, with which one can compare performance of various methods. One hopes that such a corpus will be forthcoming.","Finally, we wish to reiterate an important point. The major problem for our segmenter, as for all segmenters, remains the problem of unknown words (see Fung and Wu [1994]). We have provided methods for handling certain classes of unknown words, and models for other classes could be provided, as we have noted. However, there will remain a large number of words that are not readily adduced to any productive pattern and that would simply have to be added to the dictionary. This implies, therefore, that a major factor in the performance of a Chinese segmenter is the quality of the base dictionary, and this is probably a more important factor--from the point of view of performance alone--than the particular computational methods used.","The method reported in this paper makes use solely of unigram probabilities, and is therefore a zeroeth-order model: the cost of a particular segmentation is estimated as the sum of the costs of the individual words in the segmentation. However, as we have noted, nothing inherent in the approach precludes incorporating higher-order constraints, provided they can be effectively modeled within a finite-state framework. For example, as Gan (1994) has noted, one can construct examples where the segmentation is locally ambiguous but can be determined on the basis of sentential or even discourse context. Two sets of examples from Gan are given in (1) and (2) (= Gan's Appendix B, exx. 11a/11b and 14a/14b respectively). In (1) the sequence ,~"]},{"title":"ma3-lu4","paragraphs":["cannot be resolved locally, but depends instead upon broader context; similarly in (2), the sequence ;~J-~J[~"]},{"title":"cai2-neng2","paragraphs":["cannot be resolved locally: 1.

Gan's solution depends upon a fairly sophisticated language model that attempts to find valid syntactic, semantic, and lexical relations between objects of various linguistic types (hanzi, words, phrases). An example of a fairly low-level relation is the affix relation, which holds between a stem morpheme and an affix morpheme, such as ~ -menO (PL). A high-level relation is agent, which relates an animate nominal to a predicate. Particular instances of relations are associated with goodness scores. Particular relations are also consistent with particular hypotheses about the segmentation of a given sentence, and the scores for particular relations can be incremented or decremented depending upon whether the segmentations with which they are consistent are \"popular\" or not.","While Gan's system incorporates fairly sophisticated models of various linguistic information, it has the drawback that it has only been tested with a very small lexicon (a few hundred words) and on a very small test set (thirty sentences); there is therefore serious concern as to whether the methods that he discusses are scalable. Another question that remains unanswered is to what extent the linguistic information he considers can be handled--or at least approximated--by finite-state language models, and therefore could be directly interfaced with the segmentation model that we have presented in this paper. For the examples given in (1) and (2) this certainly seems possible. Consider first the examples in (2). The segmenter will give both analyses Y'd- ~ cai2 neng2 'just be able,' and ~-~ cai2-neng2 'talent,' but the latter analysis is preferred since splitting these two morphemes is generally more costly than grouping them. In (2a), we want to split the two morphemes since the correct analysis is that we have the adverb ;~- cai2 'just,' the modal verb ~ neng2 'be able' and the main verb J]~ ke4-fu2 'overcome'; the competing analysis is, of course, that we have the noun Yd-~. cai2-neng2 'talent,' followed by ~J]~ ke4-fu2 'overcome.' Clearly it is possible to write a rule that states that if an analysis Modal + Verb is available, then that is to be preferred over Noun + Verb: such a rule could be stated in terms of (finite-state) local grammars in the sense of Mohri (1993). Turning now to (1), we have the similar problem that splitting ,~ into ,~ ma3 'horse' and ~ lu4 'way' is more costly than retaining this as one word ,~ ma3-lu4 'road.' However, there is again local grammatical information that should favor the split in the case of (la): both ,~ ma3 'horse' and ,~ ma3-lu4 are nouns, but only ,~ ma3 is consistent with the classifier ~ pil, the classifier 400 Sproat, Shih, Gale and Chang Word-Segmentation for Chinese for horses. 21 By a similar argument, the preference for not splitting ,,~ could be strengthened in (lb) by the observation that the classifier (~"]},{"title":"tiao2","paragraphs":["is consistent with long or winding objects like ,~/~"]},{"title":"ma3-1u4","paragraphs":["'road' but not with ,~"]},{"title":"ma3","paragraphs":["'horse.' Note that the sets of possible classifiers for a given noun can easily be encoded on that noun by grammatical features, which can be referred to by finite-state grammatical rules. Thus, we feel fairly confident that for the examples we have considered from Gan's study a solution can be incorporated, or at least approximated, within a finite-state framework.","With regard to purely morphological phenomena, certain processes are not handled elegantly within the current framework. Any process involving reduplication, for instance, does not lend itself to modeling by finite-state techniques, since there is no way that finite-state networks can directly implement the copying operations required. Mandarin exhibits several such processes, including A-not-A question formation, illustrated in (3a), and adverbial reduplication, illustrated in (3b): 3.

Conclusions Despite these limitations, a purely finite-state approach to Chinese word segmentation enjoys a number of strong advantages. The model we use provides a simple framework in which to incorporate a wide variety of lexical information in a uniform way. The use of weighted transducers in particular has the attractive property that the model, as it stands, can be straightforwardly interfaced to other modules of a larger speech or natural language system: presumably one does not want to segment Chinese text for its own sake but instead with a larger purpose in mind. As described in Sproat (1995), the Chinese segmenter presented here fits directly into the context of a broader finite-state model of text analysis for speech synthesis. Furthermore, by inverting the transducer so that it maps from phonemic transcriptions to hanzi sequences, one can apply the segmenter to other problems, such as speech recognition (Pereira, Riley, and Sproat 1994). Since the transducers are built from human-readable descriptions using a lexical toolkit (Sproat 1995), the system is easily maintained and extended. While size of the resulting transducers may seem daunting--the segmenter described here, as it is used in the Bell Labs Mandarin TTS system has about 32,000 states and 209,000 arcs--recent work on minimization of weighted machines and transducers (cf.","21 In Chinese, numerals and demonstratives cannot modify nouns directly, and must be accompanied by a classifier. The particular classifier used depends upon the noun. 401 Computational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 3 Mohri [1995]) shows promise for improving this situation. The model described here thus demonstrates great potential for use in widespread applications. This flexibility, along with the simplicity of implementation and expansion, makes this framework an attractive base for continued research.
