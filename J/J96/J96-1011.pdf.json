The paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must be written in English. Contact the editor regarding the possibility of electronic submission. Submissions may be made in any of the following categories: Papers: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in computational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The length of a paper depends on its content, but it is suggested that manuscripts be limited to forty double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of thirty journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed, being read by at least two members of the editorial board and usually by an additional expert in the particular subject area. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the author certifies the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publication to another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Editor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the case of a \"work for hire,\" by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978 U.S. Copyright law. Letters to the Editor: This category includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these contributions for inclusion. Five copies of papers or three copies of letters should be sent to: Julia Hirschberg, CL Editor AT&T Research 600 Mountain Avenue, 2C-409 Murray Hill, NJ 07974, USA (+1 908) 582-7496; acl@research.att.com Squibs and Discussions: This category includes short articles reporting technical results, discussions of results, algorithms, or new computational linguistic data or tools of interest to the journal readership. Submissions should generally not exceed eight double-spaced pages and should be submitted to: Pierre Isabelle, CL Squibs and Discussions Editor CWARC Communications Canada 1575 Chomedey Boulevard Laval, Quebec, CANADA H7V 2X2 (+1 514) 973-5801; isabelle@citi.doc.ca Book Section: Anyone interested in reviewing a book, or in suggesting a book for review, should contact the Book Review Editor; publishers may also submit copies of books for review directly to: Graeme Hirst, CL Book Review Editor University of Toronto Department of Computer Science Toronto, CANADA M5S 1A4 (+1 416) 978-8747; gh@cs.toronto.edu The FINITE STRING: Send (a) summaries of research in progress -- of particular interest would be perspectives on the activities at a particular institution; (b) announcements of meetings of potential interest to the membership; and (c) personal notes (e.g., honors, moving, changes in status) to The FINITE STRING Editor. Time-sensitive material should be received by the first day of the second month of each quarter to appear in the next issue.

A European chapter was established in 1982. Besides publishing Computational Linguistics, the ACL holds international meetings (annually in North America, biennially in Europe) where the state-of-the-art in natural language processing research and development is presented. Recently, special interest groups on the Mathematics of Language, the Lexicon, Parsing, Generation, Computational Phonology, and Multimedia Language Processing have been formed; others are likely to be added.
