The proposal builds on work in deterministic parsing, relating it to grammar-based accounts of human syntactic preferences and garden-path behavior. Other grammar-based approaches have attempted to derive performance data from the content of particular syntactic constraints and how well they are satisfied on-line. Gorrell instead proposes that the significant factor for human processing is the distinction between different types of structural information that are brought to bear in syntactic analysis. The classification of information types determines a natural modularization of the human parser, which is argued to account for the behavioral properties observed. The approach has potential interest for computational linguists who are interested in the grammatical underpinnings of natural language understanding systems, and in the problem of deriving the best parse for an ambiguous utterance. In particular, issues of information encapsulation and its consequences for incremental interpretation are of great importance for cognitive models of language as well as practical NLU systems. Unfortunately, computational linguists are likely to be less than satisfied by the lack of precision in Gorrell's specification of his model, and by the absence of a firm computational foundation for his claims.","The focus of Gorrell's proposal is the division of structural information into primary and secondary relations. The primary relations are the primitives that are necessary to a specification of the parse-tree structure (i.e., dominance and precedence). The secondary relations are grammatical concepts that are defined in terms of the resulting tree (e.g., c-command and government). The distinction is reflected in the processing of the two types of information: Primary relations are asserted by a structure-building module, and secondary relations are evaluated within the resulting tree by a separate structure interpreter. Given the distinction between building a structure and verifying relations within that structure, Gorrell argues for a new kind of determinism in parsing, called structural determinism, which applies only to the structure-building module. The constraints on the operation of the structure builder underlie Gorrell's account of human disambiguation.","The book is thorough in its review of Government-Binding theory (the grammatical framework assumed by Gorrell) and of GB-based models of human parsing. Other aspects of the book are less complete, leav-ing a number of questions unanswered. For example, given that assertions of primitive relations cannot be retracted in normal parsing, the mechanism for determining which assertions to make is of critical importance. Gorrell proposes that the structure-building module is driven to \"[attempt] incrementally to satisfy principles of grammar.\" As stated, this entails that the structure builder needs to judge the sarisfiability of syntactic constraints in order to make assertions about the parse-tree structure. However, evaluat-ing the structural conditions under which those constraints are satisfied is the purview of the structural interpreter, for which it in turns needs the assertions about the basic tree structure. The strict modularization of the proposed model is the foundation of Gorrell's proposal, but it is not clear how the division can be maintained, given that the operation of each module depends on informarion provided by the other.","The book focuses on a topic in psycholinguistics that should be of great importance in building parsers that can mimic human behavior and respond to human expectations. However, the relevance of the particular proposal for computational linguists is less established, given the loose development of the specific components of the model. Computational linguists who model human sentence-processing behavior will find an interesting discussion of some familiar issues in the field (such as form- versus content-based preference strategies, and modularity). The impact of the central proposal awaits a more thorough and precise development of the details of the model.--Suzanne Stevenson, Rutgers University 577 Computational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 4 Linguistics and Computation Jennifer Cole, Georgia M.

The broad theme of the workshop was Computational Linguistics and the Foundations of Linguistic Theory, and its purpose was to provide a forum in which computational linguists, syntacticians, morphologists, and phonologists could come together and discuss important issues of common interest.","The areas of linguistic research represented in this volume are diverse, yet they are united under the notion that the principles of grammatical well-formedness and the principles of language processing are interdependent .... The fact that many of the papers included here span several areas within linguistic theory underscores the importance of communication between researchers in diverse areas.\"--From the preface","The contents of the volume are as follows:","\"Formal devices for linguistic generalizations: West Germanic word order in LFG\" by Annie Zaenen and Ronald M.
