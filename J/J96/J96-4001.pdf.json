Harald Baayen* Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics The number of different words expected on the basis of the urn model to appear in, for example, the first half of a text, is known to overestimate the observed number of different words. This paper examines the source of this overestimation bias. It is shown that this bias does not arise due to sentence-bound syntactic constraints, but that it is a direct consequence of topic cohesion in discourse. The nonrandom, clustered appearance of lexically specialized words, often the key words of the text, explains the main trends in the overestimation bias both quantitatively and qualitatively. The effects of nonrandomness are so strong that they introduce an overestimation bias in distributions of units derived from words, such as syllables and digrams. Nonrandom word usage also affects the accuracy of the Good-Turing frequency estimates which,for the lowest frequencies, reveal a strong underestimation bias. A heuristic adjusted frequency estimate is proposed that, at least for novel-sized texts, is considerably more accurate. 1. Introduction When reading through a text, word token by word token, the number of different word types encountered increases, quickly at first, and ever more slowly as one progresses through the text. The number of different word types encountered after reading N tokens, the vocabulary size V(N), is a function of N. Analytical expressions for V(N) based on the urn model are available. A classic problem in word frequency studies is, however, that these analytical expressions tend to overestimate the observed vocabulary size, irrespective of whether these expressions are nonparametric (Good 1953; Good and Toulmin 1956; Muller 1979; Brunet 1978) or parametric (Sichel 1986; Khmaladze and Chitashvili 1989; Chitashvili and Baayen 1993) in nature.","Although the theoretical or expected vocabulary size E[V(N)] generally is of the same order of magnitude as the observed vocabulary size, the lack of precision one observes time and again casts serious doubt on the reliability of a number of measures in word frequency statistics. For instance, Baayen (1989, 1992) and Baayen and Renouf (1996) exploit the Good-Turing estimate for the probability of sampling unseen types (Good 1953) to develop measures for the degree of productivity of affixes, Baayen and Sproat (to appear) apply this Good-Turing estimate to obtain enhanced estimates of lexical priors for unseen words, and the Good-Turing estimates also play an important role for estimating population probabilities (Church and Gale 1991). If a simple random variable such as the vocabulary size reveals consistent and significant deviation from its expectation, the accuracy of the Good-Turing estimates is also called into question. The aim of this paper is to understand why this deviation between the- * Wundtlaan 1, 6525 XD Nijmegen, The Netherlands.

In Section 2, I introduce some basic notation and the expressions for the growth curve of the vocabulary with which we will be concerned throughout, including a model proposed by Hubert and Labbe (1988), which, by introducing a smoothing parameter, leads to much-improved fits. Unfortunately, this model is based on a series of unrealistic simplifications, and cannot serve as an explanation for the divergence between the observed and expected vocabulary size. In Section 3, therefore, I consider a number of possible sources for the misfit in greater detail: nonrandomness at the sentence level due to syntactic structure, nonrandomness due to the discourse structure of the text as a whole, and nonrandomness due to thematic cohesion in restricted sequences of sentences (paragraphs). Section 4 traces the implications of the results obtained for distributions of units derived from words, such as syllables and digrams, and examines the accuracy of the Good-Turing frequency estimates. A list of symbols is provided at the end of the paper. 2.

Thus the horizontal axis can be viewed as displaying the \"text time\" measured in word tokens. The vertical axis of the left-hand panels shows the number of observed word types (dotted line) and the number of types predicted by the model (solid line) obtained using (1). These panels reveal that the expected vocabulary size overestimates the observed vocabulary size for almost all of the 40 equidistant measurement points. To the eye, the overestimation seems fairly small. Nevertheless, in absolute terms the expectation may be several hundreds of types too high, and may run up to 5% of the total vocabulary size. 1 The type definition I have used throughout is based on the orthographic word form: house and houses are counted as two different types, houses and houses as two tokens of the same type. No lemmatization has been attempted, first, because the probabilistic aspects of the problem considered here are not affected by whether or not lemmatization is carried out, and second, because it is of interest to ascertain how much information can be extracted from texts with minimal preprocessing. 2 These texts were obtained by anonymous ftp from the Project Gutenberg at obi.std.com.

For the first 20 measurement points, the instances for which E[V(N)] diverges significantly from V(N) are shown in bold. 3 Clearly, the divergence is significant for almost all of the first 20 measurement points. This suggests informally that the discrepancy between E[V(N)] and V(N) is significant over a wide range of sample sizes. 2.1 The Model Proposed by Hubert and Labbe The problem of the systematic estimation error of E[V(N)] has been pointed out by Muller (1979) and Brunet (1978), who hypothesize that lexical specialization is at issue. In any text, there are words the use of which is mainly or even exclusively restricted to a given subsection of that text. Such locally concentrated clusters of words are at odds with the randomness assumption underlying the derivation of (1), and may be the cause of the divergence illustrated in Figure 1. Following this line of reasoning, Hubert and Labbe (1988) propose a model according to which (1) should be modified 3 Since the expression for an estimate of the variance of V(N) figuring in the Z-scores used here requires knowledge of E[V(2N)], the significance of the divergence for the second 20 measurement points is not available. For technical details, see Chitashvili and Baayen (1993). 457 Computational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 4 as follows (see the appendix for further details): M (1 p)V- (1 - p) ~V(N,f) 1 - .

Given K different text sizes for which the observed and expected vocabulary sizes are known, p can be estimated by minimizing the mean squared error (MSE)","K V - ~k=l((Mk) E[V(Mk)]) 2 K (3) or the chi-square statistic","K (V(Mk) - E[V(Mk)]) 2 ~ ~-~-~-~ (4) k=l (conveniently ignoring that the variance of V(M) increases with M, see Chitashvili and Baayen [1993]). For Alice in Wonderland, minimalization of (4) for K = 40 leads to p = 0.16, and according to this rough estimate of goodness-of-fit the revised model fits the data very well indeed (X~39) 7- 3.58, p > 0.5). For Moby Dick, however, the chi-squared statistic suggests a significant difference between the observed and expected vocabulary sizes (X~39) = 172.93,p < 0.001), even though the value of the p parameter (0.12) leads to a fit that is much improved with respect to the unadjusted growth curve (X~39) = 730.47). Closer inspection of the error pattern of the adjusted estimate reveals the source of the misfit: for the first 12 measurement points, the observed vocabulary size is consistently overestimated. From the 14th observation onwards, the Hubert-Labbe model consistently underestimates the real vocabulary size. Apparently, the development of the vocabulary in Moby Dick can be modeled globally, but local fluctuations introducing additional points of inflection into the growth curve are outside its scope--a more detailed study of the development of lexical specialization in the narrative is required if the appearance of these points of inflection are to be understood.","In spite of this deficiency, the Hubert-Labbe curve appears to be an optimal smoother, and this suggests that the value obtained for the coefficient of vocabulary partition p is a fairly reliable estimate of the extent to which a text is characterized by lexical specialization. In this light, the evaluation by Holmes (1994), who suggests that p might be a useful discriminant for authorship attribution studies, is understandable. Unfortunately, the assumptions underlying (2) are overly simplistic, and seriously call into question the reliability of p as a measure of lexical specialization, and the same holds for the explanatory value of this model for the inaccuracy of E[V(N)]. 2.2 Problems with the Hubert and Labbe Model One highly questionable simplification underlying the derivation of (2) spelled out in the appendix is that specialized words are assumed to occur in a single text slice only. Consider Figure 2, which plots the number of times Ahab appears in 40 successive, equally sized text slices that jointly constitute the full text of Moby Dick. The dotted line reveals the main developmental pattern (time-series smoothing using running medians). Even though Ahab is one of the main characters in Moby Dick, and even though his name certainly belongs to the specialized vocabulary of the novel, Ahab is 458 Baayen Lexical Specialization p-o /... â€¢ / ! â€¢"]},{"title":"/ /","paragraphs":["/"]},{"title":"!. /","paragraphs":["i .~.....--, ............ , /' /. / ./ /\" /","â€¢ f â€¢ ."]},{"title":"â€¢\"\"\";....'...~...'\"\".\"\"\" â€¢ text slice","paragraphs":["i\" :/ o. 6 lb 20 d0 40 Figure 2 Nonrandom word usage illustrated for Ahab in Moby Dick.

The dotted line represents a time-series smoother using running medians (Tukey 1977). not mentioned by name in one text slice only, as the Hubert-Labbe model would have. What we find is that he is not mentioned at all in the first five text slices. Following this we observe a series of text slices in which he appears frequently. These are in turn succeeded by slices in which Ahab is hardly mentioned, but he reappears in the last part of the book, and as the book draws to its dramatic close, the frequency of Ahab increases to its maximum. This is an illustration of what Indefrey and Baayen (1994) refer to as inter-textual cohesion: the word Ahab enjoys specialized use, but it occurs in a series of subtexts within the novel as a whole, contributing to its overall cohesion. Within text slices where Ahab is frequently mentioned, the intra-textual cohesion may similarly be strengthened. For instance, Ahab appears to be a specialized word in text slice 23, but he is mentioned only in passing in text slice 25. His appearance in the two text slices strengthens the intertextual cohesion of the whole novel, but it is only the intra-textual cohesion of slice 23 that is raised. The presence of inter-textual cohesion in addition to intra-textual cohesion and the concomitant phenomenon of global lexical specialization suggest that in order to understand the discrepancy between V(N) and its expectation, a more fine-grained approach is required.","A second question concerns how lexical specialization affects the empirical growth curve of the vocabulary. Inspection of plots such as those presented in Figure 1 for Alice in Wonderland suggests that the effects of lexical specialization appear in the central sections of the text, as it is there that the largest differences between the expected and the observed vocabulary are to be observed--differences that are highly penalized by the MSE and chi-squared techniques used to estimate the proportion of specialized words in the vocabulary. Unfortunately, the central sections are not necessarily the ones characterized by the highest degree of lexical specialization. To see this, consider Figure 3, which plots the difference between the expected number of new types using 459 Computational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 4 0 \"~1\" \" 0 Q o o","6 lb 2'0 do 4'0 k Figure 3 Error scores for the influx of new types in Alice in Wonderland.

(1) and the observed number of new types for the successive text slices of Alice in Wonderland. More precisely, for each text slice k, k = 1 ..... 40, we calculate the progressive difference error scores D(k), k = 1... 40: D(k) = {E[V(Mk)] - E[V(Mk_I)]} - {V(Mk) - V(Mk_,)}."]},{"title":"(5)","paragraphs":["Note that in addition to positive difference scores, which should be present given that E[V(Mk)] > V(Mk) for most, or, as in Alice in Wonderland, for all values of k, we also have negative difference scores. Text slices containing more types than expected under chance conditions are necessarily present given the existence of text slices k for which E[V(Mk)] - V(Mk) > 0: the total number of types accumulated over the 40 text slices has to sum up to V(N). Figure 3 shows that the expected numbers of new word types are overestimated for the initial part of the novel, that the theoretical estimates are fairly reliable for the middle section of the novel, while the final chapters show a slightly greater increase in the number of new types than expected under chance conditions. If lexical specialization affects the influx of new types, its effects appear not in the central sections of the novel as suggested by Figure 1, but rather in the beginning and perhaps at the end. This finding seriously questions the appropriateness of using the growth curve of the vocabulary for deriving a measure of lexical specialization.","A third question arises with respect to how one's measure of lexical concentration is affected by the number of text slices K. In Hubert and Labbe's model, the optimal value of the p parameter is independent of the number of text slices K for not-too-small K (K > 10). Since the expected growth curve and the observed growth curve are completely fixed and independent of K--the former is fully determined by the fre-460 Baayen Lexical Specialization quency spectrum of the complete text, the latter is determined by the text itself--the choice of K influences only the number of points at which the divergence between the two curves is measured. Increasing the number of measurement points increases the degrees of freedom along with the deviance, and the optimal value of the p parameter remains virtually unchanged. But is this a desirable property for a measure of lexical specialization? Even without taking the effects of inter-textual cohesion into account, and concentrating solely on local specialization and intra-textual cohesion, formulating lexical specialization in terms of concentration at a particular point in the text is unrealistic: it is absurd to assume that all tokens of a specialized word appear in one chunk without any other intervening words. A more realistic definition of (local) lexical specialization is the concentration of the tokens of a given word within a particular text slice. In such an approach, however, the size of the text slice is of crucial importance. A word appearing only in the first half of a book enjoys some specialized use, but to a far lesser extent than a word with the same frequency that occurs in the first half of the first chapter only. In other words, an approach to lexical specialization in terms of concentration of use is incomplete without a specification of the unit of concentration itself. 3. Sources of Nonrandomness To avoid these problems, I will now sketch a somewhat more fine-grained approach to understanding why V(N) and its expectation diverge, adopting Hubert and Labbe's central insight that lexical specialization can be modeled in terms of local concentration. Consider again the potential sources for violation of the randomness assumption underlying the derivation of E[V(N)]. At least three possibilities suggest themselves: syntactic constraints on word usage within sentences, global discourse organization, and local repetition. I will consider these possibilities in turn. 3.1 Syntactic Constraints Syntactic constraints at the level of the sentence introduce many restrictions on the occurrence of words. For instance, in normal written English, following the determiner the the appearance of a second instance of the same determiner (as in this sentence), is extremely unlikely. According to the urn model, however, such a sequence is likely to occur once every 278 words (the relative frequency of the in English is approximately 0.06), say once every two pages. This is not what we normally find. Clearly, syntax imposes severe constraints on the occurrence of words. Does this imply that the urn model is wrong? For individual sentences, the answer is undoubtedly yes. But for more global textual properties such as vocabulary size, a motivated answer is less easy to give. According to Herdan (1960, 40), reacting to Halle's criticism of the urn model as a realistic model for language, there is no problem, since statistics is concerned with form, not content) Whatever the force of this argument may be, Figure 1 demonstrates clearly that the urn model lacks precision for our data.","In order to ascertain the potential relevance of syntactic constraints referred to by Halle, we may proceed as follows: If sentence-level syntax underlies the misfit between the observed and the expected vocabulary size, then this misfit should remain visible for randomized versions of the text in which the sentences have been left unchanged, but in which the order of the sentences has been permuted. If the misfit disappears, 4 M. Halle, \"In defence of the number two,\" in Studies Presented to J. Whatmough, The Hague, 1957, quoted in Herdan, 1960, page 40. 461 Computational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 4 we know that constraints the domain of which are restricted to the sentence can be ruled out.","The results of this randomization test applied to"]},{"title":"Alice in Wonderland, Moby Dick,","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"Max Havelaar","paragraphs":["are shown in the right-hand panels of Figure 1 by means of \"+\" symbols.

The nonrandomness at the level of sentence structure does not influence the expected vocabulary size. As a global text characteristic, it is probably insensitive to the strictly local constraints imposed by syntax. Apparently, it is the sequential order in which sentences actually appear that crucially determines the bias of our theoretical estimates. There are at least two domains where this sequential order might be relevant: the global domain of the discourse structure of the text as a whole, and the more local domain of relatively small sequences of sentences sharing a particular topic.","To explore these two potential explanatory domains in detail, we need a method for linking topical discourse structure and local topic continuity with word usage.

These Z-scores can then be used to ascertaIn which words are significantly underdispersed in that they occur in significantly too few text slices given the urn model (cf. Baayen, 1996). Unfortunately, dispersions deviate substantially from normality, so that Z-scores remain somewhat impressionistic. I have therefore used a randomization test to ascertain which words are significantly underdispersed.","The randomization test proceeded as follows: The sequence of words of a text was randomized 1,000 times.

The residuals do not reveal any significant trend (F(1, 38) < 1), which suggests that the underdispersed vocabulary is indeed responsible for the main trend in the progressive difference scores D(k) of the vocabulary and hence for the divergence between E[V(N)] and V(N). In the next section, I will argue that intra-textual cohesion is in large part responsible for the general downward curvature of DU(k). In what follows, I will first present an attempt to understand the differences in the error scores E[V(N)] - V(N) shown in Figure 1 as a function of differences in the use of key words at the discourse level.","In Alice in Wonderland, key words are relatively rare in the initial text slices. As a result, these text slices reveal fewer types than expected under chance conditions. Consequently, V(N) is smaller than E[V(N)]. For increasing k, as shown in the upper right panel of Figure 1, the divergence between V(N) and its expectation first increaseswthe initial text slices contain the lowest numbers of underdispersed types and tokens--and then decreases as more and more underdispersed words appear. Thus the semi-circular shape of the error scores E[V(N)] - V(N) shown in Figure 1 is a direct consequence of the topical structure at discourse level of Alice in Wonderland.","The error scores E[V(N)] - V(N) for Moby Dick and Max Havelaar shown in Figure 1 reveal a different developmental profile. In these novels, the maximal divergence appears early on in the text, after which the divergence decreases until, just before the end, V(N) becomes even slightly larger than its expectation. Is it possible to understand this qualitatively different pattern in terms of the discourse structure of these novels? First, consider Moby Dick. A series of diagnostic plots is shown in Figure 5.

I have argued that a detailed analysis of the distribution of key word tokens and types may shed some light on why the theoretical vocabulary size sometimes overestimates and sometimes underestimates the observed vocabulary size. We are left with the question of to what extent repeated use of words within relatively short sequences of sentences, henceforth for ease of reference paragraphs, affects the accuracy of E[V(N)]. I therefore carried out two additional analyses, one using five issues of the Dutch newspaper Trouw, and one using the random samples of the Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf available in the Uit den Boogaart (1975) corpus. For both texts, no overall topical discourse structure is at issue, so that we can obtain a better view of the effects of intra-textual cohesion by itself.","For each newspaper, the available texts were brought together in one large corpus, preserving chronological order. Each corpus was divided into 40 equally large text slices. The upper left panel of Figure 7 shows that in the consecutive issues of Trouw (March 1994) the expected vocabulary size differs significantly from the observed vocabulary size for all of the first 20 measurement points, the domain for which significance can be ascertained (see footnote 3).

Since intra-textual cohesion is also present in the texts of novels, we may conclude that the overestimation bias in novels is determined by a combination of intra-textual and inter-textual cohesion. 4. Implications We have seen that intra-textual and inter-textual cohesion lead to a significant difference between the expected and observed vocabulary size for a wide range of sample sizes. This section addresses two additional questions. First, to what extent does the nonrandomness of word occurrences affect distributions of units selected or derived from words? Second, how does cohesive word usage affect the Good-Turing frequency estimates? 4.1 Word-derived Units First consider the effect of nonrandomness on the frequency distributions of morphological categories. The upper panels of Figure 8 plot the difference between the expected and observed vocabulary size for the morphological category of words with 469 Computational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 4 -heid in 'Max Havelaar' -heid in Trouw L,3 Z > 1.13 z > LU O ,/\"'\"ix. /\\ /'\\"]},{"title":"\\/\\,'..","paragraphs":[",, .","\\ \\"]},{"title":"\\","paragraphs":["/ â€¢",". .- \"'.\\/\" â€¢"]},{"title":"/\\ 10 20","paragraphs":["k","30 40 5 10 15 20 k Digraphs in 'Alice in Wonderland' Syllables in Trouw"]},{"title":">8","paragraphs":["i o3"]},{"title":"z~","paragraphs":["LU Q o \\,\"~","\\ ,,'.. o o,1 o Lo"]},{"title":"/ ;\"\",","paragraphs":[",.\"\\., r' \\., .,,\"","0 10 20 30 40 0 10 20 k k 30 40 Figure 8 Diagnostic plots for affixes, syllables, and digraphsâ€¢ The difference between the expected and observed vocabulary size for the morphological category of words with the Dutch suffix -heid '-ness' in Max Havelaar (upper left) and in Trouw (upper right), for syllables in Trouw (lower left), and for digraphs in Alice in Wonderlandâ€¢ Significant differences are shown in bold for the first half of the tokensâ€¢ the Dutch suffix -heid, which, like -ness in English, is used to coin abstract nouns from adjectives (e.g., snelheid, 'speed', from snel, 'quick'). The plots are based on samples consisting of all and only those words occurring in Max Havelaar (upper left) and Trouw (upper right) that belong to the morphological category of -heid, ignoring all other words, and preserving their order of appearance in the original texts. The sample of -heid words in Max Havelaar consisted of 640 tokens representing 260 types, of which 146 hapax legomena. From Trouw, 1145 tokens representing 394 types were extracted, among which 246 hapax legomena.","In Max Havelaar, a number of words in -heid, such as waarheid 'truth' and vrijheid 'freedom', are underdispersed key words. Not surprisingly, this affects the growth curve of -heid itself. For small values of k, we observe a significant divergence between E[V(N)] and V(N). In the newspaper Trouw, where -heid words do not play a central role in an overall discourse, no significant divergence emerges. Nevertheless, we again observe a consistent trend for the expected vocabulary size to overestimate the actual vocabulary size.","Figure 8 also plots the development of the vocabulary of syllables in Trouw (bottom left), and the development of the vocabulary of digraphs in Alice in Wonderland (bottom right). The \"texts\" of syllables and digraphs preserve the linear order of the texts from which they were derived. For both digraphs (80,870 tokens representing 398 types, of which 30 hapax legomena) and syllables (470,520 tokens, 6,748 types, 470 Baayen Lexical Specialization and 1,909 hapax legomena), Figure 8 reveals significant deviation in the first half of both texts. This suggests that the nonrandomness observed for words carries over to word-based units such as digraphs and syllables."]},{"title":"4.2 Accuracy of Good-Turing Estimates","paragraphs":["Samples of words generally contain--often small--subsets of all the different types available in the population.

For the frequencies of types occurring at least once in the sample, the average of the sample and Good-Turing adjusted frequencies is a useful heuristic. For estimates of the probability of unseen types, the sample and Good-Turing estimates provide approximate upper and lower bounds. 5. Discussion Words do not occur randomly in texts. This simple fact is difficult to take into account in statistical models of word frequency distributions. Hence, it is often ignored, in the hope that violations of the randomness assumption will not seriously affect the accuracy of quantitative measures and estimates.","The goal of this paper has been to explore in detail the consequences of intra-474 Baayen Lexical Specialization 00 O. d r~ o r~ c5 O"]},{"title":"o 6 Figure 10 1 1'0 2'o 30 4'0","paragraphs":["f Frequency class probability mass estimates for the first 40 frequency ranks in a sample of M = 132,680 of the Trouw data.

Further analyses of subsets of derived words, syllables, and digrams showed that the overestimation bias reappears in units derived from words when these words occur in normal, cohesive text.","The overestimation bias disappears when the order of the sentences is randomized. This indicates that the bias should not be attributed to syntactic and semantic constraints on word usage operating within the sentence. Instead, the bias arises due to intra-textual and inter-textual cohesion. In sequences of sentences, words are more likely to be reused than expected under chance conditions. Coherent discourse requires local topic continuity. This intra-textual cohesion gives rise to a substantial part of the overestimation bias, a bias that leads to significant deviations even when small text fragments of some 75 words are selected randomly from a newspaper.","In addition to intra-textual cohesion, there are words that contribute to the cohe-475 Computational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 4 sion of the discourse as a whole. Detailed analyses of how these key words appear over sampling time in the novels reveal marked differences in their distributions. These differences in turn shed light on the details of the differences in the patterns of estimation errors E[V(N)] - V(N) that characterize the texts. The progressive difference scores of the key words, the deviation scores for the expected and observed numbers of new types appearing in the successive text slices, reveal a pattern that is highly similar to the same scores for the vocabulary as a whole, both qualitatively and quantitatively. This supports the hypothesis that the key words are primarily responsible for the deviation of the expected vocabulary size from its expectation.","Nonrandomness in word usage not only introduces a bias with respect to the expected vocabulary size--overestimation when interpolating and underestimation when extrapolating, it also affects the accuracy of the Good-Turing estimates. To correct for an overestimation bias, Good (1953) introduced adjusted estimates, building on the assumption that word usage is to all practical purposes random. These adjusted estimates, however, appear to overshoot their mark for continuous text in that they underestimate the population relative frequencies to roughly the same extent that the unadjusted probabilities lead to overestimation, especially for the lowest frequencies. Again, the effect of inter-textual and intra-textual cohesion manifests itself. Once used, words tend to be used again, and this leads to a somewhat higher relative population frequency than expected. The other side of the same coin is that Good's estimate for the probability mass of unseen types, 79(N), is an upper bound. The words that have already been used have a raised probability of being used again. Hence, the probability for unseen types to appear is lowered.","There are two major ways to deal with the effects of nonrandomness in word usage on the accuracy of statistical estimates. First, by randomly sampling individual sentences instead of sequences of sentences, the effects of intra-textual and inter-textual cohesion will be largely eliminated. With the increasingly large corpora that are becoming available at present, enhanced sampling methods should pose no serious problem. For literary studies, however, the discourse structure of a text is part and parcel of the object of study itself. Here, the use of the heuristically adjusted estimates proposed in Section 4.2 may prove to be useful.","Finally, the investigation of the distribution of key words may turn out to be a useful tool for investigating the structure of literary texts, a tool that may lead to an improved understanding of the role of lexical specialization in shaping the quantitative developmental structure of the vocabulary."]},{"title":"Appendix","paragraphs":["Equation (1) can be derived as follows; see Good 1953; Good and Toulmin 1956; Kalinin 1965: Let f(i,M) denote the frequency of ~i in a sample of M tokens (M < N), and define","1 iff(i,M) = m (23) Xi -- 0 otherwise.
