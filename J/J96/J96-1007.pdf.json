Introduction","paragraphs":["The truth-conditional approach to semantics is based on the assumption that conveying information about the world is a central part of what language is about, and therefore the judgments of human subjects as to whether sentences are true or false of a given situation are a fundamental source of empirical data about the meaning of natural language sentences. This approach has proved remarkably successful: speakers' intuitions about the truth conditions of sentences have given us the closest approximation(s) to a mathematical theory of sentence meaning we have at the moment. Yet many find the assumption on which truth-conditional semantics rests controversial.

Pinkal intentionally leaves open the possibility of borderline cases, which cannot be properly classified as either ambiguous or vague.","Having motivated the precisification approach to indefiniteness in chapters 3 and 4 on intuitive grounds, Pinkal's next step is to present in the next two chapters an argument for the approach on logical grounds. Building on work by Fine (1975) and 141 Computational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 1 Kamp (1975, 1981a), Pinkal demonstrates how the notion of precisification can be implemented by revising the supervaluation technique, 1 and how this formulation leads to a logic--Precisification Logic--that not only allows him to formalize the distinctions introduced in Chapter 4, but is \"conservative,\" by which he means that all the classical tautologies and entailment relations are retained. On the contrary, formalizations of indefiniteness that rely on the introduction of a third value either result in the loss of tautologies that one would want to preserve, or achieve conservativity at the expense of very unintuitive definitions of the truth conditions of the basic connectives. Perhaps the most surprising among Pinkal's claims is that natural language is not truth-functional, by which he means that the value assigned to an expression does not depend only on the values assigned to its subexpressions. Pinkal contrasts statements such as John is either tall or not tall, which intuitively seem to be true even if the statement John is tall is indefinite, with statements such as John is tall or blond, to which we want to accord the status of \"indefinite\" when both disjuncts are. One of the most convincing arguments in favor of Pinkal's Precisification Logic is that it is in accord with our intuitions on these cases, unlike most logics based on three (or more) truth values.","In the last two chapters of the book, the question of vagueness is taken up again, in the light of problems raised by measure statements and by the sorites paradox. Pinkal concludes that a more radical approach than Precisification Logic is called for, and develops a new formalization of precisification in which an increase in precision corresponds to a context change in the sense of Kamp (1981b). 4. General comments Why should a computational linguist read this book? One reason is that it is a very accessible introduction to the literature on vagueness, and an accessible compendium of many useful techniques in formal semantics. Computational linguists who believe that truth conditions have to do with the meaning of natural language expressions--and this reviewer agrees with Pinkal that at the moment there is no other way of expressing mathematical generalizations about meaning--should, in addition, find the question of how logic relates to the \"natural world\" extremely important. As for computational linguists who dismiss logic on the grounds that it depends on implausible assumptions, they may discover in Pinkal's book that such assumptions can be relaxed in various ways.","The most convincing part of Pinkal's theory is his account of vagueness. The supervaluation-based approach, as revised in the last chapters, is extremely attractive because it is a way to \"tame\" vagueness that does not require us to abandon the basic laws of logic entirely, and can be built into essentially any semantic theory. The tools introduced in Precisification Logic to characterize precise expressions and relative expressions provide a way of specifying properties of lexical items not usually captured by existing lexica.","I found the arguments supporting the connection between ambiguity and vagueness less convincing. I have no problems with Pinkal's claim that both ambiguity and vagueness have to do with precisification in a loose sense (rather than with, say, the number of possible readings that an expression may have). However, it's by no means clear that the same sort of precisification is involved in both cases. My intuitions about the distinction between ambiguity and vagueness could be rephrased 1 A supervaluation is a partial function that assigns a value to a logical expression a on the basis of the values assigned to a by a set of classical interpretations. If all of these interpretations agree on a value for a, the supervaluation also assigns to a that value; otherwise, the function is not defined. 142 Book Reviews using Pinkal's terminology as follows: Vagueness has to do with the relation between language and the world; hence, the sense of precisification that we want to use for this form of indefiniteness is \"precisification with respect to the world,\" and Pinkal's treatment neatly captures this notion. The sense of precisification that seems to matter for ambiguity, instead, appears to be meta-theoretic: what gets precisified is not the content of what the speaker said, but what the hearer thinks the speaker said. This form of precisification seems to involve an augmentation of the context in the sense of \"what the speaker intended.\" Prima facie, these intuitions would be captured most accurately by a theory in which different forms of precisification are handled in different ways. Pinkal does not provide a convincing argument to the contrary; his claim that vagueness and ambiguity are but extremes of a continuum relies almost entirely on his observation that ambiguity and vagueness cannot be distinguished by simply saying that ambiguous statements have a finite number of readings, whereas vague statements have an infinite number of them--which is probably correct, but from which his conclusion doesn't follow. There are similar problems with some of the other proposals that Pinkal introduces in chapter 4, such as his characterization of the distinction between polysemy and homonymy. His suggestion doesn't reflect the traditional descriptive characterization as formulated by, say, Lyons (1977), and Pinkal's argument in favor of his alternative view is not entirely convincing.","A computational linguist hoping to find in Logic and Lexicon new ideas about disambiguation will be disappointed. Although the disambiguation imperative provides an intriguing characterization of the semantics of a class of ambiguous expressions in terms of their disambiguation properties, and although the notion of context update plays an important role in the last chapter, the question of which forms of reasoning underlie disambiguation, and whether the logic Pinkal proposes is appropriate for this task, is never raised.","This said, this book fills such a gap in the literature, and Pinkal's discussion is so thorough, that anybody who is interested in either ambiguity or vagueness is likely to benefit from it.","References","Alshawi, Hiyan and Crouch, Richard.
