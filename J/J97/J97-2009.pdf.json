Sutcliffe, Heinz-Detlev Koch and Annette McElligott (-)<7~ Amsterdam/Atlanta, GA 1996. 277,XII pp. ~x0~ (Language and Computers 17) ISBN: 90-420-0114-3 Bound Hfl. 130,-/US-$ 81.- ISBN: 90-420-0102-X Paper Hfl. 45,-/US-$ 28.- The task of language engineering is to develop the technology for building computer systems which can perform useful linguistic tasks such as machine assisted translation, text retrieval, message classification and document summarisation. Such systems often require the use of a parser which can extract specific types of grammatical data from pre-defined classes of input text. There are many parsers already available for use in language engineering systems. However, many different linguistic formalisms and parsing algorithms are employed. Grammatical coverage varies, as does the nature of the syntactic information extracted. Direct comparison between systems is difficult because each is likely to have been evaluated using different test criteria. In this volume, eight different parsers are applied to the same task, that of analysing a set of sentences derived from software instruction manuals. Each parser is presented in a separate chapter. Evaluation of performance is carried out using a standard set of criteria with the results being presented in a set of tables which have the same format for each system. Three additional chapters provide further analysis of the results as well as discussing possible approaches to the standardisation of parse tree data. Five parse trees are provided for each system in an appendix, allowing further direct comparison between systems by the reader. The book will be of interest to students, researchers and practitioners in the areas of computational linguistics, computer science, information retrieval, language engineering, linguistics and machine assisted translation.

The Joumal of Intelligent Information Systems is a technical journal that focuses on the creation of information systems that exhibit intelligent behavior and embody intelligence in their reasoning and management processes. Increasingly, knowledge-directed inference processes are being used to produce information from the data contained in large shared databases. The goal of the Joumal of Intelligent Information Systems is to provide a forum for those interested in making information systems intelligent in which they can publish their original research and development results. For us, intelligence may be manifested in a user interface which has knowledge of user profiles and preferences and can use this knowledge to foster more productive human-computer interactions; intelligence may be embodied in the loosely or tightly-coupled architectures for integrating knowledge-based systems with database systems; and intelligence may reside in query optimization algorithms that incorporate semantic integrity constraints, heuristics as well as database statistics. Journal of Intelligent Information Systems is an archival, peer-reviewed, technical journal publishing the following types of high-quality, state-of-the-art papers: - research papers - invited papers - workshop and conference reports - survey and tutorial articles - book reviews. In addition to papers Journal of Intelligent Information Systems also presents: - meeting announcements - reviews - open problems and proposed solutions.

The paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must be written in English. Contact the editor regarding the possibility of electronic submission. Submissions may be made in any of the following categories: Papers: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in computational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The length of a paper depends on its content, but it is suggested that manuscripts be limited to forty double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of thirty journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed, being read by at least two members of the editorial board and usually by an additional expert in the particular subject area. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the author certifies the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publication to another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared; or will appear, in a non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Editor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the case of a \"work for hire,\" by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978 U.S. Copyright law. Letters to the Editor: This category includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the readership.
