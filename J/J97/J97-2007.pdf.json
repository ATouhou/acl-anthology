As Harold Somers states in the preface to this edition, \"it was the first at-tempt anyone had made to take a critical and objective look at the details of MT systems.\" This explains to a large extent the interest it may arouse and justifies to some extent its (re)publication within the Studies in Computational Linguistics series a decade after its original completion.","The book comprises two parts. Part I is a concise general discussion about machine translation (MT). It covers succinctly the linguistic and computational information necessary to be able to follow the second part of the book. Part II surveys, in great detail, and evaluates six MT systems: SYSTRAN, TAUM-M6t6o, TAUM Aviation, GETA Ariane-78, Yorick Wilks's Preferential Semantics (PS) system, and METAL. Neither of the authors were involved in the development of any of these software projects. They did, however, have an in-depth understand-ing of the intricacies of the systems, having collected numerous relevant reports and in-temal memos. Their description is given in a relatively clear, easy-to-follow manner with-out compromising on technical detail. Harold Somers has provided a number of additional footnotes trying to put (part of) the discussion into a mid-90's perspective.","The book is not, nor does it claim to be, either an introduction to MT or a general reference book on MT. In essence, it is a critical, detailed description of the six aforementioned MT systems. Somers claims in the preface that \"this effort has not yet been duplicated.\" As humble as he may be, the facts are that by the time he wrote this preface (December 1993) Somers himself had already coauthored Hutchins and Somers (1992). The latter is a widely available introductory MT textbook and reference book that contains, in-ter alia, four full chapters dedicated to critical detailed descriptions of most of these MT systems (all excepting TAUM Aviation and Wilks's PS system). Although Hutchins and Somers may seem at times to exhibit more of a socio-historical interest than a technical one--in contrast to the book under review-- nonetheless, they too go into substantial technical detail and give overall comparable descriptions. The effort, thus, has actually been duplicated to a significant extent, casting certain doubt on any serious need for this second (partially redundant) edition of Whitelock and Kilby's book.","To summarize, the book is interesting, well written, not too thick, and easily read. However, unless one is explicitly interested in detailed critical descriptions of TAUM Aviation or Wilks's PS system, then Hutchins and Somers (1992)--which covers most of that discussed by Whitelock and Kilby and much much more--should probably suffice. This renders the book under review somewhat dispensable.--Daniel RadzinskL Lexical Technology Inc., Alameda, California."]},{"title":"Reference","paragraphs":["Hutchins, W. John and Harold L.

I began reading this book while on a flight to attend the third International Colloquium on Grammatical Inference (ICGI-96), where I was invited to give a lecture on 355 Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 2 grammatical inference of natural language. By the end of the book, and the flight, I had completely rethought the introduction to my talk.","The book is a collection of revised papers from a workshop at the 1995 International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, with a very worthwhile introduction written by the members of the workshop or-ganizing committee. As the title implies, the book is divided into three sections: connectionist networks and hybrid approaches, statistical approaches, and symbolic approaches to language learning.","Most of the selections in the first section are proof-of-concept papers, in contrast to the more results-oriented papers in the other two sections. The reader is left with the impression that while there is interest-ing work being done in applying neural networks and genetic algorithms to language learning, the approach is still in its infancy, and lags somewhat behind the statistical and symbolic movements. For example, the final paper in the section, \"Learning language us-ing genetic algorithms,\" by Smith and Witten, established the robustness of its proposed learning algorithm by trying to learn the rule S --+ NP VP from a half-dozen five- and six-word sentences.","With this book, Wermter, Riloff, and Scheler have done a commendable job of providing the community with a good start-ing point for exploring these very different approaches to the problem of language leaming.--David M.

Newell Decker (University of Nebraska-Lincoln) Lawrence Erlbaum Publishers, 1996, xx+163 pp; paperbound, ISBN 0-8058-2186-4, $24.50 Although written primarily for students in audiology, speech pathology, and related areas, Decker's book will also be helpful to any linguist who wants to learn the practical as-pects of electronics for collecting and analyzing speech data. The book assumes that the reader has no scientific or technical background. The topics covered include the following: the basics of setting up and connect-ing equipment; microphones and other transducers; amplifiers, attenuators, mixers, and filters; digital signal processing; spectrum analysis; digital and analogue tape recording; and instrumentation for studying the physiology of speech.--G.H.
