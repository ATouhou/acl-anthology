Tutorial on Machine Translation The University of Geneva, Institut Dalle Molle, ISSCO, announces a tutorial on machine translation will be held in Lugano, Switzerland, 2-7 April 1984.","Machine Translation (MT) has grown into a discipline with many facets. The aim of this tutorial is to convey the state of the art by allowing experts in different aspects of MT to present their particular point of view. Sessions concerning the contribution of theoretical and computational linguistics, computer science, expert systems design, combined with discussions on the development of MT, and its possible future evolution will make up a tutorial which should be relevant to all concerned with the relationship between natural language translation and computers.","For further information contact: ISSCO (MT Tutorial) 54, route des Acadias 1227 Geneva, Switzerland American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 9, Number 1, January-March 1983 39"]}]}
