It is regrettably late, as a result of the complexities involved in transferring the files and in reorganizing the procedures for handling papers. It is my intention to bring the Journal back onto schedule by the end of 1984. Doing that may require putting out several double issues to economize on production and distribution delays, but that will not lessen the number of pages included in a volume. Depending on the number of such double issues, this means there will be five to seven issues published during 1984.","There are several changes I have made in the organization of the Journal. Some of these relate to streamlining the processing of submissions, while others deal with the content of the Journal itself. With regard to processing papers, the editorial board has agreed to review papers within three weeks of their receipt and I have been enforcing that deadline. Given the time taken to select appropriate referees and to carry out other management tasks, this means that we can process a paper from receipt by the editor to acceptance or rejection in approximately three months. In fact, since I have assumed the editorship, we have completed processing of ten papers with an average turnaround of 82 days from the date of receipt. Given the increased publication rate over the next year, there will be virtually no delay from final acceptance to publication. Thus this is an ideal time to get a paper published in a short time, probably within six months form the date of submission!","The Journal itself will start to change over the next year as a result of a complete new line of editorial staff. Ralph Weischedel is now The Finite String editor and Lyn Bates is the new Book Review editor. See their statements in this issue at the beginning of their sections. As for my part of the Journal, I want to encourage more Technical Correspondences and Letters to the Editor. Technical Correspondences provide an ideal place to describe preliminary results of a project or the results of a study relevant to computatiqnal linguistics. Letters include extensive discussion on a matter of opinion. Responses to both Technical Correspondences and Letters will be actively encouraged.","I also want to encourage special issues on topics in computational linguistics. These will usually be administered by a Guest Editor, although all submissions will still be subject to review by the Editorial Board as usual. If you are interested in editing such an issue, or have a suggestion of a topic area for an issue, please contact me.","As of the first issue of 1984 (Volume 10), the name of the Journal will be changed to"]},{"title":"Computational Linguistics","paragraphs":["to reflect its international nature. We will be increasing the proportion of non-American members on the Editorial Board over the next few years and hope to attract many more submissions from outside the U.

Any suggestions and comments you have on what we plan to do, what we are doing, or what we should be doing will be greatly appreciated.

It should state the objectives of the work, summarize the results, and give the principle conclusions and recommendations. It is preferable that the abstract not be in the first person, and it should not contain any mathematical notation or cite references. Work planned but not completed should not appear. Since the abstract will be used to select appropriate referees, it is essential to make it as informative as possible.","References should be listed alphabetically by author at the end of the paper according to the following style, where the naming convention is 'Surname, Firstname Initial.' and multiple authors are separated by semicolons, the last one being preceded by \"and\": Article in journal: Name.

Whenever it does not impede the logic or readability of the paper, footnote material should be integrated into the text. When necessary, they should be numbered consecutively from the beginning of the article and appear at the bottom of the page on which they are referenced. Notation should be selected so as to simplify the phototypesetting process. Also, figures should be devised with consideration for whether they would require one column or two columns in the text. All figures in the final manuscript will be the author's responsibility. For initial submission of papers for refereeing, the figures should be integrated into the text as much as possible, rather than being inserted at the end of the document. Original line drawings must be drawn in black ink on white paper; the lines should be heavy enough to reproduce well. Photographs should be in black and white on glossy paper. Computer printout is not acceptable for figures; any such copy should be redone in a comparable type font. AJCL is interested in exploring the use of electronic submission for the final manuscript, for those able to produce and transmit copy in that form. We are prepared to handle both tape and network transmissions. For such a submission, it is essential to reduce the problems entailed in introducing format commands. The easiest situation for our Production Editor at the present is to eliminate all such commands, separating sections that are handled differently by blank lines. It is, of course, essential to accompany the electronic transmission with a graphic version that indicates the preferred format. It should be recognized that deviations from personal preferences may occur in the interest of ensuring a more consistent style for the Journal. Electronic submissions should be sent directly to the Production Editor at the mailing or net addresses provided on the inside front cover."]}]}
