This conference is intended to promote interaction among researchers in all disciplines related to fifth generation computer technology. The topics of interest include (but are not limited to) the following: • Foundations for Logic Programs • Logic Programming Languages/Methodologies • Architectures for New Generation Computing • Applications of New Generation Computing • Impacts of New Generation Computing Paper Submission Requirements Four copies of manuscripts should be submitted by April 15, 1984 to:","Prof. Hideo Also","Program Chairman","ICOT","Mite Kokusai Bldg. 21F","1-4-28 Mite, Minato-ku","Tokyo 108, JAPAN Papers are restricted to 20 double-spaced pages (about 5000 words) including figures. Each paper must contain a 200-250 word abstract. Papers must be written and presented in English.","Papers will be reviewed by international referees. Authors will be notified of acceptance by June 30, 1984, and will be given instructions for final preparation of their papers at that time. Camera-ready papers for the proceedings should be sent to the Program Chairman prior to August 31, 1984.

In recent years its central role within Artificial Intelligence has become apparent, and considerable research activity has been directed to-wards both theoretical and practical issues. The workshop aims to assemble theoreticians and practitioners from across AI who recognize in their research a need for non-monotonic reasoning. The objective is to identify those forms of plausible reasoning that arise in different areas of AI, to isolate common patterns, to entertain various accounts - both formal and informal - of these reasoning patterns, and to evaluate their suitability and limitations.","To encourage interaction and a broad exchange of ideas, the workshop will be kept small - about 35 participants. Sessions will consist of individual presentations, with ample time for general discussion.","Papers are invited for consideration in all aspects of non-monotonic reasoning including, but not restricted to: • Formal Theory • Computational Mechanisms • Philosophical Considerations • Reason (or \"Truth\") Maintenance and the Retrac-","tion of Assumptions • Non-monotonic Reasoning as It Arises in","- Planning","- Natural Language","- Knowledge Representation","- Data Bases","- Computational Vision","- Expert Systems","Three copies of an extended abstract (up to 8 pages, double spaced) should be sent to the General Chairman, postmarked before 1 May 1984. Acceptance notices will be mailed by 15 June 1984. Revised abstracts should be returned to the General Chairman by 1 September 1984 so they may be bound for distribution at the workshop.

Hector Levesque, Fairchild Corporation Robert Moore, SRI International Ray Reiter, University of British Columbia Bonnie Lynn Webber, University of Pennsylvania A Tutorial on Machine Translation will be held by the Institut Dallc Molle pour les Etudes Semantiques et Cognitives de l'Universit6 de Geneve (\"ISSCO\") from Monday, 2 April, to Saturday, 7 April, 1984, in Lugano, Switzerland.","The aim of the tutorial is to convey the state of the art by allowing experts in different aspects of MT to present their particular point of view. Sessions covering the historical development of MT and its possible future evolution will also be included to provide a tutorial that should be relevant to all concerned with the relationship between natural language and computer science.","The Tutorial will take place in the Palazzo dei Congressi or the Villa Heleneum, both set in parkland on the shore of Lake Lugano. Participants will be accommodated in nearby hotels. Registration will take place on the Sunday evening preceding the Tutorial.
