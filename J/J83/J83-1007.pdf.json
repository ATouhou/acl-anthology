One possible end result of our research would be the disappearance of planning as a separate subject of study altogether, subsumed in a more inclusive and deeper theory of general reasoning. D.3. Mind and action Project Manager: John Perry This project will attempt to bridge the gap between computational theory and practice, on the one hand, and philosophical insight, on the other, by using formal methods to bring intuitive theories of mind and action into a computational frame of reference. This will involve building a common technical vocabulary, possibly based on work in theoretical computer science on formalizing the relation between levels of abstraction in the description of complex computational processes (e.g., work on abstract data structures and the semantics of high-level languages). The ultimate goal is either a computationally meaningful reinterpretation of much of the intuitive terminology from the philosophy of mind and practical reasoning or a more radical revision of our ideas on how to describe mental structure and process. One important question we will try to answer is whether our model should include as a separate component each of the many attitudes that our language names (e.g., believe, want, intend, fear). If not, what criteria should be used to collapse them? We will look at the relationship between an objective \"observer's\" theory of mind and action and the commonsense \"participants's\" theory that we apply to each other in everyday life. Further, we will examine whether there is a systematic method for abstracting the latter type of theory from the semantics of propositional attitudes, how we can account computationally for how rational deliberation results in the causation of action, and what mechanism lead to \"changes of mind.\" D.4. The commonsense world Project Manager: Robert C. Moore Generating and interpreting fluent natural language requires considerable abilities to do commonsense reasoning, which in turn presupposes an explicit elaboration of our commonsense theories of the world. Such theories are also needed for extending semantical theories of natural language, since the semantics of our language and our commonsense view of the world are inextricably intertwined. We will focus on a handful of commonsense theories that are so basic to our view of the world that they arise in some form in almost any domain of discourse, for example, the commonsense theory of space and motion. We will also choose areas in which natural language has evolved special mechanisms for expressing information, so that a commonsense theory in such an area is almost essential to carrying out the semantical analysis of that part of language. The commonsense theory of time, for instance, must be understood in order to explicate adequately the semantics of tense and aspect.

In addition to refereed papers, it will contain several new features. As a reflection of continuing growth and specialization within computational linguistics, the program committee felt that several intellectual developments of potentially wide interest required some introduction for non-specialists. Accordingly, the authors of submitted papers in two of these areas have been invited to give instead more extensive presentations with more tutorial content. David Israel will talk on computational implications of Barwise and Perry's newly emergent theory of situation semantics and Mark Liberman will present a tutorial overview on the new round of applications of techniques from artificial intelligence and computational linguistics to low-level speech analysis and phonetically-based speech recognition.","The sole panel discussion at the meeting is closely linked to a set of papers which are part of a new wave of work focusing on the computational complexity of various grammatical formalisms and on the relevance of such analyses. The program committee felt the differing views expressed in these papers strongly invited wider discussion. Ray Perrault has organized a American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 9, Number 1, January-March 1983 35 The FINITE STRING Newsletter Program for the 21st Annual Meeting of the ACL panel on these topics, and will set the stage with a tutorial presenting relevant formal underpinnings and historical background.","The Program Committee consisted of Mitchell Marcus, Bell Laboratories, Chair; Philip Cohen, Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corporation; Lauri Karttunen, University of Texas, Austin; William Mann, USC/ISI; Robert Moore, SRI International; Ann Robinson, Symantec; Robert Wilensky, University of California, Berkeley.
