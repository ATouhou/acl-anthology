SMT systems are very attractive because they may be built with little human effort when enough monolingual and bilingual corpora are available. However, bilingual corpora large enough to build competitive SMT systems are not always easy to harvest, and they may not even exist for some language pairs. On the contrary, rule-based machine translation systems (RBMT) may be built without any parallel corpus; however, they need an explicit representation of linguistic information whose coding by human experts requires a considerable amount of time.","When both parallel corpora and linguistic information exist, hybrid approaches (Thurmair, 2009) may be followed in order to make the most of such resources. We focus on alleviating the data sparseness problem suffered by phrase-based statistical machine translation (PBSMT) systems (Koehn, 2010, ch. 5) when trained on small parallel corpora. We present a new hybrid approach which enriches a PBSMT system with resources from shallow-transfer RBMT. Shallow-transfer RBMT systems, which are described in detail below, do not perform a complete syntactic analysis of the input sentences, but rather work with much simpler intermediate representations. Hybridisation between shallow-transfer RBMT and SMT has not yet been explored. Existing hybridisation strategies involve more complex RBMT systems (Eisele et al., 2008) which are usually treated as black boxes; in contrast, our approach directly uses the RBMT dictionaries and rules.","We provide an exhaustive evaluation of our hybridisation approach with two different language pairs: Breton–French and Spanish–English. While the first one suffers from actual resource scarceness, many different parallel corpora are available for the second one, which allows us to test our approach on different domains and check if it is able to improve the poor performance of PBSMT systems when translating texts from a domain not covered by the bilingual training data.","The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Next section overviews the two systems we combine in our approach. Then, section 3 outlines related hybrid approaches, whereas our approach is described in section 4. Sections 5 and 6 present the experiments conducted and discuss the results achieved, respectively. The paper ends with our conclusions and future research lines."]},{"title":"2 Translation Approaches 2.1 Phrase-Based Statistical Machine Translation","paragraphs":["PBSMT systems (Koehn, 2010, ch. 5) translate sentences by maximising the translation probability as defined by the log-linear combination of a number of feature functions, whose weights are chosen to optimise translation quality (Och, 2003). A core component of every PBSMT system is the phrase table, which contains bilingual phrase pairs extracted from a bilingual corpus after word alignment (Och and Ney, 2003). The set of translations 90 from which the most probable one is chosen is built by segmenting the source sentence in all possible ways and then combining the translation of the different source segments according to the phrase table. Common feature functions are: source-to-target and target-to-source phrase translation probabilities, source-to-target and target-to-source lexical weightings (calculated by using a probabilistic bilingual dictionary), reordering costs, number of words in the output (word penalty), number of phrase pairs used (phrase penalty), and likelihood of the output as given by a target-language model.","2.2 Shallow-Transfer Rule-Based Machine Translation The RBMT process (Hutchins and Somers, 1992) can be split into three different steps: analysis of the source language (SL) text to build a SL intermediate representation; transfer from that SL intermediate representation to a target language (TL) intermediate representation; and generation of the final translation from the TL intermediate representation.","Shallow-transfer RBMT systems use relatively simple intermediate representations, which are based on lexical forms consisting of lemma, part of speech and morphological inflection information of the words in the input sentence, and simple shallow-transfer rules that operate on sequences of lexical forms: this kind of systems do not perform a complete syntactic analysis. Apertium (Forcada et al., 2011), the shallow-transfer RBMT platform used to evaluate our approach, splits the transfer stage into structural and lexical transfer. The lexical transfer is done by using a bilingual dictionary which, for each SL lexical form, provides a single TL lexical form; thus, no lexical selection is performed. It is worth noting that multi-word expressions, such as on the other hand (which acts as a single adverb), may be analysed to (or generated from) a single lexical form.","Structural transfer is done by applying a set of rules in a left-to-right, longest-match fashion to prevent the translation to be performed word for word in those cases in which this would result in an incorrect translation. Structural transfer rules process sequences of lexical forms by performing operations such as reorderings and gender and number agreements. For the translation between non-related language pairs, the structural transfer may be split into three levels in order to facilitate the writing of rules by linguists. The first level performs short-distance operations (such as gender and number agreement between nouns and adjectives) and groups word sequences into chunks; the second one performs inter chunk operations; and the third one generates a sequence of lexical forms from each chunk. Note that, although this multi-stage shallow transfer allows performing operations between words which are distant in the source sentence, shallow-transfer RBMT systems are less powerful that the ones which perform full parsing."]},{"title":"3 Related Work","paragraphs":["Bilingual dictionaries are the most reused resource from RBMT. They have been added to SMT systems since its early days (Brown et al., 1993). One of the simplest strategies, which has already been put into practice with the Apertium bilingual dictionaries (Tyers, 2009), consists of adding the dictionary entries directly to the parallel corpus. In addition to the obvious increase in lexical coverage, Schwenk et al. (2009) state that the quality of the alignments obtained is also improved when the words in the bilingual dictionary appear in other sentences of the parallel corpus. However, it is not guaranteed that, following this strategy, multi-word expressions from the bilingual dictionary that appear in the SL sentences are translated as such by the SMT decoder because they may be split into smaller units by the phrase-extraction algorithm. Our strategy differs from these approaches in that we ensure the proper translation of multi-word expressions, but also add the dictionary entries to the training corpus with the aim of improving word alignment. Other approaches go beyond adding a dictionary to the parallel corpus: dictionary entries may constrain the decoding process (Langlais, 2002), or may be used in conjunction with hand-crafted rules to reorder the SL sentences to match the structure of the TL (Popović and Ney, 2006).","Although RBMT transfer rules have also been reused in hybrid systems, they have been mostly used implicitly as part of a complete RBMT engine. For instance, Dugast et al. (2008) show how a PBSMT system can be bootstrapped using only monolingual data and an RBMT engine. Another remarkable study (Eisele et al., 2008) presents a strategy based on the augmentation of the phrase table to include information provided by an RBMT system. In this approach, the sentences to be translated by the hybrid system are first translated with an RBMT system and then a small phrase table is obtained from the resulting parallel corpus. Phrase pairs are extracted following the usual procedure (Koehn, 2010, sec. 5.2.3) which generates the set of all possible phrase pairs that are consistent with the 91 word alignments. In order to obtain reliable word alignments, they are computed using an alignment model previously built from a large parallel corpus. Finally, the RBMT-generated phrase table is added to the original one. On the contrary, our approach directly generates phrase pairs which match either an entry in the bilingual dictionary or a structural transfer rule; thus preventing them from being split into smaller phrase pairs even if they would be consistent with the word alignments. In addition, our approach does not require a large parallel corpus from which to learn an alignment model. Preliminary experiments show that our hybrid approach outperforms Eisele et al.’s (2008) strategy when translating from Spanish to English.","Other strategies involving neither transfer rules nor bilingual dictionaries may alleviate the data sparseness problem in PBSMT. For example, para-phrases may be derived from a SL monolingual corpus (Marton et al., 2009) and verb forms may be substituted by their lemma when translating into highly-inflected languages (de Gispert et al., 2005)."]},{"title":"4 Enhancing Phrase-Based SMT With Shallow-Transfer Linguistic Resources","paragraphs":["Our hybridisation strategy modifies two elements of a standard PBSMT system: the word alignments and the phrase translation model.","4.1 Improving Word Alignment with RBMT Bilingual Dictionaries As improving the quality of the word alignments in a PBSMT system could lead to improvements in translation performance (Lopez and Resnik, 2006), in our approach we add to the original corpus all the entries, after suitably inflecting them, from the Apertium bilingual dictionary, to help the word aligment process. Recall that some multi-word expressions are encoded as single lexical forms in the Apertium dictionaries; therefore, the entries generated from Apertium may contain multi-word parallel segments. Once word alignments have been computed and the probabilistic bilingual dictionary used to compute the lexical weightings of the phrase pairs has been learned, dictionary entries are ignored and no phrase pair are extracted from them. In contrast to Schwenk et al. (2009), we avoid extracting phrase pairs which do not preserve the translation of multi-word expressions as such by including the dictionary entries directly in the phrase table, as discussed next. 4.2 Enriching the Phrase Translation Model As already mentioned, the Apertium structural transfer detects sequences of lexical forms which need to be translated together to prevent them from being translated word for word, which would result in an incorrect translation. Therefore, adding to the phrase table of a PBSMT system all the bilingual phrase pairs which either match one of these sequences of lexical forms in the structural transfer or an entry in the bilingual dictionary ensures that all the linguistic information of Apertium is encoded with the minimum amount of phrase pairs. 4.2.1 Phrase Pair Generation Generating a phrase pair from every entry in the bilingual dictionary is straightforward: it only in-volves the inflection of source and target lexical forms. The generation of phrase pairs from the structural transfer rules is performed by finding sequences of SL words in the sentences to be translated that match a structural transfer rule. Each of these sequences constitute the SL side of a bilingual phrase pair; the corresponding TL phrase is obtained by translating the SL side with Apertium.","It is worth noting that the generation of bilingual phrase pairs from the shallow-transfer rules is guided by the test corpus. We decided to do it in this way in order to avoid meaningless phrases and also to make our approach computationally feasible. Consider, for instance, a rule which is triggered every time a determiner followed by a noun and an adjective is detected. Generating phrase pairs from this rule would involve combining all the determiners in the dictionary with all the nouns and all the adjectives, causing the generation of many meaningless phrases, such as el niño inalámbrico – the wireless boy. In addition, the number of combinations to deal with would become unmanageable as the length of the rule grows. 4.2.2 Scoring the New Phrase Pairs State-of-the-art PBSMT systems usually attach 5 scores to every phrase pair in the translation table: source-to-target and target-to-source phrase translation probabilities, source-to-target and target-to-source lexical weightings, and phrase penalty.","To calculate the phrase translation probabilities of the new phrase pairs obtained from the shallow-transfer RBMT resources we simply add them once to the list of corpus-extracted phrase pairs, and then compute the probabilities by relative frequency as it is usually done (Koehn, 2010, sec. 5.2.5). In this regard, it is worth noting that as RBMT-generated phrase pairs are added only once, if one of them 92 happens to share its source side with many other corpus-extracted phrase pairs, or even with a single, very frequent one, the RBMT-generated phrase pair will receive lower scores, which penalises its use. To alleviate this without adding the same phrase pair an arbitrary amount of times, we introduce an additional boolean score to flag phrase pairs obtained from the RBMT resources.","To calculate the lexical weightings (Koehn, 2010, sec. 5.3.3) of the RBMT-generated phrase pairs the alignments between the words in the source side and those in the target side are needed. They are computed by tracing the operations carried out in the different stages of the shallow-transfer RBMT system. Only those words which are neither split nor joint with other words by the RBMT engine are included in the alignments; thus, multi-word expressions are left unaligned. This is done for convenience since, in this way, the number of lexical probabilities to take into account is reduced, and, as a result, phrase pairs containing multi-word expressions receive higher scores."]},{"title":"5 Experimental Settings","paragraphs":["We evaluated our RBMT–SMT hybridisation approach on two different language pairs, namely Breton–French and Spanish–English, and with different small training corpus sizes. While the Breton–French language pair suffers from actual resource scarceness (there are only around 30 000 parallel sentences available), Spanish–English was chosen because it has a wide range of parallel corpora available, which allows us to perform both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations.","SMT systems for Spanish–English were trained from the Europarl v5 parallel corpus (Koehn, 2005), collected from the proceedings of the European Parliament. Its whole target side, except for the Q4/2000 portion, was used to train the TL model used in the experiments. We learned the translation model from corpora of different sizes; more precisely, we used fragments of the Europarl corpus consisting of 2 000, 5 000, 10 000, 20 000, 40 000 and 80 000 parallel sentences. The sentences in each training set were randomly chosen (avoiding the Q4/2000 portion) in such a way that larger corpora include the sentences in the smaller ones.","Regarding Breton–French, the translation model was built using the only freely-available parallel corpus for such language pair (Tyers, 2009), which contains short sentences from the tourism and computer localisation domains split in different sections for training, tuning and testing.

The former was performed by tuning the systems with 2 000 parallel sentences randomly chosen from the Q4/2000 portion of Europarl v5 corpus (Koehn, 2005) and evaluating them with 2 000 random parallel sentences from the same corpus; special care was taken to avoid the overlapping between the test and development sets.

However, the difference is statistically significant only under certain circumstances.

Apertium data has been developed bear-ing in mind the translation of general texts (mainly news) whereas the in-domain test sets come from the specialised domains of parliament speeches (Spanish–English) or tourism and computer localisation (Breton–French). Thus, as soon as the PBSMT system learns reliable information from the parallel corpus, Apertium phrases become useless. On the contrary, the out-of-domain Spanish– English tests, performed on a general (news) domain, show a statistically-significant improvement with all the training corpus sizes tested. In this case, Apertium-generated phrases, which contain hand-crafted knowledge from a general domain, cover more sequences of words in the input text which are not covered, or are sparsely found, in the original training corpora. The data reported in tables 4 and 5 support these hypotheses; in the in-domain evaluation, the proportion of phrases generated from Apertium included in the translations drops abruptly as the corpus grows.
