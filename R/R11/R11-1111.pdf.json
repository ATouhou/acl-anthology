The ontology structure is built upon general categories of information that patients use when describing their health in clinical encounters. The pilot study shows that the general structure makes the ontology useful in text mining of social networking web sites."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Recent studies have shown that public health surveillance benefits from information posted by users on the Web (Carneiro and Mylonakis, 2009; Ginsberg et al, 2008). Health-related messages can be found on Web forums hosting social networks (e.g., www.PatientsLikeMe. com) or individual blogs (e.g., http://www. jackslemonade.com).","For medical professionals, the user-written health information assists in prediction of public attitude towards health policies. In user messages, patient-based information prevails over biomedical information. Patient-based information is brought forth when a user views himself as a potential or real patient of a health care provider. This information reveals details of one’s health that are usually discussed during visits to a health care provider. Patient-based information is often identified as evidence-based, whereas the biomedical information is viewed as knowledge-based (Hersh, 2009).","Development of social media has prompted refocusing of text analysis from biomedical to patient-based health information mining. Several academic groups actively work on health information studies (Angelova, 2010; Chapman, 2010; Chanlekha and Collier, 2010). These groups work on methods for the analysis of academic and professional articles in medical journals and traditional news media, as well as hospital documentation.","At present, user-written health information is the subject of studies by data mining where the analysis primarily relies on statistical methods (Lampos and Christianini, 2010) and public health informatics which usually addresses specific questions, e.g., injury discussions by military servicemen (Konovalov et al, 2010).","A prevalent trend in health-related text analysis is to solve a particular task which is closely associated with a particular data source, e.g., identifying involuntary childlessness terminology on a dedicated web site (Himmel et al., 2009) or finding new terms used on a patient social networking site (Doing-Harris and Zeng-Treiler, 2011). The specific focus makes the accumulated knowledge inherently individualized towards the task and the data. It permits high accuracy on the original data, whereas shifting to other data sets is likely to experience performance set-back.","Our goal is to build a patient-based resource organized as an ontology, a repository of health-related terms assigned into a hierarchical structure of semantic categories. The general categories are durable and able to withstand the rapidly evolving environment of the Web. In an empirical setting, we show that the ontology content is representative of health-related topics and vocabulary used by the general public on the Web."]},{"title":"2 Motivation","paragraphs":["Major health concerns, related events and issues, and behavioural trends can be identified from what people post on social networks. The importance of this analysis became more pronounced during the H1N1 pandemic as recent research demonstrates (Lampos and Christianini, 2010).","User-written health information extraction can be challenging in a two-fold way: 758","Twitter 11: i can’t cos i haven’t slept yet and it’s 9:43am. i’m having some serious insomnia. i’m trying to sleep but i keep checking mail. 12: the doctor came, examined me and told me i had early tonsilitis. will look it up on the net. i’m in my mom’s room while my room aerates.","20 News groups I sometimes see OTC preparations for muscle aches/back aches that combine aspirin with a diuretic.

Figure 1: Examples of user messages.","i various web sites host texts written in different styles (Figure 1 lists samples from four web sites); thus, a site-specific method has an application range limited to the site;","ii existing text mining tools focus on biomedical and professional terminology that may be absent in social media (Casoto et al, 2010); as a result, these tools need a considerable readjustment before application to user-written text.","Standardized classification of diseases and other health-related problems is critical for epidemiologic and health management purposes. At the same time, there are few publications dedicated to user-written health information. In one study (Doing-Harris and Zeng-Treiler, 2011), the authors looked for new health-related terms in messages posted on PatientsLikeMe.com. User requests posted on an involuntary childlessness message board were studied in (Himmel et al., 2009). Blogs written by military servicemen were studied by (Konovalov et al, 2010). The researchers sought terms that described clinically relevant combat exposure. All the three listed studies have a restricted appeal: each was carried out on one data set only and was not applied or reproduced on other data sets.","Biomedical information extraction and text classification have a successful history of method and tool development, including deployed information retrieval systems (Hersh, 2009), knowledge resources and ontologies (Cohen et al, 2010; Yu, 2006). Exponential increase in bio-, bioinformatics and medical publications has caused a rapid development of ontologies that help to recognize and categorize research and professional vocabulary (Yu, 2006). We discuss here a few examples.","GENIA1","is built for the microbiology domain. Categories include DNA-metabolism, Proteinmetabolism, and Cellular process. Medical Subjects Heading (MeSH) is a controlled vocabulary thesaurus, produced by the National Library of Medicine2",". Its terms are informative to experts but might not be in use by the general public (e.g., Work Schedule Tolerance at the top level and Motor Cortex, Trypanosoma cruzi at the bottom level). The Medical Entities Dictionary (MED)3 is an ontology containing approximately 60, 000 concepts, 208, 000 synonyms, and 84, 000 hierarchies. This powerful lexical and knowledge resource is designed with medical research vocabulary in mind. Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) has 135 semantic types and 54 relations that include organisms, anatomical structures, biological functions, chemicals, etc.","Another internationally recognized classification scheme is the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) maintained by the International Health Terminology Standards Development Organization.4","Although SNOWMED CT is considered to be the most comprehensive clinical health care terminology classification system, it is primarily used to permit standardization of electronic medical records rather than to mine user-written health-related content. A public health ontology BioCaster5","is built for surveillance of traditional media.

We began by building a set of semantic categories that a patient would use when discussing personal health in a clinical set-ting.","There are several internationally accepted inter-related disease and health-related problems classification schemes:","• The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) developed by The World Health Organization is the internationally recognized standard diagnostic classification system (ICD– 10, 2004).","• The International Classification of Procedures in Medicine (ICPM) categorizes medical and surgical procedures (ICPM, 1978).","• The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) categorizes and qualifies disability, physiological functioning of body systems and their impairment, anatomical parts of the body and their impairment, activities of an individual and their limitations, participation in life situations and their restrictions, and health-related environmental factors (ICF, 2001). We amalgamated and streamlined these international health related classification scheme taxonomies to facilitate the classification of user-written health-related content on the web. Extensive clinical experience of one of the authors was applied to empirically adapt the classification scheme to users’ description of their health on various social networking web sites. Figure 2 shows the ontology structure.","We populate the categories with terms found in sources that provide patient-friendly terminology.6","Many of the terms utilized in the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and 6 The ontology is posted on http://www.","ehealthinformation.ca/ap0/opendata.asp. • Person – Anatomical parts of the body – Physiological functioning of body • Diseases and Health-Related Problems – Diseases – Symptoms • Health Care System","– Health Care Providers ∗ Physician ∗ Nurse ∗ Physiotherapist ∗ Psychologist ∗ Other Health Care Provider","– Health Care Setting ∗ Hospital ∗ Ambulatory surgery center ∗ Physician Office ∗ Community Health Care Clinic ∗ Other Health Care Setting","– Health Care Procedures ∗ Diagnostic ∗ Therapeutic • Health-Related Environmental Factors – Physical – Social – Attitudinal Figure 2: The structure of the ontology.

The medical group consists of 990 messages gathered from Web chat boards. In these messages, users discuss their health problems, ask questions pertaining to health, give advice and share relevant experience. The set has 239, 120 words, an average length of a message is 242 words, including partial citations of previous messages when applicable. Full grammatical constructs and a rich lexicon make the messages reminiscent of a more traditional, pre-Internet writing. Twitter is a micro-blogging service, with instant message postings. It is organized as a social network of Twitter users. A user can post short messages, no longer than 140 characters, that are publicly visible by default. Other users can subscribe to these tweets (i.e., become followers) and respond with their messages. A user can group his messages by topic or types and make them accessible only to followers. URL shortening is common, e.g., goo.gl for www.google.com. Other condensing happens through shorthand (e.g., “LOL” (laugh out loud),“DWT” (driving while texting), “4gt”(forgot)) and emoticons (e.g., ;-)).","We worked with 30, 164 threads of consequent tweets. The treads are split into two subsets, 3, 754, 668 and 15, 199, 470 words. An average length of a thread is 560 words, albeit some words can be very short (e.g., “u”,“4”). MySpace (aka My , Myspace) has been a leading social network in 2006 – 2008, when 95 million unique users visited the web site in a year. Friends can leave their comments in the user’s “Friends Space”; it is left to the user’s discretion to keep or delete those comments or mandate to approve them before posting. Users can assign emoticons to posts (e.g., :-0,:-(). Ability to reach all friends simultaneously is given through bulletins, messages posted on the bulletin board","education-careers 9 http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/","20newsgroups/20newsgroups.html 10 http://caw2.barcelonamedia.org/node/7 11 http://www.cs.jhu.edu/ m̃dredze/ datasets/sentiment/ and remaining there for 10 days. Profiles have enhanced blogging that promotes longer posts. However, a typical post may exhibit the Internetspeak features, such as the the shorthand and simplified grammar (e.g., “l8r” (later), “c u” (see you) ).","We analyzed 18, 178 posts split into four sub-sets of 218, 628, 1, 219, 730, 1, 987, 495 and 9, 403, 345 words respectively. An average length of a post available to us is 167 words. Amazon.com posts user reviews of consumer products. In the reviews, users share their experience and opinion about the products. Those comments are often accompanied or illustrated by a narrative of real life events included health-related problems. Messages are organized according to the types of the assessed goods.","We worked with 8, 000 reviews, evenly split along four topics: books (349, 530 words) , DVD (337, 473 words), electronics (222, 862 words), and kitchen&houseware (188, 137 words). An average length of reviews is counted in words: books – 175, DVD – 169, Electronics – 111, Kitchen – 99.

This information is in demand by health care policy-makers, population and community health organizations and medical practitioners.","Information retrieval/extraction and text mining are popular topics in Health Informatics. The field, however, only recently started to investigate health information in user-written texts. Relationship between self-disclosure and stigmatized health conditions in medical information search have been analyzed (Buchanan et al, 2007). Health information disseminated through medical and military blogs have been studied (Lagu et al, 2008; Konovalov et al, 2010).","Topic classification of user-written health messages has been a focus of research (Frank and Bouckaert, 2006). The study aimed to discriminate between messages with different health topics. Our goal is to extract health-related information from messages. When text data mining systems are deployed to analyze health information they often process institutional documents (An-gelova, 2010; Cohen et al, 2010; Chapman, 2010; Ware et al, 2009). We instead work with health-related information."]},{"title":"7 Conclusions","paragraphs":["Our goal is to assist medical practitioners and researchers in the analysis of Web-based social media. For example, medical professionals may wish 762 to follow the understanding in the general population of a common medical condition such as otitis media and the indications for surgical intervention. We designed a set of semantic categories based on international classification schemes and extensive clinical experience of one of the authors. The categories are representative of notions and concepts that patients invoke in presentation of their health in clinical settings. To find adequate terms, we directly accessed clinical resources used by health care practitioners.","The evidence of ontology usefulness has been obtained from social networking sites. The ontology can be further used for detection of posted confidential health information; aggregation of user health concerns within a certain geographic area; survey of public awareness about particular issues. Additionally, the ontology can be used by tools that analyze health information on electronic media other than the Web (El Emam et al, 2010)."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["This work is in part funded by a NSERC Discovery grant available to the first author and The Ottawa Hospital Academic Medical Organization – to the second author."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Angelova, G.
