In recent years, many companies became aware of the potential of advanced information technologies for the efficient discovery and analysis of useful information in large volumes of online data such as business news, business reports, scientific publications and patents. Exploring patents or publications is an important approach to analyzing the trends of technology development. Therefore, several systems emerged recently, which attempt to describe and predict the technology development trend based on the analysis of patents or publications (e.g., (Yoon and Park, 2004), illumin8 system1",", Google Trends2","(Rech, 2007), BlogPulse3","(Glance et al., 2004) and Collexis4","). Most available systems are mainly based on a combination of statistical methods and string match. There is still a big potential to apply language technologies to this task.","1","http://www.illumin8.com/","2","http://www.google.de/trends","3","http://www.blogpulse.com/","4","http://www.collexis.com/products","In this paper, we present a system named TECH-WATCHTOOL5",", that has already been successfully tested by corporate users. In daily opera-tion, it now aids companies and analysts in detecting emergent technologies and in identifying associated key players, their cooperative networks and new trends that are relevant for their business sector. TECHWATCHTOOL applies methods from bibliometrics, information wrapping, information extraction and data mining. Language technology plays a central role in the extraction of names and technologies. The system monitors technologies with three modules: 1) a retrieval and extraction module for publications and patents for identification of key players and their relations, 2) a trend identification module and 3) an ontology-based navigation module. Furthermore, TECHWATCHTOOL provides different views of the discovered data, which facilitate understanding and interpretation of the results.","The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 explains existing systems for technology and trend monitoring. Section 3 introduces the NLP tools used in TECHWATCHTOOL. Section 4 describes our system architecture and the core modules. Section 5 explains the result visualization and presentation. Finally, Section 6 gives a short conclusion."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Yoon and Park (2004) present a method to create patent networks with text mining methods to in-vestigate the technology development.

The system provides a modeling of various concepts (e.g. products), but the collaboration networks among the concepts are missing. In addition, illumin8 also illustrates the change of the numbers of active persons or organizations in a certain period. Google Trends is not more than a statistical summarization of its search function (Rech, 2007). As a more advanced example, BlogPulse (Glance et al., 2004) is a system for automatic discovery of trends in blogs. It can find new trends as well as visualize the chronological development of specific terms. BlogPulse extracted trends based not only on terms, but also on videos, news and links which are the targets of daily in-terests. The system Collexis can discover relationships between elements from different content sources. It can aggregate information from multiple content sources and help to discover potential new hypotheses on large amounts of unstructured contents. All these systems rely more and less on information retrieval technologies and are limited in extracting structured information from free texts."]},{"title":"3 NLP Tools","paragraphs":["In TECHWATCHTOOL, named entity (NE) recognition and information extraction (IE) tools are applied to extract named entities (persons, organizations, etc.) and to detect relations or mentions of trends. Two tools are integrated in our system:","1. SProUT as named entity recognizer (Drozdzynski et al., 2004) and","2. DARE as relation extractor and trend sentence detector (Xu et al., 2007; Xu, 2007). 3.1 SProUT SProUT6","(Shallow Processing with Unification and Typed Feature Structures) is a platform for development of multilingual shallow text processing and information extraction systems. It is a generic rule-based recognizer to extract named entities or concept terms. Users can write corresponding recognition patterns and specify linguistic resources, such as lexicons, gazetteers and tokenizers. The platform provides linguistic processing resources for several languages including English, German, etc. SProUT uses typed feature structures (TFS) as a uniform data structure for representing the input resources and the recognized","6","http://sprout.dfki.de/index.html named entities. In TECHWATCHTOOL, SProUT is utilized to extract named entities (e.g., persons, organizations and journals) from free texts and to deal with name variants. A special heuristics is implemented in our system via the unification method provided by SProUT, in order to find the equivalent classes of persons and organizations. For example if “Eckhard Beyer” and “Prof. E. Beyer” are the authors of publications about the same technology, they might be identified as name variants of the same person by our method. 3.2 DARE DARE7","(Domain Adaptive Relation Extraction) is a minimally supervised machine learning framework for extracting relations of various complexity. It consists two major parts: 1) rule learning, 2) relation extraction. Rule learning and relation extraction feed each other in a bootstrapping framework. The bootstrapping starts from socalled “semantic seed” as a search query, which is a small set of instances of the target relation. (Uszkoreit, 2011) and (Li et al., 2011) describe the application and evaluation of DARE on different corpora for different relation extraction tasks. Currently DARE provides linguistic components which process English and German free texts. In TECHWATCHTOOL, DARE is used to learn linguistic patterns to recognize sentences that potentially contain the trend information and also relations between persons and organizations. To learn patterns from trend sentences, we used the corpus offered by the project partner ThyssenKrupp AG, which is annotated with trend sentences and terms by the experts. From the annotation, we acquire examples as seed for DARE to learn patterns, e.g., • (“lithium-ion battery”, “car”, “future”) • (“Gary Mepsted”, “lithium-ion battery”’) The following is an example of trend-statement with its pattern:","pattern: “power:Verb” ([subj:Noun], [obj:“car”], [mod:“future”])","trend-statement: Lithium batteries power hybrid","cars of future8 7 http://dare.dfki.de 8 http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/","06/21/environment-batteries-lithium-","saft-dc-idUSL2055095620070621 661","To learn patterns for recognizing the relation between persons and their positions in an organization, we use the Penn Treebank as our linguistically annotated corpus and some examples of the following triple: <person, organization, position> as start seeds."]},{"title":"4 System Architecture","paragraphs":["TECHWATCHTOOL is a web application for multiple users, implemented in Java6. It has three modules dealing with different scenarios:","1. Searching and identification of key players and their collaboration network from patents and publications 2. Identification of trends for an area","3. Ontology-based navigation of a specific domain 4.1 Search and Identification of Key Players Scientific publications and patents are two important indicators of technology development. Authors, applicants or owners of these two resources are active persons or organizations in their respective areas. Our task is to extract these active persons and institutions, identify their relationships and discover key players among them.","Fig. 1 shows the workflow and components of this module. Figure 1: Workflow of search and identification of key players","Given a user query, for example, a technology term (e.g., “laser beam welding”) or a company name (e.g. “NISSAN Motor”), the Web Communicator will acquire the relevant publications and patents from three resources: Google Scholar9",", esp@cenet10","and DepatisNet11",".

The task of technology trend identification is to extract statements indicating the future trends of a specific technology expressed by key players. TECHWATCHTOOL retrieves firstly relevant documents with the Google Custom Search Engines12",", which are defined by the experts of the user company. Linguistic patterns are applied to the documents to recognize sentences that potentially contain the trend information. The linguistic patterns are determined in two ways: 9 http://scholar.google.de/, a search engine","for scientific publications 10 http://ep.espacenet.com/, the European","patent web server 11 http://depatisnet.dpma.de/DepatisNet/,","the German patent web server 12 http://www.google.com/cse/ 662 Figure 2: Trend identification","1. the linguistic experts define and evaluate the initial set of patterns in the form of regular expressions;","2. the machine learning system DARE (see Section 3.2) acquires additional patterns by learning rules from the dependency structures. The regular expressions are designed based on the lexical indicators of the potential trend statements. The domain experts highlight the texts as samples for designing and scoring the patterns. Text statements that match these patterns are considered the indicators of potential trends.

Compared to the regular expression-based patterns, the rules learned by DARE are more accurate because they consider the syntactic structures and more bigger linguistic contexts. Therefore, the recognition is more precise. Furthermore, DARE is able to correct and update the rules when more queries and more documents are generated through the users. On the other hand, the dependency structures in DARE system are fairly strict,","13","http://www.hybridcars.com/news/ investors-embrace-a123-lithium-new-ethanol-26126.html therefore, not as robust as the regular expressions. Therefore, we combine both methods to detect more trend statements without compromising on the accuracy.","Using this module, TECHWATCHTOOL can also identify the key players who are active in a certain domains without identified connections to any publications or patents. Such key players may be large corporations, department leaders or managers.

An ontology for a specific technology domain is usually provided by the experts of the user companies. Users can zoom into the ontology and find concepts (named by technology terms) and their subconcepts and obtain information about selected items. The information can contain a description of this concept, recent publications and patents, its new key players and new trends in the area.

The advantage of the graph viewer is that Figure 4: Interactive graph viewer for collaboration networks among persons, organizations, journals, publications and patents users can monitor and observe new clusters of collaborations in a very straightforward way. Further-more, the viewer offers to the users various convenient functionalities such as graph layouts, zoom-ing and focusing functions as well as customiza-tion of the color scheme.","In order to assist users in finding key players quickly, the table view provides sortable tables containing relevance ranking information about persons or organizations.","For monitoring the technology development in a certain time interval, a diagram viewer is included in TECHWATCHTOOL as depicted in Fig. 6.

The system combines information wrapping, information extraction and data mining technologies and provides different views of result presentation. Through these means, users can access and interpret the information in a very convenient way and thus gain valuable new insights.","As described in Section 3, the recognition of concept terms relies on the NLP tools. Therefore, the errors of NLP tools can damage the accuracy of TECHWATCHTOOL analysis. Meanwhile the patent and publication analysis is based on the search results of the web search engines that can neither guarantee precision nor recall. Therefore, avoiding the negative consequences of these factors and evaluating the quality of the TECHWATCHTOOL system proper remains an open challenge. It is also very difficult to automatically assess the extraction and identification results of the trend search module. We plan to evaluate it manually by annotating a small sample of documents. The identification algorithm of the trend search module still needs to be improved. We plan to run the DARE rule-learning system during the application of TECHWATCHTOOL automatically to acquire new patterns and to validate the learned patterns. We also intend to update the ontology by the new technology terms learned from document via the trend search module. Our current method for evaluating the persons and organizations in the trend module still produces errors. It happens that unrelated persons or organizations occasionally occur together with the given query pattern. This over-detection will hopefully be alleviated by NLP tools that utilize the syntactic structures of the sentences, such as DARE does."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["The research reported in this paper was initialized in the context of industrial projects funded by ThyssenKrupp AG and was further developed in the project Theseus Ordo (funded by the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi) through the contract 01MQ07016).
