The terms can be formed by only a head or a head and complements. Then, the automatic term extraction task was mainly based on the recognition of this kind of phrases.","In this paper, automatic extraction experiments for medical term extraction using noun phrases (NPs) previously recognized on medical text corpus in Spanish are described and compared. For this task, in a first stage, as baseline, all identified NPs are considered as term candidates, while in the other stages the extraction is directed to “specific NPs” that are determined on the basis of syntactic and positional criteria, among others. The novelty of this work is that we are not using pure noun phrases, like many works utilize. In fact, we are using specific NPs, is to say, a subclassification of phrases. We use the IULA corpus (Bach et al., 1997) of medical texts in Spanish and results are compared with reference lists of unigrams, bigrams and trigrams.","According to the results, (i) we showed that it is possible to extract medical terms using “specific NPs”, (ii) the software dictionary was improved with 2,445 new terms, and (iii) other terms that were not in the reference lists were extracted. For the third contribution we used the SNOMED CT R⃝ term lists aiming at improving the IULA reference lists. However, it should be mentioned that we detected other expressions that were neither in the reference lists nor in SNOMED CT R⃝, although they could be considered medical terms. In this case, we have to say that new terms are added almost on a daily basis, and it is practically impossible to manually update the terms lists."]},{"title":"2 Term extraction in medicine","paragraphs":["There are different works about term extraction that may be applied for different domains, some-times adaptations are necessary for each of them. For the medical domain, we may mention the contributions of Névéol and Ozdowska (2005) and Bessagnet et al. (2010) for the French; Hao-Min et al. (2008), for the Chinese, and the Lopes et al. (2009), for Portuguese. For the English, we cite the Krauthammer and Nenadic (2004) work, which makes a detailed description of automatic term recognition (ATR) systems in the medical field. Those systems are based either on internal characteristics of specific classes or on external clues that can support the recognition of word se-quences that represent specific domain concepts. Different types of features are used, such as orthographic (capital letters, digits, Greek letters) and morphological clues (specific affixes, POS tags), or syntactic information from shallow parsing. Also, different statistical measures are suggested for “promoting” term candidates into terms.","In our work, the term extraction is applied in 746 the medical domain in Spanish. So here, we mention the main works in this area. We may mention the ONCOTERM Project (Bilingual System of In-formation and Cancer Resources), the Describe R⃝ System, the Vivaldi and Rodrı́guez works, the Castro et al. works, and the large terminology developed by the SNOMED CT R⃝ Project.","ONCOTERM (López Rodrı́guez et al., 2006) is a Project whose goal is to develop a information system for the oncology domain, in which the concepts are linked to an ontology. The authors worked from Spanish texts to create a terminology database, with correspondences in English and German.","The Describe R⃝ system (Sierra et al., 2009), meanwhile, applies a Defining Contexts Extractor (Alarcón, 2009) for the search, classification, and grouping of medical definitions from the web.","Vivaldi and Rodrı́guez (2010) created a term extraction system that uses Wikipedia (WP) semantic information. It was tested in a medical corpus, and, according to its results, WP was considered a good resource for tasks of medical term extraction.","Castro et al. (2010) work presents a semantic annotation of clinical notes and an application of an automatic tool for medical concept recognition on the SNOMED CT R⃝ ontology. Furthermore, a tool test is presented in 100 clinical notes, and, according to the authors, the results are quite good.","SNOMED CT R⃝1","is a big medical terminology and is the result of the fusion between SNOMED RT and the Clinical Terms Version 3, a terminology previously known as Read Codes, created by the National Health Service (NHS) in England."]},{"title":"3 Term extraction methodology","paragraphs":["With the objective of indentifying medical terms, we have developed rules for “specific” NPs recognition. They were used for extracting terms and, as baseline, we consider the term extraction usually performed with NP. We applied it to Spanish, but it may be adapted to others languages, adjusting the linguistic informations of parsers used.","1","SNOMED CT R⃝ - http://www.nlm.nih.gov/ research/umls/Snomed/snomed_main.html - “ This material includes SNOMED Clinical Terms R⃝ (SNOMED CT R⃝), which is used with permission of the International Health Terminology Standards Development Organisation (IHTSDO). All rights reserved. SNOMED CT R⃝ was originally created by The College of American Pathologists. “SNOMED” and “SNOMED CT” are registered trademarks of the IHTSDO.”","According to Figure 1, the term extraction, carried out this work, starts with the delimitation of the domain and the corpus. Afterwards, it is necessary to perform an orthographic normalization, changing the corpus file codification to UTF-8. Also, line changes are removed to prevent problems with the tools for the morphological analysis. In the sequence, the tokenization and morphological analysis is carried out aiming at tagging words and punctuation marks.","This way, we developed NPs recognition rules (e.g., article + noun = “ NP”) to shape the NPs to be worked with. Phrase recognition allows the extraction of term candidates. At this stage, stopwords are removed of these candidates.","After cleaning the candidates, they are separated into lists of unigrams, bigrams, trigrams and higher than trigrams to allow evaluation. 3.1 Experiments For the experiments we used the IULA-UPF technical corpus2","that belongs to the health and medical domains. This corpus is composed of 12 texts in Spanish and the average of words per document is 8,207. With it, the IULA-UPF has also provided three reference term lists, containing a total of 697 unigrams (e.g. “ alergia” - allergy), 665 bigrams consisting of a name plus an adjective (e.g. “ ácido benzoico” - benzoic acid) and 82 trigrams formed by a name plus the preposition “de” plus another name (e.g. “ grupo de riesgo”).","From the corpus, we had to recognize noun phrases (NPs), prepositional phrases (PP), and nucleus verbal phrase (nvp).","The term extraction is detailed in Figure 1. The morphological analysis of corpus words was carried out using the SMORPH program (Aı̈t-Mokhtar, 1998), that is a finite-state part of speech tagger that Infosur3","Group has adapted to Spanish.

These rules are loaded into the MPS syntactic parser (Abbaci, 1999) that receives the SMORPH output as input.","Three different experiments were performed considering the noun phrase sub-classification.","For the first experiment (Exp. NP), all ex-of conjugation; c1: first conjugation; TDIAL: type of dialectal variety; est: standard; prde: preposition “ de”; prep: preposition; masc: male; cop: copulative; sg: singular, linsing: next line; pun: dot. pressions previously tagged as NPs were considered as term candidates. For the second one (Exp. S NP), after manual observations about the terms, some NP that could be relevant were subclassified. This subclassification considered the possibility that:","• the NP could be a verbal argument (NP VARG): “ detectó la bronconeumonı́a” (He detects bronchopneumonia). For it, the rule corresponding to the structure NP + svn = NP VARG was created.","• the NP could be an antecedent of a non-defining clause (NP NONDEF): “ el asma, que se traduce...” (asthma, which means). Here we took several rules and an example of them is NP + coma + relative + svn = NP NONDEF. Rules for non-defining clause recognition were created. For this work, we only considered that expression from the NP-antecedent until verb clause.","• the NP could be an item from an enumeration (NP ENUM): “ dolor de garganta, fiebre y tos” (headache, fever, and cough). An example of enumeration rule is NP + coma + NP + conjunction + NP = NOM COMP ENUM (Nominal complete enumeration).","• the NP could be in parentheses (NP PARENT): (fenoterol). The rule corresponding to the structure parentheses 748 + NP + parentheses = NP PARENT was created.","• the NP could be at the beginning of the clause (NP INIC): “ ...en los últimos años. El mecanismo inmunológico es...” (...in recent years. The immunological mechanism is...). In this case, for the construction of the rule, the endpoint of the previous sentence was considered: endpoint + NP = NP INIC. NP that appears at the beginning of clause was regarded as a candidate, because the candidate of this sentence position could be the subject or it could be a topicalized element. This rule considered that subjects and topicalized elements are relevant to the terminology extraction.","• the NP could be a argument of a prepositional phrase (PP) at the beginning of the clause (NP PPINIC): “ ...infección bacteriana. Para el diagnóstico...” (...bacterial infection. For diagnosis...). In the same way as in the previous case, the endpoint of the sentence was considered: endpoint + preposition + NP = NP PPINIC.","In the third experiment (Exp. S NP2), we used the subclassification of Exp. S NP and the NPs that are PP arguments were added: “ en estudios epidemiológicos” (in epidemiological studies).","In all experiments, the cleaning of the extracted terms was carried out aiming at removing the numerals. This cleaning consists of discarding of candidates composed only of one letter, stopwords from the extremities of the candidates, and candidates that fully corresponded to stopwords. We used the stoplist available in the Snowball Project5 and we added verb conjugations poder and deber and some words such as año (year), dı́as (days), algún (any), etc., totaling 733 stopwords.","Also, in the case of NP VERB, the right extremities svn were removed. For example, in the NP VERB “ se detectan 636 asmáticos” - (636 asthmatics were detected), after removing “se detectan” and cleaning this example, the candidate was reduced to: “ asmáticos” (asthmatics).","Subsequently, in order to allow further evaluation, term candidates were separated into term lists of unigrams, bigrams, trigrams. 5 Snowball Project - http://snowball.tartarus.","org/algorithms/spanish/stop.txt 3.2 Results and evaluation of experiments The number of extracted candidates is showed in Table 2.","Unigrams Bigrams Trigrams Experiment NP 1744 2684 1999 Experiment S NP 856 1172 824 Experiment S NP2 1188 1913 1419 Table 2: Number of extracted candidates.","Two automatic tests were carried out (Figure 1). In the first one, IULAreference lists were used to verify the quality of extracted candidates.","First of all, it was necessary to apply stemming techniques (PreTexT II tool (Soares et al., 2008)) to the extracted terms and reference term list, due to morphological variations in the words. Subsequently, it was possible to compare the extracted terms and the reference term list.","The accuracy and coverage for all three experiments (NP, S NP and S NP2) are showed in Figures 2, 3, and 4, respectively, for unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams. The figures are modified from Vivaldi and Rodrı́guez (2010) because they used the same corpus in their experiments, so, we also present a comparison between our and their results. In their work, EWN corresponds to the group of extracted terms using the YATE method (Vivaldi, 2001). The other terms were extracted with the Wikipedia categories (WP) having “Medicina” as domain name and varying the cal-culation of the domain coefficient. In WP.lc, the number of simple steps given in Wikipedia is considered; WP.lmc takes into consideration the mean number of paths in Wikipedia; WP.nc takes into consideration the number of paths in Wikipedia. It is important to notice that the extraction proposal of Vivaldi and Rodrı́guez only considered patterns with the following structures: (i) noun (for unigrams), (ii) noun + adjective (for bigrams), and (iii) noun + the “de” preposition + noun (for trigrams). This highly contrasts with our extraction that considers all possible combinations.","For the second test, the quality of the candidates was verified according to the SNOMED CTR⃝ list, which has 1,060,632 Spanish terms. Subsequently, the candidates that could be interesting for the medical domain were manually identified and, afterwards, we checked if those candidates were present or not in the SNOMED CT R⃝ list.

We were able to obtain the best coverage in the first experiments, in which we took all NPs as term candidates. Nevertheless, we expected those results because most of the candidates are obtained when all NPs are extracted, and it allows for a large coverage. However, we expected better accuracy rates for the cases with “specific NPs”.","In the comparison, we may see that the results obtained were similar to those of Vivaldi and Rodrı́guez in the case of unigrams, although they were able to obtain better results for bigrams and trigrams. Regarding this fact, we observed that the best accuracy rate was achieved with the experiments in which the NPs were part of an enumeration. Also, we emphasize the simplicity of our ex-750 traction method, which does not require external knowledge and was able to work well using the SMORPH dictionary and MPS recognition rules, also not considering only reference list patterns but all possibilities. In addition, better accuracy is expected by new and more specific MPS rules.","According to the results, we obtained three interesting contributions: (i) we were able to show the possibility of extracting medical terms from recognition of “specific NPs”, even that it is necessary improvements in the method; (ii) the SMORPH dictionary was improved with 2,445 new terms. Thus, we expect to have better experiments in the medical domain with this tool; (iii) other terms that were not present in the reference lists were also extracted. Those terms were tested with the SNOMED CT R⃝ and we obtained terms that could be added to the IULA reference lists, which means an improvement of these lists. At the same time, we observed that there were other terms with a different structure from “noun + the ‘de’ preposition + noun”. This evidences the fact that there exists important trigrams that do not necessarily fit to that pattern.","As future work, we intend to improvethe accuracy with new filtering rules, to increase the SMORPH dictionary, and to test the extraction rules in larger corpora and other domains."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["Thanks to Erasmus Mundus, CNPq, FAPESP y CONICET for financial support and to Vivaldi y Rodrı́guez for making available the dataset."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["F Abbaci. 1999.
