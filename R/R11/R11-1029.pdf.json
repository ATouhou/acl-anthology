In the past, a vast bulk of the research focused on the development of mono-lingual event extraction systems that operate on single documents without tak-ing any advantage of global evidence, i.e., without reusing the knowledge acquired in the process of extracting information from other topically-related documents. The advantages of going beyond the classical single-document extraction and exploiting information redundancy to validate facts have recently been explored by various research groups (Downey et al., 2005; Finkel et al., 2005; Ji and Grishman, 2008; Lee et al., 2010; Liao and Grishman, 2010; Mann, 2007; Patwardhan et al., 2007; Poibeau et al., 2008; Yangarber and Jokipii, 2005; Yangarber, 2006). Since nowadays many influential facts are not only reported multiple times by different sources, but also in different languages, the importance of the ability to aggregate and fuse information across documents in several languages is becoming paramount (Ji, 2010). Several experiments on cross-lingual information extraction have been reported (Chen et al., 2009; Sudo et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2010), however, they mainly focused on cross-lingual bootstrapping of ML-based event extraction systems.","This paper presents the results of an experiment aiming at exploring the usefulness of cross-lingual information fusion for refining the results of a real-time multilingual news event extraction engine that is deployed in a large-scale online news monitoring platform. To be more precise, we explored: (a) what fraction of event descriptions extracted could potentially be merged and refined through cross-lingual information fusion; and, (b) whether gain in precision/recall could be obtained. In principle, there are two ways of approaching cross-lingual information fusion in the context of multilingual news event extraction: (1) translate all news articles into one common language for which a high-performance event extraction system exists (e.g., English), and run that system on the translated news (including cross-article fusion), or (2) run mono-lingual event extraction on the native language news articles, then translate (normalize) automatically extracted event descriptions into one common language, and subsequently, perform information fusion. In this paper we explore the latter approach.","The remaining part of this paper is organized as follows. First, the real-time event extraction engine is presented in Section 2. Next, the creation and statistics of the test corpus are described in 210 Section 3. Subsequently, Sections 4 and 5 present the cross-lingual fusion technique and the results of the experiments. We end with some conclusions in Section 6."]},{"title":"2 Real-time Event Extraction Engine","paragraphs":["First, news articles are gathered by Europe Media Monitor (EMM) (Atkinson et al., 2009), a large-scale media monitoring platform1",", which currently retrieves a vast bulk of news articles per day from over 2500 news sources in all major languages. The news articles harvested in a last 4-hour time window are grouped into clusters according to content similarity, using hierarchical agglomerative clustering in a manner as described in (Piskorski et al., 2011).2","Then news article clusters are categorised using filters, which consist of boolean combinations of multilingual keywords and some metadata.","Next, each cluster is processed by NEXUS, the core event extraction engine, which initially performs shallow linguistic analysis, including, i.a., fine-grained tokenization, sentence splitting, domain-specific dictionary look-up (e.g., for the detection of numerical expressions, quantifiers, person titles, and for the labeling of key terms indicating unnamed person groups), and morphological analysis. In particular, for morphological analysis an extended version of the full-form MUL-TEXT3","lexica are used.","Subsequently, a cascade of finite-state extraction grammars4","is applied on each article in the cluster. The low-level grammars are primarily used for the detection of small-scale structures (e.g., person groups, which might potentially constitute a slot filler). The higher-level grammars consist of simple linear 1/2-slot extraction patterns, similar to those in (Riloff, 1996), e.g., PER-GROUP <VICTIM> \"was killed\" as-signs a group of persons followed by a phrase \"was killed\" the role of a victim. These patterns are applied only on the top sentences and the title of each article. The main rationale behind this","1","http://press.jrc.it","2","The article feature vectors are simple word count vectors and no lemmatization is performed.","3","http://nl.ijs.si/ME/","4","A grammar consists of pattern-action rules, where the left-hand side of a rule is a regular expression over nonrecursive typed feature structures (the recognition pattern) , whereas the right-hand side constitutes a list of feature structures, which will be returned in case the recognition pattern is matched. See (Piskorski, 2007) for more details. is that news articles are written in the invertedpyramid style.5","Secondly, analysing the entire text might involve handling complex language phenomena (e.g., anaphora resolution), which is hard and requires knowledge intensive processing. In particular, in the context of developing an event extraction system capable of processing news in several languages tackling more complex language phenomena would involve a substantial effort to provide the necessary language-specific resources. Finally, if some crucial information can not be captured from one article in the cluster (due to the simplistic approach mentioned before), it might be extracted from other articles in the same cluster. Let us consider as an example the following sentence. ‘The United Nations says Somali gunmen who hijacked a U.N.-chartered vessel carrying food aid for tsunami victims have released the ship after holding it for more than two months.’ The proper extraction of Somali gunmen as the actor of a RELEASE event would require some syntactical parsing to identify the relative clause that describes the Somali gunmen, otherwise the application of a linear extraction pattern might result in assigning the tsunami victims the actor role of the RELEASE event (incorrect). However, the title and the initial sentence of most of news articles on crisis-related events exhibit relatively simple syntactical structure, e.g., it would be more likely (based on empirical observations) that the same information as in our example is conveyed through a sentence like this: ‘Somali gunmen have released the ship after holding it for more than two months.’ Consequently, the application of the pattern PER-GROUP <ACTOR> \"have released\" would yield a correct extraction of Somali gunmen as the actor of the RELEASE event.","Since the information about events is scattered over different articles, the last step consists of cross-article cluster-level information fusion in order to produce full-fledged event descriptions, i.e., information extracted locally from each single article in the same cluster is aggregated and validated. This involves: (a) disambiguation on entity roles (as a result of application of extraction patterns the same entity might be assigned different 5","The most important parts of the story are placed in the beginning of the article and the least important facts are left toward the end. 211 roles), (b) computing an estimate of the total number of victims, and (c) event type classification, all accomplished through heuristics.6","It is important to note that NEXUS detects only the main event for each news article cluster (‘one sense per discourse’) (Gale et al., 1992), and 6 language-specific instances of the system have been developed to cover news in English, Italian, Spanish, French, Portuguese, and Russian. In particular, for each language extraction grammars and specialized lexica were acquired using weakly supervised ML techniques and validated by human experts. Noteworthy, certain part of the extraction grammars are shared among languages (Zavarella et al., 2008).","There are several differences in language-specific versions of NEXUS. Currently, Italian, French, Spanish and Portuguese versions fully rely on morphological analysis (MULTEXT), whereas Russian and English system instances do not, i.e., morphological features are not referred to in the extraction patterns. In addition, the Italian, Spanish and Portuguese systems deploy more (abstract) linguistic rules that constitute a partial parser of domain specific phrases. The overall number of extraction patterns used in the Italian, Spanish and Portuguese system varies from 100 to circa 400, whereas the English, French and Russian system deploy thousands of extraction patterns, mainly relying on surface-level text features. Another important difference is that the event type classification for English is done using a blend of category definitions and a statistical classifier, whereas the other 5 language-specific instances rely only on well-defined event category definitions. There are over 30 event category definitions, which can consist of a simple list of related keywords or a combination of lists of words. Most category definitions are defined using Boolean operators with optional proximity operator and wild cards. Alternatively, cumulative positive or negative weights and a threshold can be specified.","The briefly sketched cluster-centric approach to news event extraction, the process of acquisition of language specific resources for NEXUS, and other particularities of NEXUS are given in (Tanev et al.,","6","For instance, if the same entity has two roles assigned in the same news cluster, preference is given to the role assigned by the most reliable group of patterns, e.g., 2-slot extraction patterns are considered more reliable than 1-slot extraction patterns. In case of event type classification and victim count-ing heuristics similar in spirit to those described in (Piskorski et al., 2011) were used. 2008; Tanev et al., 2009; Piskorski et al., 2011). Some other effort aiming at constructing multilingual event extraction based on light-weight linguistic approach is presented in (Lejeune et al., 2010)."]},{"title":"3 Corpus and Event Statistics","paragraphs":["For exploring the potential of cross-lingual information fusion a corpus consisting of crisis-related event descriptions automatically extracted by NEXUS on 22 randomly selected (non-continuous) days in 2010 from news in 6 languages has been prepared. In particular, we focused on violent events and natural and man-made disasters. The set of slots we considered includes the following ones: TYPE, LOCATION, PERPETRATOR, DEAD, DEAD-COUNT, INJURED, INJURED-COUNT, KIDNAPPED, KIDNAPPED-COUNT, ARRESTED, WEAPONS.","The corpus consists of 618 event descriptions. Table 1 gives the statistics on the extracted event descriptions and news sources used. The 618 event descriptions extracted refer to 523 real-world events. Language #Event #Slots filled #Slots filled #News","descriptions in total on average sources English 268 963 3.59 783 Spanish 129 454 3.52 174 French 77 273 3.55 224 Italian 50 172 3.44 68 Russian 52 158 3.04 178 Portuguese 42 137 3.26 55 All 618 2157 3.49 1482 Table 1: The statistics of the extracted events.","Out of the 523 events 51 were reported in more then one language. This accounts for circa 9,8% of all extracted events that could be potentially refined through cross-lingual information fusion. The 51 events reported in more than one language include: 33 violence events, 7 natural disasters, 9 man-made disasters and 2 other crisis-related events. Noteworthy, 350 events out of the 523 were detected in non-English news. In the latter group of ’non English’ events only 7 were reported in more than two languages, which accounts for 2% of all events in this group. Hence, extraction from English news is crucial in the process of cross-lingual information fusion. The histogram in Figure 1 shows the number of languages in which news report on events in our corpus.","For the 51 events reported in more than one language we manually created the gold-standard 212"," 1 2 3 4 5 60.8 8 80 800 472 27 13 4 5 2 Number of languages in which news report an event N u m b e r  o f  E v e n t s Figure 1: The histogram showing the number of languages in which news report on events. stand-off annotations based on any information which could be found in news articles in all 6 languages. Furthermore, for the purpose of evaluating mono-lingual systems, we also created for each of the 51 events and a given language (i.e., for each mono-lingual news article cluster) a stand-off annotation based on information which could be found in that particular language only. In total, there were 4252 news articles that refer to the 51 events. In particular, the average number of news articles per cluster which correspond to an event in the set of the 51 events is: 29 (all languages), 55 (English), 16 (Spanish), 21 (Italian), 29 (French), 21 (Portuguese), and 8 (Russian). The annotation task (including the classification of the events) was jointly carried out by two annotators.","For the preparation of the test corpus and annotation, in particular, for linking (manually) of event descriptions across languages, the Event Moderation Tool (EMT) described in (Atkinson et al., 2011) has been used. EMT provides GUI-based tools that can: retrieve automatically extracted event descriptions gathered over time according to a number of different criteria (e.g., event type, date of occurrence, language, source and location), edit, validate, group, translate, and export them into other knowledge repositories.","The test corpus comes from Internet news articles that EMM scrapes and analyses on the fly. The scraped information is governed by copyrights and therefore cannot be reproduced by any means or form without infringement. Hence, as of now, the only corpus that we can provide to the research community are the links to the original articles accompanied with some additional information, i.e., the corresponding event ID that we generated (for 51 events reported in at least two languages) as well as the language of the underlying news article.

First, event descriptions extracted by mono-lingual systems are normalized, i.e., all non-numerical slot fillers are translated (converted) into English, whereas geographical names are mapped to their canonical forms using the multilingual GeoNames8","gazetteer. In the second step, for each event the corresponding normalized event descriptions are merged into one via the application of simple fusion methods. The computa-tion of the value of each slot in the ‘fused’ event description is based on the following general assumption: ‘If a candidate slot value (returned by at least one of the mono-lingual systems) occurs frequently (more than once) as a filler of a given slot in a collection of event descriptions referring to a certain real-world event, and if this value was ’on average’ extracted with high system confidence9",", and if it refers to a more specific concept than the other values in the candidate slot filler set, that increases the likelihood that this slot value is correct’.","Table 2 shows an example of system response (in as simplified form), i.e., event descriptions extracted by mono-lingual systems, and the result of cross-lingual fusion for an event related to U.S. drone strike that killed eight militants of German nationality in Islamabad.","We now present the fusion method more for-mally. First, let E denote an event. We denote the set of automatically extracted event descriptions that refer to E as ED = {e1, . . . , ek}, where ei is a set of slot-value pairs. The value of slot x in the event description e is denoted as e(x). We extend this notion to a set of values for slot x in an event description collection ED(x) = {v|∃e ∈ ED ∧ e(x) = v}.

Let e∗","denote the event description resulting from merging the event descriptions in ED using fusion method M , which is defined as follows:","e∗ (x) = argmax","v∈ED(x) ScoreM (x, v) where ScoreM (x, v) denotes a scoring function specific to method M .

For instance, in ED(LOCAT ION ) = {Spain, Andalucia, Algeciras}, Algeciras would be boosted by β · 2 since Algeciras is a part of Andalucia and Spain. Hence, Algeciras gets","10","The confidence is based on a combination of factors, e.g., the reliability of the pattern(s) used to extract a particular value (the likelihood that pattern extract the slot value correctly), the number of articles in which some patterns were triggered (frequency), the overall confidence of the language-specific instance of the event extraction system, etc.","11","A small in-house ontology was used for this purpose. a higher chance of being selected as the location of the event. α and β were set differently for different slot types.","As for numerical slots, the fusion was done in a slightly different way. First of all, the definition of ScoreM (x, v) was simplified since the last part (β) does not apply to numbers, and secondly, in case of candidate values, which are significantly distant one from another we selected a maximum (provided that confidence of extracting it is higher than a pre-specified constant), based on a simple assumption that the event is most likely evolving and numbers change continuously, the highest being the more up-to-date one. It is not necessarily the case that the last news article on a certain event reports the most up-to-date figures since there is certain latency between reporting on a given event in different countries. Therefore, we chose the ’maximum’ heuristic."]},{"title":"5 Experiments","paragraphs":["We have applied the cross-lingual fusion technique presented in Section 4 on the corpus described in Section 3 and we measured extraction precision, recall and F-measure for each language-specific system instance and for the extraction based on cross-lingual information fusion. It is important to note that we assigned basically three scores (for non-numerical slots) for filling each slot: 0 (incorrect), 1 (correct), and 0.5 (partially correct), where ’partially correct’ is assigned in cases where the slot fill represents a more generic concept than the one in the gold-standard, or in case of locations, if the slot fill refers to an administrative unit, which encompasses the specific place of an event, e.g., if the event happened in Islamabad, we assign the slot fill Pakistan the score ’partially correct’.","Event Type Location","P R F P R F English 86.6 80.7 83.5 82.6 80.7 81.6 Spanish 80.4 61.7 69.8 85.5 85.5 85.5 French 83.3 70.0 76.1 68.8 66.0 67.4 Italian 67.8 63.3 65.5 86.7 86.7 86.7 Russian 81.3 28.3 42.0 61.4 58.7 60.0 Portuguese 73.7 59.2 65.7 87.5 55.6 66.7 FUSION 91.3 84.3 87.6 87.3 87.3 87.3 Table 3: Precision, recall and F-measure figures for the extraction of event type and location.","The overall precision and recall figures is shown in Figure 2.

As can be observed, a gain of 4-5% and 8% in precision and recall could be obtained for the extraction of event type and numerical slots respectively. The precision for extracting locations and non-numerical slots for the best-scoring mono-lingual system is better than the result of cross-lingual fusion. However, the recall for the same slot types is 0.6% and 2.7% respectively higher in case of cross-lingual fusion.","A small error analysis of cross-lingual fusion was carried out. In case of fusing event type information, it turned out that for 5 out of 51 events in our corpus none of the mono-lingual systems was able to assign any type information. Consequently, the cross-lingual fusion did not result in any improvement in case of those events, i.e., no type information was assigned. In case of 2 other events, all of the mono-lingual systems returned incorrect event type information, which resulted in incorrect cross-lingual fusion. Furthermore, in case of 2 events, the cross-lingual fusion resulted in selection of an event type (extracted by at least one of the mono-lingual systems), which is related to the event type in the gold standard (partially correct extraction), but the latter was not detected by any mono-lingual system. Finally, for 1 event, the cross-lingual fusion resulted in selection of an incorrect event type, although the correct event type was detected by at least one of the mono-lingual systems. The analysis of fusing location information revealed that: (a) in case of 3 events a wrong location was selected, although at least one of the mono-lingual system returned the correct answer, (b) for 4 events the returned location was partially correct, and (c) for 2 events none of the mono-lingual systems provided a correct answer, and, consequently, the error was propagated in the fusion process."]},{"title":"6 Conclusions and Future Work","paragraphs":["We presented the results of preliminary explorations on using cross-lingual information fusion to improve the recall/precision of a large-scale multilingual event extraction system. Circa 10% of event descriptions extracted by the mono-lingual systems could be refined, and a gain of 6,4% and 4,8% in the overall recall and precision could be obtained respectively. Since we limited the time window for grouping event descriptions referring to a given event to 1 day only the aforementioned figure of 10% constitutes an approximation of a lower bound for the fraction of crisis-related event descriptions, which can be potentially refined through cross-lingual information fusion. An effort is envisaged to create (multilingual) temporal event chains (Ji et al., 2009), which go beyond 1-day time window, for further explorations on the potential of cross-lingual information fusion for refining event extraction results.","Although the reported improvement in precision and recall appears to be promising, to better assess the actual impact of exploiting multilinguality for refining event descriptions an evaluation of the improvement achieved by merging information from different sources in the same language is planned too. In order to get a better insight into the real contribution of exploiting 215 news in each language a direct one-to-one comparison between the English system (the one with the highest impact) and each of the mono-lingual systems will be carried out too.","Furthermore, we intend to explore the usefulness of deploying cross-lingual information fusion in the context of extracting other types of events. For instance, in (Atkinson et al., 2011) we elaborate on the specifics of reporting on border security-related events (e.g., illegal migration at-tempts, cross-border crimes, etc.) in online news, which revealed that suchlike events are intuitively less likely to benefit from cross-lingual information fusion.","Future work will also focus on exploring more elaborated fusion techniques (Ji and Grishman, 2008) and comparison with the approach based on translating news articles into one common language and running event extraction and information fusion on the translated articles. Although several authors reported that such an approach is error-prone due to inaccuracy of the state-of-the-art machine translation techniques, it has not been evaluated in the context of a cluster-centric and linguistically-lightweight approach to event extraction as described in this paper.","Our event extraction engine processes only the title and top sentences of each news article. However, processing additional ‘relevant’ sentences, which could be selected through deployment of some time-efficient sentence ranking measures (Litvak et al., 2010), might lead to a better coverage and is considered to be explored in the future. The inclusion of additional sentences in the event extraction process might also help to estimate the fraction of information which is being missed by the current event extraction engine.","With the emergence of social media, one can observe an ever growing trend of reporting on the same event in many different languages. For instance, the GLOBAL VOICES12","is a community of bloggers and translators around the globe, who link and translate articles/posts on certain events and issues that are not usually present in international mainstream media. Therefore, we plan to carry out experiments on deploying cross-lingual information fusion techniques to refine event extraction from suchlike information sources.","Although the experiments reported in this paper are preliminary, we strongly believe that the 12 http://globalvoicesonline.org presented work and discussion constitutes useful source of information for researchers and practitioners working on advancing event extraction technology."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["We are greatly indebted to all our colleagues in the OPTIMA action at the Joint Research Centre, who are working on EMM.
