There are a number of works about Sentiment Analysis (SA) studying the task of identifying the polarity, whether the opinion expressed in a text is positive or negative about a given topic. Howe ve r , mos t of re s ea r ch is focused on English texts and there are very few resources for other languages. In this wor k we present an Opinion Corpus for Arabic (OCA) composed of Arabic reviews extracted from specialized web pages related to movies and films using this language. Moreover, we have translated the OCA corpus into English, generating the EVOCA corpus (English Version of OCA). In the experiments carried out in this work we have used different machine learning algorithms to classify the polarity in these corpora showing that, although the experiments with EVOCA are worse than OCA, the results are comparable with other English experiments, since the loss of precision due to the translation is very slight."]},{"title":"1. I ntro d uc t io n","paragraphs":["Nowadays, the interest in Opinion Mining (OM) has grown significantly due to different factors. On the one hand, the rapid evolution of the World Wide Web has changed our view of the Internet. It has turned into a collaborative framework where technological and social trends come together, resulting in the over exploited term Web 2.0. On the other hand, the tremendous use of e-commerce services has been accompanied by an increase in freely available online reviews and opinions about products and services . A customer who wants to buy a product usually searches information on the Internet trying to find other consumer analyses. In fact, web sites such as Amazon1",", Epinions2","or IMDb3",", can affect the customer decision.","1 http://www.amazon.com 2 http://www.epinions.com Moreover, the automatic Sentiment Analysis (SA) i s useful not only for individual customer but also for any company or institution. However, the huge amount of information makes necessary to accomplish new methods and strategies to tackle the problem.","Thus, SA is becoming one of the main research areas that combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Text Mining (TM). This new discipline attempts to identify and analyze opinions and emotions. It includes several subtasks such as subjectivity detection, polarity classification, review summariza-tion, humor detection, emotion classification, sentiment transfer, and so on [9]. H o wever, most of works related to OM are oriented to use English language. Perhaps due to the novelty of the task, there are very few papers analyzing the opinions using other languages different to English. In this paper, we present the experiments accomplished with an Opinion Corpus for A r a b i c (OCA) collected from different web pages with comments about movies. In addition, we have used automatic machine translation tools to translate OCA corpus into English. We have generated different classifiers using Support Vector Ma c h i n e and Naïve Bayes in order to determinate the polarity of the opinions. The experiments carried out with the English Version of OCA (EVOCA) s h o w that, although we lost precision in the translation, the results are comparable to other works using English texts. So, we can use this procedure in order to determ i n e the polarity of an Arabic corpus by using English translation. This is important because most of resources are in English and we can take advantage of t h i s s i tua ti on .","The paper is organized as following: Next section presents some papers about OM using non-English language.

Thus, it is important to develop resources for h el pin g r esearcher to work with these languages.","There are some interesting papers that h a ve st udied the problem using non-English collections. For example, Denecke [5] worked on German comments collected from Amazon. These reviews were translated into English using standard machine translation software. Then the translated reviews were classified as positive or negative, using three different classifiers: LingPipe7, SentiWordNet [6] with classification rule, and SentiWordNet with machine learning.","Zhang et al.

Ghorbel and Jacot [7] used a corpus with movie reviews in French. They applied a supervised classification combined with SentiWordNet in order to determinate the polarity of the reviews.","Agić et al. [2] presented a manually annotated corpus with news on the financial market in Croatia. Boldrini et al. [4] aimed to build up a corpus with a fi n e-gained annotation scheme for the detection of subjective elements. The data were collected manually from 300 blogs in three different languages: Spanish, Italian and English.","Regarding opinion mining for Arabic language, Ahmad et al. [3] performed a local grammar approach for three languages: Arabic, Chinese and English using financial news. They selected and compared the distribution of words in a domain-specific document to the distribution of words in a general corpus.","Finally, Abbasi et al.

Some of these difficulties are stated below:","","• Nonsense and non related comments. M a n y reviews in different web pages are not related to the topic. People attempt to comment on any - thing, even with unrelated words or nonsense. For instance, instead of comment an item, the user just types a word:","","Thaaaaaaanks روووووووكشم =","","• Romanization of Arabic. Many comments use the Roman alphabet. Each phoneme in Arabic can be replaced by its counterpart in the Roman alphabet. This can be due to non-use of Arabic keyboards for people who comment on Arabic topics from abroad. For instance, Table 1 shows a fragment explaining the problem of commenting on a topic using the Roman alphabet. There are also possible variants in the case of Romanization of Arabic for the above example, taking into account the diacritics in the Arabic language.

Some of them use a rating scale of 10 points, so reviews with less than five points are classified as negative while those with a rating between five and 10 points are classified as positive. Other blogs use a 5-rating scale. In these cases, we considered the movies with three, four and five points as positive, while those with less than three points were classified as negative. This classification was based on a deep study of the reviews which were rated as neutral. Finally, we also found binary classifications such as good or bad.  Table 3.

Rapid Miner is an environment for machine learning and data mining processes.","We have applied two of the most used classifiers: Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Naïve Bayes (NB).","SVM [11] is based on the structural risk minimization principle from the computational learning theory, and seek a decision surface to separ a t e t h e training data points into two classes and makes decisions based on the support vectors that are selected as the only effective elements in the training set.","On the other hand, NB algorithm [8] is based on the Bayes theorem. Due to its complex calculation, the algorithm has to make two main assumptions: first, it considers the Bayes denominator invariant, and second, it assumes that the input variables are con ditional independence.","",""," 6","http://rapid-i. com","","","In our experiments, the 10-fol d cr oss-validation has been used in order to evaluate the classifier. This evaluation has been carried out on three main measures: precision (P), recall (R) and F1 m ea sur e [10].","Moreover, for each machine learning algorithm, we h a ve analyzed how the use of stemmer a ffe ct s t h e experiments. TF·IDF has been used as weighting scheme. We have also accomplished several experiments using different n-grams models. However, the obtained results with bi-gra m s an d tri gr am s wer e ver y similar to unigrams. For this reason we have only shown the best results obtained with unigrams. Results for SVM and NB are shown in Table 5 and Ta-bl e 6, respectively.","As we can see, taking into account the F1 measure, all the experiments with OCA over com e EVOCA except when we use SVM and stemmer. In fact, this is the only case where stemmer obtains a better result although the impr ovem en t i s ver y sl i gh t (+1.54%).

On the EVOCA corpus the difference is higher for SVM +15.37% and +9.73%, using stemmer and without using it, respectively. Although the differences between SVM and NB over the OCA corpus are small, when they are applied over EVOCA, NB loses too much precision. In this case, the translation is affecting highly the results.","Finally, we h a ve analyzed the impact of the stemmer in the experiments. As can be observed in both Table 5 an d Ta bl e 6, in all cases the stemming process gets worse results except when we use SVM on the EVOCA corpus (+1.63% for stemming).
