All these points are really relevant when compiling a corpus. However, we consider that usually one of them is underestimated: the interface design. When Hovy (2010) mentions this aspect, he mainly refers to the annotation interface. We think that the annotation interface is important but, as well, that, if there is an available annotation interface suitable for the purposes of a corpus project, it can be used. Nevertheless, we consider that an interface allowing users to consult or download the corpus’ texts, and even carrying out searches (both statistics and linguistics) over a selected subcorpus, is really useful and necessary.","Compiling and annotating an adequate corpus is not a trivial task; it implies lots of people, resources, time and effort. Thus, we consider that it is important to develop a friendly and useful interface to be able to exploit the created corpus, and transform it into a most accessible resource. Therefore, in this article, we present the on-line interface that we have developed in order to include the RST Spanish Treebank (da Cunha et al., 2011). The RST Spanish Treebank is the first corpus including Spanish texts annotated with rhetorical relations of the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) by Mann and Thompson (1988). It contains texts from nine specialized domains (Astrophysics, Earthquake Engineering, Economy, Law, Linguistics, Mathematics, Medicine, Psychology and Sexuality). It includes 52,746 words, 267 texts, 2,256 sentences and 3,349 discourse segments. The segmentation criteria are similar to those employed by da Cunha et al. (2011). Each text was tagged by 1 person, from a team of 10 RST expert annotators. There is a 31% of the corpus double-annotated. The corpus is not annotated with syntactic structure, although we are conscious this would be interesting. The corpus will be useful for the 698 development of a rhetorical parser for this language and several other applications related to computational linguistics (automatic translation, automatic summarization, information extraction, etc.). In addition, this corpus will be helpful for researchers and students interested on the analysis of rhetorical relations. Thus, before the search interface design, we wondered which kind of information they would need for their discourse studies. We considered that they would like to know the quantity of discourse segments included in a corpus (for example, to compare the discourse complexity among languages), the number of rhetorical relations of each type (for example, to try to characterize the discourse of a genre, a domain or a language, in the same line of Iruskieta and da Cunha, 2011), or to extract text passages corresponding to some rhetorical relations (for example, to determine how these relations are explicit in the text and if they are marked with discourse connectors). With these possible needs in mind, we have developed some search tools and we have included them in the interface. Thus, the interface allows users to consult or download the texts and their corresponding annotations and, in addition, it allows carrying out several statistical and linguistic searches over a selected subcorpus. The interface is available in: http://www.corpus.unam.mx/rst/.","In Section 2, we present some previous work. In Section 3, we explain the development of the interface: the website, the annotated texts selection and downloading interface, the search tools (statistical and linguistic), the annotated texts uploading interface and the administrator interface. In Section 4, we establish some conclusions and future work."]},{"title":"2 Previous Work","paragraphs":["Nowadays, there are lots of corpora containing texts annotated at different levels (morphological, syntactic, semantic, etc.), for the majority of the most used languages. Despite this fact, there are not so many corpora annotated with rhetorical relations. The most used rhetorical framework for this task is the RST, an independent language theory departing from the idea that a text can be segmented into Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs) linked by means of nucleus-satellite or multinuclear rhetorical relations. In the first case, the satellite gives additional information about the other one, the nucleus, on which it depends. Some examples are the relations of Antithesis, Background, Cause, Reformulation or Result. In the second case, several elements, all nuclei, are connected at the same level, that is, there are no elements dependent on others and they all have the same importance with regard to the intentions of the author of the text. They are the relations of Contrast, List, Joint or Sequence, among others.","Until now, there were RST corpora only for three languages: English (Carlson et al., 2002; Taboada and Renkema, 2008), German (Stede, 2004) and Portuguese (Pardo et al., 2008; Pardo and Seno, 2005). These RST corpora suppose an important step on the RST research and they have been very useful to develop several applications, like information extraction, text generation, automatic summarization, etc. Each one has some advantages and disadvantages, related to the number of included texts and words, the annotation systematicity, the texts’ domain heterogeneity, the amount of double-annotated texts (to measure the agreement between annotators), etc. (see da Cunha et al., 2011) Nevertheless, we consider that there is one limitation shared by almost all these corpora: the lack of a free on-line corpus interface, to consult the corpus and to carry out searches over it. Most of these corpora offer a folder containing all the annotated texts individually into the format of the annotation interface RSTtool (O'Donnell, 2000). The only one offering a search tool (allowing to users to search at different linguistic levels) is the German Potsdam Commentary Corpus (Stede, 2004), although, to our knowledge, this tool is not available on-line."," "]},{"title":"3 Developing the Interface ","paragraphs":["In this section, we explain all the aspects regarding the developing of the interface. 3.1 The Website The RST Spanish Treebank is free for research purposes and it can be consulted or downloaded by means of the on-line interface we have developed for it. Ide and Pustejovsky (2010) mention several different kinds of documentation which a corpus project must provide. Following these guideliness, the website including the RST Spanish Treebank contains a high level description of the resource for non-specialist public, annotation guidelines, information on the theoretical framework, project documentation (location, personnel, contact, etc.), corpus documentation, among other information. 699","The RST Spanish Treebank interface and all the related information are written in Spanish, although they will be also in English soon.","3.2 Annotated Texts Selection and Downloading Interface The RST Spanish Treebank interface allows the visualization and downloading of all the original documents in plain text format (txt), with their corresponding annotated trees in RSTtool format (rs3), as well as in image format (png). Each text includes its title, its reference, its web link (if it is an on-line text) and its number of words.","The copyright of the texts included in a corpus is a polemical subject. Usually, written authorization to the authors of the texts must be requested in order to include the texts in a corpus. However, as Sierra (2008) explains, there are exceptions or limits in some cases. One of them is the case of non-profit research projects, where only passages of texts (not complete texts) are provided and their origin and corresponding bibliographic reference are stated. This is precisely the case of the RST Spanish Treebank, since it is a non-profit research project which provides the corpus through an interface that includes only passages of the original texts (for example, abstracts of scientific articles, sections of webpages, thesis introductions, etc.) and the bibliographic references (and links, in the cases of electronic publications) of all the documents.","The interface shows texts by areas and allows the user to select a subcorpus (including individual files and/or folders containing several files). The selection of the subcorpus can be saved on local disk (generating an xml file including the IDs of the selected texts) for future analyses.","As the RST Spanish Treebank is a growing corpus, our interface is dynamic too, in order to be able to do changes (for example, to include new domains categories) without modifying the interface code. To solve this challenge, we have developed an in-house program that recursively reads the entire corpus’ directory and creates a general xml with the information of each document (as location, number of words, etc.). As well, at the same time, this program creates an individual xml for each file, which contains its bibliographic reference, origin, among other data.","Appendix A includes a screenshot of the texts selection and downloading interface. 3.3 Search Tools Until now, we have developed four search tools, which are included in the RST Spanish Treebank interface. Three of them are statistical; the other one is linguistic. The four tools are developed in Perl and can be applied over the total corpus or over a subcorpus selected by the user.  3.3.1 Statistic Tools Firstly, users can know the number of words of the selected subcorpus automatically and in real time. This tool is simple but it is important, because it allows the user to increase or decrease his subcorpus easily regarding his research aims.","Secondly, users may obtain the number of EDUs of the selected corpus, using the tool RST_stats_EDUs. This tool analyses automatically the rs3 archives of the selected subcorpus and it calculates the amount of EDUs present into these texts. This tool is useful to have an idea of the discourse “potential” of a corpus.","Thirdly, the interface includes a statistical tool that allows obtaining statistics of rhetorical relations in a subcorpus selected by the user. It is called RST_stats_Rel. We consider that this is the most useful tool, because the user may carry out statistical researches about the rhetorical relations existing into the texts of the studied corpus, which usually are performed by hand. The RSTtool also offers this option but it can be only used for one text at time. We consider that it is more useful for the user to obtain statistics from various texts, so as to get significant statistical results. As the RSTtool, our tool allows to count the multinuclear relations in two ways: a) one unit for each detected multinuclear relation, and b) one unit for each detected nucleus. For example, Figure 1 shows a RST tree containing a multinuclear relation of Contrast. If we select the strategy a), the tool will count 1, and if we select the strategy b), the tool will count 2.","","","English translation: One patient was found in breathing acidosis, whereas 5 presented","chronic breathing alkalosis.","","Figure 1: Example of multinuclear Contrast relation ","Table 1 contains the list of the nucleus-satellite relations of the RST Spanish Treebank, 700 with the number and percentage of rhetorical relations, calculated by RST_stats_Rel.

This tool allows the user to select a subcorpus and to extract from it the EDUs corresponding to the rhetorical relation selected, like a multidocument specialized summarizer guided by user's interests. This tool might be useful, for example, to elaborate a compendium of results of diverse medical articles about a certain topic (selecting the relation of Result) or to compile a state of the art about one topic (selecting the relation of Background). At present some monodocument summarizers based on RST exist for some languages (Marcu 2000; Pardo and Rino, 2001; da Cunha et al., 2007, among others), but, at our knowledge, no multidocument specialized RST summarizers exist. We can mention here the works about multidocument summarization for Portuguese based on the Cross-document Structure Theory (CSS) (Radev, 2000), a theory derived from RST (Jorge and Pardo, 2010). Figure 2 contains a passage of the output of the RST_extract, applying it over the subcorpus of Sexuality and selecting the rhetorical relation of Result (the English tranlation is ours). We show 3 of the 20 extracted Result satellites.                      Figure 2: Example of the output of RST_extract ","RST_extract uses as input the rs3 files from RSTTool. Due to the complexity of this kind of format, for the moment, our tool only extracts satellites of nucleus-satellite relations, being simple EDUs (not SPANs). 3.4 Annotated Texts Uploading Interface The RST Spanish Treebank interface also includes a screen that permits the users to send comments, suggestions, and also to send their se00028.rs3: La hipertrofia del epitelio produce acantosis y la aparición de papiloma de 3 meses a 2 años después del inicio de la infección.","The epithelium hypertrophy causes","acanthosis and the occurrence of","papilloma from 3 months to 2 years","after the beginning of the infection.  se00032.rs3: Las complicaciones más graves de la enfermedad inflamatoria pélvica son la esterilidad y embarazo ectópico secundario.","The most severe complications of the","pelvic inflammatory illness are the","sterility and the secondary ectopic","pregnancy.  se00032.rs3: La infección puede ascender y dar como resultado salpingitis, abscesos tubo-ováricos y enfermedad inflamatoria pélvica.","The infection can rise and to give as","result salpingitis, tube-ovarian","abscesses and pelvic inflammatory","illness.  701 own annotated texts. Our aim is for the RST Spanish Treebank to become a dynamic corpus, in constant evolution, increasing with texts annotated by users. This has a double advantage since, on the one hand, the corpus will grow and, on the other hand, users will profit from the interface's applications, using their own subcorpora. The only requirement is to use the relations and the segmentation and annotation criteria of our project. Once the texts are sent, the RST Spanish Treebank data manager will verify if the annotation corresponds to these criteria. 3.5 Administrator Interface The sustainability of a language resource is a crucial aspect. As Ide and Pustejovsky (2010) assess, “means for resource preservation and maintenance should be established prior to publication to ensure continued availability [...]. In the case where resources are distributed via the web [...], ensured sustainability is the reponsibility of the resource developer”. Having this requirement in mind, we have a data manager who is the responsible for the administration of the RST Spanish Treebank and its interface. This manager is the person in charge of the new texts and information that will be included in the corpus (both texts from users and texts selected by our research team). Data manager work is important because, although a part of the task is automatic (texts uploading), the texts data (ID, title, bibliographic reference and link) are included semi-automatically.","The administrator interface is divided in two parts. The first one is a program that connects to the server through Secure Shell Protocol; using this application, the data manager can upload all the files to be added at the corpus and set their location. The second part of the administrator interface is an on-line template that includes four fixed fields (text ID, title, reference and link). Once the documents are uploaded and their templates are filled, the data manager can press an update button. This button brings up to date the general xml of the corpus and the individual xml of each file, and executes the first statistical tool to count the number of words of each new file at the server."]},{"title":"4 Conclusions","paragraphs":["In this paper, we have presented the RST Spanish Treebank interface that we have developed in order to include the RST Spanish Treebank, the first corpus containing Spanish texts annotated with RST relations. As we have shown, this interface allows users to consult or download the texts and their corresponding annotations freely and on-line. Moreover, it allows carrying out several statistical and linguistic searches over a selected subcorpus. We consider this interface is necessary and useful to exploit all the data contained in a corpus, which in this case will be in continuous growth.","We think that this work means an important step for the RST research in Spanish. Additionally, the RST Spanish Treebank and its interface will be useful to carry out diverse researches about RST in this language. These researches can be developed both from a descriptive point of view (contrastive analysis among specialized texts from different domains, analysis of genres, analysis of discourse markers, etc.) and an applied point of view (development of discourse parsers, development of natural language processing applications, like automatic summarization, automatic translation, information extraction, etc.). In addition, we consider that this interface would be useful to contain and analyze automatically RST corpora for other languages, because the interface architecture would allow it without too much adaptation effort.","As future work, we would like to insert a sentence segmentator (in order to count sentences automatically) and to optimize the RST_extract tool (in order to extract satellites and nuclei being SPANs, not only EDUs).
