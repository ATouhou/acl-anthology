The task of cognates identification is widely used in historical and comparative linguistics, in the study of languages relatedness (Chin et al, 2010), phylogenetic inference (Atkinson et al, 2005) and in identifying how and to what extent languages changed over time. Besides these research a-reas, in which the genetic relationships between words are extremely relevant, cognates have been successfully used in other fields, such as language acquisition, bilingual word recognition (Dijkstra et al, 2012), corpus linguistics (Simard et al, 1992), cross-lingual information retrieval (Buckley et al, 1998) and machine translation (Knight et al, 2003). In these domains, the term “cognates” is usually used with a somewhat different meaning, denoting words with high orthographic/phonetic and cross-lingual meaning similarity, the condi-tion of common etymology being left aside. Kondrak (2001) makes the distinction between the different interpretations of the notion and Inkpen et al (2005) present the definition of “genetic cognates”.","In this paper we focus on genetic relationships between words and we use the term “cognates” in a broader meaning, counting as cognates the word-etymon pairs as well. Our motivation is that these pairs of words also share a common ancestor, thus complying with the cognates’ definition. For example, the Romanian word campion (meaning champion) has Italian etymology and the etymon campione, which has Latin etymology and the etymon campione(m). Thus, the Romanian word campion and the Italian word campione are cognates, as they share a common Latin ancestor.","The paper is organized as follows: we introduce our approach to cognates identification in Section 2. We describe the corpus used for our research in Section 3. We present several orthographic approaches used for cognates identification in Section 4. We evaluate these metrics and analyse the results of our experiments in Section 5. Finally, we draw some conclusion regarding our research in Section 6."]},{"title":"2 Our Approach","paragraphs":["We focus on the Romanian language and we investigate its cognate pairs with two other Romance languages, French and Italian. We believe this comparison is interesting for the following reason: the two related languages differ significantly with respect to their orthographic depth: the mapping rules between graphemes and phonemes are more complex for French, which has a deep orthography, than for Italian, which has a highly phonemic orthography.","We identify the etymologies and etymons of the Romanian words using dexonline 1","machine-readable dictionary, which is an aggregator for over 30 Romanian dictionaries. By parsing its definitions, we are able to automatically extract information regarding words’ etymologies and etymons. The most frequently used pattern is shown below. 1 http://dexonline.ro 141 <abbr class=\"abbrev\" title=\"limba language_name\"> language_abbreviation </abbr> <b> etymon </b>","As an example, we provide below an excerpt from a dexonline entry which uses this pattern to specify the etymology of the Romanian word capitol (which means chapter). When more options are possible for explaining a word’s etymology, dexonline provides multiple etymologies. We account for all the given alternatives, enabling our method to provide more accurate results. In our example, the word capitol has double etymology: Latin (with the etymon capitulum) and Italian (with the etymon capitolo). <b> CAPÍTOL </b> <abbr class=\"abbrev\" title=\"limba italiana\"> it. </abbr> <b> capitolo </b> <abbr class=\"abbrev\" title=\"limba latina\"> lat. </abbr> <b> capitulum </b>","After determining the etymologies of the Romanian words, we translate in French all words without French etymology and in Italian all words without Italian etymology using Google Translate 2",". We consider cognate candidates pairs formed of Romanian words and their translations. Using French3","and Italian4","dictionaries, we extract etymology-related information for French and Italian words. To identify cognates we compare, for each pair of candidates, the etymologies and the etymons. If they match, we identify the words as being cognates. Our solu-tion for addressing cognates identification answers Swadesh’s question, as cited in (Campbell, 2003): “Given a small collection of likely-looking cognates, how can one definitely determine whether they are really the residue of common origin and not the workings of pure chance or some other factor?”, as we limit the analysis only to words that share a common etymology, i.e. words that are known to be related.","For example, for the Romanian word victorie, dexonline reports Latin etymology and the etymon victoria. Because this word does not have Italian etymology, we assume it might have a cognate 2 http://translate.google.com 3 http://www.cnrtl.fr/etymologie 4 http://www.sapere.it/sapere/dizionari.html pair in Italian. Consequently, we translate it in Italian, obtaining the word vittoria. We consider the words victorie and vittoria cognate candidates. Using the Italian dictionary we identify, for this word, Latin etymology and the etymon victoria. We compare etymologies and etymons for the Romanian word and its translation in Italian and, as they match, having a common ancestor (Latin) and the same etymon (victoria), we identify them as a cognate pair."]},{"title":"3 The Corpus","paragraphs":["We apply our method on a high-quality Romanian corpus comprising of the transcription of the parliamentary debates held between 1996 and 2007 in the Romanian Parliament, recently proposed in (Grozea, 2012). The sessions deal with a wide variety of topics regarding the political, social and economic fields. In this paper we decided to run our experiments using words extracted from a large corpus of transcribed spoken language, in order to investigate the cognates that are most frequently used in Romanian. This dataset covers particular cases in the task of cognates identification, such as cognates between which the degree of orthographic similarity is low (for example the Romanian word atotputernicie, which means almightiness, and its French cognate pair omnipotence, both sharing the Latin etymon omnipotentia) and vice versa, non-cognates that resemble one another (for example the Romanian word mănăstire, meaning monastery and having the Old Slavic etymon monastyrı́, and its Italian translation monastero, having the Latin etymon monasteriu(m)).","Many words have undergone transformations by the augmentation of language-specific diacritics when entering a new language. From an orthographic perspective, the resemblance of words is higher between words without diacritics than between words with diacritics. For example, the similarity seems lower for the Romanian word amiciti̧e (which means friendship) and its French cognate pair amitié than for their corresponding forms without diacritics, amicitie and amitie. For this reason, we investigate the performances of the orthographic approaches to the task of cognates identification using two versions of the corpus: with and without diacritics included.","For preprocessing this corpus, we removed words that are irrelevant for our investigation, such 142 as dates and numbers and all the transcribers’ descriptions of the parliamentary sessions (such as “The session began at 8:40.” ), as we focus on the spoken language. We performed word segmenta-tion, using whitespace and punctuation marks as delimiters, we lower-cased all words and we removed stop words, using a list of Romanian stop words provided by Apache Lucene 5","text search engine library . We lemmatized the words using dexonline, which provides information regarding the words’ inflected forms and enables us to correctly identify lemmas where no part-of-speech or semantic ambiguities arise (in this case we consider the first occurred lemma)."]},{"title":"4 Orthographic Approaches","paragraphs":["Various word distances have been used in the task of string similarity computation. They have been applied in many different research areas, besides cognates identification, such as sentence alignment (Brew and McKelvie, 1996), record linkage (Jaro, 1989), stemming (Dalbelo and Snajder, 2009) and bioinformatics (Dinu and Sgarro, 2006). In (Kondrak, 2001) some of the most widely used measures are analysed, and their flaws and the differences between them are emphasized.","The approaches used to evaluate cognate pairs are divided in two groups: phonetic and orthographic. The orthographic approaches are usually used in corpus linguistics (Kondrak, 2001). We employ our method of identifying cognates to evaluate the extent to which lexical similarity can be used for automatic detection of cognates. We investigate some orthographic approaches widely used in this research area and some original metrics as well.","In (Inkpen et al, 2005) several orthographic similarity measures are used for the classification of pairs of words as cognates or false friends. For our investigation we chose some of the distances used in this paper, another distance that was successfully employed for record linkage and also an original metric in the field of cognates identification, rank distance.","• Levenshtein distance (Levenshtein, 1965), also named the edit distance, counts the minimum number of operations (insertion, dele-tion and substitution) required to transform one string into another. We use a normalized Levenshtein distance computed as:","5 http://lucene.apache.org EDIT (wi, wj) = LD(wi, wj) max(|wi|, |wj|) where LD(wi, wj) is the Levenshtein distance for words wi and wj. E.g. ∆(langue, lingua) = 2","6 = 0.33","• Rank distance (Dinu and Dinu, 2005) is used to measure the similarity between two rank lists. A ranking of a set of n objects can be represented as a permutation of the integers 1, 2, ..., n. S is a set of ranking results. σ ∈ S. σ(i) represents the rank of object i in the ranking result σ. The rank distance is computed as: RD(σ, τ ) = i=n ∑ i=1 |σ(i) − τ (i)| The ranks of the elements are given from bottom up, i.e. from n to 1, in a Borda order. The elements which do not occur in one of the rankings receive the rank 0. To extend the rank distance to strings, we index each occurence of a given letter a with ak, where k is the number of its previous occurences, and then compute the rank distance for the new indexed strings which become in this situation rankings. In order to normalize it, we divide the obtained value by the maximum possible distance between two strings u and v, which is:","|u|(|u| + 1) 2 +","|v|(|v| + 1) 2","E.g. ∆(langue, lingua) = 10 42 = 0.23","• Longest common subsequence ratio (Melamed, 1995) computes the similarity between two words dividing the length of the longest common subsequence of the two words by the length of the longer word: LCSR(wi, wj) = LCS(wi, wj) max(|wi|, |wj|) where LCS(wi, wj) is the longest common subsequence of wi and wj. We subtract this value from 1, in order to obtain the distance between two words. E.g. ∆(langue, lingua) = 1 − 4","6 = 0.33 143","• XDice (Brew and McKelvie, 1996) is a version of Dice’s coefficient (Adamson and Boreham, 1972) which counts the number of shared character bigrams between two words and divides it by the number of bigrams in both words, allowing also extended bigrams (formed by the first and third letter of trigrams): XDICE(wi, wj) = 2 ∗ |xbi(wi) ∩ xbi(wj)| |xbi(wi) + xbi(wj)| where xbi(w) is a function which determines the multi-set of character bigrams and extended bigrams in w. As XDice computes similarity between words, we subtract its value from 1 to obtain distances. E.g. ∆(langue, lingua) = 1 − 2∗4","18 = 0.55","• Jaro distance (Jaro, 1989) and its version, Jaro-Winkler distance (Winkler, 1990), are measures which account for the number and position of common characters between words. These metrics are described in (Delmestri and Dinu, 2012). Given two strings wi = (wi1, ..., wim) and wj = (wj1, ..., wjn), the number of common characters for wi and wj is the number of charachters wik in wi which satisfy the condition:","∃wj l in wj : wik = wj","l, |k − l| ≤","max(m, n) 2 − 1 Let c be the number of common characters in wi and wj and t the number of character transpositions (i.e. the number of common characters in wi and wj in different positions, divided by 2). Jaro distance is defined as follows: J(wi, wj) = 1 3 ∗ ( c m + c n + c − t c ) As both Jaro and Jaro-Winkler metrics are string similarity measures, we subtract these values from 1 to obtain distances between words. E.g. ∆(langue, lingua) = 1− 1","3 ∗","(4","6 + 4","6 + 4−0","4 ) = 0.22 Jaro-Winkler distance accounts also for the length l of the common preffix ofwi and wj (l ≤ 4) and considers a scaling factor p = 0.1. JW (wi, wj) = J(wi, wj) + p ∗ l ∗ (1 − J(wi, wj)) where J (wi, wj) is the Jaro distance for words wi and wj. E.g. ∆(langue, lingua) = 1 − (0.77 + 0.1 ∗ 1 ∗ (1 − 0.77)) = 0.20"]},{"title":"5 Evaluation and Results Analysis","paragraphs":["In order to evaluate the performances of these orthographic approaches to the task of cognates identification, we apply the method presented in Section 2 for determining cognate pairs in Italian and French for each word in the preprocessed corpus.

In order to analyse and compare the relevance of these metrics, we further use these results to compute the values for recall, precision, accuracy and f-score using the formulas shown below, as presented in (Manning et al, 2008). recall =","T P T P + F N precision =","T P T P + F P accuracy =","T P + T N T P + T N + F P + F N f − score = 2 ∗ precision ∗ recall precision + recall The results of our research are listed in Table 2 for the corpus with diacritics and in Table 3 for the corpus without diacritics. We highlighted the maximum accuracy obtained by each metric for thresholds between 0 and 1. Between Jaro and Jaro-Winkler distances, we decided to use only the latter metric in our analysis, as they are similar to a certain extent and we noticed that Jaro-Winkler distance provides better results.","According to the outcome of our investigation, the edit distance identifies Romanian-French and Romanian-Italian cognates with the highest degree of accuracy, reaching its maximum for a threshold value of 0.5 (and 0.6 for French, when diacritics are accounted for), followed closely by Jaro-Winkler distance and the longest common subsequence ratio. An interesting situation can be observed for Jaro-Winkler distance, whose accuracy decreses dramatically starting with 0.5 threshold, especially when diacritics are not taken into consideration. As expected, for each orthographic method the accuracy increases, reaches a maximum and then decreases, due to the precision-recall tradeoff. However, it is interesting to observe the similarity for the longest common subsequence ratio, rank distance and edit distance with regard to their accuracy curves when diacritics are accounted for. XDice and Jaro-Winkler distances exhibit different behaviours, in that Jaro-Winkler reaches its maximum accuracy for a threshold value lower than the average, while XDice has maximum accuracy for a higher threshold value. This behaviour stands for both languages.","It can be noticed that the orthographic approaches we used obtain higher degrees of accuracy for French than for Italian, which implies the fact that the orthographic changes undergone in the process of adapting to the Romanian language are a better indicator of cognacy for words with 145","French th EDIT LCSR RD JW XDICE","R P A F R P A F R P A F R P A F R P A F 0.0 08.9 100.0 54.4 16.3 08.9 100.0 54.4 16.3 08.9 100.0 54.4 16.3 08.9 100.0 54.4 16.3 08.9 100.0 54.4 16.3 0.1 12.3 94.0 55.8 21.7 12.9 93.2 56.0 22.6 21.4 87.7 59.2 34.4 58.1 80.6 72.0 67.5 13.4 90.3 56.0 23.3 0.2 34.1 81.2 63.1 48.0 35.9 80.6 63.6 49.7 54.6 82.5 71.5 65.7 82.6 77.9 79.6 80.2 28.3 81.8 61.0 42.1 0.3 60.5 82.0 73.6 69.6 62.9 81.0 74.1 70.8 73.4 79.9 77.4 76.5 92.5 74.5 80.4 82.5 48.8 80.6 68.5 60.8 0.4 77.1 79.8 78.8 78.4 79.3 78.2 78.6 78.8 85.4 77.1 80.0 81.1 96.7 69.4 77.0 80.8 63.8 79.5 73.7 70.8 0.5 89.1 77.1 81.4 82.7 90.9 75.0 80.3 82.2 92.3 73.4 79.4 81.8 98.8 60.6 67.3 75.1 76.4 78.5 77.7 77.4 0.6 93.9 74.8 81.1 83.3 95.3 71.2 78.4 81.5 95.5 68.9 76.2 80.0 99.5 53.6 56.7 69.7 82.5 77.3 79.1 79.8 0.7 96.5 71.4 78.9 82.1 97.6 65.3 72.9 78.3 97.8 62.7 69.9 76.4 99.6 52.6 55.0 68.9 87.5 75.6 79.6 81.1 0.8 98.5 63.1 70.5 76.9 99.1 55.8 60.3 71.4 98.9 56.7 61.8 72.1 99.6 52.6 54.9 68.8 93.0 72.2 78.6 81.3 0.9 99.6 55.6 60.0 71.3 99.8 51.6 53.0 68.0 99.7 52.9 55.4 69.1 99.6 52.6 54.9 68.8 96.7 66.6 74.1 78.9 1.0 100.0 50.0 50.0 66.7 100.0 50.0 50.0 66.7 100.0 50.0 50.0 66.7 100.0 50.0 50.0 66.7 100.0 50.0 50.0 66.7","Italian th EDIT LCSR RD JW XDICE","R P A F R P A F R P A F R P A F R P A F 0.0 06.7 100.0 53.4 12.6 06.7 100.0 53.4 12.6 06.7 100.0 53.4 12.6 06.7 100.0 53.4 12.6 06.7 100.0 53.4 12.6 0.1 12.2 77.0 54.3 21.0 12.3 75.7 54.2 21.2 17.5 73.8 55.7 28.3 63.8 70.9 68.8 67.1 19.1 74.4 56.2 30.4 0.2 41.4 70.9 62.2 52.3 42.3 69.5 61.9 52.6 43.5 68.6 61.8 53.2 84.9 68.0 72.5 75.5 38.6 72.8 62.1 50.5 0.3 64.6 70.3 68.6 67.3 66.3 69.4 68.6 67.9 66.8 67.9 67.6 67.4 94.0 66.2 73.0 77.7 52.6 70.6 65.3 60.2 0.4 80.1 68.9 72.0 74.1 82.0 67.8 71.5 74.2 82.9 66.7 70.8 74.0 97.7 62.7 69.8 76.4 65.9 69.4 68.4 67.6 0.5 91.8 67.5 73.8 77.8 93.3 66.1 72.7 77.4 91.3 64.9 70.9 75.8 99.6 57.1 62.3 72.6 76.9 68.1 70.4 72.2 0.6 95.4 65.7 72.9 77.8 96.7 63.4 70.5 76.6 95.9 62.2 68.8 75.5 99.9 52.0 53.9 68.4 84.1 67.2 71.6 74.7 0.7 97.8 63.7 71.0 77.1 98.6 59.8 66.2 74.5 98.5 58.5 64.3 73.4 99.9 51.4 52.6 67.8 90.0 66.0 71.9 76.2 0.8 99.4 58.1 63.9 73.4 99.7 53.3 56.2 69.5 99.3 54.2 57.7 70.2 99.9 51.3 52.6 67.8 95.1 63.9 70.7 76.4 0.9 99.9 53.6 56.7 69.7 99.9 50.8 51.6 67.4 99.8 51.7 53.4 68.1 99.9 51.3 52.6 67.8 97.7 60.4 66.8 74.6 1.0 100.0 50.0 50.0 66.7 100.0 50.0 50.0 66.7 100.0 50.0 50.0 66.7 100.0 50.0 50.0 66.7 100.0 50.0 50.0 66.7 Table 3: Recall (R), precision (P), accuracy (A) and f-score (F) values (computed as percentages) for orthographic measures in the task of cognates identification when diacritics are not accounted for French etymons or cognate pairs than for words with Italian etymons or cognate pairs. A possible explanation is that starting with the 19th","century numerous words were imported from French. That period represents a stage in the Romanian’s language evolution in which norms for the vocabulary of the literary language were defined, including patterns for adapting neologisms to Romanian, and probably many of the French words which entered the language in the 19th","century are in this situation."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion and Future Work","paragraphs":["In this paper we proposed a dictionary-based approach to identifying cognate pairs. We extracted etymology-related information from online dictionaries and we accounted for etymologies and etymons to detect cognates. We applied our method on a high-volume Romanian corpus and we focused on detecting cognate pairs between Romanian and its most closely related languages, Italian and French. We used this method to investigate to which extent the lexical similarity can be used for automatic detection of cognates, analysing the performances obtained by various orthographic approaches: edit distance, rank distance, longest common subsequence ratio, XDice distance and Jaro-Winkler distance. Our results show that the edit distance classifies pairs of words as cognates or non-cognates with the highest degree of accuracy, obtaining better results for French than for Italian, with some improvements when diacritics are not accounted for.","A possible application for cognates identification is native language detection (Popescu and Ionescu, 2013). We believe that accounting for genetic relationships between words could prove useful for this task. In our future work we intend to further investigate the performances of the orthographic approaches to the task of cognates identification by introducing an additional step of parameter tuning for the threshold value in our procedure. We plan to apply this method of identifying cognates on the entire dexonline dictionary. In this paper we focused on the cognates that are most frequently used in Romanian, but we believe that obtaining an almost exhaustive dataset of Romanian-French and Romanian-Italian cognate pairs would be an important achievement."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["The authors thank the anonymous reviewers for their helpful and constructive comments.
