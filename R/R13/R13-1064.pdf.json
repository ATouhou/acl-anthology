This has several applications such as detecting consumer opinions in on-line product reviews or increasing the effectiveness of social media marketing campaigns. However, the informal features of Web 2.0 texts can affect the performance of automated opinion mining tools. These are usually short and noisy texts with presence of slang, emoticons and lexical variants which make more difficult to extract contextual and semantic information. In this paper we demonstrate that the use of lexical normalisation techniques can be used to enhance polarity detection results by replacing informal lexical variants with their canonical version. We have carried out several polarity classification experiments using English texts from different Web 2.0 genres and we have obtained the best result with microblogs where normalisation contribution to the classification model can be up to 6.4%."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Nowadays, Web 2.0 applications provide some of the most popular forms of communication between users on the Internet such as blogging, social networks or short text messaging platforms. This large daily amount of generated information contains valuable insights about user opinions and sentiments regarding almost any topic.","A basic task in opinion mining deals with determining the overall polarity orientation of a document about some topic. The polarity information extracted from user comments and consumer feedback from on-line product reviews can be used to increase the effectiveness of social media marketing campaigns, discover new market threats and opportunities or react faster to customer issues. Also, microblogging platforms such as Twitter in-clude rich metadata about interactions which provides a way to measure the reputation of their users based on the number of followers or the publication popularity by counting the number of times one message has been shared.","However, the language used in social media is very informal, containing elements such as misspellings, slang, lexical variants, inconsistent punctuations, URLs or emoticons (Thurlow, 2003). Also, the presence of genre-specific terminology such as, RT for re-tweet and #hashtags can make any Natural Language Processing (NLP) task challenging. For this reason, a way to handle such challenges is needed in order to automatically understand the opinions and sentiments that people are communicating on the Internet. The use of lexical normalisation techniques has recently been the subject of research applied to short and noisy texts such as tweets or SMS, improving the performance of NLP tools that need to extract contextual and semantic information from this type of informal texts.","Moreover, not all Web 2.0 genres have the same level of informality, microblog posts have to be short so they tend to contain SMS-style contrac-tions while blog entries are usually larger and more elaborated (Santini, 2006). For this reason, in this study we evaluate the contribution of text normalisation techniques to an opinion mining application using corpora from three different Web 2.0 genres, demonstrating that it can enhance the polarity classification of microblogs by a 6.4%.","This article is organised as follows: In Section 2 we review the state of the art. Section 3 describes the normalisation process. The polarity classification is explained in Section 4. In Section 5, the obtained results are analysed. Finally, our main 491 conclusions and future work are drawn in Section 6."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Both academic researches and commercial companies have increased their interests recently in mining user opinions on the Internet. After the initial works of (Pang et al., 2002) several applications of opinion mining have been developed in order to measure the word of mouth (Jansen et al., 2009), correlate polls with user opinion (Balasubramanyan et al., 2010) or predicting elections results (Tumasjan et al., 2010). Most of these studies have been focused on Twitter (Barbosa and Feng, 2010), (Bifet and Frank, 2010) using both machine learning (Turney, 2002) and lexicon-based approaches (Taboada et al., 2011). The real-time nature of tweets provides a large amount of metadata and content information such as hashtags and smileys (Davidov et al., 2010) that can be used as a training corpus for opinion mining systems (Pak and Paroubek, 2010) without requiring annotated corpora (Wiebe et al., 2005).","Text normalisation techniques (Liu et al., 2011), (Han et al., 2013) based on the substitution of out of vocabulary (OOV) words have been used in opinion mining systems before (Mukherjee et al., 2012), (Gutiérrez et al., 2013), (Sidorov et al., 2013) but this process is usually presented as an intermediate filtering step without explicitly detailing the contribution of normalisation to the classification results. On the other hand, there are different genres within the Web 2.0 and they do not have the same level of informality (Mosquera and Moreda, 2012), so the contribution of text normalisation techniques to polarity classification can be more or less relevant depending on that level. For this reason, in this study we evaluate the performance of an automated opinion classification system before and after using lexical normalisation techniques using annotated corpora from three different Web 2.0 genres."]},{"title":"3 Lexical Normalisation","paragraphs":["We have used TENOR (Mosquera et al., 2012), a multilingual lexical normalisation tool for English and Spanish texts in order to transform noisy and informal words into their canonical form (see Table 1). After this step they can be easily processed by NLP tools and applications.","In order to do this, OOV words are detected with a dictionary lookup. TENOR uses a custommade lexicon built over the expanded Aspell dictionary and then augmented with domain-specific knowledge from the Spell Checking Oriented Word Lists (SCOWL)1","package.","The OOV words are matched against a phone lattice using the double metaphone algorithm (Philips, 2000) to obtain a list of substitution can-didates. With the Gestalt pattern matching algorithm (Ratcliff and Metzener, 1988) a string similarity score is calculated between the OOV word and its candidate list.","Nevertheless, there are acronyms and abbreviated forms that can not be detected properly with phonetic indexing techniques (lol - laugh out loud). For this reason, TENOR uses an excep-tion dictionary with common Internet abbrevia-tions and slang collected from online sources2",".","Moreover, a number transliteration lookup table and several heuristics such as word-lengthening compression, emoticon translation and simple case restoration are applied to improve the normalisation results. Finally, TENOR uses a trigram language model in order to enhance the clean candidate selection."]},{"title":"4 Polarity Classification","paragraphs":["The methodology explained in (Boldrini et al., 2009) has been used in order to create a two-class polarity classifier (positive/negative) based on the bag of words model. We have tested two different machine learning algorithms: j48 (Quinlan, 1993) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) (Vapnik, 1997) with word unigrams and lemmas. Stop-words and URLs were replaced by static labels with aim to simplify the model and avoid extra noise. 4.1 Datasets We have trained our polarity classification system using annotated English texts from three different Web 2.0 genres:","Microblog publications: Extracted from 5513 Twitter messages 3",".","Blog posts: The Kyoto sub-set of the EmotiBlog4 1 http://wordlist.sourceforge.net/ 2 http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:English internet slang 3 http://www.sananalytics.com/lab/twitter-","sentiment/sanders-twitter-0.2.zip 4 The EmotiBlog corpus is composed by blog posts on the","Kyoto Protocol and election processes in Zimbabwe and USA 492","Informal English text Normalised English text a) Gotta buy this asap I am going to buy this as soon as possible. b) I will nevooor buy tis again :( I will never buy this again I’m sad. c) Greeeeeeat product!!!

Analysing the results we can observe that the overall best classification is achieved using the SVM algorithm. For the microblog genre there are improvements when using the dataset normalised with TENOR and these are higher when using lemmas instead of unigrams with a 6.4% improvement over the original dataset. However, there is almost no improvement or even the performance is decreased in some cases when applying TENOR to both blogs and reviews genres. These contain a very low amount of lexical variants and misspellings, and because of that using lexical normalisation techniques can lead to false positives in the substitution process, thus decreasing the performance of the polarity classifier. On the other hand, the microblog dataset is substantially more informal, so the application of normalisation techniques has a positive impact in the classification results."]},{"title":"6 Conclusions and Future Work","paragraphs":["In this paper we have presented the evaluation of the contribution of a text normalisation tool to an opinion mining system using corpora from three different Web 2.0 genres.
