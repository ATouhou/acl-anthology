The novelty is that we evaluate our classifier and our selected features on literary texts hav-ing their action placed in the past and written so as to give off the impression of the respective epoch. We investigate several types of features and ultimately go with a very simple set of 10 features which very accurately classifies the texts based on the century they were actually written in. We use random forests to obtain high performance."]},{"title":"1 Introduction and Motivation","paragraphs":["Determining the time when a document was written is a task not only with implications in cultural heritage but one which proves important to many other domains such as historical and literary criticism, diachronic linguistics, manuscript phylogeny and stemmatics, and the elaboration of critical theories about the author of the texts in question. A more practical, coarser grained approach is to classify according to the century in which a text was written, approach that we take in this paper.","Within many instances of this task, disputes between linguists and historians appear. For example, among the first texts written in Romania there are four religious texts, Codicele Voronetȩan, Psaltirea Scheiană, Psaltirea Voronetȩană and Psaltirea Hurmuzachi, for which the dating is disputed between the 15th","century (idea promoted by historians such as Nicolae Iorga) and the end of the 16th","century (idea maintained by linguists such as Rosetti) (Tagliavini, 1972). Often times, the texts present characteristics of a translation, yet they are not original translations but modern copies of lost originals.","For Romanian, the 16th","century represents the beginning of Romanian writing. In (Dimitrescu, 1994, p. 13) the author states that the modern Romanian vocabulary cannot be completely understood without a thorough study of the texts written in this period, which should be considered the source of the literary language used to-day. In the 17th","century, some of the most important cultural events took place, such as the improvement of the education system and the establishing of several printing houses, and this led to a new development of the Romanian language (Dimitrescu, 1994, p.75). Then, in the 18th","century, a diversification of the philological interests in Romania took place through writing the first Romanian-Latin bilingual lexicons, the draft of the first monolingual dictionary, the first Romanian grammar, and the earliest translations from French (Lupu, 1999, p. 29).","The transition to the Latin alphabet, which was a significant cultural achievement, is completed in the 19th","century. The Cyrillic alphabet is maintained in Romanian writing until around 1850, afterwards being gradually replaced with the Latin alphabet (Dimitrescu, 1994, p. 270). The 19th","century is marked by the conflict (and eventually the compromise) between etymologism and phonetism in Romanian orthography. In (Maiorescu, 1866) the author argues for applying the phonetic principle and several reforms are enforced for this purpose. In the 20th","century, some variations regarding the usage of diacritics in Ro-136 manian orthography are noticed.","In this paper we approach an interesting version of the epoch disambiguation task, successfully disambiguating the century in which Romanian novels with the action set in the past and written so as to simulate the action’s epoch appear have been written in. We used novels of Romanian writers Mihail Sadoveanu and Ştefan Agopian with the action developing in different time periods between the 16th to the 20th century. For training and evaluation we used a multitude of texts written in either one of the 5 centuries."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["The influence of the temporal effects in automatic document classification is analyzed in (Mourão et al., 2008; Salles et al., 2010). The authors state that a major challenge in building text classification models may be the change which occurs in the characteristics of the documents and their classes over time (Mourão et al., 2008). Therefore, in order to overcome the difficulties which arise in automatic classification when dealing with documents dating from different epochs, identifying and accounting for document characteristics changing over time (such as class frequency, relationships between terms and classes and the similarity among classes over time (Mourão et al., 2008)) is essential and can lead to a more accurate discrimination between classes.","Dalli and Wilks (2006) successfully apply a method for classification of texts and documents based on their predicted time of creation, prov-ing that accounting for word frequencies and their variation over time is accurate. Kumar et al. (2012) argue as well for the capability of this method, of using words alone, to determine the epoch in which a text was written or the time period a document refers to.","The effectiveness of using models for individual partitions in a timeline with the purpose of predicting probabilities over the timeline for new documents is investigated in (Kumar et al., 2011; Kanhabua and Nørvåg, 2009). This approach, based on the divergence between the language model of the test document and those of the timeline partitions, was successfully employed in predicting publication dates and in searching for web pages and web documents.","In (de Jong et al., 2005) the authors raise the problem of access to historical collections of documents, which may be difficult due to the different historical and modern variants of the text, the less standardized spelling, words ambiguities and other language changes. Thus, the linking of current word forms with their historical equivalents and accurate dating of texts can help reduce the temporal effects in this regard.","Chambers (2012) states that applying timestamps to documents is, to some extent, similar to topic classification, focusing on choosing a time period instead of a topic, but also relating to temporal words and phrases which describe the time period to be determined and are often comprised in the investigated documents. Therefore, he argues for the inclusion of these temporal expressions into the learning system for automatic document dating and proposes such a model which obtains better results than previous generative models.","In (Mihalcea and Nastase, 2012) the authors in-troduced the task of identifying changes in word usage over time, disambiguating the epoch at word-level.","Recently, Stajner and Zampieri (2013) used stylistic features, such as lexical richness, to predict the century of historical Portuguese texts."]},{"title":"3 Approach 3.1 Datasets used","paragraphs":["In order to investigate the diachronic changes and variations in the Romanian lexicon over time, we used a corpus containing texts ranging from the 16th","to the 20th","century, representing the five different stages in the evolution of the Romanian language, as discussed in the introduction. We used this corpus for feature selection, model training and evaluation, following the methodology de-scribed in Section 3.2.","We used this model to classify 20th","century novels with action set in the past. The novels we used are shown in Table 2 along with the century in which the action takes place.","For preprocessing, we removed words that are irrelevant for our investigation, such as dates and numbers and non-textual annotations marked by non alphanumeric characters. We performed basic word segmentation, using whitespace and punctuation marks as delimiters and we lower-cased all words. 137 Century Title 16 Codicele Todorescu Codicele Martian Coresi, Evanghelia cu ı̂nvăt ̧̆atură Coresi, Lucrul apostolesc Coresi, Psaltirea slavo-română Coresi, Târgul evangheliilor Coresi, Tetraevanghelul Manuscrisul de la Ieud Palia de la Orăsţie Psaltirea Hurmuzaki 17 The Bible Miron Costin, Letopisetu̧l T ̧̆arii Moldovei Miron Costin, De neamul moldovenilor Grigore Ureche, Letopisetu̧l T ̧̆arii Moldovei Dosoftei, Viata̧ si petreacerea sfinti̧lor Varlaam Motoc, Cazania Varlaam Motoc, Răspunsul ı̂mpotriva Catehismului calvinesc 18 Antim Ivireanul, Opere Axinte Uricariul, Letopisetu̧l T ̧̆arii Românesti si̧ al T ̧̆arii Moldovei Ioan Canta, Letopisetu̧l T ̧̆arii Moldovei Dimitrie Cantemir, Istoria ieroglifică Dimitrie Eustatievici Braso̧veanul, Gramatica românească Ion Neculce, O samă de cuvinte 19 Mihai Eminescu, Opere, v.

A quarter of the chunks were held out as a test set. On the training set, we experimented with several intuitive engineered features based on dictionaries, sentence length, stop word frequencies, and on word endings, but the most effective feature set turns out to be extremely simple.","We represented the texts using a simple bag-of-words model, applying tf re-weighting, and performed χ2","feature selection. The ten best features turn out to classify both the training set and the test set without error. The classifier used is a random forest ensemble with 20 trees. The tree parameter max features, the maximum number of features to consider in a split, is left at the de-fault value of √","d, where d = 10 is the number of features. There is no need for further search since the accuracy is perfect.","For comparison, a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier on the same feature set obtains 90.1% accuracy. To check whether the random forest actually learns to identify parts of the same document, we trained the same model using the document name as label. In this case, the accuracy with which the system assigned to a chunk the name of the document from which it was extracted was only 72.1%. However, the misclassifications happen mostly within century level.

We classified, using this system, the texts from Table 2. Because the interest is at document level, we did not split into chunks of 500 sentences, but be-cause of tf normalization, this does not affect the results.","We examined the confidence (estimated class probability score) of the classification, which is the average of the probabilities given by the 20 trees in the randomized forest. Classification is very confident and places all texts in the century when they were actually written in, namely the 20th",".

Despite the fact that the problem is simple, overfitting is effectively prevented by extreme feature selection and the features used promise to be useful in determin-ing the period of some disputed writings from Romanian literature. It is interesting to see that the features contain pairs of old and new variants of the same word (cari/ care, pre/ pe), as well as only old variants of a word (amu for acum, derept for drept), and are mostly functional words.","It is possible that a justification similar to the one encountered in authorship attribution holds: authors can try to mimic the lexicon of the century where they are setting the action, and use rare, loaded words that set the frame for readers. But by counting very frequent functional words in temporal variations, such as the 10 best features extracted by our pipeline, we can find the signal of the contemporary language of the author, one difficult to fake.","In this paper we focused on temporal classification which can be a first step in many applications such as building a system for automatically translating between language stages. An interesting next step would be to extend the study at a lexical level and identify all forms of a word in order to create a map of its historical development, something also useful in the task mentioned above."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["The contribution of the authors to this paper is equal.
