NLP may be used to supplement these graphs with information about why documents are cited. While previous work (Teufel et al., 2009; Athar, 2011; Athar and Teufel, 2012) record positive and negative sentiment about cited work, we record information about how cited documents are compared to each other. CONTRAST-ing documents may describe different approaches or different opinions. Documents which CORROBORATE each other may follow a single approach. A document that is cited as corroborating with many other documents may be very salient. Some example instances of these CONTRAST/CORROBORATE relations are provided in Figure 1, the document containing the citations (represented as we or this study) contrasts with [1] and corroborates [2]; [3] and [4] contrast with each other; and [5] and [6] corroborate.","We use square brackets and numbers (IEEE style) to represent citations that are the object of this study (Figure 1). We use last name plus date (APA style) for works cited as part of this research effort. Examples in this paper (modified for brevity) are from the PubMed Central corpus1",".

Other important elements (Figure 3) have boxes drawn around them.","In this paper, we explore the relations between sentence-internal predicate relations, intersentential discourse relations and relations between citations. Then we describe and evaluate a system which derives CORROBORATE and CONTRAST relations between citations."]},{"title":"2 How Citation Relations are Encoded 2.1 The phrase/citation connection","paragraphs":["(Abu Jbara and Radev, 2012) describes a system for identifying the referential scope of each citation, a text fragment that the citation is semantically related to–multiple citations can share the same referential scope. We assume that arguments of grammatical and discourse relations are essentially the referential scopes of the citations that we are concerned with. Like (Abu Jbara and Radev, 2012), we cover 2 cases. In the first case, the citation is an argument of some predicate (Figure 1, citation 1). In the second case, the citation is parenthetically linked to a constituent (Figure 1, ci-460 tations 2, 3 and 4) ((Abu Jbara and Radev, 2012) refers to this case as non-syntactic). We found the second case to be more common than the first for CORROBORATE and CONTRAST.","Authors use we, our, this research, and other phrases which we call self-citations to refer to their own work. These self-citations participate in the same citation relations as conventional citations. Thus, CORROBORATE and CONTRAST relations can have a self-citation arguments, e.g., Figure 1, we and This study in ex. 1 and 2. Self-citations occur in regular noun phrase positions (subject, object, etc.), but not parenthetically. 2.2 Citations, Discourse and Grammar SBJ","[1] VPNP contrasts with [2] Sentence 1 PRD ADV Sentence N+1 PP Sentence N PRD VP SBJ NP X Contrast−ARG2 NP VP","PRD SBJ Contrast−ARG1 Sentence Group K Sentence Group K+1 ... Sections ... Document Disc−ARG1 Disc−ARG2 Paragraphs Paragraphs is often claimed [1] In contrast, claim not X[2]others Figure 2: Constituent Structure of a Document","In Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1988) and related approaches (Marcu, 2000), the discourse structure of a document forms a tree, with the root representing the document; internal nodes representing sections, paragraphs and multi-clause sentences, and leaves representing single clauses. The edge labels on the set of outgoing branches from a node collectively represent relations among the children of that node. As in Figure 2, substituting the leaves of a discourse tree with predicate argument representations (or parses) results in a rooted graph for a document with words as leaves. If the referential scopes of a pair of citations correspond to a pair of siblings at any level in this graph, the relation represented at the parent node can correspond to a citation relation. The sentence “[1] contrasts with [2] regarding whether X is or is not true” is analogous to the sentence “X is often claimed [1]. In contrast, others claim not X [2]” because the subject and object of the verb contrast correspond to the discourse arguments of in contrast. Taking this approach, we assume that discourse units and grammatical arguments are the referential scopes of citations. Furthermore, we limit our attention to citations scopes that are no more than a few sentences long (as in the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) (Miltsakaki et al., 2004)).","We assume that: (1) there is a grammatical or discourse relation corresponding to each CORROBORATE and CONTRAST citation relation; (2) each such grammatical/discourse relation takes 2 arguments, each argument being a sequence of sentences, a sentence, a phrase or a word; and (3) more than one citation can be associated with each argument. Given these assumptions we seek to identify: (a) the candidate grammatical/discourse relation and its arguments; and (b) the sets of citations that correspond to these arguments. We then hypothesize the corresponding citation relation for each ARG1/ARG2 pair in the Cartesian product of the set of citations in the ARG1 domain and the set of arguments in the ARG2 domain.","This means that to identify CONTRAST and CORROBORATE citation relations, we need to identify syntactic and discourse signals that would imply that citations hold these relations. In the case of syntactic predicates, these turn out to be a list of words (contrast, corroborate, endorse, ...) that are idiosyncratic to this task. For discourse connectives, we can use some previous classifications: causal discourse connectives (thus, therefore) tend to be linked to CORROBORATE citation relations; and CONTRAST discourse connectives (in contrast, on the other hand, however) tend to be linked to CONTRAST citation relations. While all the cited work on discourse relations posit these same relations for consecutive sentences with no explicit connectives, we have not explored this avenue yet.2 2.3 Multi-Sentence Units We recognize a third DISCOURSE relation, EXPAND, which does not directly link to either of our citation relations. Rather, 2 sentences in an EXPAND relation are treated as a single unit, which can, itself be a discourse argument. Fur-2 (Prasad et al., 2007) reports annotating 16053 implicit","and 18459 explicit discourse relations in their corpus. 461","A) Prior to the HPAI H5N1 virus epidemics, wild bird mortality from AI virus infection had been rare [7], [8].","B) In contrast, HPAIV H5N1 is unusual as high mortality rates have occurred in wild birds [9], [10].","C) Passerine birds have been naturally affected by HPAI H5N1 viruses [11]–[14].","D) Experimental infections of passerine [15], [16] characterized these birds as vulnerable.","E) Additionally, Gronesova et al., 2008 found that 18% of samples from 12 passeriform species tested positive for influenza A viral genome in a surveillance study [17]. Figure 3: Multi-S ARG2: (Kalthoff et al., 2009) thermore, EXPAND relations can (transitively) link such units to additional sentences, produc-ing larger multi unit chunks. Citations in 2 multi-sentence units can be in CORROBOATE or CONTRAST relations in the same manner as the single sentence cases described above. Figure 3 contains one such example. Sentences B, C, D and E are linked together into one unit by means of 3 EXPAND relations, holding between sentence pairs {B,C}, {C,D} and {D,E}. The discourse connective In contrast takes sentence A as one argument and the unit B through E as a second argument. Based on this CONTRAST discourse relation, we deduce that the citations in A (7 and 8) are in contrast with the citations in B through E (9–17), resulting in 18 CONTRAST citation relations.","Our EXPAND discourse relation approximately corresponds to several discourse relations in other frameworks (EXAMPLE, ELABORATION, LIST and others in (Marcu, 2000); CONJUNCTION, INSTANTIATION and others in PDTB). We collapse these relations in order to simplify the task. 2 mechanisms for identifying EXPAND relations both of which are evident in Figure 3: (i) using discourse connectives, e.g, the EXPAND relation between D and E is signaled by the connective Additionally; and (ii) based on the cohesion between 2 sentences – this is the case for the links connecting sentences {B,C} and {C,D}. Follow-ing (Marcu, 2000) (and others), cohesion can be determined by elements that indicate continuity between sentences such as anaphoric words (the demonstrative these) or repeated words from the previous sentence. In Figure 3, birds, have, H5N1 and viruses are repeated in C, after occurring in B. D contains the demonstrative these, and repeats the word birds that is found in C. Our system takes these cohesive signals as evidence that an EXPAND relation holds between 2 consecutive sentences. Our Expand relations are used to approximate the larger citation context. (Athar and Teufel, 2012) uses similar methodology in their citation sentiment system."]},{"title":"3 DocRelate 3.1 Our Approach","paragraphs":["Each file in our corpus of PubMed scientific articles has the citations premarked. Preprocess-ing includes the marking of all sentence and paragraph boundaries. Our citation relation system, DocRelate processes each document from beginning to end, one sentence at a time. All processing is based on regular expressions and simple string matches and is therefore both faster and less accurate than a syntactically-sophisticated approach would be. Nevertheless, we expect that aspects of DocRelate that deal with relations across sentence boundaries to be essentially the same as they would be in systems using deeper processing.","For each sentence, we find: (a) lexical signals; (b) sentence dividers (semi-colons, coordinate/subordinate conjunctions); and (c) citations (conventional and self-citations). For each lexical signal, we establish a clause1 and a clause2. If the lexical signal follows a sentence divider, clause1 is the portion of the current sentence preceding the sentence divider, whereas clause2 follows the sentence divider, e.g., the sentence divider is and in The public considers frequently reported infectious diseases, to be the most severe [18] and therefore people’s anxiety correlated with a negative perception of the disease [19]. Otherwise, the previous and current sentences are clause1 and clause2 (Figure 1 ex. 3 and 4).","We maintain a dictionary of lexical signals, which includes: surface forms, local disambiguat-ing information, part of speech (POS) and CITA-TION relation (EXPAND, CORROBORATE or CONTRAST). For lexical signals with POS of ’adverb’, clause1 is assumed to contain the ARG1 citations and clause2 is assumed to contain the 462 ARG2 citations: most examples discussed in this paper follow this pattern, e.g., Figure 1 ex. 3 and 4. For other POS: (preposition, verb, adjective and subordinate conjunction (SCONJ)) both arguments are inside clause1. For most sentence-internal cases, the signal divides the clause into 2 parts: citations preceding the signal are candidate ARG1s and those following the signal are ARG2s, e.g., Figure 1 ex. 1 and 2. When an SCONJ occurs at the beginning of a clause, the clause must be divided at a centrally-located comma. Citations preceding that comma are ARG2 candidates, whereas citations following the comma are ARG1s. The 2 cases of SCONJ are:","Case 1 Limited studies have suggested dsRNA is an activator of NLRP3 inflammasome [20] although this has been disputed [21].","Case 2 Although influenza strains resistant to NA inhibitors are less prevalent [22], resistance to oseltamivir has been reported [23],[24]. For Case 1, ARG1 is 20 and ARG2 is 21; for case 2, both 23 and 24 are ARG1s and 22 is ARG2. Our approach to SCONJ is essentially the same as that of (Marcu, 2000) among others.","In the absence of discourse connectives, we can hypothesize an EXPAND relation between 2 sentences if the second sentence refers back to the first, as determined by: (a) the proportion of words in the second sentence also occurring in the first, ignoring a list of stop words; (b) the presence of abbreviations in the second sentence corresponding to word sequences in the first; (c) the presence of referring expressions found in the second sentence (this, these, those, another, it, they, them, itself, themselves, their, here, latter); and (d) the occurrence of self-citations in both the current sentence and the previous one.","Algorithm 1 is our approach for finding citation relations in an article. After each sentence is processed, citations that are not embedded in a sentence-internal ARG2 are recorded as potential ARG1s for the next sentence (the cites func-tion) and each EXPAND relation causes the previous set of ARG1 citations to be stored as well (in St ARG1). This makes analyses like that of Figure 4 possible: the (ARG1) citations preceding However are contrasted with the (ARG2) citations in the sentence containing However. The citations in sentence A are stored due to the Expand relation","foreach sentence in document do S ←− Sentence P ←− P reviousSentence SLink ←− DiscRel(S, P ) Output Sentence-internal relations if SLink ∈ { CONT RA, CORROB} then","ARG2 ←− cites(S)","ARG1 ←− St ARG1 ∪ cites(P )","if Satisfy Constraints(ARG1,ARG2) then","Output SLink Relation for","∀{ a1, a2} ∈ ARG1 × ARG2 end Empty St ARG1 if ARG1 ̸= ∅ then","St SLink ←− SLink","St ARG1 ←− ARG1 end","end","else if SLink = EXP then ARG1 ←− cites(P ) ARG2 ←− cites(S) if St SLink ̸= ∅ ∧ ARG2 ̸= ∅ then","Output: St Link relation for","∀{ a1, a2} ∈ St ARG1 × ARG2 end else add cites(S) to st ARG1 end end else Empty St ARG1 and St SLink end end Algorithm 1: Identify Citation Relations between sentences A and B, motivated by the referring expression These and abbreviation HPAIV (highly pathogenic avian influenza virus). When the procedure evaluates sentence C, the citations in A are potential ARG1s. However, as there is not an EXPAND relation between sentences B and C, these potential ARG1s are not stored for connectives in subsequent sentences.","Cross-sentence CONTRAST and CORROBORATE signals (St SLink in Figure 1) are stored in addition to previous ARG1s up to that point. As long as there is a continuous sequence of EXPAND relations linking the subsequent sentences, citations in those sentences can fill the ARG2 slot for St SLink. Figure 3 is one such example: the citations in the the sentence preceding In contrast are ARG1s and the citations following the signal are ARG2s: both citations in the sentence and in subsequent sentences. Storage of these elements is emptied in the absence of EXPAND.","We have implemented the following constraints on these procedures: (1) 2 clauses cannot be linked by multiple discourse relations. Conflicts favor the relations CONTRAST and CAUSE over EXPAND (where discourse CAUSE relations imply 463","A Recently, an H9N2 AIV was isolated from pigs in several provinces in China [25],[26],[27], and a H5N1 HPAIV was identified in pigs in Asian countries [28].","B These observations have led to the conclusion that swine can serve as direct and intermediate hosts for many subtypes of AIVs including the HPAIV of the H5 and H7 subtypes.","C However, there is recent evidence that do-mestic pigs show only low susceptibility to H5N1 HPAIV [29], [30]. Figure 4: Multi-S ARG1: (Ma et al., 2008) CORROBORATE citation relations). This creates separate multi-sentence units for CONTRAST and CORROBORATE relations, since all storage is emptied in the absence of cross-sentence EXPAND relations; (2) the sets of citations for proposed ARG1 and ARG2 cannot have a member in common – this rules out relations that do not make sense (a document contrasting with itself) or that are uninformative (a document corroborating with itself). may be due to failures 3.2 Lexical Entries for Signals We manually constructed a dictionary of signals licensing EXPAND, CORROBORATE and CONTRAST relations. The CORROBORATE and CONTRAST entries are signals which license citation relations, the entries being based on their roles in syntax and discourse structure. The EXPAND entries are signals that license EXPAND discourse relations. We have 246 entries for EXPAND, 48 for CONTRAST and 31 for CORROBORATE. This was feasible because there are a small number of these signals that cover most cases. We based our dictionary on previous work. We examined entries in COMLEX Syntax (Macleod et al., 1996) including the 7 coordinate conjunctions, 108 SCONJ, 96 adverbs marked as (META-ADV :CONJ T), and a few other adverb classes as well. We examined the set of discourse connectives marked in PDTB and classified in its manual (Prasad et al., 2007). We also did some manual annotation (unpublished work) and examined files from our training corpus while creating the system. Sample lexical entries (Figure 5) include: base forms, parts of speech (POS), relation licensed, and constraints.

For example, contrast can be a verb; one of the multi-word prepositions {in contrast with, in contrast to, by contrast to}; or one of the multi-word adverbs {in contrast, by contrast}. Choice of POS for contrast determines the relative positions of ARG1 and ARG2, e.g., for the adverb, it is in the previous clause. Another constraint is the sentence-initial requirement, since some adverbs connect clauses when they occur initially, but not when they occur elsewhere in the sentence. For example, sentence-initial roughly can introduce a sentence that elaborates some aspect of the previous sentence (EXPAND), e.g., Roughly, the chance that this would happen was 8 to 1. However, the non-initial use of roughly still means something like approximately, but the connection with the previous sentence is no longer there, e.g., The odds were roughly 8 to 1. 3.3 System Evaluation We ran DocRelate on a 20 document held-out test corpus. Figure 6 represent 216 correct answers out of 291 relations in the answer key (manual annotation by the author after the system was completed). We evaluated (CORROBORATE, CONTRAST) relations between citations, but not discourse relations between sentences (CAUSE, CONTRAST, EXPAND) or predicate argument relations."]},{"title":"4 Concluding Remarks","paragraphs":["We achieve the highest accuracy for relations linking citations across adjacent sentences.

While the single-sentence case is similar to the 1-sentence-apart case, our results for the latter case were lower because: (a) the inventory of same-sentence signals is larger and many are missing from our lexicon; (b) these signals are less reliable; and (c) our pattern-based approximations of syntactic rules did not work for the sentence-internal case – using parsing based rules would have helped. Our false negatives exceed our false positives. We observed errors due to the following: (1) missing entries in our dictionary; (2) defects in our sentence-internal syntactic analysis; and (3) false positives for self-citations.

Our current system achieves accuracy of 92% precision and 74% recall for CORROBORATE/CONTRAST relations, with some variation based on relation type and the distance between the citations in terms of sentences. for citations not in adjacent sentences. The main contribution of this paper is the working out of the details of how to identify citation relations. Towards this goal, we described a robust system using simple, manually written string-based rules. In future work, we plan to identify properties of additional discourse structures that impact the problem of identifying citation relations. It is likely that a more elaborate system would achieve better results. Such systems could include features based on parsing, semantic role labeling and other text processing, thus mak-ing more precise rules available. Systems based on Machine Learning approaches could also be created based on the features described here, as well as text-processing-based features."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["Supported by the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) via Department of In-terior National Business Center contract number D11PC20154.
