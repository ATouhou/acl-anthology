In this paper, we describe an ongoing effort to build our first Arabic-French phrase– based machine translation system using the Moses decoder among other linguistic tools. The results show an improvement in the quality of translation and a gain in terms of Bleu score after introducing a pre-processing scheme for Arabic and applying some rules based on morphological variations of the source language.

It is a highly inflectional language, which makes the morphological analysis complicated. In Arabic, many coordinat-ing conjunctions, the definite article, many prepositions and particles, and a class of pronouns are all clitics that attach themselves either to the start or the end of words (Attia, 2008). This morphological complexity has consequences on NLP applications, such as machine translation and information retrieval. One the one hand, developing an Arabic-French machine translation system is not an easy task, although there is a vast amount of training data nowadays. On the other hand, dealing with the complexity and ambiguity of the source language plays a major role in boosting the efficiency of the translation system.  In previous research, it was shown that morphological pre-processing of a morphologically rich language, such as Arabic does provide a benefit, especially in the case of limited volume of training data (Goldwater and McClosky, 2005), (Sadat and Habash, 2006), (Lee, 2004), (El Ishibani et al., 2006), (Hasan et al., 2003). In Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) con-text, Habash et Sadat (Habash et Sadat, 2006) pre-processed Arabic texts using different segmentation schemes for translation into English and showed that the quality of translation is generally better than the baseline. Similar findings were reported by (El Ishibani et al., 2006) on Arabic-English SMT. In relation to Arabic-French SMT, few research and evaluations were reported, compared to Arabic-English SMT among other pairs of languages. One of the first statistically-driven machine translation systems for Arabic-French was reported by Hasan et al (Hasan et al., 2006) during the second Cesta evaluation campaign1",". The proposed SMT system used a simple stemming algorithm based on finite-state automata to split Arabic words into prefixes, stem and suffixes. Nevertheless, this simple segmentation method showed a reduced OOV rate from 8.2% to 2.6% for the test data and thus a better quality of translation in terms of BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2001). Another research on Arabic-French SMT was focused on domain adaptation to the news domain and did not consider the pre-processing of the morphologically complex language such as Arabic (Schwenk and Senellart, 2009). An improvement of 3.5 BLEU points on the test set was realized. In relation to improving an SMT system using some language analysis rules, such as re-ordering and Arabic as a source language, there was no  1 http://www.technolangue.net/article.php3?id_article=199 579 reported research on Arabic-French SMT. However, Carpuat et al. (Carpuat et al., 2010) showed that post-verbal subject (VS) constructions are hard to translate because they have highly ambiguous reordering patterns when translated to English. They proposed to reorder VS construc-tion into SV order for SMT word alignment only. This strategy significantly improves BLEU and TER scores of the SMT using Arabic-English language pair. In this paper, we report some experiments related to our first participation in the 2012 TRAD evaluation campaign","2",", that was coordinated by the Laboratoire National de métrologie et d’Essais (LNE) and CASSIDIAN (the defence and security subsidiary of the EADS group), and was funded by the French General Directorate for Armament (DGA). Our main interest at this stage is related to the pre-processing of the source language, in order to improve the quality of translation, rather than the radical changes that might improve the translation or training engines or the increase of the amount of the training corpora. This paper is organized as follows. The morphology of Arabic language is described in section 2. In section 3, we discuss the proposed solutions of pre-processing Arabic through segmentation and different rules on morphological reduction of the source language. In section 4, we present the experiments on Arabic-French SMT with different evaluations. Section 5 concludes the present paper with a discussion and future extension. 2 The Morphology of Arabic Language Before we delve into the methods, we need to discuss the nature of the Arabic language, which has a bearing on the text preparation stage. The Arabic script is complicated in that each white-space-delimited unit may correspond to several syntactic units. The Arabic orthographic unit, a unit delimited by white space, usually carries more than one token. An example is a form like (wsyktbwnhA)","3","(In Eng. “and they will write it”). This grammatically complete sentence carries a conjunction w, a future particle s, a verbal token yktbwn, and a feminine singular third person object pronoun hA. The verbal token is made of a verb ktb, a masculine present third person inflection y and a plural indicative inflection wn. This nature entails that the type token ratio is  2 http://www.trad-campaign.org/ 3 All Arabic transliterations are provided using the Buckwalter transliteration scheme (Buckwalter, 2002) much smaller than it is for a non-morphologically rich language like English for example. This means that the same word does not repeat often enough for the investigator to make valid observations. In order for any linguistic, especially lexical, investigation to be reliable, one needs to perform some sort of morphological analysis capable of reducing the word to its basic form. This has implications on machine translation as it means that no matter how big the training corpus is; the Arabic side will always suffer from scarcity."]},{"title":"3 Pre-processing Arabic for SMT","paragraphs":["With Arabic being morphologically complex and rich, lexical scarcity comes as a natural result. In such cases it helps to reduce this morphological complexity in order to obtain better alignments and decoding for Statistical Machine Translation (Habash et al., 2010). Our goal at this stage is related to the pre-processing of Arabic as a source language, in order to improve the quality of translation. First, in order to perform Arabic pre-processing, we used a machine learning approach that performs word segmentation and POS tagging at the segment level. We then use rules to derive the different pre-processing schemes required for the machine translation experiments. Thus, instead of using MADA (Habash et al., 2010), the well known morphological analyzer for Arabic, we choose another accessible morphological analyzer that is memory-based learning for both word segmentation and Part of Speech tagging (Emad and Kübler, 2010). The segmentation and POS tagging modules above give a rich representation with enough information for almost any further required transformation. Given an input sentence like (a), the system produces (b) as a segmented and annotated sentence, as described in the following example:  (a)"]},{"title":"تتاطلسلاا لیيحرتب تتاباارطضلااا تطبترراا دقوو نیيیيعرشلاا ریيغ نیيرجاهملاا نم دیيدعلل ةیيسنرفلاا ","paragraphs":["(In Buckwalter transliteration: wqd ArtbTt AlADTrAbAt btrHyl AlslTAt Alfrnsyp llEdyd mn AlmhAjryn gyr Al$rEyyn).

The Basic experiment is the baseline of all the work we are doing. In this experiment, the Arabic side undergoes minimal pre-processing in which we only separate the punctuation and remove the occasional diacritization (the short vowels). Short vowels do not normally occur in Arabic, but sometimes scattered ones are there mainly for disambiguation purposes; however since their use is not standardized and subjective, their removal usually leads to better agreement between the training and test sets. Tokenized. In this context, tokenization means splitting the prefixes and suffixes that have a syntactic value and that usually stand as independent words in other languages. Examples of these include the possessive pronouns (-hm, -h, - y, -hA), conjunctions (w, f), and prepositions (l-, k-, t-). We have also chosen to split the Arabic definite article Al due to the perceived similarity in distribution between the Arabic and French definite articles. The sentence above “wqd ArtbTt AlADTrAbAt btrHyl AlslTAt Alfrnsyp llEdyd mn AlmhAjryn gyr Al$rEyyn ” is thus tokenized as “w/CONJ qd/VERB_PART ArtbT/PV+t/PVSUFF_SUBJ:3FS Al/DET AD-TrAb/NOUN+At/NSUFF_FEM_PL b/PREP trHyl/NOUN Al/DET slT/NOUN+At/NSUFF_FEM_PL Al/DET frnsy/ADJ+p/NSUFF_FEM_SG l/PREP Al/DET Edyd/NOUN mn/PREP Al/DET mhAjr/NOUN+yn/NSUFF_MASC_PL_GEN gyr/NEG_PART Al/DET $rEy/ADJ+yn/ NSUFF_MASC_PL_GEN”. Where the conjunction w, the prepositions b and l, and the definite article Al are no longer prefixes, but separate tokens. The process also normalized the definite article from l to Al, which is the more frequent form. MorpReduced. In the morphologically reduced experiment, we reduce the morphology of Arabic to a level that makes it closer to that of the French language. An example of this is the dual form, which does not occur in French and has thus been transformed to the plural. The following table (Table 1) lists the most common examples of Arabic morphological reduction.

Thus, the total number of sentences is 118 000 for the training corpora. The development corpus contains 20,000 words, namely 40,000 words with the reference. The evaluation corpus contains 15,000 words with 4 references. The common practice of extracting bilingual phrases from the parallel data usually consists of three steps: first, words in bilingual sentence pairs are aligned using state-of-the-art automatic word alignment tools, such as GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003), in both directions; second, word alignment links are refined using heuristics, such as Grow-Diagonal-Final (GDF) method; third, bilingual phrases are extracted from the parallel data based on the refined word alignments with predefined constraints (Och and Ney, 2003). The trigram language models are implemented using the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002). Moses4","","4 Available on http://www.statmt.org/ moses/  581 (Koehn et al., 2007), an open source toolkit for phrase-based SMT system, was used as a decoder. These steps of building a translation system are considered as a common practice in the state-of-the-art of phrase-based SMT systems. Our research for improving the Arabic-French SMT system was emphasized more on the pre-processing part of the SMT system. We have measured the effect of the proposed pre-processing steps on data sparseness, based on the percentage of unknown unigrams (OOVs) on a development set (dev set). Table 2 summarizes the findings on the dev set. We give numbers in terms of tokens (the total number of words) and types (the number of unique words in the text, i.e. no-redundant words in the text). It can be noticed that the tokenization has a major effect on combatting data sparseness and consequently improving the quality of translation as measured by the BLEU score. Morphological normalization, which is a layer on top of tokenization, improves things even further, and this is reflected in the difference between the baseline BLEU score and the MorphReduced BLUE score which is 8.6 absolute points. Table 3 compares the results, in term of BLEU scores, of the three experimental settings in 3 evaluations schemes, as follows:  (a) Standard, which includes performing recasing and removing white space before punctuation, (b) Nopunct, in which punctuation is stripped and evaluation is performed on the lexical text only, and (c) Nopunctcase in which, in addition to removing punctuation, all words are lower-cased. We can see from Table 3 that the Baseline experiment produces the lowest results, and that the tokenization scheme is a big leap with a 7.2 BLEU scores of improvement (25.9 vs. 33.1), which means that performing tokenization is really a necessary step for translating from Arabic, and that the morphological complexity of Arabic could be a hindrance to quality automatic translation. While tokenization leads to considerable improvement, morphological reduction fares even better with a 7.4 BLEU score higher than the baseline. This could be due to the fact the morphological reduction reduces the number of unknown words even further than tokenization alone. It is still an open question whether the positive effect of pre-processing will still carry over with increasing the amount of training data and to what extent this will help.

We have introduced pre-processing schemes for the source language (Arabic) and some rules of language analysis related to the target language (French). Our method for POS tagging and segmentation of Arabic texts showed a significant improvement in terms of BLEU score; however it does not assume the best results. The introduced morphological rule that reduces the morphology of Arabic to a level that makes it closer to that of the French language, showed the best results. Our future work is focused on the introduction of extra swapping rules, to introduce some structural matching between the source language (Arabic) and the target language (French). Moreover, we are planning to introduce more rules for the recognition and transliteration of named entities; which makes our translation system a hybrid rule-based and statistical SMT system. We will also investigate the integration of more training data such as comparable corpora to make our MT system more competitive and reliable.",""," 582"]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Attia, M. 2008.
