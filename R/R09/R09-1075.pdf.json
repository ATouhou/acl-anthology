We tag the word affective meaning by one of the WordNet Affect six labels anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise and group into “positive” (joy, surprise) and “negative” (anger, disgust, fear, sadness) classes. We use the word spelling, a word form, to represent words in machine learning experiments to solve the multi-class classification and binary classification problems. The results show that the word form can be a reliable source of learning the affect.","Keywords: phonosemantics, sentiment analysis, machine learning"]},{"title":"1 Motivation","paragraphs":["Computational Natural Language Learning have been making steady progress in various aspects of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Many tasks have been successfully solved, e.g., document topic classification obtained accuracy comparable with human evaluation. However, some problems have been a challenge for algorithmic solutions, although humans routinely solve such tasks, e.g., spotting difference between terrible accident and terrific situation.","A fundamental, essential language characteristic is the word sense which is often recognized in a rather in-tuitive way. Senses of words given in machine-readable dictionaries sometimes are not adequate to what people have in mind. This inadequacy was demonstrated in the field of word sense disambiguation (WSD) where the machine- readable dictionaries failed to help in text understanding [5]. At the same time, some tools have become a success. WordNet1",", a public domain lexical knowledge base, is a powerful semantic network regularly used in word sense disambiguation. Another example is Roger’s Thesaurus 2","which groups words to-gether by implicit semantic relations. Such resources map word senses to certain explanations and connections with other words.","In the current work, we use machine learning algorithms to learn relations between word meanings and their sounds. A word as a linguistic sign can be attributed with two essential characteristics, the sound 1 http://wordnet.princeton.edu/ 2 http://thesaurus.reference.com/ and meaning , where meaning refers to the word reference, i.e. the concept the word describes. For example, ball and its sound directly correlate with a round, soft object which is used to throw and catch around. Relations between the word sound and meaning are far from certain. In [3], the association between the word sound and its meaning is said to be arbitrary. In contrast, Phonosemantics, the theory of sound symbolism, is based on a hypothesis that relations exist between the two characteristics [13].","The goal of this work is to build lexical resources for Russian and Romanian languages based on the WordNet-Affect domains. The resources are then used to test the hypothesis that word form is relevant to meaning, in this case – the emotions the words convey. We build two data sets, Russian and Romanian respectively, based on the WordNet Affect emotion synsets [12]. To represent the data in machine learning experiments, we use the fact that in Russian and Romanian languages the word sounds directly correspond to the word orthography. Thus, we use the word spelling, a word form, as a substitution for its sound. Specifically, we use the letter form of transliterated Russian words and Romanian words for machine learning classification of words’ affects. The word emotions are categorized into the WordNet Affect emotion classes anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. We solve multi-class and binary classification problems. to classify the words into the six classes and into binary (joy, surprise vs others) classes. We apply algorithms with different learning paradigms. The obtained empirical results show that, under certain conditions, the word form can be a reliable source of learning its affect.","Our study contributes to the development of much needed tools, as in recent years, most of the Internet use growth was supported by non-native English speakers. Starting in 2000, for non-English speaking regions, the growth has surpassed 3,000 % compared with the over-all growth of 342%.3","Consequently, the amount of text data written in languages other than English rapidly increased. This surge has prompted the demand for automated text analysis. The tool development progressed for some languages (French, German, Japanese, Chinese, Arabic), whereas some languages ( Eastern European), have not yet attracted much attention from the NLP and Text Data Mining community. The presented study contributes to filling the gap. 3 http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm"]},{"title":"416 2 Phonosemantics","paragraphs":["Words (rabbits) and morphemes (rabbit,-s) are commonly accepted as the meaning-bearing units which provide association between sound and meaning [7]. However, a hypothesis that smaller units, phonemes and phonetic features, can bear meaning has found supporters in Phonosemantics research [6, 8, 9]. Based on the notion of distinctions [15], three types of sound meaning have been suggested [8, 9]:","Onomatopoeia is the imitation of a sound like, for example, in roar or moo. Clustering is an effect of the semantic association.","True Iconism is the visceral effect of the sound on a person.","Semantic properties of the phonetic features are unconsciously learned by a child, e.g. the smallness implicit in the /i/ sound and the wetness implicit in the /w/4",". Once the word is assigned to its referent, i.e., concept, this intuitively apprehended semantics is masked by the referent, but it does not cease to act altogether. The effect of the sound is still influencing the word. This influence remains on the unconscious level therefore it is difficult to pick out phoneme senses.","In this work, we hypothesize that a word’s form and sound have certain relations with its meaning. Consequently, the meaning of a word is in part inherited from its form. For example, slide is a smooth motion, the smoothness and slipperiness so common in /sl/ shows up in the actual referent for slide [9]. In words with a more specific reference, the component of the reference is more salient; consequently, the sound-meaning part is less salient. For example, words which denote material objects (house, train) have senses dominated by the referents. On the other hand, words which denote abstract concepts as sensations, feelings and emotions keep more sound semantics in their forms (anger, joy, agitation). Thus, words describing similar sentiments should have something similar in their sounding (vex, worry), whereas words representing opposite feelings should have much less in common (disgust, elation).","Relations between the form and meaning of English emotional words were analyzed in [10]. The authors applied K-Nearest Neighbor, a prototype-based learner, to classify affective words into multi-class and binary emotion categories. The empirical results showed that the word forms for English words expressing the same emotion are alike in certain ways. Our current study differs from [10] as follows:","1. We study Russian and Romanian emotional words. Both languages are Eastern European, be-longing to Slavic and Latin families, respectively.","2. We analyze the learning abilities of different paradigms, i.e. probability-, prototype-, decision-and optimization-based algorithms. 4 http://www.trismegistos.com/MagicalLetterPage/ Table 1: Translation of the WordNet 05573914 n English Romanian preference preferinta penchant inclinatie, slabiciune predilection predilectie taste a avea gust, a gusta, a cunoaste; a","gusta; a degusta (un aliment), de-","gustare, . . ."]},{"title":"3 Lexical Resources WordNet Affect","paragraphs":["WordNet-Affect 5","is a lexical re-source which is based on the lexical knowledge of the (English) WordNet. WordNet-Affect contains words which convey affects. A number of affective labels (a-labels) were manually assigned to the synonym sets (synsets) of nouns, adjectives, verbs, and adverbs. The words with the Emotion tag were fine-grain annotated using six labels: joy, fear, anger, sadness, disgust, surprise [12]. The six emotion tags were adapted from the study of human non-verbally expressed emotions [4]. We used the WordNet Affect data provided at the SemEval-2007 “Affective Text” [11]. Russian and Romanian WordNet Affects We translated the WordNet Affect synsets into Russian and Romanian. We applied a three-step approach:","Translation We manually translated every word in the six WordNet Affect emotion categories; Table 1 gives an example of a synset translation. We omitted word combinations (get happy), collocations and idioms. The other restriction was that the translations were related to the emotion of the synset. We postponed part-of-speech correspondence till the later phases. For the Romanian data set, we used the on-line dictionary Dexonline 6","to obtain all synonyms of the translated words.","Building the word sets to form the word sets for analysis, we made a list of all the translations. We edited them to delete words which meanings were not close to the emotion, e.g., for taste, only preferinta was left, all the food references were removed (Table 1). We removed duplicate translations as well. As a result, we built six sets of Russian words and six sets of Romanian words expressing the WordNet Affect emotions.","Reducing the number of the paronymous words Russian and Romanian languages are rich in derivations (schastlivyi, schastliven’kii); there were sometimes four, five – or more – words with the same root. We removed all the paronymous words. Note that Romanian and Russian languages allow letter alternation in the word root. Thus, we kept two words per root (zlo, zliti) if the number of matching letters was < 3. 5 http://wndomains.itc.it. 6 http://dexoline.ro"]},{"title":"417 Table 2:","paragraphs":["Data sets of affective words: English, Russian, Romanian.","Classes English data Russian data Romanian data # synsets % synsets # words % words # words initial # words % words # words initial # words","%","words anger 128 21.0 318 20.7 149 105 13.0 316 151 25.0 disgust 20 3.3 72 4.7 46 31 5.0 93 43 3.9 fear 83 13.5 208 13.5 118 71 14.6 123 55 12.8 joy 228 37.2 539 35.1 253 183 36.2 510 211 37.7 sadness 29 4.7 309 20.1 217 128 25.6 241 111 16.2 surprise 124 20.3 90 5.9 54 29 5.6 91 48 4.4 Total 612 100.0 1536 100.0 837 547 100.0 1374 619 100.0 Table 3: Distribution of the affective nouns in the Russian and Romanian data.","Russian Data Romanian Data Classes # nouns % Classes # nouns % anger 39 13.0 anger 51 25.0 disgust 15 5.0 disgust 8 3.9 fear 44 14.6 fear 26 12.8 joy 109 36.2 joy 77 37.7 sadness 77 25.6 sadness 33 16.2 surprise 17 5.6 surprise 9 4.4 Total 301 100.0 Total 204 100.0","Table 2 describes the WordNet-Affect synsets used in our work: # synsets presents the initial number of the English synsets, % synsets shows per cent for each class, # words – the unique words count for the English, % words – per cent of words for each emotion, # words initial presents the number of the Russian words before the removal of paronymous words, # words and % words list counts and per cent of the Russian words which were used in classification experiments, # words initial, # words, % words list the similar information for the Romanian data set.

We have studied emotion words in Russian and Romanian. The obtained empirical results show the reliability of our learning approach. On the Russian and Romanian data sets, the applied algorithms performed considerably better than baselines. Although the difference in data sets does not allow a direct comparison, our results appear to be more accurate and precise than the results for the English affective words [10].","Based on the results of this study, we propose that there is similarity among the forms of words that express the same emotion: the word form similarity was captured by machine learning algorithms which classified words according to their emotion tags. We also sought a better word form presentation. In Russian and Romanian languages, word spelling can be considered as a word phonetic equivalent. This feature allowed us to limit the search to letter-based representations. It should be noted that letter representations provided better results for English affective words [10], although in English correspondence between the letters and phonemes is not unique, i.e. the same letter can represent different sounds depending on the neighboring letters (cat – [k],certain–[s]). Thus, we can conclude that for phonosemantic classification, letter representations may provide relevant information about the word form.","For future studies, we plan to concentrate on features which better discriminate among emotion classes. We also want to determine which sounds better correlate with the conveyed emotions. Our current hypothesis is that for every emotion there are several classes of words that share common phonological features. For example, the sound z is present in Russian words with meaning of amazement; the transliterated sound sh can be found in Russian words representing a kind of stupefaction (there is no absolutely precise translation of these words in English). Note that the exact translation of the English word stupefy is ostolbenet’. Hence, the transliterated word and its translation share the combination of sounds st. These are preliminary remarks. A thorough analysis will be able to demonstrate the existence – or the absence – of semantic relations between words with common phonetic features. Another venue would be to expand our current study to part-of-speech other than nouns. We also are interested in conducting human evaluation., i.e., based on the listed word representations, query native speakers about evoked emotions."]},{"title":"6 Conclusions","paragraphs":["We have constructed Russian and Romanian word sets based on the WordNet Affect domains.
