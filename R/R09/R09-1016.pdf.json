In NLP, taxonomies such as WordNet [17] are widely used in intermediate tasks such as word sense disambiguation (e.g. [1]) and selectional preference induction (e.g., [25]) as well as in final applications such as question answering (e.g., [4]) and textual entailment recognition (e.g. [5]). In KR, taxonomies as well as other word networks are the bulk of domain ontologies.","To be effectively used in NLP and KR applications, taxonomies and knowledge repositories have to be large or, at least, adapted to specific domains. Yet, even huge knowledge repositories such as WordNet [17] are extremely poor when used in specific domains such as the medical domain (see [29]). Automatically creat-ing, adapting, or extending existing knowledge repositories using domain texts is, then, a very important and active area. A large variety of methods have been proposed: ontology learning methods [16, 3, 19] in KR as well as knowledge harvesting methods in NLP such as [13, 21]. These learning methods use variants of the distributional hypothesis [12] or exploit some induced lexical-syntactic patterns (originally used in [26]). The task is generally seen as a classification (e.g., [22, 27]) or a clustering (e.g., [3]) problem. This allows the use of machine learning models.","Yet, as any other machine learning problem, knowledge harvesting and ontology learning models exploit the above hypothesis to build feature spaces where instances, i.e., words as in [22] or word pairs as in [27], are represented. These feature spaces are used to determine whether or not new word pairs coming from the text collection have to be included in existing knowledge repositories. Decision models are learnt","∗","DISP University Rome “Tor Vergata“ using existing knowledge repositories and then applied to new words or word pairs. Generally, these models use as features all the possible and relevant generalized contexts where words or word pairs can appear. For example, possible features in the word pair classification problem are ”is a” and ”as well as”. Given the nature of the problem, these feature spaces can then be huge as they include all potential relevant features for a particular relation among words. Relevant features are not known in advance. Yet, large feature spaces can have negative effects on machine learning models such as increasing the computational load and introducing redundant or noisy features. Feature selection is the solution (see [11]).","In this paper, we want to study how to improve performances of taxonomy learning methods by using feature selection. We focus on the probabilistic taxonomy learning model introduced by [27] as it uses existing taxonomies exploiting the transitivity of the isa relation. Leveraging on the particular model, we propose a novel way of using singular value decomposition (SVD) as unsupervised model for feature selection. In a nutshell, given the probabilistic model for taxonomy learning, we use SVD as a way to compute the pseudo-inverse matrix needed in logistic regression. We will analyze if our method for using unsupervised feature selection positively affect performances.","Before staring, in Sec. 2 we will shortly review methods for taxonomy learning and for feature selection. We motivate our choice of working within the probabilistic setting. In Sec. 3, as SVD is the core of our method, we will then introduce SVD as unsupervised feature selection model. In Sec. 4 we then describe how we introduced SVD as natural feature selector in the probabilistic taxonomy learning model introduced by [27]. To describe how we use SVD as natural feature selector, we will shortly review the logistic regression used to compute the taxonomy learning model. We will describe our experiments in Sec. 5. Finally, in Sec. 6, we will draw some conclusions and describe our future work."]},{"title":"2 Related work","paragraphs":["Extracting knowledge bases from texts is one of the major goal of NLP and KR.

For example, it is used in [3] for populating lattices, i.e. graphs of a particular class, of formal concepts.","Lexical syntactic patterns are also a source of relevant information for deciding whether or not a particular relation holds between two words. This approach has been widely used for detecting hypernymy relations such as in [13, 18], for other ontological relations such as in [21], or for more generic relations such as in [24, 28]. These learning models generally use the hypothesis that two words are related according to a particular relation if these often appear in specific text fragments.","Despite the wide range of models for taxonomy learning, only very few exploit the structure of existing taxonomies. The task is seen as building taxonomies from scratch. In [3], for example, lattices and the related taxonomies are the target. Yet, existing taxonomies may be used to drive the process of building new taxonomies. In [19], WordNet [17] and WordNet glosses are used to drive the construction of domain specific ontologies. In [22], taxonomies are augmented exploiting their structure. Inserting a new word in the network is seen as a classification problem. The target classes are the nodes of the existing hierarchy. The distributional description of the word as well as the existing taxonomy structure is used to make the decision. This model is purely distributional. In [27], a probabilistic model exploiting existing taxonomies is introduced. This model is purely based on lexicalsyntactical patterns. Also in this case, the insertion of a new word in the hierarchy is seen as a binary classification problem. Yet, the classification decision is taken over a pair of words, i.e., a word and its possible generalization. The probabilistic classifier should decide if this pair belongs or not to the taxonomy.","The probabilistic taxonomy learning models has at least two advantages with respect to the other models. The first advantage is that it coherently uses existing taxonomies in the expansion phase. Both existing and new information is modeled in the same probabilistic way. The second advantage is that classification problem is binary, i.e., a word pair belongs or not to the taxonomy. This allows to build a unique binary classifier. This is not the case for models such as the one of [22], where we need a multi-class classifier or a set of binary classifiers. For these two reasons, we are using the probabilistic taxonomy learning setting for our study.","Yet, in applications involving texts such as taxonomy learning, machine learning models are exposed to huge feature spaces. This has not always positive effects. A first important problem is that huge feature spaces require large computational and storage resources for applying machine learning models. A second problem is that more features not always result in better accuracies of learnt classification models. Many features can be noise. Feature selection, i.e., the reduction of the feature space offered to machine learners, is seen as a solution (see [11]).","There is a wide range of feature selection models that can be classified in two main families: supervised and unsupervised. Supervised models directly exploit the class of the instances for determining if a feature is relevant or not. The idea is to select features that are highly correlated with final target classes. Information theoretic ranking criteria such as mutual information and information gain are often used (see [8]). Unsupervised models are instead used when the information on classes of instances is not available at the training time or it is inapplicable such as in information retrieval. Straightforward and simple models for unsupervised feature selection can be derived from information retrieval weighting schemes, e.g., term frequency times inverse document frequency (tf ∗idf). In this case, relevant features are respectively those appearing more often or those more selective, i.e., appearing in fewer instances.","Feature selection models are also widely used in taxonomy learning. For example, attribute selection for building lattices of concepts in [3] is done applying specific thresholds on specific information measures on the attributes extracted from corpora. This models uses conditional probabilities, point-wise mutual information, and a selectional-preference-like measure as the one introduced in [25]."]},{"title":"3 Unsupervised Feature Selection with SVD","paragraphs":["A very important way of unsupervised feature selection is the application of the SVD. As this is the bulk of our methodology we will review how SVD can be used for this purpose. SVD has been largely used in information retrieval for reducing the dimension of the document vector space [7].","SVD, originally, is a decomposition of a rectangular matrix. Given a generic rectangular n × m matrix A, its singular value decomposition is A = U ΣV T","where U is a matrix n × r, V T","is a r × m and Σ is a diagonal matrix r × r. The diagonal elements of the Σ are the singular values such as δ1 ≥ δ2 ≥ ... ≥ δr > 0 where r is the rank of the matrix A. For the decomposition, SVD exploits the linear combination of rows and columns of A.","There are different ways of using SVD as unsupervised feature reduction. An interesting way is to exploit its approximated computations, i.e. :","A ≈ Ak = Um×kΣk×kV T k×n (1) where k is smaller than the rank r. The computation algorithm [10] allows to stop at a given k different from the real rank r. The property of the singular values, i.e., δ1 ≥ δ2 ≥ ... ≥ δr > 0, guarantees that the first k are bigger than the discarded ones. There is a direct relation between the informativeness of the i-th new dimension and the singular value δi.

The taxonomy is seen as a set T of assertions R over pairs Ri,j. If Ri,j is in T , i is a concept and j is one of its generalization (i.e., the direct or the indirect generalization). For example, Rdog,animal ∈ T describes that dog is an animal according to the taxonomy T .","The main probabilities are then: (1) the prior probability P (Ri,j ∈ T ) of an assertion Ri,j to belong to the taxonomy T and (2) the posterior probability P (Ri,j ∈ T |−→e i,j) of an assertion Ri,j to belong to the taxonomy T given a set of evidences −→e i,j derived from the corpus. These evidences are derived from the contexts where the pair (i, j) is found in the corpus. The vector −→e","i,j is a feature vector associated with a pair (i, j). For example, a feature may describe how many times i and j are seen in patterns like ”i as j” or ”i is a j”. These among many other features are indicators of an is-a relation between i and j (see [13]).","Given a set of evidences E over all the relevant word pairs, the probabilistic taxonomy learning task is defined as the problem of finding a taxonomy ̂T that maximizes the probability of having the evidences E, i.e.:","̂T = arg max T P (E|T ) In [27], this maximization problem is solved with a local search. What is maximized at each step is the ratio between the likelihood P (E|T ′",") and the likelihood P (E|T ) where T ′","= T ∪ N and N are the relations added at each step. This ratio is called multiplicative change ∆(N ) and is defined as follows ∆(N ) = P (E|T ′",")/P (E|T ). The main innovation of the model in [27] is the possibility of adding at each step the best relation N = {Ri,j} as well as Ri,j with all the relations induced from Ri,j, i.e., N = {Ri,j} ∪ I(Ri,j) where I(Ri,j) are the relations induced using the existing taxonomy and Ri,j.
