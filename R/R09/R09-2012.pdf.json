Projection-based approaches, which are among the most popular ones, rely on a seed bilingual lexicon. Surprisingly, there is no careful analysis of the impact of the size the initial context and coverage of the lexicon. This is precisely the focus of this study. We observe that source context size and lexicon coverage influence robustness in projection-based term translation. In particular, we show that increasing the number of seed words by a factor of three leads to a 20% relative improvement in accuracy."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Parallel corpora have been widely used in machine translation. For example, sentence and word aligment models proposed by [2], or applications to multilingual terminology extraction [8]. This approach, using parallel corpora, yields good results. But the lack of parallel texts is still an issue. This is particularly true for specific domains. Building parallel corpora is time-consuming and relies heavily on human translators. Even if domain specific parallel corpora exist, terminology extraction often amounts to reverse engineering the work of human translators.","This is a reason why comparable corpora [11] are studied by researchers in multilingual terminology extraction. Some authors have shown that statistical methods can make use of comparable corpora. In particular, [17] paved the way for a family of approaches that assumes that co-occurrences of words which are translations of each other are correlated in comparable corpora. Basically, we can observe that a word and its translation appear in the same lexical environment, which can be used as a context vector [5]. This projection-based translation approach can be applied to terminology extraction. For example in [14], a term extraction program coupled with a lexical alignment program are implemented to manage this task.","Usually, in projection-based term extraction, a bilingual or multilingual lexicon is needed to do the projec-tion from one language to another. This step depends on the lexicon and the context vector. To the best of our knowledge, there are no analyses on the impact of the initial context size or on the coverage of the lexicon in such projection-based methods. This is precisely the focus of this paper. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in section two, we present the projection-based approach and describe related work. In section three, we explain the experimental settings. In section four, we present the resources used. Finally the results are presented in section five, followed by a discussion in section six."]},{"title":"2 Projection-based Approach 2.1 Description","paragraphs":["In the source language text, the term to be translated is surrounded by a context consisting of other terms. This information helps us build a context vector, with a flexible window around the term [6, 14] for example. Then this context has to be projected in the target language. The target context vector is built thanks to a bilingual lexicon. This lexicon-based step is the basis of projection-based approaches. To retrieve translation candidates, the projected context vector has to be compared with all possible vectors in the target language built directly from corpora.","This comparison can be computed with different similarity measures. Usually, the Cosine, Jaccard or Dice coefficient [9] are used. [18] obtained better results using the city-block metric than using the Cosine, Jaccard coefficient, Euclidean distance and scalar product. [14] have also made studies on the impact of different metrics to extract terms’ translation pairs. The figure 1 illustrates this projection-based approach."]},{"title":"2.2 Related Works","paragraphs":["Studies on parallel corpora has allowed to identify features like co-occurrence position of a word and its translation [10, 19, 21]. Switching to non-parallel corpora implies that the co-occurrence feature is not directly applicable because there are no direct correspondences between sentences or segments. Another word feature correlating words pairs, called context heterogeneity [5], can be applied to texts in different languages which are not translations of each other. Computed on comparable corpora, the context heterogeneity measure can be used to retrieve domain-"]},{"title":"66 Fig. 1:","paragraphs":["General representation of the projection-based approach with comparable corpora. specific word pairs in unrelated languages (English and Japanese for example).","[17] concludes that patterns of co-occurrences of words between different languages are correlated in non-parallel corpora. In [18], co-occurrence matrices are built from comparable corpora, and used to compare the projected vectors with all possible vectors from the initial text. In the same study, a small seed word lexicon, which does not cover the test set, is used and expanded during the experiments with the projection-based approach.","Based on these studies, [14] proposed an approach to solve multi-word term translation from non-parallel corpora. They first adapt the single-word term context vector approach proposed by [7] to multi-word term. Then, an implementation of the direct context vector method is proposed and applied to terminology extraction between unrelated languages (French/Japanese). Different metrics are compared to compute similarity between the context vector of the term to translate and the context-matrix built from the initial corpora [14].","In these studies, much attention is paid to similarity metrics between context vectors, built on single or multi-word term co-occurrence values. The projection-based approach described here requires a bilingual seed word lexicon, and it is very surprising that its coverage is not yet carefully studied. Only terms in the lexicon are projected in the target context vector, so this aspect is very important for initial context-vector projection."]},{"title":"3 Experimental Settings","paragraphs":["Our system takes as input a list of domain-specific single and multi-word terms to translate. Each of them is a query for document retrieval in a comparable corpus. Terms from these documents compose an initial context vector. Then we use a seed word lexicon to project the context from source to target language. The resulting target language vector is used to retrieve documents from a comparable corpus. The aim of this study is to manage and score document retrievals containing initial term translations, according to initial translation references. The impact of the initial context’s size variations, its seed word lexicon coverage and the lexicon size are studied. Experiments were conducted on French to English single and multi-word term translations. The implementation is composed of five parts :","1. Document retrieval (the query is the term to translate)","2. Initial context vector construction from words contained in documents","3. Projection of the vector in the target language using the seed word lexicon 4. Document retrieval with projected vector","5. Oracle scoring on documents : containing or not the term translation The score is computed on retrieved documents. If a returned document contains the candidate translation, an oracle is set to 1, otherwise it remains at 0. It is possible that the initial context vector can not be built, because the corpus does not contain the term to translate. It is also possible that the projected vector cannot be used to retrieve documents in the target language. The first reason is that the translation reference is not in the corpora. We decide then to compute two oracle scores : on all candidates from the initial term list and on candidates with an initial context covered by the corpora.","The task is to verify whether the target language context is robust enough to retrieve documents containing the initial term translation. It is the first thing we want to measure. We make variations of the initial context and the seed word lexicon size, but also of the seed word lexicon coverage."]},{"title":"4 Resources 4.1 Comparable Corpora","paragraphs":["Using the World Wide Web as a non-parallel corpus can solve the problems of accessibility, relevance and quantity of data.

The first is made to be sure that Wikipedia can be used to build source language contexts. This means that the term to translate is in the corpus. Then, a second filtering step is done on Wikipedia with the translation proposed in MeSH for every term. After these two steps, 2 000 terms were removed, because none of them are covered by Wikipedia."]},{"title":"4.3 Bilingual Seed Word Lexicon","paragraphs":["To manage a pivot between different languages, a domain specific lexicon has to be built.

The source context-vector is then sufficient to do the projection in the target language and to retrieve good documents. In theory, this means that an initial context-vector of 200 terms is required. Besides, the average projected context-vector size is about 12.09 seeds. The seed word lexicon coverage of the initial context is, in theory, about 6.04%. In fact, the size of the initial context-vector depends on the number of terms contained in the documents from Wikipedia. The average lexicon coverage of initial contexts in all experiments is around 11% (from 9% to 13% depending on the size of the initial context-vectors).","On the experiments with 20 initial documents, we can see that increasing the number of seeds by a factor of three leads to a relative improvement in oracle accuracy of 20%. If we look at the results on 1 document and 50 terms per document, compared to the results on 20 documents with 5 terms, for a lower number of seeds (6.37 instead of 6.81) and half of the initial context-vector size (50 words instead of 100), the oracle accuracy of document retrieval is enhanced. It can be explained by a higher seed word lexicon coverage, associated to a better initial context-vector. In fact, this context-vector is closer to the candidate to translate. All the words used to build the context are in the first document retrieved by the search engine, that is the document with the best cosine similarity measure.","The tables 2 and 3 contain the oracle and limited scores, respectively with the general and the medical seed word lexicons. We can see that a higher recall is obtained with the domain-specific lexicon. The reason is that this seed word lexicon gives a higher initial context coverage.
