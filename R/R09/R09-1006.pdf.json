Our framework extracts in an unsupervised way knowledge for a set of concepts hierarchically ordered. For example, for the concept bewick’s swan, one of the concepts in bird taxonomy, some extracted properties are: have few natural predator 1",", live in water, is a small Holarctic swan. From a logical/ontological point of view the extracted knowledge can be classified as: quantifier restrictions (e. g. most birds build nests), parts of the instances of the concepts in the taxonomy (e.g. small head and long thick mane for the concept shetland pony), alternative classification of the concepts in the taxonomy (herd animal and social creature for the concept horse), etc.","The knowledge relevant for concepts can be automatically extracted from a variety of sources: dictionaries, databases, corpora, web directories and others. Recently, Wikipedia drew the attention of various research groups as a goldmine resource for information retrieval [3], information extraction [9] and ontology building [8].","There are some characteristics that make Wikipedia an appropriate resource for information extraction. Firstly, its coverage is impressive: the English Wikipedia has almost three million articles currently 1","In this paper the concepts will be typed in bold and the","properties in italics maintained and updated by thousands of voluntary contributors, thus surpassing any other encyclopedia in history. Secondly, the style of writing Wikipedia articles is more homogeneous than the mixed bag of styles one encounters in general corpora or in unrestricted text found on the web. Thirdly, Wikipedia has a large network of links, categories and info-boxes allowing a combination of techniques for information extraction.","This paper introduces a novel method for acquisition of knowledge for taxonomies of concepts from the raw Wikipedia text. We assume that similar concepts (i.e. those classified under the same node in a taxonomy) are described in a comparable way in Wikipedia. More precisely, we suppose that the relevant knowledge of these similar concepts is expressed using equivalent surface patterns. The learning process starts with the generation of concept hierarchies from WordNet. The concepts in each hierarchy are mapped onto Wikipedia pages and the knowledge appropriate to the concepts is automatically extracted at a precision ranging from 55 to 66 percents depending on the taxonomy.","The remaining of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we present the mapping of concept taxonomy onto Wikipedia pages and discuss the algorithm for knowledge extraction. Section 3 presents, evaluates and discusses the results. Section 4 compares our work with related approaches and the last section summarizes the results and concludes the paper."]},{"title":"2 Knowledge Extraction for Taxonomies of Concepts","paragraphs":["The knowledge extraction precision depends on the accuracy of the classification of Wikipedia pages. Each concept from the taxonomy should be precisely mapped on the corresponding Wikipedia article. Therefore, to generate the taxonomy of concepts and map the generated taxonomy onto Wikipedia articles we follow the next steps:","• First, we pick a concept of interest representing the higher level node of the taxonomy to be extracted and map it onto a WordNet synset. For example, if you have chosen the concept dog and you want to get the sense corresponding to the animal, you map the concept to the sense number 1 in WordNet."]},{"title":"28","paragraphs":["• Second, the hyponymy (sub)tree having as root the concept chosen in the previous step is produced and the concepts in the tree are mapped onto Wikipedia pages. As others have shown [5] the best mapping heuristic is to choose that member of a synset which has the sense number 1 . Even so, the ambiguity problem is not completely solved. For it is possible that concepts having low or no ambiguity in WordNet to be highly ambiguous in Wikipedia. Fortunately, in this case the Wikipedia server returns a page having a standard structure and allows us to reject the ambiguous concept or to guess the right mapping. The disambiguation is performed concatenating the ambiguous concept with each of its WordNet hyperonyms and searching again in Wikipedia until an unambiguos entry is found. For example, the concept buckskin appears in two synsets in WordNet and in 8 possible entries in Wikipedia. Because we are interested in the sense of buckskin having the hyperonym horse we concatenate the two words (buckskin (horse)) and send the new entry to Wikipedia server. Fortunately, in this case no ambiguity results and the correct mapping is automatically performed. The generated taxonomy is used as input by the system in Figure 1. The Extracted taxonomy is mapped onto the Wikipedia pages (the first part of Figure 1) and the pipeline of the system is made by a set of modules, each of them working on the output produced by the preceding module in the pipeline. Fig. 1: The pipeline of the system for knowledge extraction","The module Article Downloader and Parser downloads the Wikipedia articles corresponding to the categories in the taxonomy. From the rough downloaded content of Wikipedia articles we eliminate the useless html tags and the head structure of the article is recovered (e.g. to each higher order head in the article its corresponding text is assigned). In addition, the module eliminates the content of some heads not used by the system, like: Links, Miscellaneous, See also.","The next module, Sentence Extractor and Co-Reference Resolution, extracts from the Wikipedia text of an article all sentences containing references to the title concept. The idea behind extracting all sentences containing the title concept is that these sentences express in a direct way relevant information about the categories in the taxonomy. To extend the range of the sentences extracted, the module performs a basic co-reference resolution. It assumes that pronouns like their, it, he, they found within the first three words of a sentence refer back to the title concept. Further, all references at the beginning of a sentence (within the first five words) to any concept in the taxonomic chain of the title concept are also extracted.","Then the module Linguistic Processing performs part-of-speech tagging, lemmatization and term identification for the extracted sentences. In order to harvest multi-word expressions and to achieve a better generalization across multiple similar sentences we use the following regular expression of a term definition: (N P rep)?((Adv)?Adj) ∗ (N oun)+","The abbreviation NPrep denotes a noun preposition and the straightforward abreviations Adv and Adj denote a adverb an an adjective respectively. The output of this module is a list of sentences in simplified term form (where the terms containing the title concepts are replaced with the generic label TitleConcept and the rest of the terms are replaced with the label T).","The task of the module Pattern Computation and Selection is to identify the patterns expressing relevant knowledge for the title concepts. This module has two sub-modules: the first one is called Pattern Generation and computes candidate patterns. The second one is named Pattern Ranking and Selection and it implements heuristics for ranking and selecting the relevant patterns. The idea behind pattern generation is that the patterns originated should express knowledge characteristic to similar concepts. We judge concepts as similar if they are classified under the same node in the taxonomy and we assume that the relevant knowledge of similar concepts is stated in using the same lexico-syntactic patterns. Therefore, one expects the patterns expressing knowledge of these concepts to appear in the extracted Wikipedia sentences for more than one concept. To produce candidate patterns the Cartesian Product between all sentences in simplified term form (as outputted by the Linguistic Processing module) belonging to each pair of similar concepts is performed. For each pair of sentences in the Cartesian product we consider as candidate patterns the longest common substring includ-ing the title concept between the sentences. The sub-module Pattern Ranking and Selection filters the patterns produced by the sub-module Pattern Generation. We assume that the best patterns have the shape given by the following regular expression form: (T itleConcept|T )(.+)(T |T itleConcept). Thus we accept the following patterns: ”T of TitleConcept be T”, ”TitleConcept be T”, ”TitleConcept be design by T” and reject the next patterns: ”in"]},{"title":"29","paragraphs":["T , TitleConcept be”, ”of TitleConcept, T”. While the former patterns have both topic (what is being talked about; it always contains the TitleConcept) and focus (what is being said about the topic), the latter are incomplete, missing either topic or focus, thus being useless for information extraction. We also reject all patterns having a frequency lower than an experimentally determined threshold.","The module Knowledge extraction extracts knowledge for the concepts in taxonomy using the patterns voted in the previous step. For example, applying the voted pattern ”TitleConcept consists of T” to one of the sentences in the entry of the concept knife we get part relations: • knife consist of a blade","Moreover, applying the pattern ”TitleConcept be use in T” to the entries corresponding to the concepts razor and sickle we extract the function relations: • razor be use in carpentry • sickle be use in druidic ritual"]},{"title":"3 Results and discussions 3.1 Experimental setup","paragraphs":["The input to the knowledge generation experiment is a set of six taxonomies extracted from WordNet as explained in the previous section. The root nodes of taxonomies are three animals (Horse, Dog, Bird), two vehicles (Aircraft and Boat) and one tool (Cutlery). The distribution of concepts for each taxonomy together with examples of concepts is given in Table 1. The number of concepts in the six taxonomies varies from a minimum of 34 concepts to a maximum 128 concepts with an average number of 64 concepts per category. The encyclopedia entries corresponding to the taxonomies categories are downloaded with the software module WWW::Wikipedia. The Wikipedia text is part-of-speech tagged and lemmatized with TreeTagger, a language independent POS tagger."]},{"title":"3.2 Pattern Voting","paragraphs":["Table 2 shows examples of patterns voted for each of the six taxonomies. Inspecting the table we observe that a pattern voted in all taxonomies is ”TitleConcept be T”. This pattern is present in almost all articles in Wikipedia and it is usually found in the first three sentences of the abstract. Included in the term connected with the title concept by the verb to be there is a noun phrase giving the taxonomic classification of the title concept together with other interest-ing information. However, the taxonomic classification extracted with the help of this pattern is not always found among the superordinate terms in the taxonomy we started with. For example, the extracted superordinate for the concept red eyed vireo is songbird. In WordNet the relevant superordinates of the concept red eyed vireo are: oscine, passerine and bird, none of which is songbird.","Taxonomic Number of Examples Root Concepts","Aircraft 34 monoplane, seaplane airliner, stealth fighter","Boat 30 wherry, fireboat motorboat, steamboat","Horse 34 tarpan, shetland pony percheron, palomino","Dog 128 belgian sheepdog, collie rottweiler, dalmatian","Bird 121 crossbill, oscine nightingale, tailorbird","Cutlery 34 knife, chisel sickle, razor Table 1: The roots of the extracted taxonomies and concept examples","As we expected, some of the voted patterns express knowledge specific to the concepts in certain taxonomies. For example, the pattern ”T build TitleConcept” is related to concepts in the taxonomy Aircraft and the pattern ”TitleConcept eat T” is specific to the concepts in the taxonomy Bird2",". In the first case, the knowledge extracted are constructors of aircraft models like: Pan Am One or Edison. In the second case, the properties obtained are kinds of food (insects, snail) consumed by different types of birds.","Taxonomic Examples of","Root voted Patterns","Aircraft TitleConcept be T","T use TitleConcept","T build TitleConcept","Boat TitleConcept be T","TitleConcept use T","TitleConcept have T","Horse TitleConcept be T TitleConcept be use in T TitleConcept require T","Dog TitleConcept be T","TitleConcept need T TitleConcept also know as T","Bird TitleConcept be T TitleConcept forage on T","TitleConcept eat T","Cutlery TitleConcept be T TitleConcept consist of T TitleConcept be T with T Table 2: Examples of extracted patterns for taxonomy classes"]},{"title":"3.3 Knowledge Evaluation","paragraphs":["In the Table 3 we give examples of the generated","knowledge for three concepts: andean condor, air-2 Although we expected that the second pattern ”TitleConcept eat T” to appear also in the concepts of the taxonomies Dog and Horse it turned out that it did not appear or it was not voted as relevant."]},{"title":"30 ship","paragraphs":["and knife belonging to the taxonomies Bird, Aircraft and Cutlery respectively.","Concept Examples of","Properties","andean condor be find in South America","be call the Argentinean Condor","Vultur gryphus","airship use dynamic helium volume have a natural buoyancy","be know as dirigible","knife consists of a blade come in many forms","make of copper Table 3: Examples of extracted properties for three concepts","Two raters evaluate the quality of the generated knowledge using a 3-point scale:","• Ideal Knowledge - (2 points). The extracted properties are necessary for the concepts in the taxonomy. They should be part of an ideal list of properties for the taxonomy concepts (e.g. is omnivorous for the concept australian magpie or consists of a blade for the concept knife)","• Partially Correct - (1 point) if the extracted properties correctly describe the taxonomy concepts but are not among their ideal list of properties (e.g. is related to butcher birds or described by English Ornithologist John Latham for the concept australian magpie)","• Incorrect Knowledge - (0 points) if the extracted properties do not apply in any way to the category (e.g. the property number for the concept knife or the property be on average for the concept andean condor). The precision of the extracted knowledge is computed using the following formula. P recission = 2NIK + 1NP C 2NP roperties where • NIK counts the number of ideal knowledge labels","• NP C represents the number of partially correct labels • NP roperties counts all properties evaluated Approximately 10 concepts per category are chosen for evaluation. When the two raters disagreed about a label the judge solves the disagreement adding the final label. The inter-rater agreement is computed using the Kappa score [7] and the precision is computed for the judge scores (see table 4).","Each property generated in the rater file was annotated with a type (e.g. classification property, part property, behaviour property, etc.). For the concepts in all taxonomies the algorithm generates part properties (e.g. leg for the concept king vulture, blade for the concept knife) and classification properties","Taxonomic Kappa Precission Root Score Aircraft 0.62 0.55 Boat 0.65 0.57 Horse 0.62 0.63 Dog 0.65 0.66 Bird 0.68 0.60 Cutlery 0.79 0.61 Table 4: The inter-rater agreement and the precision for the extracted knowledge (e.g. medium-large grebe for the concept red necked grebe or scent hound for the concept beagle). Then, depending on the taxonomy, the algorithm generates different types of properties. For example, for all animals (the concepts in the taxonomies dominated by Horse, Dog and Bird) a common property type generated is Behaviour (e.g. sensitive to insecticide for the concept greyhound or builds a large nest for the concept bald eagle). For tools a common generated property type is the function (e.g. used by barbers for razor or used in druidic ritual for golden sickle). Interestingly enough, some extracted knowledge are rules, like: most birds build nests or most helicopters have a single main rotor."]},{"title":"4 Related Work","paragraphs":["With the advent of new information sources many teams are developing methods for large-scale information extraction taking advantage of the huge amounts of unstructured text currently available. In this framework relevant is the work of Pasca ([4]) who exploits both query logs and Web documents to acquire instances and knowledge for open domain classes.","Recently the potential of Wikipedia for information extraction in general and knowledge extraction in particular was acknowledged by many research groups. The methods that use Wikipedia for knowledge extraction can be grouped in two major classes. The first class of methods takes profit of the internal link structure and the structured information in Wikipedia (e.g. infoboxes or templates), while the second class of methods use Wikipedias raw text.","Representative for the second class of methods is the work of [6]. They acquire from Simple English Wikipedia (an Wikipedia variant intended for people whose first language is not English) patterns expressing the semantic relations linking nouns in Princeton WordNet 1.7 (hyperonymy, hyponymy, holonymy and meronymy). Then they gather new instances for these relations improving in this way the WordNet coverage. The reported precision for the newly extracted relationships is between 60 and 70 depending on the relation. A direct comparison between their system and our system is not possible because, in the first place, the framework they use is weakly supervised, while our framework is completely unsupervised. Secondly, their system is tuned to acquire certain kinds of relations (hyperonyms, parts), while our framework does not make any assumption about the relations that should be extracted. However, there is an important"]},{"title":"31","paragraphs":["overlap between the patterns for hyperonyms and part relation generated by both methods.","Much sophisticated frameworks for relation acquisition from Wikipedia include the work of [2] who uses a dependency parser to extract hyponymy relations from Wikipedia sentences containing the verb to be. Our approach is different from the other methods mentioned in the way we make use of the Wikipedia text to generate concept knowledge. We do not identify patterns by defining a certain relation using seeds, as it is the standard procedure in CL after the seminal work of Hearst [1]. We assume instead that similar concepts are described in similar ways in encyclopedia-like resources. If the main assumption behind the work of Hearst is that semantic relations can be mapped with a certain precision on lexico-syntactic patterns, we go a step forward and assume that semantic structures describing concept knowledge can be mapped on sets of lexico-syntactic patterns."]},{"title":"5 Conclusions","paragraphs":["In this paper we presented a novel method for unsupervised knowledge extraction for taxonomies of concepts using Wikipedia as information source.
