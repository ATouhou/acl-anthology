Introduction","paragraphs":["In many linguistic situations, redundant NPs, usually already present in a previous utterance or in a previous constituent of the same utterance may be reduced to pronoun or to zero (NP deletion) in order to avoid redundancy [1]. (1.1) *John went to school and then John went to the mall (1.2) John went to school and then [he went] to the mall Portuguese has a very rich verbal inflection, and the subject can easily be recovered through verbal inflection. The grammatical rules governing NP deletion may vary among languages, even among different varieties of the ‘same’ language, as in the case of Brazilian (bp",") vs. European Portuguese (ep","). For example, the Portuguese equivalent for the examples (1.1)-(1.2) should be: (1.3) *O Joãoi foi à escola e depois o Joãoi foi ao","ep","centro comercial/ep,bp","shopping (1.4) O Joãoi foi à escola e depois (ε + *ep,bp","elei) foi ao ep centro comercial/ep,bp","shopping (1.5) O Joãoi foi à escola e depois ao ep","centro","comercial/ep,bp","shopping In the previous examples, the reduction of the verb imposes the subject NP deletion; otherwise it can be reduced, in Brazilian Portuguese, both to pronoun and to zero, while in European Portuguese only zero-reduction is allowed. In order to correctly resolve zero anaphora [2], NLP systems require (a) the correct identification of the zero anaphor and (b) the correct identification of the antecedent of the zero anaphor1",". Several strategies can be used to achieve this goal. For machine learning techniques, an annotated corpus is required. This paper describes the methodology adopted in the construction of an annotated corpus for the study of zero anaphora in Portuguese, the ZAC corpus. To our knowledge, no such corpus exists at this time for the Portuguese language. The purpose of this linguistic resource is to promote the use of automatic discovery of linguistic parameters for anaphora resolution systems2",". Our ultimate goal is to implement a module for zero anaphora resolution in the Portuguese grammar [3] developed under Xerox Incremental Parser (XIP) [4]. Because of the complexity of the linguistic phenomena involved, a detailed description of the different situations is provided. This paper will only focus on the annotation of subject zero anaphors. The main issues regarding zero anaphora in Portuguese are: indefinite subjects, either without verbal agreement marks or with first person plural or third person plural verbal agreement; position of the  1 For clarity, anaphor is used to designate the pronoun, in NP reduction, or the syntactic slot left empty by NP deletion, while anaphora is a general term for the referential relation between the anaphor and its antecedent. It includes both anaphora proper, if the antecedent appears in a previous moment in discourse and cataphora if it appears after later moment. 2 A similar corpus has been presented for Spanish [5] but in a different theoretical framework. A corpus for anaphora resolution has been produced for Brazilian Portuguese [6], but as far as we know only coreference chains between anaphors have been annotated, and no information was available for zero anaphors. Adaptation of the Mitkov algorithm [2] to Brazilian Portuguese pronoun resolution is given in [9]."]},{"title":"53","paragraphs":["anaphor relative to its antecedent, i.e. anaphoric and cataphoric relations; coreference chains inside the same sentence and spanning several sentences; and determining the head of the antecedent noun phrase for a given anaphor.

However, in some sentences, the reduced material cannot be easily recovered from the preceding discourse, hence, even if the anaphor type may be indicated, the antecedent proper is left unknown ‘?’. On coordinated relative clauses, where the second relative pronoun has been zeroed, it is marked with the special notation [0(que)=<X], where X represents the antecedent of the relative pronoun (this situation is not frequent in the corpus) (3.4): (3.4) Os processos epigenéticos também podem ocorrer","pela modificação das histonas, as linhas que","envolvem o DNA e [0(que)=<linhas] formam","um novelo","The epigenetic processes can also occur by the","modification of histones, the lines that involve the DNA","and form a ball b) noun phrases For NPs whose head is a nominal determiner, for example conjunto ‘set’ (3.5) and maioria ‘majority’ (3.6), it is this head noun that the zeroed anaphor is referred to, even if the semantic head of the noun phrase is the complement of that determiner (3.5) O terceiro fenômeno epigenético consiste na ação","dos micro-RNAs, um conjunto de nucleotídeos que","percorre o genoma [0=<conjunto] ligando e","[0=<conjunto] desligando os genes","The third epigenetic phenomenon consists in the action of","micro-RNAs, a set of nucleotides that travel the genome","connecting and disconnecting the genes"]},{"title":"54","paragraphs":["(3.6) Já as garotas tiveram resultados melhores: 75% dos homens toparam no ato.

In the case of titles in apposition with proper names, the two elements are considered together as the head of that NP (e.g. Dona Marta ‘Mrs Marta’). In the case of coordinated antecedent NPs or PPs, only the first head noun is to be referred to by the zero anaphor, but with the special notation ',&' after that head noun. With the so-called pronominal use of definite and indefinite articles, as well as with demonstrative pronouns, the zeroed noun is not to be referred to in the following zero anaphor and hence a pronominal analysis is adopted for these words (3.12): (3.12) E os demais, apesar de [0=<os] serem titulados,","terão de ter experiência profissional na área do","curso.","And the remaining [students], although [they] have","already graduate, will have to acquire professional","experience in the course’s area","c) indefinite subject","The indefinite subject is annotated as [0=indef] (3.13):","(3.13) [0=indef] Nascer com patrimônio genético idêntico não significa que as pessoas crescerão tendo corpo, mente e doenças iguais To be born with identical genetic heritage does not mean that people will grow up with similar body, mind and disease","Indefinite elliptical subject where there is a systematic","ambiguity with first person plural nós 'we', will be specially","noted [0=1p] (3.14):","(3.14) As descobertas são impressionantes.
