Exploring such cases, we aim at revealing new semantic aspects of figurative language. Detection of sentiments and implicit polarity, is within our focus. We thus propose a methodology for sentiment analysis that can be valuable in detecting new semantic aspects of language. Recent studies have shown that subjectivity is a language property which is directly related to word senses [14]. We believe that subjectivity and thus, senses related to meanings that convey subjectivity, are valuable indicators of sentiment. In order to prove this, we are led to the exploration of non-literal senses. Work presented in [11] provides evidence that non-literal senses, such as metaphors and expanded senses, tend to indicate subjectivity, triggering polarity. In order to capture the polarity that figurative language conveys [12], it is necessary to resolve ambiguities and detect the cases where words have non-literal meaning. Detecting this property for words, we can further assign polarity to the enclosing context, as it is shown in [12]. Towards this goal, other elements in discourse such as valence shifters [9] affect evaluative terms such as figurative expressions and modify the polarity of the whole context. In this paper we introduce a methodology for polarity detection that applies word sense disambiguation (WSD), exploits the assessed word senses and assigns","∗","National Centre for Scientific Research ”Demokritos”, Inst. of Informatics and Telecommunications, Greece","†","University of the Aegean, Dpt. of Information and Communication System Enginneering, Greece polarity to the enclosing sentences, exploiting other contextual features as well.","In Section 2 we briefly present related work while in Section 3 we present the theoretical background of this work, together with evidence for the conjectures made.

Specifically in [3] there is an effort using semi-supervised machine learning methods to determine orientation of subjective terms by exploiting information given in glosses provided by WordNet. In particular this approach is based on the assumption that terms with similar orientation tend to have similar glosses. Therefore, by means of glosses classification authors aim to classify the terms described by these glosses. Moreover in [16] the authors try to achieve a classification of phrases and sentences into positive/negative, by exploiting their context. In our approach we exploit the context where figurative expressions appear and perform disambiguation to reveal their senses which are considered as indicators of sentiment.","There are contextual elements in discourse that could modify the valence of words bearing opinion, thus affecting the overall polarity of a sentence. These contextual valence shifters are studied in [9].","Words, as shown in [14] can be assigned a subjective (with polarity) sense or an objective (neutral) sense. In this paper we support that we need to relate word senses with polarity, rather than the words themselves. It has also been shown through an empirical evaluation in [11], that especially metaphorical and expanded senses are strongly polar. Recent approaches follow this trend by developing sense tagged lists [4].","The methodology we propose aims to perform sentiment analysis on figurative language, detecting the writer’s attitude. The suggested approach shows: (a) the necessity of WSD for assigning polarity to figurative expressions, (b) that figurative expressions combined with valence shifters drive the polarity of the sentence in which they appear, (c) that it seems"]},{"title":"370","paragraphs":["promising even for the cases where the language is not figurative."]},{"title":"3 Theoretical Background and Corpus Study","paragraphs":["We claim that metaphors and expansions drive the polarity of the whole sentence, as they constitute in-tense subjective expressions. The author, as shown in the following examples, transmits his opinion: (a)“Ice storm cripples central U.S”, (b)“Woman fights to keep drunken driver in jail”. In (a) the author uses “cripple” to express implicitly his frustration about the physical disaster. The same is happening in (b) with the expanded sense of “fight”, where the writer expresses indirectly a positive attitude towards this woman.","We consider figurative language as the language which digresses from literal meanings. We conjecture that expanded senses and metaphors, being part of figurative language, can be used as expressive subjective elements since they display sentiment implicitly [12], [15]. To provide evidence for this, we used the corpus of the Affective Text task of Sem Eval 0́71","comprising 1000 newspaper headlines as it contains strongly personal and figurative language. We extracted headlines containing metaphorical and expanded expressions, using criteria inspired by Lakoff [6]. Lakoff’s theory follows the principle of “from more concrete to more abstract meaning”. For this reason, we mostly considered as metaphorical those headlines whose word senses do not coincide with the default reading. The “default reading” of a word is the first sense that comes to mind in the absence of contextual clues, and it usually coincides with the literal one: the more concrete connotation of a word. In contrast, headlines containing figurative language invoke a deduction to a more abstract reading.","We manually extracted from the corpus 277 headlines in total2","; 190 containing expanded senses (95 positive and 95 negative) and 87 containing metaphors (39 positive and 48 negative). These are annotated, as described in [13], according to a valence scale in which 0 represents a neutral opinion, -100 a negative opinion, and 100 a positive opinion. The average polarity assigned to headlines containing expansions and metaphors is above 40 which provides evidence that figurative language conveys significant polarity.","We consider that in the headlines, there can be contextual indicators, referred to as “valence shifters”, that can strengthen, weaken or even reverse the polarity evoked by metaphors and expansions. We first examine valence shifters that reverse the polarity of a sentence. Let us consider the following examples: (a)“Blazing Angels” for PS3 fail to soar, (b)“Stop/halt/end, violent nepal strikes”. In example (a) we observe, as is also claimed in [9], that “fail” has a negative connotation. On the other hand “to soar” in this context, has a positive connotation.

Moreover, in example (b) additional valence shifters are presented which are used as expanded senses, and they act as polarity reversers. These are the verbs “halt”, “end” and “stop”.","In the following examples we meet two more categories of valence modifiers: the diminishers and the intensifiers: (c)“Tsunami fears ease after quake”, (d) “New Orleans violence sparks tourism fears”. In example (c) “ease” functions as a valence diminisher for “fears”, as it means “ to calm down”. The polarity of the whole sentence becomes less negative. In example (d), “spark” is used with its expanded sense denoting “to trigger a reaction”, thus strengthening the evaluative term it modifies.","There are words that always act as valence shifters, while certain polysemous words, act as valence shifters when they are used under a specific sense (i.e. as expanded senses or metaphors). We manually compiled a list of 40 valence shifters derived from our corpus. It contains common valence shifters (e.g. negations) and words used as such on a per context basis. In the near future we intend to exploit a WSD approach in order to detect the specific word senses of non literal expressions that act as valence shifters."]},{"title":"4 The Proposed Method For Sentiment Analysis","paragraphs":["Our methodology involves three steps:(a) disambiguation of word senses (WSD).

This WSD algorithm performs disambiguation for every word of each headline of our corpus, taking as input a headline and a relatedness measure [8]. Given such a measure, it computes similarity score for word sense pairs, created using every sense of a target word and every sense of its neighbouring words. The score of a sense of a target word is the sum of the maximum individual scores of that sense with the senses of the neighbouring words. The algorithm then assigns the sense with the highest score to the target word.

Results from preliminary experiments (Section 5) show that GI provides correct information concerning polarity of non literal senses. On the other hand, SentiWordNet [4] is a resource for opinion min-ing assigning every synset in WordNet three scores, which represent the probability for a sense of a word to be used in a positive, negative or objective manner. Our method assumed binary classification of polarity while SentiWordNet performs ternary polarity classification. In the training procedure for SentiWordNet’s construction a seed list consisting of positive and negative synsets was compiled and was expanded iteratively through WordNet lexical relations. Our method uses GI’s positive and negative terms together with their definitions, instead. Moreover, after experimental evaluation with various WordNet features in order to detect sense level polarity for non literal senses, we decided that the best representative combination in judging the polarity for non literal senses is the combination which consists of synsets and GlossExamples (GES) of non literal senses. On the other hand SentiWordNet uses synsets and the whole gloss of every WordNet sense, in order to judge sense level polarity.","To compute the models of positive and negative polarity and produce mappings of senses to these models, we adopt a graph based method based on character n-grams [5], which takes into account contextual (neighbourhood) and sub-word information.","A (character) n-gram Sn","contained in a text T can be any substring of length n of the original text.

The edges are weighted by measuring the number of co-occurrences of the vertices’ n-grams within the window Dwin. Subsequent paragraphs explain how the models of polarity are generated from the General Inquirer and how mappings of WordNet senses to these models are calculated by exploiting n-gram graph representations.","4.2.1 Constructing models using n-gram Graphs To compute models of polarity using n-gram graphs, we have used two sets of positive and negative examples of words and definitions provided by the General Inquirer (GI). To represent a text set using n-gram graphs, we have implemented an update/merge operator between n-gram graphs of the same rank. Specifically, given two graphs, G1 and G2, each representing a subset of the set of texts, we create a single graph that represents the merging of the two text subsets: update(G1, G2) ≡ Gu","= (Eu",", V u",", L, W u","), such that Eu","= EG","1 ∪ EG","2 , where EG","1 , EG","2 are the edge sets of G1, G2 correspondingly.","The weights of the resulting graph’s edges are calculated as follows: W i","(e) = W 1","(e)+(W 2","(e)−W 1","(e))×l. The factor l ∈ [0, 1] is called the learning factor: the higher the value of learning factor, the higher the impact of the second graph to the first graph. The model construction process for each class (e.g. of the positive/negative polarity class) comprises the initializa-tion of a graph with the first document of a class, and the subsequent update of this initial graph with the graphs of the other documents in the class using the union operator. As we need the model of a class to hold the average weights of all the individual graphs contributing to this model, functioning as a representative graph for the class documents, the i-th graph that updates the class graph (model) uses a learning factor of l = i−1","i , i > 1.","When the model for each class is created, we can determine the class of a test document by computing the similarity of the test document n-gram graph to the models of the classes: the class whose model is the most similar to the test document graph, is the class of the document.

The reason behind the choice of HMMs was that they take under consideration transitions among observations which constitute sequences. In our case the POS of a word combined with the word’s polarity constitutes an observation. This information is provided by the POS tagging, and the graph based polarity assignment method upon metaphorical and expanded senses of the input sentences. The transitions among these observations yield the polarity of the sentential sequences. Structured models have been exploited for polarity detection showing promising results [2]. To exploit valence shifters, these are manually annotated in the corpus: they are assigned a predefined value depending on whether they revert, strengthen or weaken the polarity, in order to be integrated in the HMM.","This choice of features is based on the assumption that polarity of sentences is implied by patterns of parts of speech appearance, by the polarity assigned to specific senses in the specific context, and by the presence of valence shifters types in a sentence. We need to emphasize that the sequences are constructed using only non literal senses and valence shifters (if present), as we believe that these sequences enclose and determine the polarity of the sentences in which they participate. Having trained two HMM’s, one for positive and one for negative cases, we determine the polarity of each headline sentence by means of the maximum likelihood of the judged observations given by each HMM. In order to evaluate this method of classifying headlines containing metaphors and expanded senses into positive and negative, we have used a 10-fold cross validation method for each of the two subsets."]},{"title":"5 Experimental Results","paragraphs":["We evaluated the performance of the whole system (Table 4), but also the distinct steps comprising our method in order to verify our initial hypotheses, (a) WSD helps in polarity detection of non literal sentences and (b) the polarity of figurative language expressions drives the overall polarity of the sentences where these are present.","To evaluate the WSD method selected, we manually annotated the metaphorical and expanded cases with their corresponding senses in WordNet, indicated by their synsets and glosses. Two annotators were instructed to assign the most appropriate senses derived from WordNet according to the semantics of each headline’s context and a third one refereed any disagreement In order to evaluate the polarity assignment to senses, we manually aligned the senses of metaphors and expansions indicated by the WSD step, with the corresponding senses existing in GI, in order to assign to them the polarity provided by the latter.","In assigning polarities to senses, three annotators participated. Two of them mapped senses to GI, and the third refereed any disagreement. The annotators aligned metaphorical and expanded senses from WordNet, considering synsets and GES, with the corresponding senses from GI and took into account the polarity orientation (pos/neg) assigned to these senses. As synsets and GES denote the contextual use of the given sense, they can also reveal its polarity orientation in a given context. For each corpus subset (metaphors and expansions) there were two sets of senses, one extracted manually and one using automatic WSD. The annotators performed the alignment of all four of these sense sets with GI, which was exploited in the experimental evaluation. The results for the four polarity alignment tasks concern disagreement upon polarity alignment between annotators. In particular for metaphors, annotators disagreed in 10 senses for manual and 13 senses for automatic disambiguation, out of a total of 128 senses. Moreover for expansions annotators disagreed in 20 senses for manual and 24 senses for automatic disambiguation, out of a total of 243 senses. In preliminary research we performed an extra alignment with GI in order to detect if the figurative senses investigated are polar. Results show us that according to GI, the majority of metaphors (positive: 38.28%, negative: 35.15%) and expansions (positive: 31.27% negative: 37.8%) are polar.

The results presented in Table 1 are based on automatic WSD and Sense level polarity assignment. It is deduced that even crude WSD, like the baseline method, could help the polarity classification of non literal sentences. Table 1 shows that polarity detection using the GV based WSD method performs much better than the one without WSD (nonWSD), for both categories of headlines. We further performed t-tests [7], to verify if the performance boost when GV based WSD is exploited is statistically significant over that when WSD is absent. Indeed, the method exploiting GV based WSD is better - within the 1% statistical error threshold (p-value 0.01).","Table 1 shows that polarity classification using GV based WSD outperforms the one using baseline WSD for both subsets of headlines. For metaphors, the GV based WSD method is better than the one using baseline WSD, within the 1% statistical error threshold (p-value 0.01). On the other hand, for expanded senses we cannot support within 5% statistical error that GV based WSD performs better than baseline (p-value 0.20). The above results verify our initial hypothesis that WSD is valuable in the polarity classification of headlines containing non literal senses.","In order to evaluate the GV based WSD method, we first compared the output of the GV based WSD step with that of the manually performed WSD. This comparison is performed for both metaphorical and expanded cases. We detected that in the WSD process for metaphorical senses, GV based WSD had a 49.3% success and for expanded senses 45%. The mediocre performance of GV based WSD is attributed to the fact that disambiguation of metaphors and expansions is itself a difficult task. Additionally, the restricted context of a headline makes the process even more difficult. In order to find out to which extent the errors introduced in the disambiguation step can affect the performance of the whole system, we compare two versions of our system. These versions are differentiated by the automation of different components of the system.","In Table 2, we see the performance of both versions in terms of recall and precision for polarity classification of headlines containing metaphors and expansions. The first version is based on manual WSD and manual sense level polarity assignment (manual/manual(a)), and the second is based on automatic WSD and manual polarity assignment upon the senses that the automatic WSD method indicated (auto/manual(b)). Both versions use HMM models for headlines classification. We can also deduce from these results, that errors introduced during automatic WSD do not affect the system significantly. This is attributed to the fact that the prototypical core sense of a word remains, even if the word can be semantically expanded, acquiring elements from relative semantic fields. This core sense can bear a very subtle polarity orientation, which becomes stronger and eventually gets activated as the word sense digresses (as in the cases of expansions and metaphors) from the core one.
