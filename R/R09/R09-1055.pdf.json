The growing needs in information management and localization make it more and more necessary to assist and automate terminological tasks.","A lot of terminological tools have been developed since the early research works of the 90s and many content management companies now rely on them [20]. However, despite the progress made, it remains difficult to get a clear idea of the maturity of computational terminology and to compare the proposed approaches. Unlike many other NLP fields, only few effort has been made to set up an evaluation protocol adapted to the specificity of terminological tasks.","We nevertheless argue that an evaluation is possible in computational terminology and that defining a clear and consensual evaluation protocol would benefit to the whole field. This paper focuses on technical aspects of evaluation putting aside the ergonomic and software aspects. We propose a comparative and application-independent evaluation protocol for monolingual term extraction as a first step towards more global and application-oriented evaluations.","Sections 2 and 3 review the first experiments that have been carried out for evaluating terminological tools and the difficulties that such evaluations raise. Sections 4 and 5 present our proposal: a protocol for evaluating term extractors and the specific metrics on which it relies. Section 6 describes experiments for meta-evaluating the proposed metrics."]},{"title":"2 State of the art","paragraphs":["Various experiments have been made to evaluate terminological tools. Some were technologically oriented and took the form of evaluation challenges while others put focus on the application context."]},{"title":"2.1 Evaluation challenges","paragraphs":["Traditionally, evaluation challenges aim at evaluating a set of systems on a specific task and for a common data set. The systems are compared to each other or wrt. a common data set. This enables the ranking of the systems for the specified task. The first evaluation challenges proposed interesting protocols.","The NTCIR1","initiative was launched in 1999 and aimed at evaluating information retrieval and term recognition in Japanese [15]. The term recognition task (TEMREC ) was decomposed into three subtasks: term extraction, key-word extraction and key-word roles analysis. The systems were evaluated on the basis of a standard set of terms. Unfortunately, this task was not very popular and it was eliminated in posterior NTCIR initiatives. [9] explains that TEMREC suffered from the limited number of participants and the absence of previous evaluation initiative for computational terminology.","CoRReCT proposed interesting data set and protocol [7]. The goal was to evaluate term recognition in corpora, a task that is close to controlled indexing. Participating systems took a corpus and a terminology as inputs and indexed the corpus with the terms of the input terminology and their variant forms. The incremental annotation of the corpus is an originality of CoRRecT.","CESART is the most complete challenge [14]. Three different tasks were planned (term extraction, controlled indexing and relation extraction) but only the first one gave rise to a real evaluation, due to the reduced number of participants. CESART nevertheless proposed an interesting protocol for term extraction. A gold standard list of terms and a corresponding acquisition corpus were chosen for a specific domain. 1 http://research.nii.ac.jp/ntcir/"]},{"title":"299","paragraphs":["The systems were given the acquisition corpus as input. They extracted terms from the acquisition corpus and the resulting lists of terms were compared with the gold standard, using traditional precision and recall metrics. The originality of CESART was to consider term relevance on a 5-value scale rather than as a Boolean value. An adjudication phase allowed to add some missing relevant terms to the gold standard. Despite the small number of term extractors that participated in CESART, the challenge highlighted the heterogeneity of their results, especially regarding the length of the output lists of terms2",". This reflects the diversity of the their methods and the differences in their underlying conceptions of what a terminology should be."]},{"title":"2.2 Application-based Evaluation","paragraphs":["Smaller experiments have been carried out to evaluate the impact of terminological tools on parsing sublanguages [3], indexing and retrieving documents [6, 16, 19], building back-of-the-book indexes [1] or automatically translating specialised documents [12].","These experiments proposed original approaches to evaluate computation terminology without any terminological gold standard. The impact of terminologies is measured through the own application quality critera.","Even if they reported very positive results, none of the mentioned experiences gave a global idea of the impact of terminological tools on an application. Coming to such a conclusion would require, for each application, to integrate various term extractors in various application systems, to really assess the impact of the first ones on the second ones and to compare various extracting methods independently on how they are in-tegrated.","This is the reason why we consider that application oriented evaluations are more complex to set up than technological ones, which are addressed in this paper."]},{"title":"3 Evaluation Difficulties","paragraphs":["Despite these first evaluation experiences, no comprehensive and global framework has yet been proposed for computational terminology as there exist for many other NLP fields. Beside economic factors, it seems that evaluating terminology acquisition raises some specific intrinsic difficulties.","Heterogeneity of terminology acquisition tools Computational terminology quickly developed in the 1990s and diversified into many subtasks at the end of the decade [4, 8, 5].","The first works focused on term extraction and a large variety of tools have been developed. Some of them rely on a morphological and syntactic analysis to identify the textual units that can be considered as terms. Others are based on statistics and word cooccurrences. Statistical extractors generally produce ranked lists of terms while linguistic ones output unordered ones. Depending on the extractor, focus is put on term well-formedness or on analysis robustness 2","The extractors were evaluated on the basis of their first 10,000","terms but some systems outputted 20 times more. and result coverage. The results produced by these tools are therefore difficult to compare, which makes evaluation more complex.","Following term extraction, many additional terminological functionalities have been proposed. Terminology acquisition now covers a large variety of tools and this diversification also hinders evaluation. We argue that, for evaluation purposes, computational terminology must be split into several, clearly identified, independent and elementary tasks. We focus on the first one in this paper: term extraction.","Complexity of terminological resources The diversity of terminological tools reflects in the resulting terminological resources. Terms are often multi-word units that follow various variation rules in corpora. Terms can also be related to each others by morphological (schedule/schedules), synonymy (plan/schedule) or hyponymy (time schedule/schedule) relations. The quality of the resulting terminology cannot be measured with a single metric, as it is the case with word error rate in speech recognition, for instance. This also leads to decompose term acquisition into several tasks to be evaluated independently.","Gradual relevance The quality of extracted lists of terms would be easy to measure if terms were either relevant or irrelevant because one could rely on the well-known evaluation metrics such as recall and precision. Unfortunately, the underlying hypothesis that relevance is a binary value does not hold for term extraction: a term candidate can be different from a standard term but nevertheless close to it and interesting. In biology, it was reported that extractors often propose incomplete terms, such as core rna, which are nevertheless kept in a modified form (core rna polymerase) by terminologists [2]. CESART strategy to avoid this binary relevance constraint consisted in defining four levels of precision.","Gold standard variability A major difficulty comes from the fact that, even for a same domain and corpus, different terminologists will produce different terminologies, which reflects their different points of view, different terminological traditions and different choices regarding the granularity of the description. There is usually not a single gold standard but a large set of ”acceptable solutions”. To palliate the variability of the gold standards, we propose to tune the output of the terminology chosen as standard. This is an original way to free evaluation from the imperfection and relativity of the gold standard. It plays the same role as adjudication but it can be used on a larger scale and it is less costly.","Application role The application for which the terminology is designed also determines what must be evaluated. Although the role of application is important, we do not propose an application-oriented evaluation here. We focus on technological evaluation, which we consider as a first generic step towards more global evaluations.","Interaction Since terminology acquisition is seldom seen as a fully automatic process, terminological tools are generally assisting tools that integrate"]},{"title":"300","paragraphs":["the terminologist role in the resource building process. This also makes evaluation complex because it is difficult to distinguish what comes from the acquisition tools and what results from the terminologist’s work. It is nevertheless interesting to compare the output of the system with its amended version. It gives and interesting feed-back for interactive tools."]},{"title":"4 Protocol","paragraphs":["Despite those difficulties, we argue that it is possible to design a generic protocol to evaluate term extraction."]},{"title":"4.1 Comparative Protocol","paragraphs":["We identified three scenarios for evaluating terminological tools and term extraction in particular. They all rely on comparison. The first scenario compares the output of a term acquisition tool with an independent gold standard. The second takes interaction into account and measures the effort required to turn the draft terminology into an acceptable one. This effort corresponds to the minimal number of elementary operations (term deletion, addition or modification) that allows to transform the draft terminology into the final one. The third scenario evaluates the terminology indirectly through an application (e.g. machine translation) using the application own quality criteria.","The comparative protocol that we propose can be used in the two first scenarios: the output of a system (O) is compared with a gold standard (R) that is either an external resource or the validated output3","."]},{"title":"4.2 Choice of the gold standard","paragraphs":["Even if, as mentionned above, gold standard is variable. There are several ways to build it. One may reuse an existing terminology as in CESART but this terminology may be only partially related to the acquisition corpus. A costly solution consists in asking one or several terminologists to build that standard terminology out of the acquisition corpus. A third solution consists in having the terminologists validating the results of the systems. In that case, the gold standard is the fusion of the validated outputs of the systems, as in CoRReCT. This last solution is not exhaustive but it is less costly than the second one.","The metrics proposed in the following for term extraction are compatible with any of these gold standard building methods."]},{"title":"4.3 Sub-tasks Decomposition","paragraphs":["As mentioned above, term extraction is not the only terminological task. Other tasks such as variation calculus, relation extraction, term normalisation must be considered as well, even if they are left apart here. As far as evaluation is concerned, those tasks must be considered as independently as possible. This is especially important for term extraction and variation calculus, which consists in clustering terms that are variant forms of each others. The term lists output by 3","In that case, there is no need for a standard terminology but","recall cannot be measured or only partially because validation","consists in deleting rather than adding terms. the systems must be considered as unstructured lists even if the systems propose some variation relations among the terms. Those systems have to be evaluated twice (for the term extraction in the first place and for the variation in a second phase) but the quality of one task must not affect the evaluation of the other."]},{"title":"5 Metrics","paragraphs":["As mentioned above, traditional metrics of precision and recall are not appropriate for term extraction evaluation. One problem is that term relevance is a gradual rather than a binary notion and that one cannot expect all extractors or terminologists to deliver ranked list of terms. This led us to stem relevance on a terminological distance. A second problem is that no terminological standard can be considered as a stable and unique gold standard. We propose to overcome that difficulty by tuning the system output to the granularity of the chosen gold standard in order to avoid arbitrarily favouring one system against another.","It is important however to have simple and well-known metrics [13], so we adapt traditional metrics of precision and recall rather than defining new ones4",".","The proposed metrics are implemented in a tool, called TermoMeter. It takes two unstructured term lists as input (the output O of a term extractor and the gold standard R without any hypothesis on the type, length and granularity of that gold standard) and it computes the terminological precision and recall (resp. T P and T R) of O wrt. R. For a perfect system (O = R), TermoMeter gives T P = T R = 1. A system that extracts in addition terms that are close to the gold standard is not penalised or only a little bit. TermoMeter gives T P = T R = 0 for systems that give only irrelevant terms (S ∩ R = ∅).","Let us consider the cases where R = {data base} and we have the following output lists: O1 = {data base, data bases}, O2 = {data bases} et O3 = {data base, table of content}. We expect O1 and O2 to be of similar quality: O1 gives the term of R along with a second redundant but relevant one; O2 gives a single term that is close but not exactly that one of R. O3 has a lower quality since the extra term, which is to too far from the term of R, is considered as noise."]},{"title":"5.1 Term Distance","paragraphs":["Several methods have been proposed to measure word distance. They rely on character string comparison, on Levenshtein distance and the minimal number of editing operations required to transform one word into another [17], or on morphological and linguistic transformation rules. However, since terms are generally multi-word units having their own variation rules, two independent levels must be considered in term distance: the word level (base vs bases) and the phrase level (file system vs disk file system). [18] proposed to 4","Recall that: precision = |O ∩ R| |O| recall = |O ∩ R| |R| where |O| is the number of elements retrieved by the system, |O ∩ R| is the number of relevant elements retrieved by the system, and |R| is the number of elements in the gold standard."]},{"title":"301","paragraphs":["exploit Levenshtein distance to compute distances on these two levels in an homogeneous way but our approach differs from this work because we avoid relying on external linguistic knowledge. This allows to keep computation simple, which is important if one considers the number of distances that must be computed in real evaluation conditions. To keep distance unbiased, it is also important to avoid using for evaluation the linguistic knowledge (such as term variation rules or POS-tagging) that may be used by extractors.","We define a first distance on character strings (ds. It is a normalised Levenshtein distance, where the sum of the costs of the elementary editing operations (character insertion, deletion, substitution) required to transform a string into another is divided by the length of the longer string. The normalisation allows to compare the distances of various string pairs. If all the elementary operations have an equal cost of 1, TermoMeter gives the following distances : ds(base, bases) = 1/5 = 0.2 ds(base, basement) = 4/8 = 0.5 ds(base, relational) = 9/10 = 0.9 Of course, that distance does not always match with linguistic intuition but it must be evaluated globally through the evaluation of a list of terms (see Sec. 6) and not on individual pairs of words.","The distance on complex terms is based on the same principle, except that editing operations apply on words instead of characters. The distance between two complex terms (dc) is the sum of the elementary operations (word insertion, deletion or substitution) required to transform a term into another. To search for the best word alignment that minimizes the global cost, TermoMeter relies on Hungarian algorithm [11]. The cost of an insertion or deletion is 1 while the cost of a substitution is equal to the normalised Levenshtein distance (ds) of the corresponding words. This gives the following distances, for instance: dc(data base, data bases) = 0.1 dc(relational data base, data base) = 0.33 dc(relational data base, web site) = 0.88 This measure allows to take into account word permutations that are frequent in term variation as for expression of gene and gene expression. Its drawback is that it relies on a necessarily arbitrary word segmentation method.","Finally the term distance (dt) is defined as the mean of the distances on strings and on complex terms : dt(t1, t2) = (ds(t1, t2) + dc(t1, t2))/2 dt is a normalised distance ranging between 0 and 1. The following examples show that the dc factor allows for permutation but that the ds factor both attenuates that effect and limits the impact of segmentation choices: dt(precise gene localization, precise localization of gene) = (10/25 + 1/4)/2 = 0, 34 dt(porte folio, portefolios) = (1/11 + 3/11)/2 = 0, 4","This term distance is robust, quick to compute and easy to interpret. It does not require any external knowledge and is language independent. It takes a gradual relevance into account without considering the eventual variants that systems may propose and that must be evaluated on a separate task."]},{"title":"5.2 Gradual relevance","paragraphs":["The terminological precision and recall metrics take that gradual relevance into account. The global relevance of a term list with respect to a gold standard is defined as the function P ert(O, R) that verifies |O ∩ R| ≤ P ert(O, R) ≤ min(|0|, |R|) and reflects the global distance between O and R. It is based on the term distances dt(eo, er) between the terms of the output O and that of the gold standard R. The relevance of a term eo of O is based on its distance to the closest term er of R: pertR(es) = { 1 − miner∈R(dt(eo, er)) if miner∈R(dt(eo, er)) < τ 0 otherwise where τ is a threshold such that if the distance between two terms is superior to τ , they are considered as totally different."]},{"title":"5.3 Output tuning","paragraphs":["Since any terminology is a relative gold standard, it would be artificial to compare directly the output of the systems with it. It might favour the systems that would have made ”by chance” the same granularity choice. The evaluation scores and system ranking might be too dependent on the gold standard. To avoid this problem, the output is transformed to find its maximal correspondence with the gold standard, which means that the output is tuned to the terminological type and granularity of the gold standard.","Since several output terms may correspond to the same standard term, they are considered all together. The precision and recall measures are not computed directly on O but on a partition of O that is defined relatively to R.

The outputs of the systems S1, S2 and S3 respectively contain 194, 307 and 456 candidate terms and (iii) a gold standard (GS) of 514 terms, which has been built by asking a terminologist to validate the outputs of the three extractors6",".","Table 1 presents the evaluation of these systems wrt. the gold standard.
