The key is letting syntax and semantics recognize missing linguistic entities as implicit entities, so that they can be labelled as such, and referenee resolution can be directed to find specific referents for the entities. In this way the task of making implicit linguistic information explicit becomes a subset of the tasks performed by reference resolution. The success of this approach is dependent on marking missing syntactic constituents as elided and missing semantic roles as ESSENTIAL so that reference resolution can know when to look for referents. 1. Introduction","This paper describes the SDC PUNDIT 2 system for processing natural language messages. PUNDIT, written in Prolog, is a highly modular system consisting of distinct syntactic, semantic and pragmatics components. Each component draws on one or more sets of data, including a lexicon, a broad-coverage grammar of English, semantic verb decompositions, rules mapping between syntactic and semantic constituents, and a donlain model. PUNDIT has been developed cooperatively with the NYU PROTEUS system (Prototype Text Understanding System), These systems are funded by DARPA as part of the","I This work is supported in part by DARPA under contract N00014-85-C-0012, administered by the Office of Naval Research.

The PROTEUS/PUNDIT system will map Navy CASREP's (equipment casualty reports) into a database, which is accessed by an expert system to determine overall fleet readiness. PUNDIT has also been applied to the domain of computer maintenance reports, which is discussed here.","The paper focuses on the interaction between the syntactic, semantic and pragmatic modules that is required for the task of making implicit information explicit. We have isolated two types of implicit entities: syntactic entities which are missing syntactic constituents, and semantic entities which are unfilled semantic roles. Some missing entities are optional, and can be ignored. Syntax and semantics have to recognize the OBLIGATORY missing entities and then mark them so that reference resolution knows to find specific referents for those entities, thus making the implicit information explicit. Reference resolution uses two different methods for filling the different types of entities which are also used for general noun phrase reference problems. Implicit syntactic entities, ELIDED CONSTITUENTS, are treated like pronouns, and implicit semantic entities, ESSENTIAL ROLES are treated like definite noun phrases. The pragmatic module as currently implemented consists mainly of a reference resolution component, which is sptflcient for the pragmatic issues described in this paper. We are in the process of adding a time module to handle time issues that have arisen during the analysis of the Navy CASREPS. 2. The Syntactic Component","The syntactic component has three parts: the grammar, a parsing mechanism to execute the grammar, and a lexicon. The grammar consists of context-free BNF definitions (currently nulnbering approximately 80) and associated restrictions (approximately 35). The restrictions enforce context-sensitive welt-formedness constraints and, in some cases, apply optimization strategies to prevent unnecessary structure-building. Each of these three parts is described further below. 10 2.1. Grammar Coverage","The grammar covers declarative sentences, questions, and sentence fragments. The rules for frag-ments enable the grammar to parse the 'telegraphic\" style characteristic of message traffic, such as disk"]},{"title":"drive down,","paragraphs":["and has select lock. The present grammar parses sentence adjuncts, conjunction, relative clauses, complex complement structures, and a wide variety of nominal structures, including compound nouns, nominalized verbs and embedded clauses.","The syntax produces a detailed surface structure parse of each sentence (where '~entence\" is under-stood to mean the string of words occurring between two periods, whether a full sentence or a fragment). This surface structure is converted into an 'qntermediate representation\" which regularizes the syntactic parse. That is, it eliminates surface structure detail not required for the semantic tasks of enforc-ing selectional restrictions and developing the final representation of the information content of the sentence. An important part of regularization involves mapping fragment structures onto canonical verb-subject-object patterns, with missing elements flagged. For example, the tvo fragment consists of a tensed verb + object as in"]},{"title":"Replaced spindle","paragraphs":["motor. Regularization of this fragment, for example, maps the tvo sYntactic structure into a verb+ subject+ object structure:","verb(replace),subject(X),object(Y) As shown here, verb becomes instantiated with the surface verb, e.g., replace while the arguments of the subject and object terms are variables. The semantic information derived from the noun phrase object"]},{"title":"spindle motor","paragraphs":["becomes associated with Y. The absence of a surface subject constituent results in a lack of semantic information pertaining to X. This lack causes the semantic and pragmatic components to provide a semantic filler for the missing subject using general pragmatic principles and specific domain knowledge. 2.2. Parsing","The grammar uses the Restriction Grammar parsing framework [Hirschman1982, Hirschman1985], which is a logic grammar with facilities for writing and maintaining large grammars. Restrict:on Grammar is a descendent of Sager's string grammar [Sager1981]. It uses a top-down left-to-right parsing strategy, augmented by dynamic rule pru, ing for efficient parsing [Dowding1986]. In addition, it Llses a meta:grammatical approach to generate definitions for a full range of co-ordlnate conjunction structures [Hirschman1986]. 2.3. Lexical Processing","The lexicon contains several ~housand entries related to the particular subdomain of equipment maintenance. It is a modified version of the LSP lexicon with words classified as to part of speech and subcategorized in limited ways (e.g., verbs are subcategorized for their complement types). It also handles multi-word idioms, dates, times and part numbers. The lexicon can be expanded by means of an interactive lexical entry program.","The lexical processor reduces morphological variants to a single root form which is stored with each entry. For example, the form has is transformed to the root form have in Has select lack. In addition, this facility is useful in handling abbreviations: the term awp is regularized to the multi-word expression"]},{"title":"waiting ~for pÌ‚art.","paragraphs":["This expression in turn is regularized to the root form wait'for'part which takes as a direct object a particular part or part number, as in is awp 2155-6147.","Multi-word expressions, which are typical of jargon in specialized domains, are handled as single lexicol items. This includes expressions such as disk"]},{"title":"drive or select","paragraphs":["lock, whose meaning within a particular domain is often not readily computed from its component parts. Handling such frozen expressions as '~dioms\" reduces parse times and number of ambiguities.","Another feature of the lexical processing is the ease with which special forms (such as part numbers or dates) can be handled.

During parsing, the forms grammar performs a well-formedness check on these expressions and assigns them their appropriate lexical category. 3. Semantics","There are two separate components that per-form semantic analysis, NOUN PHRASE SEMANTICS and CLAUSE SEMANTICS. They are each called after parsing the relevant syntactic structure to test semantic well-formedness while producing partial semantic representations. Clause semantics is based on Inference Driven Semantic Analysis [P~tlmer1985] which decomposes verbs into component meanings and fills their semantic roles with syntactic constituents. A KNOWLEDGE BASE, the formalization of each domain into logical terms, SEMANTIC PREDI-CATES, is essential for the effective application of Inference Driven Semantic Analysis, and for the final production of a text representation. The result of the semantic analysis is a set of PARTIALLY instantiated ll Semantic predicates which is similar to a frame representation. To produce this representation, the semantic components share access to a knowledge base, the DOMAIN MODEL, that contains generic descriptions of the domain elements corresponding to the ]exical entries. The model includes a detailed representation of the types of assemblies that these elements can occur in. The semantic components are designed to work independently of the particular model, and rely on an interface to ensure a welldefined interaction with the domain model. The domain model, noun phrase semantics and clause semantics are all explained in more detail in the following three subsections."]},{"title":"3.1. Domain Model","paragraphs":["The domain currently being modelled by SDC is the Maintenance Report domain. The texts being analyzed are actual maintenance reports as they are called into the Burroughs Telephone Tracking System by the field engineers and typed in by the telephone operator. These reports give information about the customer who has the problem, specific symptoms of the problem, any actions take by the field engineer to try and correct the problem, and success or failure of such actions. The goal of the text analysis is to automatically generate a data base of maintenance information that can be used to correlate customers to problems, problem types to machines, and so on.","The first step in building a domain model for maintenance reports is to build a semantic net-like representation of the type of machine involved.

Other semantic roles are categorized as NON-SPECIFIC or SPECIFIC depending on whether or not the verb requires a specific referent for that semantic role (see Section 4).

Both object1 and object2 are essential semantic roles. Whether or not they are mentioned explicitly in the sentence, they must be filled, preferably b:Â¢ an an entity that has already been mentioned, but if not that, then entities will be created to fill them [Palmer1983]. This is accomplished by making an explicit cull to reference resolution to find referents for essential semantic roles, in the same way that reference resolution is called to find the referent of a noun phrase. This is not done for non-essential roles, such as the agent and the instrument in the same verb decomposition. If they are not mentioned they are simply left unfilled. The instrument is rarely mentioned, and the agent could easily be left out, as in The disk drive was replaced at 0800. 3 In other domains, the agent might be classified as obligatory, and then it wold have to be filled in.","There is another semantic role that has an important pragmatic restriction on it in this example, the object2 semantic role in wait'for Apart (awp).","idiomVerb(wait Ì‚for Ì‚part,time(Per)) <-","ordered(object 1(O 1),obj ect2(O2),time(Per)) The semantics of wait \"for \"part indicates that a particular type of part has been ordered, and is expected to arrive. But it is not a specific entity that might have already been mentioned. It is a more abstract object, which is indicated by restrict-ing it to being non-specific. This tells reference resolution that although a syntactic constituent, preferably the object, can and should fill this semantic role, and must be of type machine-part, that reference resolution should not try to find a specific referent for it (see Section 4).","The last verb representation that is needed for the example is the representation of be.","be(time(Per)) <- attribute(theme(T),mod(M),time(Per)) In this domain be is used to associate predicate adjectives or nominals with an object, as in disk drive is up or spindle motor is bad. The representation merely indicates that a modifier is associated with an theme in an attribute relationship. Noun phrase semantics will eventually produce the same representation for the bad spindle motor, although it does not yet.","3Note that an elided subject is handled quite differently, as in replaced tliBk tlri=e. Then the missing subject is assumed to fill the agent role, and an appropriate referent is found by reference resolution 4. Reference Resolution","Reference resolution is the component which keeps track of references to entities in the discourse. It creates labels for entities when they are first directly referred to, or when their existence is implied by the text, and recognizes subsequent references to them. Reference resolution is called from clause semantics when clause semantics is ready to instantiate a semantic role. It is also called from pragmatic restrictions when they specify a referent whose existence is entailed by the meaning of a verb.","The system currently covers many cases of singular and plural noun phrases, pronouns, one-anaphora, nominalizations, and non-specific noun phrases; reference resolution also handles adjectives, prepositional phrases and possessive pronouns modifying noun phrases. Noun phrases with and without determiners are accepted. Dates, part numbers, and proper names are handled as special cases. Not yet handled are compound nouns, quantified noun phrases, conjoined noun phrases, relative clauses, and possessive nouns. The general reference resolution mechanism is described in detail in [Dahl1986]. In this paper the focus will be on the interaction between reference resolution and clause semantics. The next two sections will discuss how reference resolution is affected by the different types of semantic roles. 4.1. Obligatory Constituents and Essential Semantic Roles","A slot for a syntactically obligatory constituent such as the subject appears in the intermediate representation whether or not a subject is overtly present in the sentence. It is possible to have such a slot because the absence of a subject is a syntactic fact, and is recognized by the parser. Clause semantics calls reference resolution for such an implicit constituent in the same way that it calls reference resolution for explicit cqnstituents. Reference resolution treats elided noun phrases exactly as it treats pronouns, that is by instantiating them to the first member of a list of potential pronominal referents, the FocusList. The general treatment of pronouns resembles that of[Sidnerl979], although there are some important differences, which are discussed in detail in [Dahl1986]. The hypothesis that elided noun phrases can be treated in much the same way as pronouns is consistent with previous claims by [Gunde11980], and [Kameyama1985], that in languages which regularly allow zero-np's, the zero corresponds to the focus. If these claims are correct, it is not surprising that in a sublanguage that allows zero-np's, the zero should also correspond to the fOCUS. 14","After control returns to clause semantics from reference resolution, semantics checks the selectional restrictions for that referent in that semantic role of that verb. If the selectional restrictions fail, backtracking into reference resolution occurs, and the next candidate on the FocusList is instantiated as the referent. This procedure continues until a referent satisfying the selectional restrictions is found. For example, in Disk drive is down.

Reference resolution for these roles is called by pragmatic rules which apply when there is no overt syntactic constituent to fill a semantic role. Reference resolution treats these referents as if they were full noun phrases without determiners. That is, it searches through the context for a previously mentioned entity of the appropriate type, and if it doesn't find one, it creates a new discourse entity. The motivation for treating these as full noun phrases is simply that there is no reason to expect them to be in focus, as there is for elided noun phrases."]},{"title":"4.2.

Conclusion","paragraphs":["This paper has discussed the communication between syntactic, semantic and pragmatic modules that is necessary for making implicit linguistic information explicit. The key is letting syntax and semantics recognize missing linguistic entities as implicit entities, so that they can be marked as such, and reference resolution can be directed to find specific referents for the entities. Implicit entities may be either empty syntactic constituents in sentence frag-ments or unfilled semantic roles associated with domain-specific verb decompo~'Jitions, in this way the task of making implicit information explicit becomes a subset of the tasks performed by reference resolution. The success of this approach is dependent on the use of syntactic .and semantic categorizations such as ELLIDED and ESSENTIAL which are meaning-ful to reference resolution, and which can guide reference resolution's decision making process.
