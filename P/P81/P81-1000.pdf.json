It contains both the refereed papers presented at the meeting and the position statements of the participants to the two invited panels, the first on the evaluation of natural language interfaces to databases, and the second on parsing. The conference is the result of the efforts of many individuals and institutions, all of whom get my thanks and those of the Association. The program committee consisted of Chip Bruce, Jaime Carbonell, Mitch Marcus, Ellen Prince, Ralph Weischedel, and myself. Jane Robinson and Norman Sondheimer organized the panels. Norman also oversaw the production of these proceedings. Jerry Kaplan handled the local arrangements. Don Walker produced the Call for Papers and the Advanced Program, and was always available to make sure the rest of us didn't forget what to do next. I could never have undertaken to be program chairman without the support I received from my hosts, SRI International and Bolt Beranek and Newman, Inc., while I was on sabbatical from the University of Toronto. My special thanks go to Jane Perry of SRI and Beverly Tobiason of BBN for their secretarial assistance. Financial assistance came from several sources. SRI International produced the Call for Papers and the Advanced Program. Bolt Beranek and Newman provided secretarial support to the program committee. Sperry Univac produced the proceedings. The Department of Computer Science at Stanford provided support for the local arrangements. Most importantly, thanks to all who took the time to write and submit papers. Particular thanks go to those whose submissions could not be accommodated in our limited schedule. Finally, thanks to those who in these days of soaring transportation costs attended the meeting. You make it all worthwhile. C.
