However, conventional spelling checkers, such as Unix"]},{"title":"spell,","paragraphs":["are concerned only with spelling errors that result in words that cannot be found in a word list of a given language. One analysis has shown that up to 15% of spelling errors that result from elementary typographical errors (character insertion, deletion, or transposition) yield another valid word in the language (Peterson, 1986). These errors remain undetected by traditional spelling checkers. In addition to typographical errors, words that can be easily confused with each other (for instance, the homophones"]},{"title":"peace","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"piece)","paragraphs":["also remain undetected.

A confusion set means that each word in the set could mistakenly be typed when another word in the set was intended. The task is to predict, given an occurrence of a word in one of the confusion sets, which word in the set was actually intended.","Previous work on context-sensitive spelling correction and related lexical disambiguation tasks has its limitations. Word-trigram methods (Mays, Damerau, and Mercer, 1991) require an extremely large body of text to train the word-trigram model; even with extensive training sets, the problem of sparse data is often acute. In addition, huge word-trigram tables need to be available at run time. More-over, word trigrams are ineffective at capturing longdistance properties such as discourse topic and tense.","Feature-based approaches, such as Bayesian classifters (Gale, Church, and Yarowsky, 1993), decision lists (Yarowsky, 1994), and Bayesian hybrids (Golding, 1995), have had varying degrees of success for the problem of context-sensitive spelling correction. However, we report experiments that show that these methods are of limited effective-ness for cases such as"]},{"title":"{their, there, they're}","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"{than, then},","paragraphs":["where the predominant distinction to be made among the words is syntactic. 71 Confusion set Train Test Most freq.

This method also has the advantage that training can be done once and for all, and quite manageably, for all confusion sets; new confusion sets can be added later without any additional training. This feature makes Trigrams a very easily expandable system.","Empirical evaluation of the trigram method demonstrates that it performs well when the words to be discriminated have different parts of speech, but poorly when they have the same part of speech. In the latter case, it is reduced to simply guessing whichever word in the confusion set is the most common representative of its part-of-speech class.","We consider an alternative method,"]},{"title":"Bayes, a","paragraphs":["Bayesian hybrid method (Golding, 1995), for the case where the words have the same part of speech.

We introduce a hybrid method,"]},{"title":"Tribayes,","paragraphs":["that exploits this complementarity by invoking each method when it is strongest. Tribayes achieves the best accuracy of the methods under consideration in all situations.","To evaluate the performance of Tribayes with respect to an external standard, we compare it to the grammar checker in Microsoft Word. Tribayes is found to have substantially higher performance.","This paper is organized as follows: first we present the methodology used in the experiments. We then discuss the methods mentioned above, interleaved with experimental results. The comparison with Microsoft Word is then presented. The final section concludes. 2 Methodology Each method will be described in terms of its operation on a single confusion set C = {Wl,..., w,}; that is, we will say how the method disambiguates occurrences of words wl through wn. The methods handle multiple confusion sets by applying the same technique to each confusion set independently.","Each method involves a training phase and a test phase. We trained each method on 80% (randomly selected) of the Brown corpus (Ku6era and Francis, 1967) and tested it on the remain-ing 20%. All methods were run on a collection of 18 confusion sets, which were largely taken from the list of \"Words Commonly Confused\" in the back of Random House (Flexner, 1983). The confusion sets were selected on the basis of being frequently-occurring in Brown, and representing a variety of types of errors, including homophone confusions (e.g.,"]},{"title":"{peace, piece})","paragraphs":["and grammatical mistakes (e.g.,"]},{"title":"{among, between}).","paragraphs":["A few confusion sets not in Random House were added, representing typographical errors (e.g.,"]},{"title":"{begin, being}).","paragraphs":["The confusion sets appear in Table 1. 72 3 Baseline As an indicator of the difficulty of the task, we compared each of the methods to the method which ignores the context in which the word occurred, and just guesses based on the priors.","Table 1 shows the performance of the baseline method for the 18 confusion sets. 4 Trigrams Mays, Damerau, and Mercer (1991) proposed a word-trigram method for context-sensitive spelling correction based on the noisy channel model. Since this method is based on word trigrams, it requires an enormous training corpus to fit all of these parameters accurately; in addition, at run time it requires extensive system resources to store and manipulate the resulting huge word-trigram table.","In contrast, the method proposed here uses part-of-speech trigrams. Given a target occurrence of a word to correct, it substitutes in turn each word in the confusion set into the sentence. Por each substitution, it calculates the probability of the resulting sentence. It selects as its answer the word that gives the highest probability.","More precisely, assume that the word wh occurs in a sentence"]},{"title":"W = wl...Wk...wn,","paragraphs":["and that w~ is a word we are considering substituting for it, yielding sentence W I.

It should be trained accordingly -- that is, only on examples where the words have the same part of speech. The Bayes component of the hybrid will therefore be trained on a subset of the examples that would be used for training the stand-alone version of Bayes.","The second point about Bayes is that, like Trigrams, it sometimes makes uninformed decisions -- decisions based only on the priors. For Bayes, this happens when none of its features matches the target occurrence. Since, for now, we do not have a good \"third-string\" algorithm to call when both Trigrams and Bayes fall by the wayside, we content ourselves with the guess made by Bayes in such situations.","Table 3 shows the performance of Tribayes compared to its components. In the \"Different tags\" condition, Tribayes invokes Trigrams, and thus scores identically. In the \"Same tags\" condition, Tribayes invokes Bayes. It does not necessarily score the same, however, because, as mentioned above, it is trained on a subset of the examples that stand-alone Bayes is trained on. This can lead to higher or lower performance -- higher because the training examples are more homogeneous (representing only cases where the words have the same part of speech); lower because there may not be enough training examples to learn from. Both effects show up in Table 3.","Table 4 summarizes the overall performance of all methods discussed. It can be seen that Trigrams and Bayes each have their strong points.

Such errors were thought to be too difficult to handle and remain undetected in conventional spelling checkers. This paper introduced Trigrams, a part-of-speech trigram-based method, that improved on previous trigram methods, which were word-based, by greatly reducing the number of parameters. The method was supplemented by Bayes, a method that uses context features to discriminate among the words in the confusion set. Trigrams and Bayes were shown to have complementary strengths. A hybrid method, Tribayes, was then introduced to exploit this complementarity by applying Trigrams when the words in the confusion set do not have the same part of speech, and Bayes when they do. Tribayes thereby gets the best of both methods, as was confirmed experimentally. Tribayes was also compared with the grammar checker in Microsoft Word, and was found to have substantially higher performance.","Tribayes is being used as part of a grammar-checking system we are currently developing. We are presently working on elaborating the system's threshold model; scaling up the number of confusion sets that can be handled efficiently; and acquiring confusion sets (or confusion matrices) automatically.
