Previous comparisons of the two approaches for English suggest that starting from constituents yields higher accuracies. In this paper, we re-evaluate both methods for Chinese, using more accurate dependency parsers than in previous work. Our comparison of performance and efficiency across seven popular open source parsers (four constituent and three dependency) shows, by contrast, that recent higher-order graph-based techniques can be more accurate, though somewhat slower, than constituent parsers. We demonstrate also that n-way jackknifing is a useful technique for producing automatic (rather than gold) part-of-speech tags to train Chinese dependency parsers. Finally, we analyze the relations produced by both kinds of parsing and suggest which specific parsers to use in practice."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Stanford dependencies (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008) provide a simple description of relations between pairs of words in a sentence. This semantically-oriented representation is intuitive and easy to apply, requiring little linguistic expertise. Consequently, Stanford dependencies are widely used: in biomedical text mining (Kim et al., 2009), as well as in textual entailment (Androutsopoulos and Malakasiotis, 2010), information extraction (Wu and Weld, 2010; Banko et al., 2007) and sentiment analysis (Meena and Prabhakar, 2007).","In addition to English, there is a Chinese version of Stanford dependencies (Chang et al., 2009), (a) A constituent parse tree.

Their thorough investigation also showed that constituent parsers systematically outperform parsing directly to Stanford dependencies. Nevertheless, relative standings could have changed in recent years: dependency parsers are now significantly more accurate, thanks to advances like the high-order maximum spanning tree (MST) model (Koo and Collins, 2010) for graph-based dependency parsing (McDonald and Pereira, 2006). Therefore, we deemed it important to re-evaluate the performance of constituent and dependency parsers.

We hope that our analysis will help end-users select a suitable method for parsing to Stanford dependencies in their own applications. 2.1 Parsers We considered four constituent parsers. They are: Berkeley (Petrov et al., 2006), Bikel (2004), Charniak (2000) and Stanford (Klein and Manning, 2003) chineseFactored, which is also the default used by Stanford dependencies. The three dependency parsers are: MaltParser (Nivre et al., 2006), Mate (Bohnet, 2010)2","and MSTParser (McDonald and Pereira, 2006). Table 1 has more information.","2","A second-order MST parser (with the speed optimization). 2.2 Corpus We used the latest Chinese TreeBank (CTB) 7.0 in all experiments.3","CTB 7.0 is larger and has more sources (e.g., web text), compared to previous versions. We split the data into train/development/test sets (see Table 2), with gold word segmentation, following the guidelines suggested in documentation. 2.3 Settings Every parser was run with its own default options. However, since the default classifier used by MaltParser is libsvm (Chang and Lin, 2011) with a polynomial kernel, it may be too slow for training models on all of CTB 7.0 training data in acceptable time. Therefore, we also tested this particular parser with the faster liblinear (Fan et al., 2008) classifier. All experiments were performed on a machine with In-tel’s Xeon E5620 2.40GHz CPU and 24GB RAM. 2.4 Features Unlike constituent parsers, dependency models require exogenous part-of-speech (POS) tags, both in training and in inference. We used the Stanford tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003) v3.1, with the MEMM model,4","in combination with 10-way jackknifing.5","Word lemmas — which are generalizations of words — are another feature known to be useful for dependency parsing. Here we lemmatized each Chinese word down to its last character, since — in contrast to English — a Chinese word’s suffix often carries that word’s core sense (Tseng et al., 2005). For example, bicycle (自 行 车车车), car (汽 车车车) and train (火车车车) are all various kinds of vehicle (车). 3 www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?","catalogId=LDC2010T07 4 nlp.stanford.edu/software/tagger.shtml 5 Training sentences in each fold were tagged using a model","based on the other nine folds; development and test sentences","were tagged using a model based on all ten of the training folds. 12 Dev Test Type Parser UAS LAS UAS LAS Parsing Time Constituent Berkeley 82.0 77.0 82.9 77.8 45:56 Bikel 79.4 74.1 80.0 74.3 6,861:31 Charniak 77.8 71.7 78.3 72.3 128:04 Stanford 76.9 71.2 77.3 71.4 330:50 Dependency MaltParser (liblinear) 76.0 71.2 76.3 71.2 0:11 MaltParser (libsvm) 77.3 72.7 78.0 73.1 556:51 Mate (2nd-order) 82.8 78.2 83.1 78.1 87:19 MSTParser (1st-order) 78.8 73.4 78.9 73.1 12:17 Table 3: Performance and efficiency for all parsers on CTB data: unlabeled and labeled attachment scores (UAS/LAS) are for both development and test data sets; parsing times (minutes:seconds) are for the test data only and exclude generation of basic Stanford dependencies (for constituent parsers) and part-of-speech tagging (for dependency parsers)."]},{"title":"3 Results","paragraphs":["Table 3 tabulates efficiency and performance for all parsers; UAS and LAS are unlabeled and labeled attachment scores, respectively — the standard criteria for evaluating dependencies.

MaltParser (liblinear) was by far the most efficient but also the least performant; it scored higher with libsvm but took much more time.","The 1st-order MSTParser was more accurate than MaltParser (libsvm) — a result that differs from that of Cer et al. (2010) for English (see §3.2). The Stanford parser (the default for Stanford dependencies) was only slightly more accurate than MaltParser (liblinear). Bikel’s parser was too slow to be used in practice; and Charniak’s parser — which performs best for English — did not work well for Chinese. 3.2 English Our replication of Cer et al.’s (2010, Table 1) evaluation revealed a bug: MSTParser normalized all numbers to a <num> symbol, which decreased its scores in the evaluation tool used with Stanford dependencies. After fixing this glitch, MSTParser’s performance improved from 78.8 (reported) to 82.5%, thus making it more accurate than MaltParser (81.1%) and hence the better dependency parser for English, consistent with our results for Chinese (see Table 3). 6 ilk.uvt.nl/conll/software/eval.pl","Our finding doesnot contradict the main qualitative result of Cer et al.

If neither parser satisfies the demands of a practical application (e.g., real-time processing or bulk-parsing the web), then MaltParser (liblinear) may be the only viable option. Fortunately, it comes with much headroom for improving accuracy, in-cluding a tunable margin parameter C for the classifier, richer feature sets (Zhang and Nivre, 2011) and ensemble models (Surdeanu and Manning, 2010).","Stanford dependencies are not the only popular dependency representation. We also considered the","11","Berkeley’s performance suffered with jackknifed tags (76.5 versus 77.0%), possibly because it parses and tags better jointly.","12","Although Mate’s performance was not significantly better than Berkeley’s in our setting, it has the potential to tap richer features and other advantages of dependency parsers (Nivre and McDonald, 2008) to further boost accuracy, which may be difficult in the generative framework of a typical constituent parser. conversion scheme of the Penn2Malt tool,13","used in a series of CoNLL shared tasks (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006; Nivre et al., 2007; Surdeanu et al., 2008; Hajič et al., 2009). However, this tool relies on function tag information from the CTB in deter-mining dependency relations. Since these tags usually cannot be produced by constituent parsers, we could not, in turn, obtain CoNLL-style dependency trees from their output. This points to another advantage of dependency parsers: they need only the dependency tree corpus to train and can conveniently make use of native (unconverted) corpora, such as the Chinese Dependency Treebank (Liu et al., 2006).","Lastly, we must note that although the Berkeley parser is on par with Charniak’s (2000) system for English (Cer et al., 2010, Table 1), its scores for Chinese are substantially higher. There may be subtle biases in Charniak’s approach (e.g., the conditioning hierarchy used in smoothing) that could turn out to be language-specific. The Berkeley parser appears more general — without quite as many parameters or idiosyncratic design decisions — as evidenced by a recent application to French (Candito et al., 2010)."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We compared seven popular open source parsers — four constituent and three dependency — for generating Stanford dependencies in Chinese. Mate, a high-order MST dependency parser, with lemmatization and jackknifed POS-tags, appears most accurate; but Berkeley’s faster constituent parser, with jointly-inferred tags, is statistically no worse. This outcome is different from English, where constituent parsers systematically outperform direct methods.","Though Mate scored higher overall, Berkeley’s parser was better at recovering longer-distance relations, suggesting that a combined approach could perhaps work better still (Rush et al., 2010, §4.2)."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["We thank Daniel Cer, for helping us replicate the English experimental setup and for suggesting that we explore jackknifing methods, and the anonymous reviewers, for valuable comments.","Supported in part by the National Natural Science Founda-tion of China (NSFC) via grant 61133012, the National “863” Major Project grant 2011AA01A207, and the National “863” Leading Technology Research Project grant 2012AA011102. 13 w3.msi.vxu.se/ñivre/research/Penn2Malt.html 14","Second author gratefully acknowledges the continued help and support of his advisor, Dan Jurafsky, and of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Machine Read-ing Program, under the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) prime contract no.
