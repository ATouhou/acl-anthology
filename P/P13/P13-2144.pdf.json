The goal is to identify how the participants in a discussion split into subgroups with contrasting opinions.

We use opinion mining techniques to identify opinion expressions and determine their polarities and their targets. We opinion predictions to represent the discussion in one of two formal representations: signed attitude network or a space of attitude vectors. We identify opinion subgroups by partitioning the signed network representation or by clustering the vector space representation.

The number of internet users in the Arab region grew by 2500% over the past 10 years. As of January 2012, the number of Arabic-speaking internet users was 86 millions. The recent political and civic movements in the Arab World resulted in a revolutionary growth in the number of Arabic users on social networking sites. For example, Arabic is the fastest growing language in Twitter history 1",".","This growth in the presence of Arab users on social networks and all the interactions and discussions that happen among them led to a huge amount of opinion-rich Arabic text being available. Analyzing this text could reveal the different viewpoints of Arab users with respect to the topics that they discuss online.","When a controversial topic is discussed, it is normal for the discussants to adopt different viewpoints towards it. This usually causes rifts in discussion groups and leads to the split of the discussants into subgroups with contrasting opinions. Our goal in this paper is to use natural language processing techniques to detect opinion subgroups in Arabic discussions. Our approach starts by identifying opinionated (subjective) text and deter-mining its polarity (positive, negative, or neutral). Next, we determine the target of each opinion expression. The target of opinion can be a named entity mentioned in the discussion or an aspect of the discussed topic. We use the identified opinion-target relations to represent the discussion in one of two formal representations. In the first representation, each discussant is represented by a vector that encodes all his or her opinion information towards the discussion topic. In the second representation, each discussant is represented by a node in a signed graph. A positive edge connects two discussants if they have similar opinion towards the topic, otherwise the sign of the edge is nega-1","http://semiocast.com/publications/ 2011_11_24_Arabic_highest_growth_on_ Twitter 829 tive. To identify opinion subgroups, we cluster the vector space (the first representation) or partition the signed network (the second representation).","We evaluate this system using a data set of Arabic discussions collected from an Arabic debating site. We experiment with several variations of the system. The results show that the clustering the vector space representation achieves better results than partitioning the signed network representation."]},{"title":"2 Previous Work","paragraphs":["Our work is related to a large body of research on opinion mining and sentiment analysis. Pang & Lee (2008) and Liu & Zhang (2012) wrote two recent comprehensive surveys about sentiment analysis and opinion mining techniques and applications.","Previous work has proposed methods for identifying subjective text that expresses opinion and distinguishing it from objective text that presents factual information (Wiebe, 2000; Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000a; Banea et al., 2008; Riloff and Wiebe, 2003).","Subjective text may express positive, negative, or neutral opinion. Previous work addressed the problem of identifying the polarity of subjective text (Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000b; Hassan et al., 2010; Riloff et al., 2006). Many of the proposed methods for text polarity identification depend on the availability of polarity lexicons (i.e. lists of positive and negative words). Several approaches have been devised for building such lexicons (Turney and Littman, 2003; Kanayama and Nasukawa, 2006; Takamura et al., 2005; Hassan and Radev, 2010). Other research efforts focused on identifying the holders and the targets of opinion (Zhai et al., 2010; Popescu and Etzioni, 2007; Bethard et al., 2004).","Opinion mining and sentiment analysis techniques have been used in various applications. One example of such applications is identifying perspectives (Grefenstette et al., 2004; Lin et al., 2006) which is most similar to the topic of this paper. For example, in (Lin et al., 2006), the authors experiment with several supervised and statistical models to capture how perspectives are expressed at the document and the sentence levels. Laver et al. (2003) proposed a method for extracting perspectives from political texts. They used their method to estimate the policy positions of political parties in Britain and Ireland, on both economic and social policy dimensions.","Somasundaran and Wiebe (2009) present an un-supervised opinion analysis method for debate-side classification. They mine the web to learn associations that are indicative of opinion stances in debates and combine this knowledge with discourse information. Anand et al. (2011) present a supervised method for stance classification. They use a number of linguistic and structural features such as unigrams, bigrams, cue words, repeated punctuation, and opinion dependencies to build a stance classification model. In previous work, we proposed a method that uses participant-to-participant and participant-to-topic attitudes to identify subgroups in ideological discussions using attitude vector space clustering (Abu-Jbara and Radev, 2012). In this paper, we extend this method by adding latent similarity features to the attitude vectors and applying it to Arabic discussions. In another previous work, our group proposed a supervised method for extracting signed social networks from text (Hassan et al., 2012a). The signed networks constructed using this method were based only on participant-to-participant attitudes that are expressed explicitly in discussions. We used this method to extract signed networks from discussions and used a partitioning algorithm to detect opinion subgroups (Hassan et al., 2012b). In this paper, we extend this method by using participant-to-topic attitudes to construct the signed network.","Unfortunately, not much work has been done on Arabic sentiment analysis and opinion mining. Abbasi et al. (2008) applies sentiment analysis techniques to identify and classify document-level opinions in text crawled from English and Arabic web forums. Hassan et al. (2011) proposed a method for identifying the polarity of non-English words using multilingual semantic graphs. They applied their method to Arabic and Hindi. Abdul-Mageed and Diab (2011) annotated a corpus of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) news text for subjectivity at the sentence level. In a later work (2012a), they expanded their corpus by la-830 beling data from more genres using Amazon Mechanical Turk. Abdul-Mageed et al. (2012a) developed SAMAR, a system for subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis for Arabic social media genres. We use this system as a component in our approach."]},{"title":"3 Approach","paragraphs":["In this section, we present our approach to detecting opinion subgroups in Arabic discussions. We propose a pipeline that consists of five components. The input to the pipeline is a discussion thread in Arabic language crawled from a discussion forum. The output is the list of participants in the discussion and the subgroup membership of each discussant. We describe the components of the pipeline in the following subsections. 3.1 Preprocessing The input to this component is a discussion thread in HTML format. We parse the HTML file to identify the posts, the discussants, and the thread structure. We transform the Arabic content of the posts and the discussant names that are written in Arabic to the Buckwalter encoding (Buckwalter, 2004). We use AMIRAN (Diab, 2009), a system for processing Arabic text, to tokenize the text and identify noun phrases. 3.2 Identifying Opinionated Text To identify opinion-bearing text, we start from the word level. We identify the polarized words that appear in text by looking each word up in a lexicon of Arabic polarized words. In our experiments, we use Sifat (Abdul-Mageed and Diab, 2012b), a lexicon of 3982 Arabic adjectives labeled as positive, negative, or neutral.","The polarity of a word may be dependant on its context (Wilson et al., 2005). For example, a positive word that appears in a negated context should be treated as expressing negative opinion rather than positive. To identify the polarity of a word given the sentence it appears in, we use SAMAR (Abdul-Mageed et al., 2012b), a system for Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis for Arabic social media genres. SAMAR labels a sentence that contains an opinion expression as positive, negative, or neutral taking into account the context of the opinion expression. The reported accuracy of SAMAR on different data sets ranges between 84% and 95% for subjectivity classification and 65% and 81% for polarity classification. 3.3 Identifying Opinion Targets In this step, we determine the targets that the opinion is expressed towards. We treat as an opinion target any noun phrase (NP) that appears in a sentence that SAMAR labeled as polarized (positive or negative) in the previous step. To avoid the noise that may result from including all noun phrases, we limit what we consider as an opinion target, to the ones that appear in at least two posts written by two different participants. Since, the sentence may contain multiple possible targets for every opinion expression, we associate each opinion expression with the target that is closest to it in the sentence. For each discussant, we keep track of the targets mentioned in his/her posts and the number of times each target was mentioned in a positive/negative context. 3.4 Latent Textual Similarity If two participants share the same opinion, they tend to focus on similar aspects of the discussion topic and emphasize similar points that support their opinion. To capture this, we follow previous work (Guo and Diab, 2012; Dasigi et al., 2012) and apply Latent Dirichelet Allocation (LDA) topic models to the text written by the different participants. We use an LDA model with 100 topics. So, we represent all the text written in the discussion by each participant as a vector of 100 dimensions. The vector of each participant contains the topic distribution of the participant, as produced by the LDA model. 3.5 Subgroup Detection At this point, we have for every discussant the targets towards which he/she expressed explicit opinion and a 100-dimensions vector representing the LDA distribution of the text written by him/her. We use this information to represent the discussion in two representations. In the first representation, each discussant is represented by a vector. For every target identified in steps 3 of the pipeline, we add three entries in the vector. The first entry holds the total number of times the target was mentioned by the discussant. The second entry holds the 831 ةمهتب فسوي مساب راضحإو طبضب ماعلا بئانلا نم رارق رودص دعب ؟رارقلا يف كيأر امو هسبح عقوتت له سيئرلا ةناهإو نايدلأا ءاردزا","ناوخلاا ةعامجو يعرش ريغ ماعلا بئانلاو هتنادإ تبثت يتح ءيرب مهتملا","مدقتلل اهيماحم عفدت تاغلابب فسوي مساب سيلو يسرم يضراعم لك دض","ضراعي نم طقفيسرم . لب هيلع يرتفي مل مسابو هضراعي هلك بعشلا","ةلود لجر حلصي لا يسرم نا يلع لدت عيمجلا اهدهاش تاطقل هل ضرعي","نيهي نا لبق رصم نيهي فسوي مساباهسيئر . نحن انم لعج مساب","عمتجملا زومر لك نم هتيرخسب ملاعلا يف ةكوحضأ نويرصملا","يضترم عم ريخلاا هعارص يفو هلاذتباو هفافسابو يرصملا","اعم امهقلاخا يندت يلع ليلد ريخ روصنم (a) (c) (b) Figure 1: An example debate taken from our dataset.

The third entry holds the number of target mentions in a negative context. We also add to this vector the 100 topic entries from the LDA vector of that discussant. So, if the number of targets identified in step 3 of the pipeline is t then the number of entries in the discussant vector is 3 ∗ t + 100.","To identify opinion subgroups, we cluster the vector space. We experiment with several clustering algorithms including K-means (Mac-Queen, 1967), Farthest First (FF) (Hochbaum and Shmoys, 1985; Dasgupta, 2002), and Expectation Maximization (EM) (Dempster et al., 1977).","The second representation is a signed network representation. In this representation, each discussant is represented by a node in a graph. Two discussants are connected by an edge if they both mention at least one common target in their posts. If a discussant mentions a target multiple times in different contexts with different polarities, the majority polarity is assumed as the opinion of this discussant with respect to this target. A positive sign is assigned to the edge connecting two discussants if the number of targets that they have similar opinion towards is greater than the targets that they have opposing opinion towards, otherwise a negative sign is assigned to the edge.","To identify subgroups, we use a signed network partitioning algorithm to partition the network. Each resulting partition constitutes a subgroup. Following (Hassan et al., 2012b), we use the Dorian-Mrvar (1996) algorithm to partition the signed network. The optimization criterion aims to have dense positive links within groups and dense negative links between groups.","The optimization function is as follows: F (C) = α × |N EG| + (1 − α) × |P OS| (1)","where C is the clustering under evaluation, |N EG| is the number of negative links between nodes in the same subgroup, |P OS| is the number of positive links between nodes in different subgroups, and α is a parameter that specifies importance of the two terms. We set α to 0.5 in all our experiments.","Clusters are selected such that P (C) is minimum. The best clustering that minimizes P (C) is found by moving nodes around clusters in a greedy way starting with a random clustering. To handle the possibility of finding a local minima, the whole process is repeated k times with random restarts and the clustering with the minimum value of P (C) is returned. We set k to 3 in all our experiments."]},{"title":"4 Data","paragraphs":["We use data from an Arabic discussion forum called Naqeshny.2",". Naqeshny is a platform for two-sided debates. The debate starts when a per-son asks a question (e.g. which political party do you support?) and gives two possible answers or positions. The registered members of the web-site who are interested in the topic participate in the debate by selecting a position and then post-ing text to support that position and dispute the","2","www.Naqeshny.com 832 opposing position. This means that the data set is self-labeled for subgroup membership. Since the tools used in our system are trained on Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) text, we selected debates that are mostly MSA. The data set consists of 36 debates comprising a total of 711 posts written by 326 users. The average number of posts per discussion is 19.75 and the average number of participants per discussion is 13.08. Figure 1 shows an example from the data."]},{"title":"5 Experiments and Results","paragraphs":["We use three metrics to evaluate the resulting subgroups: Purity (Manning et al., 2008), Entropy, and F-measure. We ran several variations of the system on the data set described in the previous section. In one variation, we use the signed network partitioning approach to detect subgroups. In the other variations, we use the vector space clustering approach. We experiment with different clustering algorithms. We also run two experiments to evaluate the contribution of both opinion-target counts and latent similarity features on the clustering accuracy. In one run, we use target-opinion counts only. In the other run, we use latent similarity features only. EM was used as the clustering algorithm in these two runs. Table 1 shows the results. All the results have been tested for statistical significance using a 2-tailed paired t-test. The differences between the results of the different methods shown in the table are statistically significant at the 0.05 level. The results show that the clustering approach achieves better results than the signed network partitioning approach. This can be explained by the fact that the vector representation is a richer representation and encodes all the discussants’ opinion information explicitly. The results also show that Expectation Maximization achieves significantly better results than the other clustering algorithms that we experimented with. The results also show that both latent text similarity and opinion-target features are important and contribute to the performance."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion","paragraphs":["In this paper, we presented a system for identifying opinion subgroups in Arabic online discussions.
