This workshop provides a venue for student researchers investigating topics in Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing to present their research, to meet potential advisors, and to receive feedback from the international research community. The workshop’s goal is to aid students at multiple stages of their education: from those in the final stages of undergraduate training to those who are preparing their graduate thesis proposal. As was the case last year, this year we solicited and accepted two categories of papers:","1. Thesis/Research Proposals: This category is appropriate for experienced students who wish to get feedback on their proposal and broader ideas for the field in order to strengthen their final research.","2. Research Papers: Most appropriate for students who are new to academic conferences. Papers in this category can describe completed work or work in progress with preliminary results. We asked for original research by students related but not limited to the following topics: • Cognitive modeling of language processing and psycholinguistics • Dialogue and interactive systems • Discourse, coreference and pragmatics • Evaluation methods • Information retrieval • Language resources • Lexical semantics and ontologies • Low resource language processing • Machine translation: methods, applications and evaluation • Multilinguality in NLP • NLP applications • NLP and creativity • NLP for the languages of Central and Eastern Europe and the Balkans • NLP for the Web and social media • Question answering • Semantics • Sentiment analysis, opinion mining and text classification • Spoken language processing • Statistical and Machine Learning methods in NLP • Summarization and generation • Syntax and parsing • Tagging and chunking • Text mining and information extraction • Word segmentation iii We selected 25 papers for publishing out of the 52 submissions (an acceptance rate of 48%) that we received from students from a wide variety of countries. Three papers were presented orally in one of the parallel sessions of the main conference. The other 22 papers were shown as posters as part of the poster session of the main conference. We were able to provide most students with conference registration and travel stipends thanks to generous support from the U.S. National Science Foundation, the ACL Walker Student Fund, the Qatar Computing Research Institute, Google, and the EU projects META-NET and Multilingual Web LT. The overall quality of the submissions was high and we thank our program committee for their excellent feedback and reviews. In particular, we are grateful to the members of the program committee who agreed to provide pre-submission feedback to students. We also thank our faculty advisors Steven Bethard, Preslav I. Nakov, and Feiyu Xu for their guidance and valuable feedback throughout the whole organization process of the workshop. Finally, thank you and congratulations to all of our Student Research Workshop presenters. iv Student Co-Chairs Anik Dey, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Sebastian Krause, German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence Ivelina Nikolova, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences Eva Maria Vecchi, University of Trento Faculty Advisors Steven Bethard, University of Colorado at Boulder & KU Leuven Preslav I.
