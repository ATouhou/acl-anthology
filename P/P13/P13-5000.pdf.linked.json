We received 25 high-quality proposals, and we were faced with the challenging task to make a suitable selection. We applied the following criteria for evaluation: appropriateness, technical fit, novelty, potential interest, presenters, and experience. In the end we accepted seven tutorials. Six of these are organized as half-day tutorials, and one is given as a full-day tutorial. We are very grateful to Roberto Navigli (publication chair), Svetla Koeva (local chair), Hinrich Schuetze (general chair), Michael Strube (the ACL 2012 tutorial chair), Stefano Faralli (publication), and of course Priscilla Rasmussen, for various kinds of help, advice and assistence offered during the process of putting the tutorial programme and materials together. Finally, we would like to thank the tutorial presenters for the time and effort in preparing and presenting the tutorials. We hope you will enjoy the tutorials!
