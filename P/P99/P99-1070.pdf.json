We investigate the precise relationship between these two formalisms, showing that, while they define the same classes of probabilistic languages, they appear to impose different inductive biases. 1","Introduction Current work in stochastic language models and maximum likelihood parsers falls into two main approaches. The first approach (Collins, 1998; Charniak, 1997) uses directly the definition of stochastic grammar, defining the probability of a parse tree as the probability that a certain top-down stochastic generative process produces that tree. The second approach (Briscoe and Carroll, 1993; Black et al., 1992; Magerman, 1994; Ratnaparkhi, 1997; Chelba and Jelinek, 1998) defines the probability of a parse tree as the probability that a certain shift-reduce stochastic parsing automaton outputs that tree. These two approaches correspond to the classical notions of context-free grammars and nondeterministic pushdown automata respectively. It is well known that these two classical formalisms define the same language class. In this paper, we show that"]},{"title":"probabilistic context- free grammars","paragraphs":["(PCFGs) and"]},{"title":"probabilistic push- down automata","paragraphs":["(PPDAs) define the same class of distributions on strings, thus extending the classical result to the stochastic case.

Though we cannot provide a definitive answer, the constructions we use to answer the equivalence question involve blowups in the number of parameters in both direc-tions, suggesting that the two models impose different inductive biases.","We are concerned here with probabilistic shift-reduce parsing models that define probability distributions over word sequences, and in particular the model of Chelba and Jelinek (1998). Most other probabilistic shift-reduce parsing models (Briscoe and Carroll, 1993; Black et al., 1992; Magerman, 1994; Ratnaparkhi, 1997) give only the conditional probability of a parse tree given a word sequence. Collins (1998) has argued that those models fail to capture the appropriate dependency relations of natural language. Furthermore, they are not directly comparable to PCFGs, which define probability distributions over word sequences.","To make the discussion somewhat more concrete, we now present a simplified version of the Chelba-Jelinek model. Consider the following sentence: The small woman gave the fat man her sandwich. The model under discussion is based on"]},{"title":"shift- reduce","paragraphs":["PPDAs.

For example the stack elements (Det, the), (hdj, small), (N, woman) can be combined to form the single entry (NP, woman) representing the phrase \"the small woman\". In general each stack entry consists of a syntactic category and a head word. After generating the prefix \"The small woman gave the fat man\" the stack might contain the sequence (NP, woman)<Y, gave)(NP, man). The Chelba-Jelinek model then executes a shift tran-542 S --+ (S, admired) (S, admired) --+ (NP, Mary)(VP, admired) (VP, admired) -+ (V, admired)(Np, oak)","(NP, oak) -+ (Det, the)(N, oak)"]},{"title":"(N,","paragraphs":["oak) -+ (Adj, towering> (N, oak> (N, oak> -~ (Adj, strong>(N, oak> (N,"]},{"title":"oak) -+","paragraphs":["(hdj, old>(N,"]},{"title":"oak) (NP, Mary) -+ Mary","paragraphs":["(N, oak) -+ oak Figure 1: Lexicalized context-free grammar sition by generating the next word. This is done in a manner similar to that of a trigram model except that, rather than generate the next word based on the two preceding words, it generates the next word based on the two topmost stack entries. In this example the Chelba-Jelinek model generates the word \"her\" from (V, gave)(NP, man) while a classical trigram model would generate \"her\" from \"fat man\".","We now contrast Chelba-Jelinek style models with lexicalized PCFG models. A PCFG is a context-free grammar in which each production is associated with a weight in the interval [0, 1] and such that the weights of the productions from any given nonterminal sum to 1. For instance, the sentence Mary admired the towering strong old oak can be derived using a lexicalized PCFG based on the productions in Figure 1. Production probabilities in the PCFG would reflect the likelihood that a phrase headed by a certain word can be expanded in a certain way. Since it can be difficult to estimate fully these likelihoods, we might restrict ourselves to models based on"]},{"title":"bilexical","paragraphs":["relationships (Eisner, 1997), those between pairs of words. The simplest bilexical relationship is a bigram statistic, the fraction of times that \"oak\" follows \"old\". Bilexical relationships for a PCFG include that between the head-word of a phrase and the head-word of a non-head immediate constituent, for instance. In particular, the generation of the above sentence using a PCFG based on Figure 1 would exploit a bilexical statistic between \"towering\" and \"oak\" contained in the weight of the fifth production. This bilexical relationship between \"towering\" and \"oak\" would not be exploited in either a trigram model or in a Chelba-Jelinek style model. In a Chelba-Jelinek style model one must generate \"towering\" before generating \"oak\" and then \"oak\" must be generated from (Adj, strong), (Adj, old). In this example the Chelba-Jelinek model behaves more like a classical trigram model than like a PCFG model.","This contrast between PPDAs and PCFGs is formalized in theorem 1, which exhibits a PCFG for which no stochastic parameterization of the corresponding shift-reduce parser yields the same probability distribution over strings. That is, the standard shift-reduce translation from CFGs to PDAs cannot be generalized to the stochastic case.","We give two ways of getting around the above difficulty. The first is to construct a"]},{"title":"top-down","paragraphs":["PPDA that mimics directly the process of generating a PCFG derivation from the start symbol by repeatedly replacing the leftmost nonterminal in a sentential form by the right-hand side of one of its rules. Theorem 2 states that any PCFG can be translated into a top-down PPDA. Conversely, theorem 3 states that any PPDA can be translated to a PCFG, not just those that are top-down PPDAs for some PCFG. Hence PCFGs and general PPDAs define the same class of stochastic languages.","Unfortunately, top-down PPDAs do not allow the simple left-to-right processing that motivates shift-reduce PPDAs. A second way around the difficulty formalized in theorem 1 is to encode additional information about the derivation context with richer stack and state alphabets. Theorem 7 shows that it is thus possible to translate an arbitrary PCFG to a shift-reduce PPDA. The construction requires a fair amount of machinery including proofs that any PCFG can be put in Chomsky normal form, that weights can be renormalized to ensure that the result of grammar transformations can be made into PCFGs, that any PCFG can be put in Greibach normal form, and, finally, that a Greibach normal form PCFG can be converted to a shift-reduce PPDA.","The construction also involves a blow-up in the size of the shift-reduce parsing automaton. This suggests that some languages that are concisely describable by a PCFG are not concisely describable by a shift-reduce PPDA, hence that the class of PCFGs and the class of shift-reduce PPDAs impose different inductive biases on the 543 CF languages. In the conversion from shift-reduce PPDAs to PCFGs, there is also a blow-up, if a less dramatic one, leaving open the possibility that the biases are incomparable, and that neither formalism is inherently more concise.","Our main conclusion is then that, while the generative and shift-reduce parsing approaches are weakly equivalent, they impose different inductive biases. 2","Probabilistic and Weighted","Grammars For the remainder of the paper, we fix a terminal alphabet E and a nonterminal alphabet N, to which we may add auxiliary symbols as needed.","A weighted context-free grammar (WCFG) consists of a distinguished start symbol S E N plus a finite set of weighted productions of the form X -~ a, (alternately, u : X --~ a), where X E N, a E (Nt2E)* and the weight u is a nonnegative real number. A probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) is a WCFG such that for all X, )-~u:x-~a u = 1. Since weights are nonnegative, this also implies that u <_ 1 for any individual production.","A PCFG defines a stochastic process with sentential forms as states, and leftmost rewrit-ing steps as transitions. In the more general case of WCFGs, we can no longer speak of stochastic processes; but weighted parse trees and sets of weighted parse trees are still well-defined notions.","We define a parse tree to be a tree whose nodes are labeled with productions.

This yields the property that PM(Y) = PG(Y). • 8 Conclusions The relationship between PCFGs and PPDAs is subtler than a direct application of the classical constructions relating general CFGs and PDAs. Although PCFGs can be concisely translated into top-down PPDAs, we conjecture that there is no concise translation of PCFGs into shift-reduce PPDAs. Conversely, there appears to be no concise translation of shift-reduce PPDAs to PCFGs. Our main result is that PCFGs and shift-reduce PPDAs are intertranslatable, hence weakly equivalent. However, the nonconciseness of our translations is consistent with the view that stochastic top-down generation models are significantly different from shift-reduce stochastic parsing models, affecting the ability to learn a model from examples.","References","Alfred V.
