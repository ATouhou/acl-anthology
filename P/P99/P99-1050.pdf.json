The quality of the projected links resulting from corpus-based acquisition is compared with projected links extracted from a technical thesaurus. 1","Motivation In the domain of corpus-based terminology, there are two main topics of research: term acquisition--the discovery of candidate terms-- and automatic thesaurus construction--the addition of semantic links to a term bank. Several studies have focused on automatic acquisition of terms from corpora (Bourigault, 1993; Justeson and Katz, 1995; Daille, 1996). The output of these tools is a list of unstructured multi-word terms. On the other hand, contributions to automatic construction of thesauri provide classes or links between single words. Classes are produced by clustering techniques based on similar word contexts (Schiitze, 1993) or similar distributional contexts (Grefenstette, 1994). Links result from automatic acquisition of relevant predicative or discursive patterns (Hearst, 1992; Basili et al., 1993; Riloff, 1993). Predicative patterns yield predicative relations such as cause or effect whereas discursive patterns yield non-predicative relations such as generic/specific or synonymy links. * The experiments presented in this paper were performed on [AGRO], a 1.3-million word French corpus of scientific abstracts in the agricultural domain. The termer used for multi-word term acquisition is ACABIT (Daille, 1996). It has produced 15,875 multi-word terms composed of 4,194 single words. For expository purposes, some examples are taken from [MEDIC], a 1.56million word English corpus of scientific abstracts in the medical domain.","The main contribution of this article is to bridge the gap between term acquisition and thesaurus construction by offering a framework for organizing multi-word candidate terms with the help of automatically acquired links between single-word terms. Through the extraction of semantic variants, the semantic links between single words are projected on multi-word candidate terms. As shown in Figure 1, the in-put to the system is a tagged corpus. A partial ontology between single word terms and a set of multi-word candidate terms are produced after the first step. In a second step, layered hierarchies of multi-word terms are constructed through corpus-based conflation of semantic variants. Even though we focus here on generic/specific relations, the method would apply similarly to any other type of semantic relation.","The study is organized as follows. First, the method for corpus-based acquisition of semantic links is presented. Then, the tool for semantic term normalization is described together with its application to semantic link projection. The last section analyzes the results on an agricultural corpus and evaluates the quality of the induced semantic links. 2 Iterative Acquisition of Hypernym Links We first present the system for corpus-based information extraction that produces hypernym links between single words. This system is built on previous work on automatic extraction of hypernym links through shallow parsing (Hearst, 1992; Hearst, 1998). In addition, our system incorporates a technique for the automatic generalization of lexico-syntactic patterns.","As illustrated by Figure 2, the system has two functionalities: 389 /000000","Termer ~-~0 • • • • • /","Multi-word terms Corpus Single word hierarchy Term norrnalizer Hierarchies of multi-word terms Figure 1: Overview of the system for hierarchy projection","1. The corpus-based acquisition of lexico-syntactic patterns with respect to a specific conceptual relation, here hypernym.","2. The extraction of pairs of conceptually related terms through a database of lexico-syntactic patterns. Shallow Parser and Classifier A shallow parser is complemented with a classifier for the purpose of discovering new patterns through corpus exploration. This procedure in-spired by (Hearst, 1992; Hearst, 1998) is composed of 7 steps:","1. Select manually a representative conceptual relation, e.g. the hypernym relation.","2. Collect a list of pairs of terms linked by the previous relation. This list of pairs of terms can be extracted from a thesaurus, a knowledge base or manually specified. For instance, the hypernym relation neocortex IS-A vulnerable area is used.","3. Find sentences in which conceptually related terms occur. These sentences are lemmatized, and noun phrases are identified. They are represented as lexico-syntactic expressions. For instance, the previous relation HYPERNYM(vulnerable area, neocortex) is used to extract the sentence: Neuronal damage were found in the selectively vulnerable areas such as neocortex, striatum, hippocampus and thalamus from the corpus [MEDIC]. The sentence is then transformed into the following lexico-syntactic expression: 1 NP find in NP such as LIST (1)","1NP stands for a noun phrase, and LIST for a succession of noun phrases. . Find a common environment that generalizes the lexicoosyntactic expressions extracted at the third step. This environment is calculated with the help of a function of similarity and a procedure of generalization that produce candidate lexico-syntactic pattern. For instance, from the previous expression, and at least another similar one, the following candidate lexico-syntactic pattern is deduced: NP such as LIST (2)","5. Validate candidate lexico-syntactic patterns by an expert.","6. Use these validated patterns to extract additional candidate pairs of terms.","7. Validate candidate pairs of terms by an expert, and go to step 3.","Through this technique, eleven of the lexico-syntactic patterns extracted from [AGRO] are validated by an expert. These patterns are exploited by the information extractor that produces 774 different pairs of conceptually related terms. 82 of these pairs are manually selected for the subsequent steps our study because they are constructing significant pieces of ontology. They correspond to ten topics (trees, chemical elements, cereals, enzymes, fruits, vegetables, polyols, polysaccharides, proteins and sugars). Automatic Classification of Lexico-syntactic Patterns Let us detail the fourth step of the preceding algorithm that automatically acquires lexico-syntactic patterns by clustering similar patterns. 390 Corpus -~"]},{"title":"Loxical","paragraphs":["preprocessor iBniT:Slp:iP:rs of"]},{"title":"terms~","paragraphs":["~ Lemmadzed and tagged corpus ~ Database of lexico-syntactic patterns"]},{"title":"Shallow parser + classifier Information extractor","paragraphs":["Lexico-syntactic patterns Partial hierarchies of single-word terms","J Figure 2: The information extraction system As described in item 3. above, pattern (1) is acquired from the relation HYPER-NYM( vulnerable area, neocortex ).

The similarity function is defined as follows: 3 Sim(A, B) = E Sim(Wini(A), Wini(B)) (6) i=1 The function of similarity between lexico-syntactic patterns Sim(Wini(A),Wini(B)) is defined experimentally as a function of the longest common string.","After the evaluation of the similarity measure, similar expressions are clustered.

Since the terms produced by the termer are only multi-word terms, our purpose in this section is to design a technique for the expansion of links between single-word terms to links between multi-word terms. Given a link between fruit and apple, our purpose is to infer a similar link between apple juice and fruit juice, between any apple N and fruit N, or between apple N1 and fruit N2 with N1 semantically related to N 2. Semantic Variation The extension of semantic links between single words to semantic links between multi-word terms is semantic variation and the process of grouping semantic variants is semantic normalization. The fact that two multi-word terms wlw2 and w 1~ w 2~ contain two semantically-related word pairs (wl,w~) and (w2,w~) does not necessarily entail that Wl w2 and w~ w~ are semantically close. The three following requirements should be met:","Syntactic isomorphy The correlated words must occupy similar syntactic positions: both must be head words or both must be arguments with similar thematic roles. For example, procddd d'dlaboration (process of elaboration) is not a variant dlaboration d'une mdthode (elaboration of a process) even though procddd and mdthode are synonymous, because procddd is the head word of the first term while mdthode is the argument in the second term.","Unitary semantic relationship The correlated words must have similar meanings in both terms. For example, analyse du rayonnement (analysis of the radiation) is not semantically related with analyse de l'influence (analysis of the influence) even particular a complete description of the generalization patterns process, see the following related publication: (Morin, 1999). though rayonnement and influence are semantically related. The loss of semantic relationship is due to the polysemy of rayonnement in French which means influence when it concerns a culture or a civilization and radiation in physics. Holistic semantic relationship The third criterion verifies that the global meanings of the compounds are close. For example, the terms inspection des aliments (food inspection) and contrSle alimentaire (food control) are not synonymous. The first one is related to the quality of food and the second one to the respect of norms.","The three preceding constraints can be trans-lated into a general scheme representing two semantically-related multi-word terms: Definition 3.1 (Semantic variants) Two multi-word terms Wl W2 and W~l w~2 are semantic variants of each other if the three following constraints are satisfied: 4","1. wl and Wll are head words and w2 and wl2 are arguments with similar thematic roles.","2. Some type of semantic relation $ holds between Wl and w~ and/or between w2 and wl2 (synonymy, hypernymy, etc.). The non semantically related words are either identical or morphologically related.","3. The compounds wl w2 and Wrl wt2 are also linked by the semantic relation S. Corpus-based Semantic Normalization The formulation of semantic variation given above is used for corpus-based acquisition of semantic links between multi-word terms. For each candidate term Wl w2 produced by the termer, the set of its semantic variants satisfying the constraints of Definition 3.1 is extracted from a corpus. In other words, a semantic normalization of the corpus is performed based on corpus-based semantic links between single words and variation patterns defined as all the","4wl w2 is an abbreviated notation for a phrase that contains the two content words wl and w2 such that one of both is the head word and the other one an argument. For the sake of simplicity, only binary terms are considered, but our techniques would straightforwardly extend to n-ary terms with n > 3. 392 licensed combinations of morphological, syntactic and semantic links.","An exhaustive list of variation patterns is provided for the English language in (Jacquemin, 1999).
