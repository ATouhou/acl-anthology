The process of interpreting sentences in discourse can be viewed as the process of providing the best explanation of why the sentences would be true. In the TACITUS Project at SRI, we have developed a scheme for abductive inference that yields a signi~caut simplification in the description of such interpretation processes and a significant extension of the range of phenomena that can be captured. It has been implemented in the TACITUS System (Stickel, 1982; Hobbs, 1986; Hobbs and Martin, 1987) and has been and is being used to solve a variety of interpretation problems in casualty reports, which are messages about breakdowns in machinery, as well as in other texts3","It~ is well-known that people understand discourse so well ~ because they know so much. Accordingly, the aim of the TACITUS Project has been to investigate how knowledge is used in the interpretation of discourse. This has involved building a large knowledge base of commonsense and do-main knowledge (see Hobbs et al., 1986), and developing procedures for using this knowledge for the interpretation of discourse. In the latter effort, we have concentrated on problems in local pragmatics, specifically, the problems of reference resolution, the interpretation of compound nominals, the resolution of some kinds of syntactic ambiguity, and metonymy resolution. Our approach to these problems is the focus of this paper.","In the framework we have developed, what the interpretation of a sentence is can be described very concisely:","ZCharniak (1986) and Norvig (1987) have also applied abductive inference techniques to discoume interpretation."]},{"title":"(1)","paragraphs":["To interpret a sentence:","Derive the logical form of the sentence,","together with the constraints that predicates","impose on their arguments,","allowing for coercions,","Merging redundancies where possible,","Making assumptions where necessary. By the first line we mean \"derive in the logical sense, or prove from the predicate calculus axioms in the \"knowledge base, the logical form that has been produced by syntactic analysis and semantic translation of the sentence.\"","In a discourse situation, the speaker and hearer both have their sets of private beliefs, and there is a large over-lapping set of mutual beliefs. An utterance stands with one foot in mutual belief and one foot in the speaker's private beliefs. It is a bid to extend the area of mutual belief to include some private beliefs of the speaker's. It is anchored referentially in mutual belief, and when we derive the logical form and the constraints, we are recognizing this refer-ential anchor. This is the given information, the definite, the presupposed. Where it is necessary to make assumptions, the information comes from the speaker's private beliefs, and hence is the new information, the indefinite, the asserted. Merging redundancies is a way of getting a minimal, and hence a best, interpretation. 2","In Section 2 of this paper, we justify the first clause of the above characterization by showing that solving local pragmatics problems is equivalent to proving the logical form plus the constraints. In Section 3, we justify the last two clauses by describing our scheme of abductive inference. In Section 4 we provide several examples. In Section 5 we describe briefly the type hierarchy that is essential for making abduction work. In Section 6 we discuss future directions.","2Interpreting indirect speech acts, such u \"It's cold in here,\" mean-ing \"C1¢w¢ the window,\" is not a counterexample to the principle that the minimal interpretation is the best interpretation, but rather can be seen as a matter of achieving the minimal interpretation coherent with the interests of the speaker. 95"]},{"title":"2 Local Pragmatics","paragraphs":["The fbur local pragmatics problems we have addressed can be illustrated by the following \"sentence\" from the casualty reports: (2) Disengaged compressor after lube-oil alarm. Identifying the compressor and the alarm are reference resolution problems. Determinlug the implicit relation between \"lube-oil\" and \"alarm\" is the problem of compound nominal interpretation. Deciding whether \"after lube-oil alarm\" modifies the compressor or the disengaging is a problem in syntactic ambiguity resolution. The preposition \"after\" requires an event or condition as its object and this forces us to coerce \"lube-oil alarm\" into \"the sounding of the lube-oil alarm\"; this is an example of metonymy resolution. We wish to show that solving the farst three of these problems amounts to deriving the logical form of the sentence. Solving the fourth amounts to deriving the constraints predicates impose on their arguments, allowing for coercions. For each of these problems, our approach is to frame a logical expression whose deriva-tion, or proof, constitutes an interpretation.","Reference: To resolve the reference of \"compressor\" in sentence (1), we need to prove (constructively) the following logical expression: (3) (B c)comFeessor(c) If, for example, we prove this expression by using axioms that say (71 is a starting air compressor, and that a starting air compressor is a compressor, then we have resolved the reference of \"compressor\" to 6'i.","In general, we would expect definite noun phrases to refer to entities the hearer already knows about and can identify, and indefinite noun phrases to refer to new entities the speaker is introducing. However, in the casually reports most noun phrases have no determiner. There are sentences, such as Retained oil sample and filter for future analysis. where \"sample\" is indefinite, or new information, and \"filter\" is definite, or already known to the hearer. In this case, we try to prove the existence of both the sample and the filter. When we fail to prove the existence of the sample, we know that it is new, and we simply assume its existence.","Elements in a sentence other than nominals can also function referentially. In Alarm sounded. Alarm activated during routine start of","compressor. one can argue that the activation is the same as, or at least implicit in, the sounding.

That is, it is the first half of our characterization (1) of what it is to interpret a sentence.","When parts of this expression cannot be derived, assumptions must be made, and these assumptions are taken to be the new information. The likelihood of different atoms in this expression being new information varies according to how the information is presented, linguistically. The main verb is more likely to convey new information than a definite noun phrase. Thus, we assign a cost to each of the atoms--the cost of assuming that atom. Tlus cost is expressed in the same currency in which other factors involved in the \"goodness\" of an interpretation are expressed; among these factors are likely to be the length of the proofs used and the salience of the axioms they rely on. Since a definite noun phrase is generally used referentially, an interpretation that simply assumes the existence of the referent and thus falls to identify it should be an expensive one. It is therefore given a high assumability cost. For purposes of concreteness, let's call this $10. Indefinite noun phrases arc not usually used referentially, so they are given a low cost, say, $1. Bare noun phrases are given an inte~ediate cost, say, $5. Propositions presented non-nominally are usually new information, so they are given a low cost, say, $3. One does not usually use selectional constraints to convey new information, so they are given the same cost as definite noun phrases. Coercion relations and the compound nominal relations are given a very high cost, say, $20, since to assume them is to fail to solve the interpretation problem. If we superscript the atoms in the above logical form by their assumability costs, we get the following expression:","(3 e, z, c, kl, k2, y, a, o)Past( z )\" ̂disengagc'(e, z, c)\" ̂cornpreJsor(c) ss ̂aftcr(kt, k2)\" êvent(k~) .2° ̂rel(kt,y) *~ ̂y ~ {c,e} A event(k2) sa° A rel(k2,a) s2° A alarm(a) gs ̂nn(o, a) s~° ̂tube-oil(o)\"","While this example gives a rough idea of the relative assumability costs, the real costs must mesh well with the inference processes and thus must be determined experimentally. The use of numbers here and throughout the next section constitutes one possible regime with the needed properties. Vv'e are at present working, and with some optimism, on a semantics for the numbers and the procedures that operate on them. In the course of this work, we may modify the procedures to an extent, but we expect to retain their essential properties.","4For justification for this kind of logical form for sentences with quantifiers and inteusional operators, see Hobbs(1983) and Hobbs (1985a). 97"]},{"title":"3 Abduction","paragraphs":["We now argue for the last half of the characterization (I) of interpretation.","Abduction is the process by which, from (Vz)p(z I D q(r) and q(A), one concludes p(A I.

Therefore, other criteria are needed to choose among the possibilities. One obvious criterion is consistency of p(A I with the rest of what one knows. Two other criteria are what Thasard (1978) has called consilience and simplicity. Roughly, simplicity is that p(A) should be as small as possible, and consilience is that q(A) should be as big as possible. We want to get more bang for the buck, where q(A) is bang, and p(A) is buck.","There is a property of natural language discourse, no-ticed by a number of linguists (e.g., Joos (19721, Wilks (1972)), that su~ests a role for simplicity and consilience in its interpretation--its high degree of redundancy. Consider Inspection of oll filter revealed metal particle~. An inspection is a looking at that causes one ~o learn a property relevant to the j~nc~io~ of the inspected object. The ~nc~io¢ of a falter is to capture p,~eticle~ from a fluid. To reveal is to os~e one ~o/earn. If we assume the two causings to learn are identical, the two sets of particles are identical, and the two functions are identical, then we have explained the sentence in a minimal fashion. A small number of inferences and assumptions have explained a large number of syntactically independent propositions in the sentence. As a byproduct, we have moreover shown that the inspector is the one to whom the particles are revealed and that the particles are in the filter.","Another issue that arises in abduction is what might be called the \"informativeness-correctness tradeotP'. Most previous uses of abduction in AI from a theorem-proving perspective have been in diagnostic reasoning (e.g., Pople, 1973; Cox and Pietrzykowski, 1986), and they have as-maned \"most specific abduction\". If we wish to explain chest palna~ it is not su~cient to assume the cause is simply chest pains. We want something more specific, such as \"pneumonia\". We want the most specific possible explanation. In natural language processing, however, we often want the least specific assumption. If there is a mention of a fluid, we do not necessarily want to assume it is lube oil. Assuming simply the existence of a fluid may be the best we can do. s However, if there is corroborating evidence, we may want to make a more specific assumption. In Alarm sounded. Flow obstructed. SSometimes a cigar is just a cigar. we know the alarm is for the lube oil pressure, and this provides evidence that the flow is not merely of a fluid but of lube oil. The more specific our assumptions are, the more informative our interpretation is. The less specific they are, the more likely they are to be correct.","We therefore need a scheme of abductive inference with three features. First, it should be possible for goal expressions to be assumable~ at varying costs. Second, there should be the possibility of making assumptions at various levels of specificity. Third, there should be a way of exploiting the natural redundancy of texts.","We have devised just such an abduction scheme, s First: every conjunct in the logical form of the sentence is given an assumability cost, as described at the end of Section 2. Second, this cost is passed back to the antecedents in Horn clauses by assigming weights to them.

This feature leads to minimality through the exploitation of redundancy.","Note that in (41, if wl + w2 <= 1, most specific abduction is favored--why assume Q when it is cheaper to assume PI and P~.

Then assuming QI ̂~2 will cost $20, whereas assuming Pl ̂P2 ̂Ps will cost only $18, since the two instances of P2 can be unified. Thus, the abduction scheme allows us to adopt the careful policy of favoring least specific abduction while also allowing us to exploit the redundancy of texts for more specific interpretations.","In the above examples we have used equal weights on the conjuncts in the antecedents. I~ is more reasonable,","SThe ~bduction scheme is due to Mark Stickel, and it, or a variant of it, is described at ~-eater length in Stickel (1988). 98 however, to assign the weights according to the \"semantic contribution\" each conjunct makes to the consequent. Consider, for example, the axiom (Vz)ear(z) \"s A no-top(z) \"4 D convertible(x) We have an intuitive sense that ear contributes more to convertible than no-top does. r In principle, the weights in (4) should be a function of the probabilities that instances of the concept Pi are instances of the concept Q in the corpus of interest. In practice, all we can do is assign weights by a rough, intuitive sense of semantic contribution, and refine them by successive approximation on a representative sample of the corpus.","One would think that since we are deriving the logical form of the sentence, rather than determining what can be inferred from the logical form of the sentence, we could not use super~et information in processing the sentence. That is, since we are back-chaining from the propositions in the logical form, the fact that, say, lube oil is a fluid, which would be expressed as (5) (Vz)lube-oil(z) D fluid(z) could not play a role in the analysis. Thus, in the text Flow obstructed. Metal particles in lube oil filter. we know from the first sentence that there is a fluid. We would like to identify it with the lube oil mentioned in the second sentence. In interpreting the second sentence, we must prove the expression ( 5 z )lube-oil( z ) If we had as an axiom"]},{"title":"(Vz)/tuid(z) ~ tub,-al(:)","paragraphs":["then we could establish the identity. But of course we don't have such an axiom, for it isn't true. There are lots of other kinds of fluids. There would seem to be no way to use superset information in our scheme.","Fortunately, however, there is a way. We can make use of this information by converting the axiom into a biconditional. In general, axioms of the form species D genus can be converted into a bieonditional axiom of the form genus A differentiae _= species","rTo prime this intuition, imagine two doom. Behind one is n ear. Behind the other is something with no top. You pick a door. If there's a convertible behind it, you get to keep it. Which door would you pick? Often, of course, as in the above example, we will not be able to prove the differentiae, and in many cases the differentiae can not even be spelled out. But in our abductive scheme, this does not matter. They can simply be assumed. In fact, we need not state them explicitly. We can simply introduce a predicate which stands for all the remaining properties. It will never be provable, but it will be assumable. Thus, we can rewrite (5) as","(Vz)fluid(z) h etcl(z) _ lube-oil(z) Then the fact that something is fluid can be used as evidence for its being lube oil. With the weights distributed according to semantic contribution, we can go to extremes and use an axiom like (Vz)rnammal(z) \"2 A atc2(z) \"s D elephant(z) to allow us to use the fact that something is a mammal as (weak) evidence that it is an elephant.","In principle, one should try to prove the entire logical form of the sentence and the constraints at once. In this global strategy, any heuristic ordering of the individual problems is done by the theorem prover. From a practical point of view, however, the global strategy generally takes longer, sometimes significantly so, since it presents the theorem-prover with a longer expression to be proved. We have experimented both with this strategy and with a bottom-up strategy in which, for example, we try to identify the lube oil before trying to identify the lube oil alarm. The latter is quicker since it presents the theorem-prover with problems in a piecemeal fashion, but the for-mer frequently results in better interpretations since it is better able to exploit redundancies; The analysis of the sentence in Section 4.2 below, for example, requires either the global strategy or very careful axiomatization. The bottom-up strategy, with only a view of a small local region of the sentence, cannot recognize and capitalize on redundancies among distant elements in the sentence. Ideally, we would like to have detailed control over the proof process to allow a number of different factors to interact in deterr-ln~ng the allocation of deductive resources.

The syntax portion is represented in standard Prolog manner, with nonterminals treated as predicates and having as two of its arguments the beginning and end points of the phrase spanned by the nonterminal.

The system got the correct interpretation, that the lube oil was the lube oil in the lube oil system of the air compressor, and it assumed that that lube oil was adequate. But it also got another interpretation. There is a mention in the knowledge base of the adequacy of the lube oil pressure, so it identified that adequacy with the adequacy mentioned in the sentence. It then assumed that the pressure was lube oil.","It is clear what went wrong here. Pressure is a ma~i-rude whereas lube oil is a material, and magnitudes can't be materials. In principle, abduction requires a check for the consistency of what is e.mumed, and our knowledge base should have contained axioms from which it could be inferred that a magnitude is not a material. In practice, unconstrained consistency checking is undecidable and, at best, may take a long time. Nevertheless, one can, through the use of a type hierarchy, eI~minate a very large number of possible assumptions that are likely to result in an in-consistency. We have consequently hnplemented a module which specifies the types that various predicate-argument positions can take on, and the likely disjointness relations among types. This is a way of exploiting the specificity of the English lexicon for computational purposes. This addition led to a speed-up of two orders of magn/tude.","There is a problem, however. In an ontologically promiscuous notation, there is no commitment in a primed proposition to truth or existence in the real world. Thus, ]ube-oil'(e, o) does not say that o is lube oil or even that it exists; rather it says that • is the eventuality of o's being lube oil. This eventuality may or may not exist in the real world. If it does, then we would express this as"]},{"title":"Re,fists(e),","paragraphs":["and from that we could derive from axioms the existence of o and the fact that it is lube oil. But e's existential status could be something different. For example, e could be nonexistent, expressed as not(e) in the notation, and in English as \"The eventuality e of o's being lube oil does not exist,\" or as \"o is not lube oil.\" Or e may exist only in someone's beliefs. While the axiom"]},{"title":"(V z)Fressure(z) D-qube-oil(x)","paragraphs":["is certainly true, the axiom"]},{"title":"(Vel,z)~essure'(e,,=) ~ -,(3 eDtu~e-oir(e2, =)","paragraphs":["would not be true. The fact that a variable occupies the second argument position of the predicate lube-o/l' does not mean it is lube oil. We cannot properly restrict that ar~Btment position to be lube oil, or fluid, or even a material, for that would rule out perfectly true sentences like \"~uth is not lube oil.\"","Generally, when one uses a type hierarchy, one assumes the types to be disjoint sets with cleanly dei~ed boundaries, and one assumes that predicates take arguments of only certain types. There are a lot of problems with this idea- In any case, in our work, we are not buying into this notion that the universe is typed. P~ther we are using the type hierarchy strictly as a heuristic, as a set of guesses not about what could or could not be but about what it would or would not occur to someone to 5~zI/. ~'hen two types are declared to be disjoint, we are saying that they are certainly disjoint in the real world, and that they are very probably disjoint everywhere except in certain bizarre modal contexts. This means, however, that we risk fmling on certain rare examples. We could not, for example, deal with the sentence, ~It then assumed that the pressure was lube oily"]},{"title":"6 Future Directions","paragraphs":["Deduction is explosive, and since the abduction scheme augments deduction with the assumptions, it is even more explosive. We are currently engaged in an empirical investigation of the behavior of this abductive scheme on a very large knowledge base performing sophisticated proceasing. In addition to type checking, we have introduced two other tevhnlques that are necessary for controlling the exploslon~unwinding recursive axioms and making use of syntactic noncoreference information. We expect our investigation to continue to yield techniques for controlling the abduction process.","We are also looking toward extending the interpretation processes to cover lexical ambiguity, quantifier scope ambiguity and metaphor interpretation problems as well. We will also be investigating the integration proposed in Section 4.3 and an approach that integrates all of this with the recognition of discourse structure and the recognition of relations between utterances and the hearer's interests. 102"]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["The authors have profited from discussions with Todd Davies, John Lowrance, Stuart Shieber, and Mabry Tyson about this work.
