{"sections":[{"title":"Preface to the Interactive Posters/Demonstrations Proceedings","paragraphs":["On behalf of the program committee for ACL-2003 Interactive Posters/Demonstrations Sessions, it is my great pleasure to present you with this proceedings. Though ACL occasionally have had demonstration sessions, this will be the first attempt for ACL to have this kind of sessions, which aim to provide researchers or developers of natural language technologies with a generous environment for presentation and discussion of their works. Each paper receives an opportuity to give a five-minute oral preview presentatin and a poster or poster with demo presentation for two and half hours. To this attempt, there were initially 62 submissions, one paper was withdrawn during the review process, and we could accept only 28 papers. One paper was withdrawn after the selection and we finally have 27 papers, which you find in this volume. When I called for the program committee, a number of wonderful people agreed to join in and have dedicated lots of their valuable time in reviewing the papers and organizing this novel session. Working with such wonderful people is of great fun, and I would heartily appreciate their voluntary and enthusiastic cooperation.
