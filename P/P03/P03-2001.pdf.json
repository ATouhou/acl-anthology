{"sections":[{"title":"Preface to the Student Research Workshop Proceedings","paragraphs":["On behalf of the Program Committee, we are pleased to present the proceedings of the Student Research Workshop at ACL-03, the 41st Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics in Sapporo, Japan. This is the fourth time that the Student Session at ACL is organized in the form of a workshop, and it is the 13th ACL Student Session. This year, the Student Research Workshop hosts 12 presentations of high-quality full-length papers. After each presentation, a panel of senior researchers will provide detailed comments and feedback on the work. We would like to thank the panelists in advance. This year, we received 31 submissions from 15 different countries. The submissions were generally on a very high standard, which made the reviewing and selection process quite difficult. We would like to thank everyone who submitted to the workshop. We would also like to thank the Program Committee for their time and effort as well as for their valuable comments.
