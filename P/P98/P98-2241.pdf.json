It has proven useful in monolog, but its utility for multi-party discourse has not been shown, and a variety of issues must be tackled to adapt the model for dialog. This paper reports our application of three naive models of centering theory for dialog. These results will be used as baselines for evaluating future models. 1 1 Introduction The centering framework (Grosz et al., 1995) is one of the most influential computational linguistics the-ories relating local focus to the form chosen for referring expressions. A number of studies have developed refinements and extensions of the theory (eg. Brennan et al., 1987; Kameyama, 1986; Strube and Hahn, 1996; Walker et al., 1998), but few have attempted to extend the model to multi-party discourse (cf. Brennan, 1998; Walker, 1998).","For dialog systems, the benefits of using centering theory include improved reference resolution and generation of more coherent referring expressions. However, it is not at all clear how to adapt the theory for multi-party discourse. This paper examines some of the issues involved in adapting the theory, then describes the results of applying three alternative models to a corpus of 2-person dialogs. We chose very naive approximations to the original theory as a starting point. These results will be a baseline for evaluating more sophisticated models in the future."]},{"title":"2 The Centering","paragraphs":["model The centering framework (Grosz et al., 1995) makes three main claims: 1) given an utterance Un, the * The authors would like to thank James Alien, Marflyn Walker, and the anonymous reviewers for many helpful comments on a preliminary draft of the paper.
