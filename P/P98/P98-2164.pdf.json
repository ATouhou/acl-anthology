Such evaluation is usually per-formed by comparing the tagger output with a reference test corpus, which is assumed to be error-free. Currently used corpora contain noise which causes the obtained performance to be a distortion of the real value. We analyze to what extent this distortion may invalidate the comparison between taggers or the measure of the improvement given by a new system. The main conclusion is that a more rigorous testing experimentation setting/designing is needed to reliably evaluate and compare tagger accuracies. 1 Introduction and Motivation Part of Speech (POS) Tagging is a quite well defined NLP problem, which consists of assign-ing to each word in a text the proper morphosyntactic tag for the given context. Although many words are ambiguous regarding their POS, in most cases they can be completely disambiguated taking into account an adequate context. Successful taggers have been built using several approaches, such as statistical techniques, symbolic machine learning techniques, neural networks, etc. The accuracy reported by most current taggers ranges from 96-97% to al-most 100% in the linguistically-motivated Constraint Grammar environment.","Unfortunately, there have been very few direct comparisons of alternative taggers 1 on identical test data. However, in most current papers it is argued that the performance of some taggers is better than others as a result of some kind of indirect comparisons between them. We","I One of the exceptions is the work by (Samuelsson and Voutilainen, 1997), in which a very strict comparison between taggers is performed. think that there are a number of not enough controlled/considered factors that make these conclusions dubious in most cases.","In this direction, the present paper aims to point out some of the difficulties arising when evaluating and comparing tagger performances against a reference test corpus, and to make some criticism about common practices followed by the NLP researchers in this issue.","The above mentioned factors can affect either the evaluation or the comparison process. Factors affecting the evaluation process are: (1) Training and test experiments are usually per-formed over noisy corpora which distorts the obtained results, (2) performance figures are too often calculated from only a single or very small number of trials, though average results from multiple trials are crucial to obtain reliable estimations of accuracy (Mooney, 1996), (3) testing experiments are usually done on corpora with the same characteristics as the training data -usually a small fresh portion of the training corpus- but no serious attempts have been done in order to determine the reliability of the results when moving from one domain to another (Krovetz, 1997), and (4) no figures about computational effort -space/time complexity- are usually reported, even from an empirical per-spective. A factors affecting the comparison process is that comparisons between taggers are often indirect, while they should be compared under the same conditions in a multiple-trial experiment with statistical tests of significance.","For these reasons, this paper calls for a discussion on POS taggers evaluation, aiming to establish a more rigorous test experimentation setting/designing, indispensable to extract reliable conclusions. As a starting point, we will focus only on how the noise in the test corpus can affect the obtained results. 997 2 Noise in the testing corpus From a machine learning perspective, the relevant noise in the corpus is that of non systematically mistagged words (i.e. different annotations for words appearing in the same syntactic/semantic contexts).","Commonly used annotated corpora have noise. See, for instance, the following examples from the Wall Street Journal (wsJ) corpus:","Verb participle forms are sometimes tagged as such (VBN) and also as adjectives (JJ) in other sentences with no structural differences:","la) ... failing_VBG to_TO voluntarily_RB submit_VB the_DT"]},{"title":"requested_VBN Â±nformation_~N","paragraphs":["... ib) ... a_DT largeJJ sample_NN of_IN"]},{"title":"married_2J","paragraphs":["women_b~IS with__IN at_IN least_3JS one_CD child_NN ...","Another structure not coherently tagged are noun chains when the nouns (NN) are ambiguous and can be also adjectives (J J):","2a) ...

Burger_NNP King_NNP 's_POS chief_JJ executive_NN o]ficer_NN ,_, Barry_NNP Gibbons_NNP ,_, stars_VBZ in_.IN ads_NNS saying_VBG ...","The noise in the test set produces a wrong estimation of accuracy, since correct answers are computed as wrong and vice-versa. In following sections we will show how this uncertainty in the evaluation may be, in some cases, larger than the reported improvements from one system to another, so invalidating the conclusions of the comparison. 3 Model Setting To study the appropriateness of the choices made by a POS tagger, a reference tagging must be selected and assumed to be correct in order to compare it with the tagger output. This is usually done by assuming that the disambiguated test corpora being used contains the right POS disambiguation. This approach is quite right when the tagger error rate is larger enough than the test corpus error rate, nevertheless, the current POS taggers have reached a performance level that invalidates this choice, since the tagger error rate is getting too close to the error rate of the test corpus.","Since we want to study the relationship between the tagger error rate and the test corpus error rate, we have to establish an absolute reference point. Although (Church, 1992) questions the concept of correct analysis, (Samuelsson and Voutilainen, 1997) establish that there exists a -statistically significant- absolute correct disambiguation, respect to which the error rates of either the tagger or the test corpus can be computed. What we will focus on is how distorted is the tagger error rate by the use of a noisy test corpus as a reference.","The cases we can find when evaluating the performance of a certain tagger are presented in table 1. OK/--aOK stand for a right/wrong tag (respect to the absolute correct disambiguation). When both the tagger and the test corpus have the correct tag, the tag is correctly evaluated as right. When the test corpus has the correct tag and the tagger gets it wrong, the occurrence is correctly evaluated as wrong. But problems arise when the test corpus has a wrong tag: If the tagger gets it correctly, it is evaluated as wrong when it should be right (false negative). If the tagger gets it wrong, it will be rightly evaluated as wrong if the error commited by the tagger is other than the error in the test corpus, but wrongly evaluated as right (false positive) if the error is the same.

Nevertheless, this is an issue that must be further addressed.","If we knew each one of the above proportions, we would be able to compute the real performance of our tagger (x) by adding up the OKt rows from table 1, i.e. the cases in which the tagger got the right disambiguation independently from the tagging of the test set:"]},{"title":"x=(1-C)t+Cu (1)","paragraphs":["The equation of the observed performance can also be extracted from table 1, adding up what is evaluated as right:"]},{"title":"K=(1-C)t+C(1-u)p (2)","paragraphs":["The relationship between the real and the observed performance is derived from 1 and 2:"]},{"title":"x=K-C(1-u)p+Cu","paragraphs":["Since only K and C are known (or approximately estimated) we can not compute the real performance of the tagger.

In addition, the bounds for the values of t, u and p are closely related to the similarities between the training and test corpora. That is, if the training and test sets are extracted from the same corpus, they will probably contain the same kind of errors in the same kind of situations. This may cause the training procedure to learn the errors -especially if they are systematic- and thus the resulting tagger will tend to make the same errors that appear in the test set. On the contrary, if the training and test sets come from different sources -sharing only the tag set- the behaviour of the resulting tagger will not depend on the right or wrong tagging of the test set.","We can try to establish narrower bounds for the parameters than those obtained in section 3.","First of all, the value of t is already constrained enough, due to its high contribution (1-C) to the value of K, which forces t to take a value close to K. For instance, apply-ing the boundaries in equation 5 to the case C--0.03 and K--0.93, we obtain that t belongs to [0.928, 0.959].","The range for u can be slightly narrowed considering the following: In the case of independent test and training corpora, u will tend to be equal to t. Otherwise, the more biased to-wards the corpus errors is the language model, the lower u will be. Note than u > t would mean that the tagger disambiguates better the noisy cases than the correct ones. Concerning to the lower bound, only in the case that all the errors in the training and test corpus were systematic (and thus can be learned) could u reach zero. However, not only this is not a likely Situation, but also requires a perfect-learning tagger. It seems more reasonable that, in normal cases, errors will be random, and the tagger will behave","4For instance, it is not reasonable that u=0, which would mean that the tagger never disambiguates correctly a wrong word in the corpus, or p-- 1, which would mean that it always makes the same error when both are wrong. randomly on the noisy occurrences. This yields a lower bound for u of 1/a, being a the average ambiguity ratio for ambiguous words.","The reasonable bounds for u are thus _1 <_ u < min t, a","Finally, the value of p has similar constraints to those of u. If the test and training corpora are independent, the probability of making the same error, given that both are wrong, will be the random 1/(a-1). If the corpora are not independent, the errors that can be learned by the tagger will cause p to rise up to (potentially) 1.
