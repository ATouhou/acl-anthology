We view this problem as that of estimating a joint probability distribution specifying the joint probabilities of word pairs, such as noun verb pairs. We propose an efficient algorithm based on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle for estimating such a probability distribution. Our method is a natural extension of those proposed in (Brown et al., 1992) and (Li and Abe, 1996), and overcomes their drawbacks while retaining their advantages. We then combined this clustering method with the disambiguation method of (Li and Abe, 1995) to derive a disambiguation method that makes use of both automatically constructed thesauruses and a hand-made thesaurus. The overall disambiguation accuracy achieved by our method is 85.2%, which compares favorably against the accuracy (82.4%) obtained by the state-of-the-art disambiguation method of (Brill and Resnik, 1994). 1 Introduction We address the problem of clustering words, or that of constructing a thesaurus, based on co-occurrence data. We view this problem as that of estimating a joint probability distribution over word pairs, specifying the joint probabilities of word pairs, such as noun verb pairs. In this paper, we assume that the joint distribution can be expressed in the following manner, which is stated for noun verb pairs for the sake of readability: The joint probability of a noun and a verb is expressed as the product of the joint probability of the noun class and the verb class which the noun and the verb respectively belong to, and the conditional probabilities of the noun and the verb given their respective classes.","As a method for estimating such a probability distribution, we propose an algorithm based on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. Our clustering algorithm iteratively merges noun classes and verb classes in turn, in a bottom up fashion. For each merge it performs, it calculates the increase in data description length resulting from merging any noun (or verb) class pair, and performs the merge having the least increase in data description length, provided that the increase in data description length is less than the reduction in model description length.","There have been a number of methods proposed in the literature to address the word clustering problem (e.g., (Brown et al., 1992; Pereira et al., 1993; Li and Abe, 1996)). The method proposed in this paper is a natural extension of both Li & Abe's and Brown et al's methods, and is an attempt to overcome their drawbacks while retaining their advantages.","The method of Brown et al, which is based on the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), performs a merge which would result in the least reduction in (average) mutual information. Our method turns out to be equivalent to performing the merge with the least reduction in mutual information, provided that the reduction is below a certain threshold which depends on the size of the co-occurrence data and the number of classes in the current situation. This method, based on the MDL principle, takes into account both the fit to data and the simplicity of a model, and thus can help cope with the over-fitting problem that the MLE-based method of Brown et al faces.","The model employed in (Li and Abe, 1996) is based on the assumption that the word distribution within a class is a uniform distribution, i.e. every word in a same class is generated with an equal probability. Employing such a model has the undesirable tendency of classifying into different classes those words that have similar co-occurrence patterns but have different absolute frequencies. The proposed method, in contrast, employs a model in which different words within a same class can have different conditional generation probabilities, and thus can classify words in a way that is not affected by words' absolute frequencies and resolve the problem faced by the method of (Li and Abe, 1996).","We evaluate our clustering method by using the word classes and the joint probabilities obtained by 749 it in syntactic disambiguation experiments. Our experimental results indicate that using the word classes constructed by our method gives better disambiguation results than when using Li & Abe or Brown et al's methods. By combining thesauruses automatically constructed by our method and an existing hand-made thesaurus (WordNet), we were able to achieve the overall accuracy of 85.2% for pp-attachment disambiguation, which compares favorably against the accuracy (82.4%) obtained using the state-of-the-art method of (Brill and Resnik, 1994). 2 Probability Model Suppose available to us are co-occurrence data over two sets of words, such as the sample of verbs and the head words of their direct objects given in Fig. 1.

On the other hand, if we restrict the general model of (4) so that both noun classes and verb classes are disjoint, then we obtain the hard clustering model we propose here (1). All of these models, therefore, are some special cases of (4). Each specialization comes with its merit and demerit. For example, employing a model of soft clustering will make the clustering process more flexible but also make the learning process more computationally demanding. Our choice of hard clustering obviously has the merits and demerits of the soft clustering model reversed. 6.2 Estimation criteria Our method is also an extension of that proposed by Brown et al from the viewpoint of estimation criterion. Their method merges word classes so that the reduction in mutual information, or equivalently the increase in data description length, is minimized. Their method has the tendency to overfit the training data, since it is based on MLE. Employing MDL can help solve this problem. 7 Disambiguation Method We apply the acquired word classes, or more specifically the probability model of co-occurrence, to the problem of structural disambiguation. In particular, we consider the problem of resolving pp-attachment ambiguities in quadruples, like (see, girl, with, telescope) and that of resolving ambiguities in compound noun triples, like (data, base, system). In the former, we determine to which of 'see' or 'girl' the phrase 'with telescope' should be attached. In the latter, we judge to which of 'base' or 'system' the word 'data' should be attached.","We can perform pp-attachment disambiguation by comparing the probabilities /5~ith (telescopelsee),/Swith (telescop elgirl). (5) If the former is larger, we attach 'with telescope' to 'see;' if the latter is larger we attach it to 'girl;' otherwise we make no decision. (Disambiguation on compound noun triples can be performed similarly.)","Since the number of probabilities to be estimated is extremely large, estimating all of these probabilities accurately is generally infeasible (i.e., the data sparseness problem). Using our clustering model to calculate these conditional probabilities (by normalizing the joint probabilities with marginal probabilities) can solve this problem.","We further enhance our disambiguation method by the following back-off procedure: We first estimate the two probabilities in question using hard clustering models constructed by our method. We also estimate the probabilities using an existing (hand-made) thesaurus with the 'tree cut' estimation method of (Li and Abe, 1995), and use these probability values when the probabilities estimated based on hard clustering models are both zero. Finally, if both of them are still zero, we make a default decision. 8 Experimental Results 8.1 Qualitative evaluation In this experiment, we used heuristic rules to extract verbs and the head words of their direct objects from the"]},{"title":"lagged","paragraphs":["texts of the WSJ corpus (ACL/DCI CD-ROM1) consisting of 126,084 sentences.","-- s~are,","a~et. data","-- stock.","~no,","secur~","-- inc..corp..co.","i bourne,","home","-- DenK.","group,","firm pr~e.","tax","-- money, ca~","-- c~lr.","vl~llicle","-- profit,","risk","-- so.are, network","-- pressure+ power Figure 3: A part of a constructed thesaurus","We then constructed a number of thesauruses based on these data, using our method. Fig. 3 shows a part of a thesaurus for 100 randomly selected nouns, based on their appearances as direct objects of 20 randomly selected verbs. The thesaurus seems to agree with human intuition to some degree, al-though it is constructed based on a relatively small amount of co-occurrence data. For example, 'stock,' 'security,' and 'bond' are classified together, despite the fact that their absolute frequencies in the data vary a great deal (272, 59, and 79, respectively.) The results demonstrate a desirable feature of our method, namely, it classifies words based solely on the similarities in co-occurrence data, and is not affected by the absolute frequencies of the words. 8.2 Compound noun disambiguation We extracted compound noun doubles (e.g., 'data base') from the tagged texts of the WSJ corpus and used them as training data, and then conducted 753 structural disambiguation on compound noun triples (e.g., 'data base system').","We first randomly selected 1,000 nouns from the corpus, and extracted compound noun doubles containing those nouns as training data and compound noun triples containing those nouns as test data. There were 8,604 training data and 299 test data.

Since for Brown the number of classes finally created has to be designed in advance, we tried a number of alternatives and obtained results for each of them.

Tab. 3 shows the results of these experiments.","We can make a number of observations from these results. (1) 2D-Clustering achieves a broader coverage than NounClass-2DC. This is because in order to estimate the probabilities for disambiguation, the former exploits more information than the latter. (2) For Brown, we show here only its best result, which happens to be the same as the result for 2D-Clustering, but in order to obtain this result we had to take the trouble of conducting a number of tests to find the best level of clustering. For 2D-Clustering, this was done once and automatically. Compared with Li-Abe96, 2D-Clustering clearly performs better. Therefore we conclude that our method improves these previous clustering methods in one way or another. (3) 2D-Clustering outperforms WordNet in term of accuracy, but not in terms of coverage. This seems reasonable, since an automatically constructed thesaurus is more domain dependent and therefore captures the domain dependent features better, and thus can help achieve higher accuracy. On the other hand, with the relatively small size of training data we had available, its coverage is smaller than that of a general purpose hand made thesaurus. The result indicates that it makes sense to combine automatically constructed thesauruses and a hand-made thesaurus, as we have proposed in Section 7.","This method of combining both types of thesauruses '2D-Clustering+WordNet+Default' was then tested. We see that this method performs the best. (See Tab. 3.) Finally, for comparison, we tested the 'transformation-based error-driven learning' proposed in (Brill and Resnik, 1994), which is a state-of-the-art method for pp-attachment disambiguation. Tab. 3 shows the result for this method as 'Brill-Resnik.' We see that our disambiguation method also performs better than Brill-Resnik. (Note further that for Brill & Resnik's method, we need to use quadruples as training data, whereas ours only requires triples.)"]},{"title":"9 Conclusions","paragraphs":["We have proposed a new method of clustering words based on co-occurrence data.
