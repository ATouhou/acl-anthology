Assuming an ordered representation of the predicate-argument structure, this work proposes a Combinatory Categorial Grammar formulation of relating surface case cues to categories and types for correctly placing the arguments in the predicate-argument structure. This is achieved by treat-ing case markers as type shifters. Unlike other CG formulations, type shifting does not proliferate or cause spurious ambiguity. Categories of all argument-encoding grammatical functions follow from the same principle of category assignment. Normal order evaluation of the combinatory form reveals the predicate-argument structure. The application of the method to Turkish is shown. 1 Introduction Recent theorizing in linguistics brought forth a level of representation called the Predicate-Argument Structure (PAS). PAS acts as the interface between lexical semantics and d-structure in GB (Grimshaw, 1990), functional structure in LFG (Alsina, 1996), and complement structure in HPSG (Wechsler, 1995). PAS is the sole level of representation in Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) (Steedman, 1996). All formulations assume a prominence-based structured representation for PAS, although they differ in the terms used for defining prominence. For instance, Grimshaw (1990) defines the thematic hierarchy as:","Agent > Experiencer > Goal / Location / Source","> Theme \" Thanks to Mark Steedman for discussion and material, and to the anonymous reviewer of an extended version whose comments led to significant revisions. This research is supported by TUBITAK (EEEAG-90) and NATO Science Division (TU-LANGUAGE). whereas LFG accounts make use of the following (Bresnan and Kanerva, 1989):","Agent > Beneficiary > Goal / Experiencer > Inst","> Patient/Theme > Locative.","As an illustration, the predicate-argument structures of the agentive verb murder and the psychological verb fear are (Grimshaw, 1990, p.8):","murder (x (y))","Agent Theme","fear (x (y))","Exp Theme","To abstract away from language-particular case systems and mapping of thematic roles to grammatical functions, I assume the Applicative Hierarchy of Shaumyan (1987) for the definition of prominence:","Primary Term > Secondary Term >","Tertiary Term > Oblique Term. Primacy of a term over another is defined by the former having a wider range of syntactic features than the latter. In an accusative language, subjects are less marked (hence primary) than objects; all verbs take subjects but only transitive verbs take objects. Terms (=arguments) can be denoted by the genotype indices on NPs, such as NP1, NP2 for primary and secondary termsJ An NP2 would be a direct object (NPacc) in an accusative language, or an ergative-marked NP (NPerg) in an ergative language. This level of description also simplifies the formulation of grammatical function changing; the primary term of a passivized predicate (PASS p) is the secondary term of the active p. I follow Shaumyan and Steedman (1996) also in the ordered representation of the PAS (1). The reader is referred to (Shaumyan, 1987) for linguistic justification of this ordering. (1) Pred... <Sec. Term> <Primary Term> Given this representation, the surface order of","t Shaumyan uses T 1 , T 2, but we prefer NPI, NP2 for easier exposition in later formulations. 167 constituents is often in conflict with the order in the PAS.

For instance, in Turkish, all six permutations of the basic SOV order are possible, and Japanese allows two verb-final permutations of underlying SOV. The relationship between case marking and scrambling is crucial in languages with flexible word order. A computational solution to the problem must rely on some principles of parsimony for representing categories and types of arguments and predicates, and efficiency of process-ing.","In a categorial formulation, grammatical functions of preverbal and postverbal NPs in (2) can be made explicit by type shifting 2 the subject to"]},{"title":"S/(S\\NP1)","paragraphs":["and the object to"]},{"title":"(S\\NP1)\\((S\\NP1)/NP2).","paragraphs":["These categories follow from the order-preserving type shifting scheme (Dowty, 1988): (3)"]},{"title":"NP ~ T/(T~NP)","paragraphs":["or"]},{"title":"TVT/NP)","paragraphs":["To resolve the opposition between surface order and the PAS in a free word order language, one can let the type shifted categories of terms proliferate, or reformulate CCG in such a way that arguments of the verbs are sets, rather than lists whose arguments are made available one at a time. The former alternative makes the spurious ambiguity problem of CG parsing (Karttunen, 1989) even more severe. Multi-set CCG (Hoffman, 1995) is an example of the set-oriented approach. It is known to be computationally tractable but less efficient than the polynomial time CCG algorithm of Vijay-Shanker and Weir (1993). I try to show in this paper that the traditional curried notation of CG with type shifting can be maintained to account for Surface Form+-~PAS mapping without leading to proliferation of argument categories or to spurious ambiguity.","Categorial framework is particularly suited for this mapping due to its lexicalism. Grammatical functions of the nouns in the lexicon are assigned 2aka. type raising, lifting, or type change by case markers, which are also in the lexicon. Thus, grammatical function marking follows naturally from the general CCG schema comprising rules of application (A) and composition (B). The functor-argument distinction in CG helps to model prominence relations without extra levels of representation. CCG schema (Steedman (1988; 1990)) is summarized in (4). Combinator notation is preferred here because they are the formal primitives operating on the PAS (cf. (Curry and Feys, 1958) for Combinatory Logic).

Forward composition of S/IV and IV/TV is possible, yielding exactly the same PAS. This problem is resolved by grammar rewriting in the sense proposed by Eisner 4 (1996). Grammar rewriting can be done using predictive combinators (Wittenburg, 1987), but they cannot handle crossing compositions that are essential to our method. Other normal form parsers, e.g. that of Hepple and Morrill (1989), have the same problem. All grammar rules in (4) in fact check the labels of the constituent categories, which show how the category is derived. The labels are as in (Eisner, 1996). -FC: Output of forward composition, of which forward crossing composition is a special case. -BC: Output of backward composition, of which backward crossing composition is a special case. -OT: Lexical or type shifted category. The goal is to block e.g., X/Y-FC Y/Z-{FC, BC, OT} =~B> X/Z and X/Y-FC Y-{FC, BC, OT} =~A> X in (10a). S/TV composition would have the label -FC, which cannot be an input to forward application. In (10b), the backward composition follows through since it has the category-label S/TV-BC, which the forward application rule does not block.

This work shows that these categories and their types can be uniquely characterized in the lexicon and tightly controlled in parsing. Spurious ambiguity problem is kept under control by normal form parsing on the syntactic side with the use of labelled categories in the grammar. Thus, the PAS of a derivation can be determined uniquely even in the presence of type shifting. The same strategy can account for deriving the PAS in unbounded constructions and non-constituent coordination (Bozsahin, 1997).","Parser's output (the combinatory form) is reduced to a PAS by normal order evaluation. Modeltheoretic interpretation can proceed in parallel with derivations, or as a post-evaluation stage which takes the PAS as input. Quantification and scrambling in free word order languages interact in many ways, and future work will concentrate on this as-pect of semantics. 172 References","Alex Alsina. 1996.
