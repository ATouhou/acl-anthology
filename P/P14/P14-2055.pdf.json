        "In order to summarize a document, it is often useful to have a background set of documents from the domain to serve as a reference for determining new and important information in the input document. We present a model based on Bayesian surprise which provides an intuitive way to identify surprising information from a summarization input with respect to a background corpus. Specifically, the method quantifies the degree to which pieces of information in the input change one’s beliefs’ about the world represented in the background. We develop systems for generic and update summarization based on this idea. Our method provides competitive content selection performance with particular advantages in the update task where systems are given a small and topical background corpus."

        "Important facts in a new text are those which deviate from previous knowledge on the topic. When people create summaries, they use their knowledge about the world to decide what content in an input document is informative to include in a summary. Understandably in automatic summarization as well, it is useful to keep a background set of documents to represent general facts and their frequency in the domain.",
        "For example, in the simplest setting of multi-document summarization of news, systems are asked to summarize an input set of topicallyrelated news documents to reflect its central content. In this GENERIC task, some of the best reported results were obtained by a system (Conroy et al., 2006) which computed importance scores for words in the input by examining if the word occurs with significantly higher probability in the input compared to a large background collection of news articles. Other specialized summarization tasks explicitly require the use of background information. In the UPDATE summarization task, a system is given two sets of news documents on the same topic; the second contains articles published later in time. The system should summarize the important updates from the second set assuming a user has already read the first set of articles.",
        "In this work, we present a Bayesian model for assessing the novelty of a sentence taken from a summarization input with respect to a background corpus of documents.",
        "Our model is based on the idea of Bayesian Surprise (Itti and Baldi, 2006). For illustration, as-sume that a user’s background knowledge comprises of multiple hypotheses about the current state of the world and a probability distribution over these hypotheses indicates his degree of be-lief in each hypothesis. For example, one hypothesis may be that the political situation in Ukraine is peaceful, another where it is not. Apriori as-sume the user favors the hypothesis about a peaceful Ukraine, i.e. the hypothesis has higher probability in the prior distribution. Given new data, the evidence can be incorporated using Bayes Rule to compute the posterior distribution over the hypotheses. For example, upon viewing news reports about riots in the country, a user would update his beliefs and the posterior distribution of the user’s knowledge would have a higher probability for a riotous Ukraine. Bayesian surprise is the difference between the prior and posterior distributions over the hypotheses which quantifies the extent to which the new data (the news report) has changed a user’s prior beliefs about the world.",
        "In this work, we exemplify how Bayesian surprise can be used to do content selection for text summarization. Here a user’s prior knowledge is approximated by a background corpus and we 333 show how to identify sentences from the input set which are most surprising with respect to this background. We use the method to do two types of summarization tasks: a) GENERIC news summarization which uses a large random collection of news articles as the background, and b) UPDATE summarization where the background is a smaller but specific set of news documents on the same topic as the input set. We find that our method performs competitively with a previous log-likelihood ratio approach which identifies words with significantly higher probability in the input compared to the background. The Bayesian approach is more advantageous in the update task, where the background corpus is smaller in size."

        "Computing new information is useful in many applications. The TREC novelty tasks (Allan et al., 2003; Soboroff and Harman, 2005; Schiffman, 2005) tested the ability of systems to find novel information in an IR setting. Systems were given a list of documents ranked according to relevance to a query. The goal is to find sentences in each document which are relevant to the query, and at the same time is new information given the content of documents higher in the relevance list.",
        "For update summarization of news, methods range from textual entailment techniques (Bentivogli et al., 2010) to find facts in the input which are not entailed by the background, to Bayesian topic models (Delort and Alfonseca, 2012) which aim to learn and use topics discussed only in background, those only in the update input and those that overlap across the two sets.",

(2006) by using a large random corpus of news articles as the background while summarizing a new article, an idea first proposed by Lin and Hovy (2000). Central to this approach is the use of a likelihood ratio test to compute topic words, words that have significantly higher probability in the input compared to the background corpus, and are hence descriptive of the input’s topic. In this work, we compare our system to topic word based ones since the latter is also a general method to find surprising new words in a set of input documents but is not a bayesian approach.

For example, one multinomial may have higher word probabilities for ‘Ukraine’ and ‘peaceful’ and another multinomial has higher probabilities for ‘Ukraine’ and ‘riots’. P (H) gives a prior probability to each hypothesis based on the information in the background corpus. In our case, P (H) is a Dirichlet distribution, the conjugate prior for multinomials.

The score for wi is the surprise computed as KL divergence between P (H|wi) and the prior P (H) (eqn. 6).",

We follow a greedy approach to optimize the summary surprise by choosing the most surprising sentence, the next most surprising and so on. At the same time, we aim to avoid redundancy, i.e. selecting sentences with similar content. After a sentence is selected for the summary, the surprise for words from this sentence are set to zero. We re-compute the surprise for the remaining sentences using step 2 and the selection process continues until the summary length limit is reached.",
        "The key differences between our Bayesian approach and a method such as topic words are: (i) The Bayesian approach keeps multiple hypotheses about the background rather than a single one. Surprise is computed based on the changes in probabilities of all of these hypotheses upon see-ing the summarization input. (ii) The computation of topic words is local, it assumes a binomial distribution and the occurrence of a word is independent of others.
