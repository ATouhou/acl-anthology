        "Code-switched documents are common in social media, providing evidence for polylingual topic models to infer aligned topics across languages. We present Code-Switched LDA (csLDA), which infers language specific topic distributions based on code-switched documents to facilitate multi-lingual corpus analysis. We experiment on two code-switching corpora (English-Spanish Twitter data and English-Chinese Weibo data) and show that csLDA improves perplexity over LDA, and learns semantically coherent aligned topics as judged by human annotators."

        "Topic models (Blei et al., 2003) have become standard tools for analyzing document collections, and topic analyses are quite common for social media (Paul and Dredze, 2011; Zhao et al., 2011; Hong and Davison, 2010; Ramage et al., 2010; Eisenstein et al., 2010). Their popularity owes in part to their data driven nature, allowing them to adapt to new corpora and languages. In social media especially, there is a large diversity in terms of both the topic and language, necessitating the modeling of multiple languages simultaneously. A good candidate for multi-lingual topic analyses are polylingual topic models (Mimno et al., 2009), which learn topics for multiple languages, creating tuples of language specific distributions over monolingual vocabularies for each topic. Polylingual topic models enable cross language analysis by group-ing documents by topic regardless of language.",
        "Training of polylingual topic models requires parallel or comparable corpora: document tuples from multiple languages that discuss the same topic. While additional non-aligned documents User 1: ¡Don Samuel es un crack! #VamosMéxico #DaleTri RT @User4: Arriba! Viva Mexico! Advanced to GOLD. medal match in “Football”! User 2: @user1 rodo que tal el nuevo Mountain ? User 3: @User1 @User4 wow this is something !! Ja ja ja Football well said Figure 1: Three users discuss Mexico’s football team advancing to the Gold medal game in the 2012 Olympics in code-switched Spanish and English. can be folded in during training, the “glue” documents are required to aid in the alignment across languages. However, the ever changing vocabulary and topics of social media (Eisenstein, 2013) make finding suitable comparable corpora difficult. Standard techniques – such as relying on machine translation parallel corpora or comparable documents extracted from Wikipedia in different languages – fail to capture the specific terminology of social media. Alternate methods that rely on bilingual lexicons (Jagarlamudi and Daumé, 2010) similarly fail to adapt to shifting vocabularies. The result: an inability to train polylingual models on social media.",
        "In this paper, we offer a solution: utilize code-switched social media to discover correlations across languages. Social media is filled with examples of code-switching, where users switch between two or more languages, both in a conversation and even a single message (Ling et al., 2013). This mixture of languages in the same context suggests alignments between words across languages through the common topics discussed in the context.",
        "We learn from code-switched social media by extending the polylingual topic model framework to infer the language of each token and then automatically processing the learned topics to identify aligned topics. Our model improves both in terms of perplexity and a human evaluation, and we provide some example analyses of social media that rely on our learned topics. 674"

        "Code-switched documents has received considerable attention in the NLP community. Several tasks have focused on identification and analysis, including mining translations in code-switched documents (Ling et al., 2013), predicting code-switched points (Solorio and Liu, 2008a), identifying code-switched tokens (Lignos and Marcus, 2013; Yu et al., 2012; Elfardy and Diab, 2012), adding code-switched support to language models (Li and Fung, 2012), linguistic processing of code switched data (Solorio and Liu, 2008b), corpus creation (Li et al., 2012; Diab and Kamboj, 2011), and computational linguistic analyses and theories of code-switching (Sankofl, 1998; Joshi, 1982).",
        "Code-switching specifically in social media has also received some recent attention. Lignos and Marcus (2013) trained a supervised token level language identification system for Spanish and English code-switched social media to study code-switching behaviors. Ling et al. (2013) mined translation spans for Chinese and English in code-switched documents to improve a translation system, relying on an existing translation model to aid in the identification and extraction task. In contrast to this work, we take an unsupervised approach, relying only on readily available document level language ID systems to utilize code-switched data. Additionally, our focus is not on individual messages, rather we aim to train a model that can be used to analyze entire corpora.",
        "In this work we consider two types of code-switched documents: single messages and conversations, and two language pairs: Chinese-English and Spanish-English. Figure 1 shows an example of a code-switched Spanish-English conversation, in which three users discuss Mexico’s football team advancing to the Gold medal game in the 2012 Summer Olympics. In this conversation, some tweets are code-switched and some are in a single language. By collecting the entire conversation into a single document we provide the topic model with additional content. An example of a Chinese-English code-switched messages is given by Ling et al. (2013): watup Kenny Mayne!! - Kenny Mayne 最近这么样啊!! Here a user switches between languages in a single message. We empirically evaluate our model on both conversations and messages. In the model presentation we will refer to both as “documents.”"

        "To train a polylingual topic model on social media, we make two modifications to the model of Mimno et al. (2009): add a token specific language variable, and a process for identifying aligned topics.",
        "First, polylingual topic models require parallel or comparable corpora in which each document has an assigned language. In the case of code-switched social media data, we require a per-token language variable. However, while document level language identification (LID) systems are common place, very few languages have per-token LID systems (King and Abney, 2013; Lignos and Marcus, 2013).",
        "To address the lack of available LID systems, we add a per-token latent language variable to the polylingual topic model. For documents that are not code-switched, we observe these variables to be the output of a document level LID system. In the case of code-switched documents, these variables are inferred during model inference.",
        "Second, polylingual topic models assume the aligned topics are from parallel or comparable corpora, which implicitly assumes that a topics popularity is balanced across languages. Topics that show up in one language necessarily show up in another. However, in the case of social media, we can make no such assumption. The topics discussed are influenced by users, time, and location, all factors intertwined with choice of language. For example, English speakers will more likely discuss Olympic basketball while Spanish speakers football. There may be little or no documents on a given topic in one language, while they are plentiful in another. In this case, a polylingual topic model, which necessarily infers a topic-specific word distribution for each topic in each language, would learn two unrelated word distributions in two languages for a single topic. Therefore, naively using the produced topics as “aligned” across languages is ill-advised.",
        "Our solution is to automatically identify aligned polylingual topics after learning by examining a topic’s distribution across code-switched documents. Our metric relies on distributional properties of an inferred topic across the entire collection. 675",

We begin by measuring how often each topic occurs in code-switched documents. If a topic never occurs in a code-switched document, then there can be no evidence to support alignment across languages. For the topics that appear at least once in a code-switched document, we estimate their probability 676 in the code-switched documents by a MAP estimate of θ. Topics appearing in at least one code-switched document with probability greater than a threshold p are selected as candidates for true cross-language topics."

In total we identified 822 Spanish-English code-switched tweets. We further expanded the mined tweets to full conversations, yielding 1055 Spanish-English code-switched documents (including both tweets and conversations), along with 4007 English and 4421 Spanish tweets composes our data set.

        "Figure 3 shows test perplexity for varying T and perplexity for the best setting of csLDA (T =60) and LDA (T =120). The table lists both monolingual and code-switched test data; csLDA improves over LDA in almost every case, and across all values of T . The background distribution (-bg) has mixed results for LDA, whereas for csLDA it shows consistent improvement. Table 4 shows some csLDA topics. While there are some mistakes, overall the topics are coherent and aligned.",
        "We use the available per-token LID system (Lignos and Marcus, 2013) for Spanish/English to justify csLDA’s ability to infer the hidden language variables. We ran csLDA-bg with li set to the value provided by the LID system for code-switched documents (csLDA-bg with LID), which gives csLDA high quality LID labels. While we see gains for the code-switched data, overall the results for csLDA-bg and csLDA-bg with LID are similar, suggesting that the model can operate effectively even without a supervised per-token LID system. 5.1 Human Evaluation We evaluate topic alignment quality through a human judgements (Chang et al., 2009). For each aligned topic, we show an annotator the 20 most frequent words from the foreign language topic (Chinese or Spanish) with the 20 most frequent words from the aligned English topic and two random English topics. The annotators are asked to select the most related English topic among the three; the one with the most votes is considered the aligned topic. We count how often the model’s alignments agree.",

We create alignments by classifying each LDA topic by language using the KL-divergence between the topic’s words distribution and a word distribution for the English/foreign language inferred from the monolingual documents.
