        "This paper presents experiments with WordNet semantic classes to improve dependency parsing. We study the effect of semantic classes in three dependency parsers, using two types of constituency-to-dependency conversions of the English Penn Treebank. Overall, we can say that the improvements are small and not significant using automatic POS tags, contrary to previously published results using gold POS tags (Agirre et al., 2011). In addition, we explore parser combinations, showing that the semantically enhanced parsers yield a small significant gain only on the more semantically oriented LTH treebank conversion."

Whether semantics improve parsing is one interesting research topic both on parsing and lexical semantics. Broadly speaking, we can classify the methods to incorporate semantic information into parsers in two: systems using static lexical semantic repositories, such as WordNet or similar ontologies (Agirre et al., 2008; Agirre et al., 2011; Fujita et al., 2010), and systems using dynamic semantic clusters automatically acquired from corpora (Koo et al., 2008; Suzuki et al., 2009).",

        "Broadly speaking, we can classify the attempts to add external knowledge to a parser in two sets: using large semantic repositories such as WordNet and approaches that use information automatically acquired from corpora. In the first group, Agirre et al. (2008) trained two state-of-the-art constituency-based statistical parsers (Charniak, 649 2000; Bikel, 2004) on semantically-enriched input, substituting content words with their semantic classes, trying to overcome the limitations of lexicalized approaches to parsing (Collins, 2003) where related words, like scissors and knife, can-not be generalized. The results showed a signicant improvement, giving the first results over both WordNet and the Penn Treebank (PTB) to show that semantics helps parsing. Later, Agirre et al. (2011) successfully introduced WordNet classes in a dependency parser, obtaining improvements on the full PTB using gold POS tags, trying different combinations of semantic classes. MacKinlay et al. (2012) investigate the addition of semantic annotations in the form of word sense hypernyms, in HPSG parse ranking, reducing error rate in dependency F-score by 1%, while some methods produce substantial decreases in performance. Fujita et al. (2010) showed that fully disambiguated sense-based features smoothed using ontological information are effective for parse selection.",
        "On the second group, Koo et al. (2008) presented a semisupervised method for training dependency parsers, introducing features that incorporate word clusters automatically acquired from a large unannotated corpus. The clusters include strongly semantic associations like {apple, pear} or {Apple, IBM} and also syntactic clusters like {of, in}. They demonstrated its effectiveness in dependency parsing experiments on the PTB and the Prague Dependency Treebank. Suzuki et al. (2009), Sagae and Gordon (2009) and Candito and Seddah (2010) also experiment with the same cluster method. Recently, Täckström et al. (2012) tested the incorporation of cluster features from unlabeled corpora in a multilingual setting, giving an algorithm for inducing cross-lingual clusters."

        "WordNet. We will experiment with the semantic representations used in Agirre et al. (2008) and Agirre et al. (2011), based on WordNet 2.1. WordNet is organized into sets of synonyms, called synsets (SS). Each synset in turn belongs to a unique semantic file (SF). There are a total of 45 SFs (1 for adverbs, 3 for adjectives, 15 for verbs, and 26 for nouns), based on syntactic and semantic categories. For example, noun SFs differentiate nouns denoting acts or actions, and nouns denoting animals, among others. We experiment with both full SSs and SFs as instances of fine-grained and coarse-grained semantic representation, respectively. As an example, knife in its tool sense is in the EDGE TOOL USED AS A CUTTING INSTRUMENT singleton synset, and also in the ARTIFACT SF along with thousands of words including cutter. These are the two extremes of semantic granularity in WordNet. For each semantic representation, we need to determine the semantics of each occurrence of a target word. Agirre et al. (2011) used i) gold-standard annotations from SemCor, a subset of the PTB, to give an upper bound performance of the semantic representation, ii) first sense, where all instances of a word were tagged with their most frequent sense, and iii) automatic sense ranking, predicting the most frequent sense for each word (McCarthy et al., 2004).

        "In all the experiments we employed a baseline feature set using word forms and parts of speech, and an enriched feature set (WordNet or clusters). We firstly tested the addition of each individual semantic feature to each parser, evaluating its contribution to the parser’s performance. For the combinations, instead of feature-engineering each parser with the wide array of different possibilities for features, as in Agirre et al. (2011), we adopted the simpler approach of combining the outputs of the individual parsers by voting (Sagae and Lavie, 2006). We will use Labeled Attachment Score (LAS) as our main evaluation criteria. As in previous work, we exclude punctuation marks. For all the tests, we used a perceptron POS-tagger (Collins, 2002), trained on WSJ sections 2–21, to assign POS tags automatically to both the training (using 10-way jackknifing) and test data, obtaining a POS tagging accuracy of 97.32% on the test data. We will make use of Bikel’s randomized parsing evaluation comparator to test the statistical signicance of the results. In all of the experiments the parsers were trained on sections 2-21 of the PTB and evaluated on the development set (section 22).

For example, ZPar’s LAS score on the LTH conversion drops from 90.45% with gold POS tags to 89.12% with automatic POS tags. We will examine the influence of each type of semantic information on sentences that contain or not POS errors, and this will clarify whether the increments obtained when using semantic information are useful for correcting the negative influence of POS errors or they are orthogonal and constitute a source of new information independent of POS tags. With this objective in mind, we analyzed the performance on the subset of the test corpus containing the sentences which had POS errors (1,025 sentences and 27,300 tokens) and the subset where the sentences had (automatically assigned) correct POS tags (1,391 sentences and 29,386 tokens).",
        "Table 5 presents the results of the best single parser on the LTH conversion (ZPar) with gold and automatic POS tags in the first two rows. The LAS scores are particularized for sentences that contain or not POS errors. The following three rows present the enhanced (combined) parsers that make use of semantic information. As the combination of the three baseline parsers did not give any improvement over the best single parser (ZPar), we can hypothesize that the gain coming from the parser combinations comes mostly from the addition of semantic information. Table 5 suggests that the improvements coming from WordNet’s semantic file (SF) are unevenly distributed between the sentences that contain POS errors and those that do not (an increase of 0.28 for sentences without POS errors and 0.55 for those with errors). This could mean that a big part of the information contained in SF helps to alleviate the errors performed by the automatic POS tagger. On the other hand, the increments are more evenly distributed for SS and clusters, and this can be due to the fact that the semantic information is orthogonal to the POS, giving similar improvements for sentences that contain or not POS errors. We independently tested this fact for the individual parsers. For example, with MST and SF the gains almost doubled for sentences with incorrect POS tags (+0.37 with respect to +0.21 for sentences with correct POS tags) while the gains of adding clusters’ information for sentences without and with POS errors were similar (0.91 and 1.33, repectively). This aspect deserves further investigation, as the improvements seem to be related to both the type of semantic information and the parsing algorithm.We did an initial exploration but it did not give any clear indication of the types of improvements that could be expected using each parser and semantic data."

For parser combination, WordNet semantic file information does give a small significant increment in the more fine-grained LTH representation. In addition we show that the improvement of automatic clusters is also weak. For the future, we think tdifferent parsers, eitherhat a more elaborate scheme is needed for word classes, requiring to explore different levels of generaliza-tion in the WordNet (or alternative) hierarchies."
