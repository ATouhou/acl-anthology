        "Wikification for tweets aims to automatically identify each concept mention in a tweet and link it to a concept referent in a knowledge base (e.g., Wikipedia). Due to the shortness of a tweet, a collective inference model incorporating global evidence from multiple mentions and concepts is more appropriate than a noncollecitve approach which links each mention at a time. In addition, it is challenging to generate sufficient high quality labeled data for supervised models with low cost. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel semi-supervised graph regularization model to incorporate both local and global evidence from multiple tweets through three fine-grained relations. In order to identify semantically-related mentions for collective inference, we detect meta path-based semantic relations through social networks. Compared to the state-of-the-art supervised model trained from 100% labeled data, our proposed approach achieves comparable performance with 31% labeled data and obtains 5% absolute F1 gain with 50% labeled data."

        "With millions of tweets posted daily, Twitter enables both individuals and organizations to disseminate information, from current affairs to breaking news in a timely fashion. In this work, we study the wikification (Disambiguation to Wikipedia) task (Mihalcea and Csomai, 2007) for tweets, which aims to automatically identify each concept mention in a tweet, and link it to a concept referent in a knowledge base (KB) (e.g., Wikipedia). For example, as shown in Figure 1, Hawks is an identified mention, and its correct referent concept in Wikipedia is Atlanta Hawks. An end-to-end wikification system needs to solve two sub-problems: (i) concept mention detection, (ii) concept mention disambiguation.",
        "Wikification is a particularly useful task for short messages such as tweets because it allows a reader to easily grasp the related topics and enriched information from the KB. From a system-to-system perspective, wikification has demonstrated its usefulness in a variety of applica-tions, including coreference resolution (Ratinov and Roth, 2012) and classification (Vitale et al., 2012).",
        "Sufficient labeled data is crucial for supervised models. However, manual wikification annotation for short documents is challenging and time-consuming (Cassidy et al., 2012). The challenges are: (i) unlinkability, a valid concept may not exist in the KB. (ii) ambiguity, it is impossible to determine the correct concept due to the dearth of information within a single tweet or multiple correct answer. For instance, it would be difficult to determine the correct referent concept for “Gators” in t1 in Figure 1. Linking “UCONN” in t3 to University of Connecticut may also be acceptable since Connecticut Huskies is the athletic team of the university. (iii) prominence, it is challenging to select a set of linkable mentions that are important and relevant. It is not tricky to select “Fans”, “slump”, and “Hawks” as linkable mentions, but other mentions such as “stay up” and “stay positive” are not prominent. Therefore, it is challenging to create sufficient high quality labeled tweets for supervised models and worth considering semi-supervised learning with the exploration of unlabeled data. 380     Stay up Hawk Fans. We are going through a slump now, but we have to stay positive. Go Hawks! Congrats to UCONN and Kemba Walker. 5 wins in 5 days, very impressive...

        "4 Figure 1: An illustration of Wikification Task for Tweets. Concept mentions detected in tweets are marked as bold, and correctly linked concepts are underlined. The concept candidates are ranked by their prior popularity which will be explained in section 4.1, and only top 2 ranked concepts are listed. However, when selecting semi-supervised learning frameworks, we noticed another unique challenge that tweets pose to wikification due to their informal writing style, shortness and noisiness. The context of a single tweet usually cannot provide enough information for prominent mention detection and similarity computing for disambiguation. Therefore, a collective inference model over multiple tweets in the semi-supervised setting is desirable. For instance, the four tweets in Figure 1 are posted by the same author within a short time period. If we perform collective inference over them we can reliably link ambiguous mentions such as “Gators”, “Hawks”, and “Bucks” to basketball teams instead of other concepts such as the county Bucks County.",
        "In order to address these unique challenges for wikification for the short tweets, we employ graph-based semi-supervised learning algorithms (Zhu et al., 2003; Smola and Kondor, 2003; Blum et al., 2004; Zhou et al., 2004; Talukdar and Crammer, 2009) for collective inference by exploiting the manifold (cluster) structure in both unlabeled and labeled data. These approaches normally assume label smoothness over a defined graph, where the nodes represent a set of labeled and unlabeled instances, and the weighted edges reflect the closeness of each pair of instances. In order to construct a semantic-rich graph capturing the similarity between mentions and concepts for the model, we introduce three novel fine-grained relations based on a set of local features, social networks and meta paths.",
        "The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: • To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to explore graph-based semi-supervised learning algorithms for the wikification task.",
        "• We propose a novel semi-supervised graph regularization model performing collective inference for joint mention detection and disambiguation. Our approach takes advantage of three proposed principles to incorporate both local and global evidence from multiple tweets.",

        "We define a concept c as a Wikipedia article (e.g., Atlanta Hawks), and a concept mention m as an n-gram from a specific tweet. Each concept has a set of textual representation fields (Meij et al., 2012), including title (the title of the article), sentence (the first sentence of the article), paragraph (the first paragraph of the article), content (the entire content of the article), and anchor (the set of all anchor texts with incoming links to the article).",
        "Wikipedia Lexicon Construction We first construct an offline lexicon with each entry as ⟨m, {c1, ..., ck}⟩, where {c1, ..., ck} is the set of possible referent concepts for the mention m. Following the previous work (Bunescu, 2006; Cucerzan, 2007; Hachey et al., 2013), we extract the possible mentions for a given concept c using the following resources: the title of c; the aliases appearing in the introduction and infoboxes of c (e.g., The Evergreen State is an alias of Washington state); the titles of pages redirecting to c (e.g., State of Washington is a redirecting page of Washington (state)); the titles of the disambigua-381 tion pages containing c; and all the anchor texts appearing in at least 5 pages with hyperlinks to c (e.g., WA is a mention for the concept Washington (state) in the text “401 5th Ave N [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)—WA]] 98109 USA”. We also propose three heuristic rules to extract mentions (i.e., different combinations of the family name and given name for a person, the headquarters of an organization, and the city name for a sports team).",
        "Concept Mention Extraction Based on the constructed lexicon, we then consider all n-grams of size ≤ n (n=7 in this paper) as concept mention candidates if their entries in the lexicon are not empty. We first segment @usernames and #hashtags into regular tokens (e.g., @amandapalmer is segmented as amanda palmer and #WorldWater-Day is split as World Water Day) using the approach proposed by (Wang et al., 2011). Segmentation assists finding concept candidates for these non-regular mentions."

To tackle this problem, we propose to incorporate global evidence from multiple tweets and performing collective inference for both mention identification and disambiguation. We first introduce the following three principles that our approach relies on.",
        "Principle 1 (Local compatibility): Two pairs of ⟨m, c⟩ with strong local compatibility tend to have similar labels. Mentions and their correct referent concepts usually tend to share a set of characteristics such as string similarity between m and c (e.g., ⟨Chicago, Chicago⟩ and ⟨Facebook, Facebook⟩). We define the local compatibility to model such set of characteristics.",
        "Principle 2 (Coreference): Two coreferential mentions should be linked to the same concept. For example, if we know “nc” and “North Carolina” are coreferential, then they should both be linked to North Carolina.",
        "Principle 3 (Semantic Relatedness): Two highly semantically-related mentions are more likely to be linked to two highly semantically-related concepts. For instance, when “Sweet 16” and “Hawks” often appear together within relevant contexts, they can be reliably linked to two baseketball-related concepts NCAA Men’s Division I Basketball Championship and Atlanta Hawks, respectively. 3.2 Approach Overview Given a set of tweets ⟨t1, ..., t|T |⟩, our system first generates a set of candidate concept mentions, and then extracts a set of candidate concept referents for each mention based on the Wikipedia lexicon. Given a pair of mention and its candidate referent concept ⟨m, c⟩, the remaining task of wikification is to assign either a positive label if m should be selected as a prominently linkable mention and c is its correct referent concept, or otherwise a negative label. The label assignment is obtained by our semi-supervised graph regularization framework based on a relational graph, which is constructed from local compatibility, coreference, and semantic relatedness relations. The overview of our approach is as illustrated in Figure 2."

        "A meta-path is a path defined over a network and composed of a sequence of relations between different object types (Sun et al., 2011b). In our experimental setting, we can construct a natural Twitter network summarized by the network schema in Figure 3. The network contains four types of objects: Mention (M), Tweet (T), User (U), and Hashtag (H). Tweets and mentions are connected by links “contain” and “contained by” (denoted as “contain−1",
        "”); and other linked relationships can be described similarly.",
        "We then define the following five types of meta paths to connect two mentions as: • “M - T - M”, • “M - T - U - T - M”, • “M - T - H - T - M”, • “M - T - U - T - M - T - H - T - M”, • “M - T - H - T - M - T - U - T - M”. 383 Each meta path represents one particular semantic relation. For instance, the first three paths are basic ones expressing the explicit relations that two mentions are from the same tweet, posted by the same user, and share the same #hashtag, respectively. The last two paths are concatenated ones which are constructed by concatenating the first three simple paths to express the implicit relations that two mentions co-occur with a third mention sharing either the same authorship or #hashtag. Such complicated paths can be exploited to detect more semantically-related mentions from wider contexts. For example, the relational link between “narita airport” and “Japan” would be missed without using the path “narita airport - t1 - u1 - t2 - american - t3 - h1 - t4 - Japan” since they don’t directly share any authorships or #hashtags. 4.3 Coreference A coreference relation (Principle 2) usually occurs across multiple tweets due to the highly redundant information in Twitter. To ensure high precision, we propose a simple yet effective approach utiliz-ing the rich social network relations in Twitter.",

As an example, it is difficult to obtain topical clues in order to link the mention “Clinton” to Hillary Rodham Clinton by relying on the single tweet “wolfblitzercnn: Behind the scenes on Clinton’s Mideast trip #cnn”. Therefore, the system mistakenly links it to the most popular concept Bill Clinton.",
        "In comparision with the supervised baseline proposed by (Meij et al., 2012), our model SSRegu1 relying on local compatibility already achieves comparable performance with 50% of labeled data. This is because that our model performs collective inference by making use of the manifold (cluster) structure of both labeled and unlabeled data, and that the local compatibility relation is detected with high precision2 (89.4%). For example, the following three pairs of mentions and concepts ⟨pelosi, Nancy Pelosi⟩, ⟨obama, Barack Obama⟩, and ⟨gaddafi, Muam-",
        "1",
        "These three coefficients are slightly different with different training data, a sample of them is: α = 0.4, β = 0.5, and γ = 0.1",
        "2",
        "Here we define precision as the percentage of links that holds the same label. mar Gaddafi⟩ have strong local compatibility with each other since they share many similar characteristics captured by the local features such as string similarity between the mention and the concept. Suppose the first pair is labeled, then its positive label will be propagated to other unlabeled nodes through the local compatibility relation, and correctly predict the labels of other nodes.",
        "Incorporating coreferential or semantic relatedness relation into SSRegu1 provides further gains, demonstrating the effectiveness of these two relations. For instance, “wh” is correctly linked to White House by incorporating evidence from its coreferential mention “white house”. The coreferential relation (Principle 2) is demonstrated to be more beneficial than the semantic relatedness relation (Principle 3) because the former is detected with much higher precision (99.7%) than the latter (65.4%).",
        "Our full model SSRegu123 achieves significant improvement over the supervised baseline (5% absolute F1 gain with 95.0% confidence level by the Wilcoxon Matched-Pairs Signed-Ranks Test), showing that incorporating global evidence from multiple tweets with fine-grained relations is beneficial. For instance, the supervised baseline fails to link “UCONN” and “Bucks” in our examples to Connecticut Huskies and Milwaukee Bucks, respectively. Our full model corrects these two wrong links by propagating evidence through the semantic links as shown in Figure 4 to obtain mutual ranking improvement. The best performance of our full model also illustrates that the three relations complement each other.",
        "We also study the disambiguation performance for the annotated mentions, as shown in Table 3. We can easily see that our proposed approach using 50% labeled data achieves similar performance with the state-of-the-art supervised model with 100% labeled data.

In fact, mention detection actually is the performance bottleneck of a tweet wikification system (Guo et al., 2013). Our system performs better in identifying the prominent mention. 6.3 Effect of Concatenated Meta Paths In this work, we propose a unified framework utilizing meta path-based semantic relations to explore richer relevant context. Beyond the basic meta paths, we introduce concatenated ones by concatenating the basic ones. The performance of the system without using the concatenated meta paths is shown in Table 4. In comparison with the system based on all defined meta paths, we can clearly see that the systems using concatenated ones outperform those relying on the simple ones. This is because the concatenated meta paths can incorporate more relevant information with implicit relations into the models by increas-ing 1.6% coreference links and 9.3% semantic relatedness links. For example, the mention “narita airport” is correctly disambiguated to the concept “Narita International Airport” with higher confidence since its semantic relatedness relation with “Japan” is detected with the concatenated meta path as described in section 4.2. 6.4 Effect of Labeled Data Size 5 0 1 0 0 1 5 0 2 0 0 2 5 0 3 0 0 3 5 0 4 0 0 0 . 3 0 0 . 3 5 0 . 4 0 0 . 4 5 0 . 5 0 0 . 5 5 0 . 6 0 F 1 L a b e l e d T w e e t S i z e  S S R e g u 1 2 3 M e i j Figure 5: The effect of Labeled Tweet Size.",
        "In previous experiments, we experimentally set the number of labeled tweets to be 200 for overall performance comparision with the baselines. In this subsection, we study the effect of labeled data size on our full model. We randomly sample 100 tweets as testing data, and randomly select 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 tweets as labeled data. 20 test runs are conducted and the average results are reported across the 20 trials, as shown in Figure 5. We find that as the size of the labeled data increases, our proposed model achieves better performance. It is encouraging to see that our approach, with only 31.3% labeled tweets (125 out of 400), already achieves a performance that is comparable to the state-of-the-art supervised model trained from 100% labeled tweets. 6.5 Parameter Analysis 0 . 1 0 . 5 1 2 5 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 0 . 3 0 0 . 3 5 0 . 4 0 0 . 4 5 0 . 5 0 0 . 5 5 0 . 6 0 F 1 R e g u l a r i z a t i o n P a r a m e t e r m ",

        "In previous experiments, we empirically set the parameter μ = 0.1. μ is the regularization parameter that controls the trade-off between initial labels and the consistency of labels on the graph. When μ increases, the model tends to trust more in the initial labels. Figure 6 shows the performance of our models by varying μ from 0.02 to 50. We can easily see that the system performce is stable when μ < 0.4. However, when μ ≥ 0.4, the system performance dramatically decreases, showing that prior popularity is not enough for an end-to-end wikification system."

        "The task of linking concept mentions to a knowledge base has received increased attentions over the past several years, from the linking of concept mentions in a single text (Mihalcea and Csomai, 2007; Milne and Witten, 2008b; Milne and Witten, 2008a; Kulkarni et al., 2009; He et al., 2011; Ratinov et al., 2011; Cassidy et al., 2012; Cheng and Roth, 2013), to the linking of a cluster of corefer-387 ent named entity mentions spread throughout different documents (Entity Linking) (McNamee and Dang, 2009; Ji et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2010; Ji et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2011; Han and Sun, 2011; Han et al., 2011; Gottipati and Jiang, 2011; He et al., 2013; Li et al., 2013; Guo et al., 2013; Shen et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2013).",
        "A significant portion of recent work considers the two sub-problems mention detection and mention disambiguation separately and focus on the latter by first defining candidate concepts for a deemed mention based on anchor links. Mention disambiguation is then formulated as a ranking problem, either by resolving one mention at each time (non-collective approaches), or by disambiguating a set of relevant mentions simultaneously (collective approaches). Non-collective methods usually rely on prior popularity and context similarity with supervised models (Mihalcea and Csomai, 2007; Milne and Witten, 2008b; Han and Sun, 2011), while collective approaches further leverage the global coherence between concepts normally through supervised or graph-based re-ranking models (Cucerzan, 2007; Milne and Witten, 2008b; Han and Zhao, 2009; Kulkarni et al., 2009; Pennacchiotti and Pantel, 2009; Ferragina and Scaiella, 2010; Fernandez et al., 2010; Radford et al., 2010; Cucerzan, 2011; Guo et al., 2011; Han and Sun, 2011; Han et al., 2011; Ratinov et al., 2011; Chen and Ji, 2011; Kozareva et al., 2011; Cassidy et al., 2012; Shen et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2013). Especially note that when applying the collective methods to short messages from social media, evidence from other messages usually needs to be considered (Cassidy et al., 2012; Shen et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2013). Our method is a collective approach with the following novel advancements: (i) A novel graph representation with fine-grained relations, (ii) A unified framework based on meta paths to explore richer relevant context, (iii) Joint identification and linking of mentions under semi-supervised setting.",
        "Two most similar methods to ours were proposed by (Meij et al., 2012; Guo et al., 2013) by performing joint detection and disambiguation of mentions. (Meij et al., 2012) studied several supervised machine learning models, but without considering any global evidence either from a single tweet or other relevant tweets. (Guo et al., 2013) explored second order entity-to-entity relations but did not incorporate evidence from multiple tweets.",
        "This work is also related to graph-based semi-supervised learning (Zhu et al., 2003; Smola and Kondor, 2003; Zhou et al., 2004; Talukdar and Crammer, 2009), which has been successfully applied in many Natural Language Processing tasks (Niu et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2006). We introduce a novel graph that incorporates three fine-grained relations. Our work is further related to meta path-based heterogeneous information network analysis (Sun et al., 2011b; Sun et al., 2011a; Kong et al., 2012; Huang et al., 2013), which has demonstrated advantages over homogeneous information network analysis without differentiating object types and relational links."

        "We have introduced a novel semi-supervised graph regularization framework for wikification to simultaneously tackle the unique challenges of annotation and information shortage in short tweets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explore the semi-supervised collective inference model to jointly perform mention detection and disambiguation. By studying three novel fine-grained relations, detecting semantically-related information with semantic meta paths, and exploiting the data manifolds in both unlabeled and labeled data for collective inference, our work can dramatically save annotation cost and achieve better performance, thus shed light on the challenging wikification task for tweets."
