        "Word representations have proven useful for many NLP tasks, e.g., Brown clusters as features in dependency parsing (Koo et al., 2008). In this paper, we investigate the use of continuous word representations as features for dependency parsing. We compare several popular embeddings to Brown clusters, via multiple types of features, in both news and web domains. We find that all embeddings yield significant parsing gains, including some recent ones that can be trained in a fraction of the time of others. Explicitly tailoring the representations for the task leads to further improvements. Moreover, an ensemble of all representations achieves the best results, suggesting their complementarity."

        "Word representations derived from unlabeled text have proven useful for many NLP tasks, e.g., part-of-speech (POS) tagging (Huang et al., 2014), named entity recognition (Miller et al., 2004), chunking (Turian et al., 2010), and syntactic parsing (Koo et al., 2008; Finkel et al., 2008; Täckström et al., 2012). Most word representations fall into one of two categories. Discrete representations consist of memberships in a (possibly hierarchical) hard clustering of words, e.g., via k-means or the Brown et al. (1992) algorithm. Continuous representations (or distributed representations or embeddings) consist of low-dimensional, real-valued vectors for each word, typically in-duced via neural language models (Bengio et al., 2003; Mnih and Hinton, 2007) or spectral methods (Deerwester et al., 1990; Dhillon et al., 2011).",
        "Koo et al. (2008) found improvement on in-domain dependency parsing using features based on discrete Brown clusters. In this paper, we experiment with parsing features derived from continuous representations. We find that simple at-tempts based on discretization of individual word vector dimensions do not improve parsing. We see gains only after first performing a hierarchical clustering of the continuous word vectors and then using features based on the hierarchy.",
        "We compare several types of continuous representations, including those made available by other researchers (Turian et al., 2010; Collobert et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2012), and embeddings we have trained using the approach of Mikolov et al. (2013a), which is orders of magnitude faster than the others. The representations exhibit different characteristics, which we demonstrate using both intrinsic metrics and extrinsic parsing evaluation. We report significant improvements over our baseline on both the Penn Treebank (PTB; Marcus et al., 1993) and the English Web treebank (Petrov and McDonald, 2012).",
        "While all embeddings yield some parsing improvements, we find larger gains by tailoring them to capture similarity in terms of context within syntactic parses. To this end, we use two simple modifications to the models of Mikolov et al. (2013a): a smaller context window, and conditioning on syntactic context (dependency links and labels). Interestingly, the Brown clusters of Koo et al. (2008) prove to be difficult to beat, but we find that our syntactic tailoring can lead to embeddings that match the parsing performance of Brown (on all test sets) in a fraction of the training time. Finally, a simple parser ensemble on all the representations achieves the best results, suggesting their complementarity for dependency parsing."

        "Below, we describe embeddings that we train ourselves (§2.1), aiming to make them more useful for parsing via smaller context windows (§2.1.1) and conditioning on syntactic context (§2.1.2). We then compare the representations using two intrinsic metrics (§2.2). 2.1 Syntactically-tailored Representations We train word embeddings using the continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) and skip-gram (SKIP) models described in Mikolov et al. (2013a; 2013b) as implemented in the open-source toolkit word2vec. These models avoid hidden layers in the neural network and hence can be trained in only minutes, compared to days or even weeks for the others, as shown in Table 1.1",
        "We adapt these embeddings to be more useful for dependency parsing in two ways, described next. 2.1.1 Smaller Context Windows The CBOW model learns vectors to predict a word given its set of surrounding context words in a window of size w. The SKIP model learns embeddings to predict each individual surrounding word given one particular word, using an analogous window size w. We find that w affects the embeddings substantially: with large w, words group with others that are topically-related; with small w, grouped words tend to share the same POS tag. We discuss this further in the intrinsic evaluation presented in §2.2.",
        "1",
        "We train both models on BLLIP (LDC2000T43) with PTB removed, the same corpus used by Koo et al. (2008) to train their BROWN clusters. We created a special vector for unknown words by averaging the vectors for the 50K least frequent words; we did not use this vector for the SKIPDEP (§2.1.2) setting because it performs slightly better without it. 2.1.2 Syntactic Context We expect embeddings to help dependency parsing the most when words that have similar parents and children are close in the embedding space. To target this type of similarity, we train the SKIP model on dependency context instead of the linear context in raw text. When ordinarily training SKIP embeddings, words v′",
        "are drawn from the neighborhood of a target word v, and the sum of logprobabilities of each v′",
        "given v is maximized. We propose to instead choose v′",
        "from the set contain-ing the grandparent, parent, and children words of v in an automatic dependency parse.",
        "A simple way to implement this idea is to train the original SKIP model on a corpus of dependency links and labels. For this, we parse the BLLIP corpus (minus PTB) using our baseline dependency parser, then build a corpus in which each line contains a single child word c, its parent word p, its grandparent g, and the dependency label l of the ⟨c, p⟩ link:",
        "“ l<L> g<G> p c l<L>”, that is, both the dependency label and grandparent word are subscripted with a special token to avoid collision with words.2",
        "We train the SKIP model on this corpus of tuples with window size w = 1, denoting the result SKIPDEP. Note that this approach needs a parsed corpus, but there also already exist such resources (Napoles et al., 2012; Goldberg and Orwant, 2013). 2.2 Intrinsic Evaluation of Representations Short of running end-to-end parsing experiments, how can we choose which representations to use for parsing tasks? Several methods have been proposed for intrinsic evaluation of word representa-",
        "2",
        "We use a subscript on g so that it will be treated differently from c when considering the context of p. We removed all g<G> from the vocabulary after training. We also tried adding information about POS tags. This increases M-1 (§2.2), but harms parsing performance, likely because the embeddings become too tag-like. Similar ideas have been used for clustering (Sagae and Gordon, 2009; Haffari et al., 2011; Grave et al., 2013), semantic space models (Padó and Lapata, 2007), and topic modeling (Boyd-Graber and Blei, 2008). 810 Representation SIM M-1 BROWN – 89.3 SENNA 49.8 85.2 TURIAN 29.5 87.2 HUANG 62.6 78.1 CBOW, w = 2 34.7 84.8 SKIP, w = 1 37.8 86.6 SKIP, w = 2 43.1 85.8 SKIP, w = 5 44.4 81.1 SKIP, w = 10 44.6 71.5 SKIPDEP 34.6 88.3 Table 2: Intrinsic evaluation of representations.

(2002). We compute cosine similarity between the two vectors in each word pair, then order the word pairs by similarity and compute Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (ρ) with the gold similarities. Em-beddings with high ρ capture similarity in terms of paraphrase and topical relationships. Clustering-based tagging accuracy (M-1): In-tuitively, we expect embeddings to help parsing the most if they can tell us when two words are similar syntactically. To this end, we use a metric based on unsupervised evaluation of POS taggers. We perform clustering and map each cluster to one POS tag so as to maximize tagging accuracy, where multiple clusters can map to the same tag. We cluster vectors corresponding to the to-kens in PTB WSJ sections 00-21.3",
        "Table 2 shows these metrics for representations used in this paper. The BROWN clusters have the highest M-1, indicating high cluster purity in terms of POS tags. The HUANG embeddings have the highest SIM score but low M-1, presumably because they were trained with global context, making them more tuned to capture topical similarity. We compare several values for the window size (w) used when training the SKIP embeddings, finding that smallw leads to higher M-1 and lower SIM.

        "We now discuss the features that we add to our baseline dependency parser (second-order MSTParser; McDonald and Pereira, 2006) based on discrete and continuous representations. 3.1 Brown Cluster Features We start by replicating the features of Koo et al. (2008) using their BROWN clusters; each word is represented by a 0-1 bit string indicating the path from the root to the leaf in the binary merge tree. We follow Koo et al. in adding cluster versions of the first- and second-order features in MSTParser, using bit string prefixes of the head, argument, sibling, intermediate words, etc., to augment or replace the POS and lexical identity information. We tried various sets of prefix lengths on the development set and found the best setting to use prefixes of length 4, 6, 8, and 12.5 3.2 Continuous Representation Features We tried two kinds of indicator features: Bucket features: For both parent and child vectors in a potential dependency, we fire one indicator feature per dimension of each embedding",

(2008) is different from the second-order MSTParser that we use here; their parser allows grandparent interactions in addition to the sibling interactions in ours. We use their clusters, available at http://people. csail.mit.edu/maestro/papers/bllip-clusters.gz. 811 vector, where the feature consists of the dimension index d and a bucketed version of the embedding value in that dimension, i.e., bucket k(Evd) for word index v and dimension d, where E is the V × D embedding matrix.6",
        "We also tried standard conjunction variants of this feature consisting of the bucket values of both the head and argument along with their POS-tag or word information, and the attachment distance and direction.7 Cluster bit string features: To take into account all dimensions simultaneously, we perform agglomerative hierarchical clustering of the embedding vectors. We use Ward’s minimum variance algorithm (Ward, 1963) for cluster distance and the Euclidean metric for vector distance (via MAT-LAB’s linkage function with {method=ward, metric=euclidean}). Next, we fire features on the hierarchical clustering bit strings using templates identical to those for BROWN, except that we use longer prefixes as our clustering hierarchies tend to be deeper.8"
