        "Thousands of videos are constantly being uploaded to the web, creating a vast resource, and an ever-growing demand for methods to make them easier to retrieve, search, and index. As it becomes feasible to extract both low-level as well as highlevel (symbolic) audio, speech, and video features from this data, these need to be processed further, in order to learn and extract meaningful relations between these. The language processing community has made huge process in analyzing the vast amounts of very noisy text data that is available on the Internet. While it is very difficult to create semantic units of low-level image descriptors or non-speech sounds by themselves, it is comparatively easy to ground semantics in the word output of a speech recognizer, or text data that is loosely associated with a video. This creates an opportunity for NLP researchers to use their unique skills, and make significant contributions to solve tasks on data that is even noisier than web text, but (we argue) even more interesting and challenging.",
        "This tutorial aims to present to the NLP community the state of the art in audio and video processing, by discussing the most relevant tasks at NIST’s TREC Video Retrieval Evaluation (TRECVID) workshop series. We liken “Semantic Indexing” (SIN) task, in which a system must identify occurrences of concepts such as “desk”, or “dancing” in a video to the word spotting approach. We then proceed to explain more recent, and challenging tasks, “Multimedia Event Detection” (MED) and “Multimedia Event Recounting” (MER), which can be compared to transcription and summarization tasks. Finally, we will present an easy way to get started in multi-media analysis using Virtual Machines from the “Speech Recognition Virtual Kitchen”, which will enable tutorial participants to perform hands-on experiments during the tutorial, and at home."
