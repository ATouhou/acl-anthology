        "Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) usually utilizes contextual information to disambiguate translation candidates. However, it is often limited to contexts within sentence boundaries, hence broader topical information cannot be leveraged. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to learning topic representation for parallel data using a neural network architecture, where abundant topical contexts are embedded via topic relevant monolingual data. By associating each translation rule with the topic representation, topic relevant rules are selected according to the distributional similarity with the source text during SMT decoding.

        "Making translation decisions is a difficult task in many Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems. Current translation modeling approaches usually use context dependent information to disambiguate translation candidates. For example, translation sense disambiguation approaches (Carpuat and Wu, 2005; Carpuat and Wu, 2007) are proposed for phrase-based SMT systems. Meanwhile, for hierarchical phrase-based or syntax-based SMT systems, there is also much work involving rich contexts to guide rule selection (He et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2008; Marton and Resnik, 2008; Xiong et al., 2009). Although these methods are effective and proven successful in many SMT systems, they only leverage within-",

        "This work was done while the first and fourth authors were visiting Microsoft Research. sentence contexts which are insufficient in explor-ing broader information. For example, the word driver often means “the operator of a motor vehicle” in common texts. But in the sentence “Finally, we write the user response to the buffer, i.e., pass it to our driver”, we understand that driver means “computer program”. In this case, people understand the meaning because of the IT topical context which goes beyond sentence-level analysis and requires more relevant knowledge. Therefore, it is important to leverage topic information to learn smarter translation models and achieve better translation performance.",
        "Topic modeling is a useful mechanism for discovering and characterizing various semantic concepts embedded in a collection of documents. Attempts on topic-based translation modeling include topic-specific lexicon translation models (Zhao and Xing, 2006; Zhao and Xing, 2007), topic similarity models for synchronous rules (Xiao et al., 2012), and document-level translation with topic coherence (Xiong and Zhang, 2013). In addition, topic-based approaches have been used in domain adaptation for SMT (Tam et al., 2007; Su et al., 2012), where they view different topics as different domains. One typical property of these approaches in common is that they only utilize parallel data where document boundaries are explicitly given. In this way, the topic of a sentence can be inferred with document-level information using off-the-shelf topic modeling toolkits such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) or Hidden Topic Markov Model (HTMM) (Gruber et al., 2007). Most of them also assume that the input must be in document level. However, this situation does not always happen since there is considerable amount of parallel data which does not have document boundaries. In addition, contemporary SMT systems often works on sentence level rather than document level due to the efficiency. Although we can easily apply LDA at the 133 sentence level, it is quite difficult to infer the topic accurately with only a few words in the sentence. This makes previous approaches inefficient when applied them in real-world commercial SMT systems. Therefore, we need to devise a systematical approach to enriching the sentence and inferring its topic more accurately.",
        "In this paper, we propose a novel approach to learning topic representations for sentences. Since the information within the sentence is insufficient for topic modeling, we first enrich sentence contexts via Information Retrieval (IR) methods using content words in the sentence as queries, so that topic-related monolingual documents can be collected. These topic-related documents are utilized to learn a specific topic representation for each sentence using a neural network based approach. Neural network is an effective technique for learning different levels of data representations. The levels inferred from neural network correspond to distinct levels of concepts, where high-level representations are obtained from low-level bag-of-words input. It is able to detect correlations among any subset of input features through non-linear transformations, which demonstrates the superior-ity of eliminating the effect of noisy words which are irrelevant to the topic. Our problem fits well into the neural network framework and we expect that it can further improve inferring the topic representations for sentences.",
        "To incorporate topic representations as translation knowledge into SMT, our neural network based approach directly optimizes similarities between the source language and target language in a compact topic space. This underlying topic space is learned from sentence-level parallel data in or-der to share topic information across the source and target languages as much as possible. Additionally, our model can be discriminatively trained with a large number of training instances, without expensive sampling methods such as in LDA or HTMM, thus it is more practicable and scalable. Finally, we associate the learned representation to each bilingual translation rule. Topic-related rules are selected according to distributional similarity with the source text, which helps hypotheses generation in SMT decoding. We integrate topic similarity features in the log-linear model and evaluate the performance on the NIST Chinese-to-English translation task. Experimental results demonstrate that our model significantly improves translation accuracy over a state-of-the-art baseline."

        "Deep learning is an active topic in recent years which has triumphed in many machine learning research areas. This technique began raising public awareness in the mid-2000s after researchers showed how a multi-layer feed-forward neural network can be effectively trained. The training procedure often involves two phases: a layer-wise unsupervised pre-training phase and a supervised fine-tuning phase. For pre-training, Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) (Hinton et al., 2006), auto-encoding (Bengio et al., 2006) and sparse coding (Lee et al., 2006) are most frequently used. Unsupervised pre-training trains the network one layer at a time and helps guide the parameters of the layer towards better regions in parameter space (Bengio, 2009). Followed by fine-tuning in this parameter region, deep learning is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance in various research areas, including breakthrough results on the ImageNet dataset for objective recognition (Krizhevsky et al., 2012), significant error reduc-tion in speech recognition (Dahl et al., 2012), etc.",
        "Deep learning has also been successfully applied in a variety of NLP tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, chunking, named entity recognition, semantic role labeling (Collobert et al., 2011), parsing (Socher et al., 2011a), sentiment analysis (Socher et al., 2011b), etc. Most NLP research converts a high-dimensional and sparse binary representation into a low-dimensional and real-valued representation. This low-dimensional representation is usually learned from huge amount of monolingual texts in the pre-training phase, and then fine-tuned towards task-specific criterion. Inspired by previous successful research, we first learn sentence representations using topic-related monolingual texts in the pre-training phase, and then optimize the bilingual similarity by leveraging sentence-level parallel data in the fine-tuning phase."

Given a parallel sentence pair ⟨f, e⟩, the first step is to treat f and e as queries, and use IR methods to retrieve relevant documents to enrich contextual information for them. Specifically, the ranking model we used is a Vector Space Model (VSM), where the query and document are converted into tf-idf weighted vectors. The most relevant N documents df and de are retrieved and converted to a high-dimensional, bag-of-words input f and e for the representation learning1",

        "There are two phases in our neural network training process: pre-training and fine-tuning. In the pre-training phase (Section 3.1), we build two neural networks with the same structure but different parameters to learn a low-dimensional representation for sentences in two different languages. Then, in the fine-tuning phase (Section 3.2), our model directly optimizes the similarity of two low-dimensional representations, so that it highly correlates to SMT decoding. Finally, the learned representation is used to calculate similarities which are integrated as features in SMT decoding procedure (Section 3.3). 3.1 Pre-training using denoising auto-encoder In the pre-training phase, we leverage neural network structures to transform high-dimensional sparse vectors to low-dimensional dense vectors. The topic similarity is calculated on top of the learned dense vectors. This dense representation should preserve the information from the bag-of-",

Therefore, we use a specially designed mechanism called auto-encoder to solve this problem. Auto-encoder (Bengio et al., 2006) is one of the basic building blocks of deep learning. Assuming that the input is a n-of-V binary vector x representing the bag-of-words (V is the vocabulary size), an auto-encoder consists of an encoding process g(x) and a decoding process h(g(x)). The objective of the auto-encoder is to minimize the reconstruction error L(h(g(x)), x). Our goal is to learn a low-dimensional vector which can preserve information from the original n-of-V vector.",
        "One problem with auto-encoder is that it treats all words in the same way, making no distinguishment between function words and content words. The representation learned by auto-encoders tends to be influenced by the function words, thereby it is not robust. To alleviate this problem, Vincent et al. (2008) proposed the Denoising Auto-Encoder (DAE), which aims to reconstruct a clean, “repaired” input from a corrupted, partially destroyed vector. This is done by corrupting the initial input x to get a partially destroyed version x̃. DAE is capable of capturing the global structure of the input while ignoring the noise. In our task, for each sentence, we treat the retrieved N relevant documents as a single large document and convert it to a bag-of-words vector x in Figure 2. With DAE, the input x is manually corrupted by apply-ing masking noise (randomly mask 1 to 0) and getting x̃. Denoising training is considered as “filling in the blanks” (Vincent et al., 2010), which means the masking components can be recovered from the non-corrupted components. For example, in IT related texts, if the word driver is masked, it should be predicted through hidden units in neural networks by active signals such as “buffer”, “user response”, etc.",
        "In our case, the encoding process transforms the corrupted input x̃ into g(x̃) with two layers: a linear layer connected with a non-linear layer. Assuming that the dimension of the g(x̃) is L, the linear layer forms a L × V matrix W which projects the n-of-V vector to a L-dimensional hidden layer. After the bag-of-words input has been transformed, they are fed into a subsequent layer to model the highly non-linear relations among words:",

        "The decoding process consists of a linear layer and a non-linear layer with similar network structures, but different parameters. It transforms the L-dimensional vector g(x̃) to a V -dimensional vector h(g(x̃)). To minimize reconstruction error with respect to x̃, we define the loss function as the L2-norm of the difference between the uncorrupted input and reconstructed input: L(h(g(x̃)), x) = ∥h(g(x̃)) − x∥2 (3)",
        "Multi-layer neural networks are trained with the standard back-propagation algorithm (Rumelhart et al., 1988). The gradient of the loss function is calculated and back-propagated to the previous layer to update its parameters. Training neural networks involves many factors such as the learning rate and the length of hidden layers. We will discuss the optimization of these parameters in Section 4. 3.2 Fine-tuning with parallel data In the fine-tuning phase, we stack another layer on top of the two low-dimensional vectors to maximize the similarity between source and target languages. The similarity scores are integrated into the standard log-linear model for making translation decisions. Since the vectors from DAE are trained using information from monolingual training data independently, these vectors may be in-adequate to measure bilingual topic similarity due to their different topic spaces. Therefore, in this stage, parallel sentence pairs are used to help connecting the vectors from different languages because they express the same topic. In fact, the objective of fine-tuning is to discover a latent topic space which is shared by both languages as much as possible. This shared topic space is particularly useful when the SMT decoder tries to match the source texts and translation candidates in the target language.",
        "Given a parallel sentence pair ⟨f, e⟩, the DAE learns representations for f and e respectively, as zf = g(f) and ze = g(e) in Figure 1. We then take two vectors as the input to calculate their similarity. Consequently, the whole neural network can be fine-tuned towards the supervised criteria with the help of parallel data. The similarity score of the representation pair ⟨zf , ze⟩ is defined as the cosine similarity of the two vectors: sim(f, e) = cos(zf , ze) = zf · ze ∥zf ∥∥ze∥ (4)",
        "Since a parallel sentence pair should have the same topic, our goal is to maximize the similarity score between the source sentence and target sentence.

The learned neural networks are used to obtain sentence topic representations, which will be further leveraged to infer topic representations of bilingual translation rules. 3.3 Integration into SMT decoding We incorporate the learned topic similarity scores into the standard log-linear framework for SMT. When a synchronous rule ⟨α, γ⟩ is extracted from a sentence pair ⟨f, e⟩, a triple instance I = (⟨α, γ⟩, ⟨f, e⟩, c) is collected for inferring the topic representation of ⟨α, γ⟩, where c is the count of rule occurrence. Following (Chiang, 2007), we give a count of one for each phrase pair occurrence and a fractional count for each hierarchical phrase pair.

        "By measuring the similarity between the source texts and bilingual translation rules, the SMT decoder is able to encourage topic relevant translation candidates and penalize topic irrelevant candidates. Therefore, it helps to train a smarter translation model with the embedded topic information. Given a source sentence s to be translated, we define the similarity as follows: Sim(zs, zα) = cos(zs, zα) (9) Sim(zs, zγ) = cos(zs, zγ) (10) where zs is the topic representation of s. The similarity calculated against zα or zγ denotes the source-to-source or the source-to-target similarity.",
        "We also consider the topic sensitivity estimation since general rules have flatter distributions while topic-specific rules have sharper distributions. A standard entropy metric is used to measure the sensitivity of the source-side of ⟨α, γ⟩ as: Sen(α) = − |zα| ∑ i=1 zαi × log zαi (11) where zαi is a component in the vector zα. The target-side sensitivity Sen(γ) can be calculated in a similar way. The larger the sensitivity is, the more topic-specific the rule manifests.",

        "Another important factor is the length of hidden layers L in the network. In deep learning, this parameter is often empirically tuned with human efforts. As shown in Figure 3, the translation accuracy is better when L is relatively small. Actually, there is no obvious distinction of the performance when L is less than 600. However, when L equals 1,000, the translation accuracy is inferior to other settings. The main reason is that parameters in the neural networks are too many to be effectively trained. As we know when L=1000, there are a total of 100, 000 × 1, 000 parameters between the linear and non-linear layers in the network. Limited training data prevents the model from getting close to the global optimum. Therefore, the model is likely to fall in local optima and lead to unacceptable representations. 4.4 Effect of topic related features We evaluate the performance of adding new topic-related features to the log-linear model and compare the translation accuracy with the method in (Xiao et al., 2012). To make different methods comparable, we set the dimension of topic representation as 100 for all settings. This takes 10 hours in pre-training phase and 22 hours in fine-tuning phase. Table 2 shows how the accuracy is improved with more features added. The results confirm that topic information is indispensable for SMT since both (Xiao et al., 2012) and our neural network based method significantly outperforms the baseline system. Our method improves 0.86 BLEU points at most and 0.76 BLEU points on average over the baseline. We observe that source-side similarity is more effective than target-side similarity, but their contributions are cumulative. This proves that bilingually induced topic representation with neural network helps the SMT system disambiguate translation candidates. Further-more, rule sensitivity features improve SMT performance compared with only using similarity features. Because topic-specific rules usually have a larger sensitivity score, they can beat general rules when they obtain the same similarity score against the input sentence. Finally, when all new features are integrated, the performance is the best, preforming substantially better than (Xiao et al., 2012) with 0.39 BLEU points on average.",
        "It is worth mentioning that the performance of (Xiao et al., 2012) is similar to the settings with N =1 and L=100 in Figure 3. This is not simply coincidence since we can interpret their approach as a special case in our neural network method: when a parallel sentence pair has 139 Settings NIST 2004 NIST 2005 NIST 2006 NIST 2008 Average Baseline 42.25 41.21 38.05 31.16 38.17 (Xiao et al., 2012) 42.58 41.61 38.39 31.58 38.54 Sim(Src) 42.51 41.55 38.53 31.57 38.54 Sim(Trg) 42.43 41.48 38.4 31.49 38.45 Sim(Src+Trg) 42.7 41.66 38.66 31.66 38.67 Sim(Src+Trg)+Sen(Src) 42.77 41.81 38.85 31.73 38.79 Sim(Src+Trg)+Sen(Trg) 42.85 41.79 38.76 31.7 38.78 Sim(Src+Trg)+Sen(Src+Trg) 42.95 41.97 38.91 31.88 38.93 Table 2: Effectiveness of different features in BLEU% (p < 0.05), with N =10 and L=100. “Sim” denotes the rule similarity feature and “Sen” denotes rule sensitivity feature. “Src” and “Trg” means utilizing source-side/target-side rule topic vectors to calculate similarity or sensitivity, respectively. The “Average” setting is the averaged result of four datasets. document-level information, that document will be retrieved for training; otherwise, the most relevant document will be retrieved from the monolingual data. Therefore, our method can be viewed as a more general framework than previous LDA-based approaches. 4.5 Discussion In this section, we give a case study to explain why our method works. An example of translation rule disambiguation for a sentence from the NIST 2005 dataset is shown in Figure 4. We find that the topic of this sentence is about “rescue after a natural disaster”. Under this topic, the Chinese rule “ 发送 X” should be translated to “deliver X” or “distribute X”. However, the baseline system prefers “send X” rather than those two candidates. Although the translation probability of “send X” is much higher, it is inappropriate in this context since it is usually used in IT texts. For example, ⟨发送邮件, send emails⟩, ⟨发送信息, send messages⟩ and ⟨发送数据, send data⟩. In contrast, with our neural network based approach, the learned topic distributions of “deliver X” or “distribute X” are more similar with the input sentence than “send X”, which is shown in Figure 4. The similarity scores indicate that “deliver X” and “distribute X” are more appropriate to translate the sentence. Therefore, adding topic-related features is able to keep the topic consistency and substantially improve the translation accuracy."

We enrich contexts of parallel sentence pairs with topic related monolingual data and obtain a set of documents to represent sentences. These documents are converted to a bag-of-words input and fed into neural networks. The learned low-dimensional vector is used to obtain the topic representations of synchronous rules. In SMT decoding, appropriate rules are selected to best match source texts according to their similarity in the topic space. Experimental results show that our approach is promising for SMT systems to learn a better translation model. It is a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art Hiero system, as well as a conventional LDA-based method.",

Since the translation of the current sentence is usually influenced by the topic of previous sentences, we plan to leverage recurrent neural networks to model this phenomenon, where the history translation information is naturally combined in the model."
