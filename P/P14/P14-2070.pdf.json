        "While many lexica annotated with words polarity are available for sentiment analysis, very few tackle the harder task of emotion analysis and are usually quite limited in coverage. In this paper, we present a novel approach for extracting – in a totally automated way – a high-coverage and high-precision lexicon of roughly 37 thousand terms annotated with emotion scores, called DepecheMood. Our approach exploits in an original way ‘crowd-sourced’ affective annotation implicitly provided by readers of news articles from rappler.com. By providing new state-of-the-art performances in unsupervised settings for regression and classification tasks, even using a naı̈ve approach, our experiments show the beneficial impact of harvesting social media data for affective lexicon building."

      "title": "1 Introduction",
      "paragraphs": [
        "Sentiment analysis has proved useful in several application scenarios, for instance in buzz monitor-ing – the marketing technique for keeping track of consumer responses to services and products – where identifying positive and negative customer experiences helps to assess product and service demand, tackle crisis management, etc.",
        "On the other hand, the use of finer-grained models, accounting for the role of individual emotions, is still in its infancy. The simple division in ‘positive’ vs. ‘negative’ comments may not suffice, as in these examples: ‘ I’m so miserable, I dropped my IPhone in the water and now it’s not working anymore’ ( SADNESS) vs. ‘ I am very upset, my new IPhone keeps not working!’ ( ANGER). While both texts express a negative sentiment, the latter, connected to anger, is more relevant for buzz monitor-ing. Thus, emotion analysis represents a natural evolution of sentiment analysis.",
        "Many approaches to sentiment analysis make use of lexical resources – i.e. lists of positive and negative words – often deployed as baselines or as features for other methods, usually machine learn-ing based (Liu and Zhang, 2012). In these lexica, words are associated with their prior polarity, i.e. whether such word out of context evokes something positive or something negative. For example, wonderful has a positive connotation – prior polarity – while horrible has a negative one.",
        "The quest for a high precision and high coverage lexicon, where words are associated with either sentiment or emotion scores, has several reasons. First, it is fundamental for tasks such as affective modification of existing texts, where words’ polarity together with their score are necessary for creating multiple graded variations of the original text (Inkpen et al., 2006; Guerini et al., 2008; Whitehead and Cavedon, 2010).",
        "Second, considering word order makes a difference in sentiment analysis. This calls for a role of compositionality, where the score of a sentence is computed by composing the scores of the words up in the syntactic tree. Works worth mention-ing in this connection are: Socher et al. (2013), which uses recursive neural networks to learn compositional rules for sentiment analysis, and (Neviarouskaya et al., 2009; Neviarouskaya et al., 2011) which exploit hand-coded rules to compose the emotions expressed by words in a sentence. In this respect, compositional approaches represent a new promising trend, since all other approaches, either using semantic similarity or Bag-of-Words (BOW) based machine-learning, cannot handle, for example, cases of texts with same wording but different words order: “The dangerous killer escaped one month ago, but recently he was arrested” (RELIEF, HAPPYNESS) vs. “The dangerous killer was arrested one month ago, but re-427 cently he escaped” (FEAR). The work in (Wang and Manning, 2012) partially accounts for this problem and argues that using word bigram features allows improving over BOW based methods, where words are taken as features in isola-tion. This way it is possible to capture simple compositional phenomena like polarity reversing in “killing cancer”.",
        "Finally, tasks such as copywriting, where evocative names are a key element to a successful product (Ozbal and Strapparava, 2012; Ozbal et al., 2012) require exhaustive lists of emotion related words. In such cases no context is given and the brand name alone, with its perceived prior polarity, is responsible for stating the area of competition and evoking semantic associations. For example Mitsubishi changed the name of one of its SUVs for the Spanish market, since the original name Pajero had a very negative prior polarity, as it means ‘wanker’ in Spanish (Piller, 2003). Evok-ing emotions is also fundamental for a successful name: consider names of a perfume like Obsession, or technological products like MacBook air.",
        "In this work, we aim at automatically producing a high coverage and high precision emotion lexicon using distributional semantics, with numerical scores associated with each emotion, like it has already been done for sentiment analysis. To this end, we take advantage in an original way of massive crowd-sourced affective annotations associated with news articles, obtained by crawl-ing the rappler.com social news network. We also evaluate our lexicon by integrating it in unsupervised classification and regression settings for emotion recognition. Results indicate that the use of our resource, even if automatically acquired, is highly beneficial in affective text recognition."

        "Within the broad field of sentiment analysis, we hereby provide a short review of research efforts put towards building sentiment and emotion lexica, regardless of the approach in which such lists are then used (machine learning, rule based or deep learning). A general overview can be found in (Pang and Lee, 2008; Liu and Zhang, 2012; Wilson et al., 2004; Paltoglou et al., 2010).",
        "Sentiment Lexica. In recent years there has been an increasing focus on producing lists of words (lexica) with prior polarities, to be used in sentiment analysis. When building such lists, a trade-off between coverage of the resource and its precision is to be found.",
        "One of the most well-known resources is Senti-WordNet (SWN) (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006; Baccianella et al., 2010), in which each entry is associated with the numerical scores Pos(s) and Neg(s), ranging from 0 to 1. These scores – automatically assigned starting from a bunch of seed terms – represent the positive and negative valence (or posterior polarity) of each entry, that takes the form lemma#pos#sense-number. Starting from SWN, several prior polarities for words (SWN-prior), in the form lemma#PoS, can be computed (e.g. considering only the first-sense, averaging on all the senses, etc.). These approaches, detailed in (Guerini et al., 2013), produce a list of 155k words, where the lower precision given by the automatic scoring of SWN is compensated by the high coverage.",
        "Another widely used resource is ANEW (Bradley and Lang, 1999), providing valence scores for 1k words, which were manually assigned by several annotators. This resource has a low coverage, but the precision is maximized. Similarly, the SO-CAL entries (Taboada et al., 2011) were manually tagged by a small number of annotators with a multi-class label (from very negative to very positive). These ratings were further validated through crowdsourcing, ending up with a list of roughly 4k words. More recently, a resource that replicated ANEW annotation approach using crowdsourcing, was released (Warriner et al., 2013), providing sentiment scores for 14k words. Interestingly, this resource annotates the most frequent words in English, so, even if lexicon coverage is still far lower than SWN-prior, it grants a high coverage, with human precision, of language use.",
        "Finally, the General Inquirer lexicon (Stone et al., 1966) provides a binary classification (positive/negative) of 4k sentiment-bearing words, while the resource in (Wilson et al., 2005) expands the General Inquirer to 6k words.",
        "Emotion Lexica. Compared to sentiment lexica, far less emotion lexica have been produced, and all have lower coverage. One of the most used resources is WordNetAffect (Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004) which contains manually assigned affective labels to WordNet synsets (ANGER, JOY, FEAR, etc.). It currently provides 900 annotated synsets and 1.6k words in the form 428",

        "To build our emotion lexicon we harvested all the news articles from rappler.com, as of June 3rd 2013: the final dataset consists of 13.5 M words over 25.3 K documents, with an average of 530 words per document. For each document, along with the text we also harvested the information displayed by Rappler’s Mood Meter, a small interface offering the readers the opportunity to click on the emotion that a given Rappler story made them feel. The idea behind the Mood Meter is actually “getting people to crowdsource the mood for the day”1",
        ", and returning the percentage of votes for each emotion label for a given story. This way, hundreds of thousands votes have been collected since the launch of the service. In our novel approach to ‘crowdsourcing’, as compared to other NLP tasks that rely on tools like Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (Snow et al., 2008), the subjects are aware of the ‘implicit annotation task’ but they are not paid. From this data, we built a document-by-emotion matrix MDE, providing the voting percentages for each document in the eight 1 http://nie.mn/QuD17Z affective dimensions available in Rappler. An excerpt is provided in Table 1.",
        "The idea of using documents annotated with emotions is not new (Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2008; Mishne, 2005; Bellegarda, 2010), but these works had the limitation of providing a single emotion label per document, rather than a score for each emotion, and, moreover, the annotation was performed by the author of the document alone.",
        "Table 2 reports the average percentage of votes for each emotion on the whole corpus: HAPPI-NESS has a far higher percentage of votes (at least three times). There are several possible explanations, out of the scope of the present paper, for this bias: (i) it is due to cultural characteristics of the audience (ii) the bias is in the dataset itself, being formed mainly by ‘positive’ news; (iii) it is a psychological phenomenon due to the fact that people tend to express more positive moods on social networks (Quercia et al., 2011; Vittengl and Holt, 1998; De Choudhury et al., 2012). In any case, the predominance of happy mood has been found in other datasets, for instance LiveJournal.com posts (Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2008).

        "To evaluate the performance we can obtain with our lexicon, we use the public dataset provided for the SemEval 2007 task on ‘Affective Text’ (Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2007). The task was focused on emotion recognition in one thousand news headlines, both in regression and classification settings. Headlines typically consist of a few 2 In French, ‘depeche’ means dispatch/news. words and are often written with the intention to ‘provoke’ emotions so to attract the readers’ atten-tion. An example of headline from the dataset is the following: “Iraq car bombings kill 22 People, wound more than 60”. For the regression task the values provided are: <anger (0.32), disgust (0.27), fear (0.84), joy (0.0), sadness (0.95), surprise (0.20)> while for the classification task the labels provided are {FEAR, SADNESS}.",
        "This dataset is of interest to us since the ‘compositional’ problem is less prominent given the simplified syntax of news headlines, containing, for example, fewer adverbs (like negations or in-tensifiers) than normal sentences (Turchi et al., 2012). Furthermore, this is to our knowledge the only dataset available providing numerical scores for emotions. Finally, this dataset was meant for unsupervised approaches (just a small trial sample was provided), so to avoid simple text categoriza-tion approaches.",
        "As the affective dimensions present in the test set – based on the six basic emotions model (Ekman and Friesen, 1971) – do not exactly match with the ones provided by Rappler’s Mood Meter, we first define a mapping between the two when possible, see Table 4. Then, we proceed to trans-form the test headlines to the lemma#PoS format.

In Table 5 we report the coverage of some Sentiment and Emotion Lexica of different sizes on the same dataset. Similar to Warriner et al.

        "Since our primary goal is to assess the quality of DepecheMood we first focus on the regression task. We do so by using a very naı̈ve approach, similar to “WordNetAffect presence” discussed in (Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2008): for each headline, we simply compute a value, for any affective dimension, by averaging the corresponding affective scores –obtained from DepecheMood- of all lemma#PoS present in the headline.",

Considering the naı̈ve approach we used, we can reasonably conclude that the quality and coverage of our resource are the reason of such results, and that adopting more complex approaches (i.e. compositionality) can possibly further improve performances in text-based emotion recognition.",

We believe that the wealth of information provided by social media can be harnessed to build models and resources for emotion recognition from text, going a step beyond sentiment analysis. Our future work will include testing Singular Value Decomposi-tion on the word-by-document matrices, allowing to propagate emotions values for a document to similar words non present in the document itself, and the study of perceived mood effects on virality indices and readers engagement by exploiting tweets, likes, reshares and comments.",
