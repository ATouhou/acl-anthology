        "Vector space word representations are useful for many natural language processing applications. The diversity of techniques for computing vector representations and the large number of evaluation benchmarks makes reliable comparison a tedious task both for researchers developing new vector space models and for those wishing to use them. We present a website and suite of offline tools that that facilitate evaluation of word vectors on standard lexical semantics benchmarks and permit exchange and archival by users who wish to find good vectors for their applications. The system is accessible at: www.wordvectors.org."

      "title": "1 Introduction",
      "paragraphs": [
        "Data-driven learning of vector-space word embeddings that capture lexico-semantic properties is a technique of central importance in natural language processing. Using co-occurrence statistics from a large corpus of text (Deerwester et al., 1990; Turney and Pantel, 2010), it is possible to construct high-quality semantic vectors — as judged by both correlations with human judgements of semantic relatedness (Turney, 2006; Agirre et al., 2009) and as features for downstream applications (Turian et al., 2010). A number of approaches that use the internal representations from models of word sequences (Collobert and Weston, 2008) or continuous bags-of-context wordsets (Mikolov et al., 2013) to arrive at vector representations have also been shown to likewise capture co-occurrence tendencies and meanings.",
        "With an overwhelming number of techniques to obtain word vector representations the task of comparison and choosing the vectors best suitable for a particular task becomes difficult. This is further aggravated by the large number of existing lexical semantics evaluation benchmarks being constructed by the research community. For example, to the best of our knowledge, for evaluat-ing word similarity between a given pair of words, there are currently at least 10 existing benchmarks1",
        "that are being used by researchers to prove the effectiveness of their word vectors.",
        "In this paper we describe an online application that provides the following utilities:",
        "• Access to a suite of word similarity evaluation benchmarks • Evaluation of user computed word vectors • Visualizing word vectors in R2",
        "• Evaluation and comparison of the available open-source vectors on the suite",
        "• Submission of user vectors for exhaustive offline evaluation and leader board ranking",
        "• Publicly available repository of word vectors with performance details",
        "Availability of such an evaluation system will help in enabling better consistency and uniformity in evaluation of word vector representations as well as provide an easy to use interface for endusers in a similar spirit to Socher et al. (2013a), a website for text classification.2",
        "Apart from the online demo version, we also provide a software that can be run in an offline mode on the command line. Both the online and offline tools will be kept updated with continuous addition of new relevant tasks and vectors. 1 www.wordvectors.org/suite.php 2 www.etcml.com 19"

        "dataset (Finkelstein et al., 2001) containing 353 pairs of English words that have been assigned similarity ratings by humans. This data was further divided into two fragments by Agirre et al. (2009) who claimed that similarity (WS-SIM) and relatedness (WS-REL)4",
        "are two different kinds of relations and should be dealt with separately. The fourth and fifth benchmarks are the RG-65 (Rubenstein and Goodenough, 1965) and the MC-30 (Miller and Charles, 1991) datasets that contain 65 and 30 pairs of nouns respectively and have been given similarity rankings by humans. These differ from WS-353 in that it contains only nouns whereas the former contains all kinds of words.",
        "The sixth benchmark is the MTurk-2875 (Radinsky et al., 2011) dataset that constitutes 287 pairs of words and is different from the previous benchmarks in that it has been constructed by crowdsourcing the human similarity ratings using Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT). Similar in spirit is the MTruk-7716",

      "paragraphs": [
        "The existing benchmarks provide ways of vector evaluation in a quantitative setting. To get an idea of what kind of information the vectors encode it is important to see how these vectors represent words in n-dimensional space, where n is the length of the vector. Visualization of high-dimensional data is an important problem in many different domains, and deals with data of widely varying dimensionality. Over the last few decades, a variety of techniques for the visualization of such high-dimensional data have been proposed (de Oliveira and Levkowitz, 2003).",
        "Since visualization in n dimensions is hard when n >= 3, we use the t-SNE (van der Maaten and Hinton, 2008) tool10",
        "to project our vectors into R2",
        ". t-SNE converts high dimensional data set into a matrix of pairwise similarities between individual elements and then provides a way to visualize these distances in a way which is capable of capturing much of the local structure of the high-dimensional data very well, while also revealing global structure such as the presence of clusters at several scales.",

It contains pairs of tuples of word relations that follow a common relation. For example, in England : London :: France : Paris, the two given pairs of words follow the country-capital relation.
