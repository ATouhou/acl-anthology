        "As the web has grown in popularity and scope, so has the promise of collaborative information environments for the joint creation and exchange of knowledge (Jones and Rafaeli, 2000; Sack, 2005). Wikipedia, a wiki-based online encyclopedia, is arguably the best example: its distributed edit-ing environment allows readers to collaborate as content editors and has facilitated the production of over four billion articles1",
        "of surprisingly high quality (Giles, 2005) in English alone since its de-but in 2001.",
        "Existing studies of collaborative knowledge systems have shown, however, that the quality of the generated content (e.g. an encyclopedia article) is highly correlated with the effectiveness of the online collaboration (Kittur and Kraut, 2008; Kraut and Resnick, 2012); fruitful collaboration, in turn, inevitably requires dealing with the disputes and conflicts that arise (Kittur et al., 2007). Unfortunately, human monitoring of the often massive social media and collaboration sites to detect, much less mediate, disputes is not feasible. 1 http://en.wikipedia.org",
        "In this work, we investigate the heretofore novel task of dispute detection in online discussions. Previous work in this general area has analyzed dispute-laden content to discover features correlated with conflicts and disputes (Kittur et al., 2007). Research focused primarily on cues derived from the edit history of the jointly created content (e.g. the number of revisions, their temporal density (Kittur et al., 2007; Yasseri et al., 2012)) and relied on small numbers of manually selected discussions known to involve disputes. In contrast, we investigate methods for the automatic detection, i.e. prediction, of discussions involving disputes. We are also interested in understanding whether, and which, linguistic features of the discussion are important for dispute detection.",
        "Drawing inspiration from studies of human mediation of online conflicts (e.g. Billings and Watts (2010), Kittur et al. (2007), Kraut and Resnick (2012)), we hypothesize that effective methods for dispute detection should take into account the sentiment and opinions expressed by participants in the collaborative endeavor. As a result, we propose a sentiment analysis approach for online dispute detection that identifies the sequence of sentence-level sentiments (i.e. very negative, negative, neutral, positive, very positive) expressed during the discussion and uses them as features in a classifier that predicts the DISPUTE/NON-DISPUTE label for the discussion as a whole. Consider, for example, the snippet in Figure 1 from the Wikipedia Talk page for the article on Philadelphia; it discusses the choice of a picture for the article’s “infobox”. The sequence of almost exclusively negative statements provides evidence of a dispute in this portion of the discussion.",
        "Unfortunately, sentence-level sentiment tagging for this domain is challenging in its own right due to the less formal, often ungrammatical, language and the dynamic nature of online conversations. “ Really, grow up” (segment 3) should 693 1-Emy111: I think everyone is forgetting that my previous image was the lead image for well over a year! ... > Massimo: I’m sorry to say so, but it is grossly over processed... 2-Emy111: i’m glad you paid more money for a camera than I did. congrats... i appreciate your constructive criticism. thank you. > Massimo: I just want to have the best picture as a lead for the article ... 3-Emy111: Wow, I am really enjoying this photography debate...

The start of each set of related turns is numbered; “ >” is an indicator for the reply structure. presumably be tagged as a negative sentence as should the sarcastic sentences “ Sounds good?” (in the same turn) and “ congrats” and “ thank you” (in segment 2). We expect that these, and other, examples will be difficult for the sentence-level classifier unless the discourse context of each sentence is considered. Previous research on sentiment prediction for online discussions, however, focuses on turn-level predictions (Hahn et al., 2006; Yin et al., 2012).2",
        "As the first work that predicts sentence-level sentiment for online discussions, we investigate isotonic Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Mao and Lebanon, 2007) for the sentiment-tagging task as they preserve the advantages of the popular CRF-based sequential tagging models (Lafferty et al., 2001) while providing an efficient mechanism for encoding domain knowledge — in our case, a sentiment lexicon — through isotonic constraints on model parameters.",
        "We evaluate our dispute detection approach using a newly created corpus of discussions from Wikipedia Talk pages (3609 disputes, 3609 non-disputes).3",
        "We find that classifiers that employ the learned sentiment features outperform others that do not. The best model achieves a very promising F1 score of 0.78 and an accuracy of 0.80 on the Wikipedia dispute corpus. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first computational approach to automatically identify online disputes on a dataset of scale. Additional Related Work.

        "We construct the first dispute detection corpus to date; it consists of dispute and non-dispute discussions from Wikipedia Talk pages. Step 1: Get Talk Pages of Disputed Articles. Wikipedia articles are edited by different editors. If an article is observed to have disputes on its talk page, editors can assign dispute tags to the article to flag it for attention. In this research, we are interested in talk pages whose corresponding articles are labeled with the following tags: DISPUTED, TOTALLYDISPUTED, DISPUTED-SECTION, TOTALLYDISPUTED-SECTION, POV. The tags indicate that an article is disputed, or the neutrality of the article is disputed (POV).",

        "Consider a discussion comprised of sequential turns; each turn consists of a sequence of sentences. Our model takes as input the sentences x = {x1, · · · , xn} from a single turn, and outputs the corresponding sequence of sentiment labels y = {y1, · · · , yn}, where yi ∈ O, O = {NN, N, O, P, PP}. The labels in O represent very negative (NN), negative (N), neutral (O), positive (P), and very positive (PP), respectively.",
        "Given that traditional Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001) ignore the ordinal relations among sentiment labels, we choose isotonic CRFs (Mao and Lebanon, 2007) for sentence-level sentiment analysis as they can enforce monotonicity constraints on the parameters consistent with the ordinal structure and domain knowledge (e.g. word-level sentiment conveyed via a lexicon). Concretely, we take a lexicon M = Mp∪Mn, where Mp and Mn are two sets of features (usually words) identified as strongly associated with positive and negative sentiment.

        "We train the sentiment classifier using the Authority and Alignment in Wikipedia Discussions (AAWD) corpus (Bender et al., 2011) on a 5point scale (i.e. NN, N, O, P, PP). AAWD consists of 221 English Wikipedia discussions with positive and negative alignment annotations. Annotators either label each sentence as positive, negative or neutral, or label the full turn. For instances that have only a turn-level label, we assume all sentences have the same label as the turn. We further transform the labels into the five sentiment labels. Sentences annotated as being a positive alignment by at least two annotators are treated as very positive (PP). If a sentence is only selected as positive by one annotator or obtains the label via turn-level annotation, it is positive (P). Very negative (NN) and negative (N) are collected in the same way. All others are neutral (O). Among all 16,501 sentences in AAWD, 1,930 and 1,102 are labeled as NN and N. 532 and 99 of them are PP and P. The other 12,648 are considered neutral. Evaluation. To evaluate the performance of the sentiment tagger, we compare to two baselines. (1) Baseline (Polarity): a sentence is predicted as positive if it has more positive words than negative words, or negative if more negative words are observed. Otherwise, it is neutral.

        "We also compare with two state-of-the-art methods that are used in sentiment prediction for conversations: (1) an SVM (RBF kernel) that is employed for identifying sentiment-bearing sentences (Hassan et al., 2010), and (dis)agreement detection (Yin et al., 2012) in online debates; (2) a Linear CRF for (dis)agreement identification in broadcast conversations (Wang et al., 2011).",

Lexical Features. We first collectunigram and bigram features for each discussion. Topic Features. Articles on specific topics, such as politics or religions, tend to arouse more disputes. We thus extract the category information of the corresponding article for each talk page. We further utilize unigrams and bigrams of the category as topic features. Discussion Features. This type of feature aims to capture the structure of the discussion. Intuitively, the more turns or the more participants a discussion has, the more likely there is a dispute. Meanwhile, participants tend to produce longer utterances when they make arguments. We choose number of turns, number of participants, average number of words in each turn as features. In addition, the frequency of revisions made during the discussion has been shown to be good indicator for controversial articles (Vuong et al., 2008), that are presumably prone to have disputes. Therefore, we encode the number of revisions that happened during the discussion as a feature. Sentiment Features. This set of features encode the sentiment distribution and transition in the discussion. We train our sentiment tagging model on the full AAWD dataset, and run it on the Wikipedia dispute corpus.",
        "Given that consistent negative sentiment flow usually indicates an ongoing dispute, we first extract features from sentiment distribution in the form of number/probability of sentiment per type. We also estimate the sentiment transition probability P (St → St+1) from our predictions, where St and St+1 are sentiment labels for the current sentence and the next. We then have features as number/portion of sentiment transitions per type.",
        "Features described above mostly depict the global sentiment flow in the discussions. We further construct a local version of them, since sentiment distribution may change as discussion proceeds. For example, less positive sentiment can be observed as dispute being escalated. We thus split each discussion into three equal length stages, and create sentiment distribution and transition features for each stage.",

        "After a closer look at the results, we find two main reasons for incorrect predictions. Firstly, sentiment prediction errors get propagated into dispute detection. Due to the limitation of existing general-purpose lexicons, some opinionated dialog-specific terms are hard to catch. For example, “I told you over and over again...” strongly suggests a negative sentiment, but no single word shows negative connotation. Constructing a lexicon tuned for conversational text may improve the performance. Secondly, some dispute discussions are harder to detect than the others due to different dialog structures. For instance, the recalls for dispute discussions of “controversy”, “RFC”, and “resolved” are 0.78, 0.79, and 0.86 respectively. We intend to design models that are able to capture dialog structures in the future work. Sentiment Flow Visualization. We visualize the sentiment flow of two disputed discussions in Figure 2. The plots reveal persistent negative sentiment in unresolved disputes (top). For the resolved dispute (bottom), participants show gratitude when the problem is settled."
