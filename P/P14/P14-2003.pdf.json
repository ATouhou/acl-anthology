        "When humans and artificial agents (e.g. robots) have mismatched perceptions of the shared environment, referential communication between them becomes difficult. To mediate perceptual differences, this paper presents a new approach using probabilistic labeling for referential grounding. This approach aims to integrate different types of evidence from the collaborative referential discourse into a unified scheme. Its probabilistic labeling procedure can generate multiple grounding hypotheses to facilitate follow-up dialogue. Our empirical results have shown the probabilistic labeling approach significantly outperforms a previous graph-matching approach for referential grounding."

      "title": "1 Introduction",
      "paragraphs": [
        "In situated human-robot dialogue, humans and robots have mismatched capabilities of perceiving the shared environment. Thus referential communication between them becomes extremely challenging. To address this problem, our previous work has conducted a simulation-based study to collect a set of human-human conversation data that explain how partners with mismatched perceptions strive to succeed in referential communication (Liu et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2013). Our data have shown that, when conversation partners have mismatched perceptions, they tend to make extra collaborative effort in referential communication. For example, the speaker often refers to the intended object iteratively: first issuing an initial installment, and then refashioning till the hearer identifies the referent correctly. The hearer, on the other hand, often provides useful feedback based on which further refashioning can be made. This data has demonstrated the importance of incorporating collaborative discourse for referential grounding.",
        "Based on this data, as a first step we developed a graph-matching approach for referential grounding (Liu et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2013). This approach uses Attributed Relational Graph to capture collaborative discourse and employs a state-space search algorithm to find proper grounding results. Although it has made meaningful progress in addressing collaborative referential grounding under mismatched perceptions, the state-space search based approach has two major limitations. First, it is neither flexible to obtain multiple grounding hypotheses, nor flexible to incorporate different hypotheses incrementally for follow-up grounding. Second, the search algorithm tends to have a high time complexity for optimal solutions. Thus, the previous approach is not ideal for collaborative and incremental dialogue systems that interact with human users in real time.",
        "To address these limitations, this paper describes a new approach to referential grounding based on probabilistic labeling. This approach aims to integrate different types of evidence from the collaborative referential discourse into a unified probabilistic scheme. It is formulated under the Bayesian reasoning framework to easily support generation and incorporation of multiple grounding hypotheses for follow-up processes. Our empirical results have shown that the probabilistic labeling approach significantly outperforms the state-space search approach in both grounding accuracy and efficiency. This new approach provides a good basis for processing collaborative discourse and enabling collaborative dialogue system in situated referential communication. 13"

        "Previous works on situated referential grounding have mainly focused on computational models that connect linguistic referring expressions to the perceived environment (Gorniak and Roy, 2004; Gorniak and Roy, 2007; Siebert and Schlangen, 2008; Matuszek et al., 2012; Jayant and Thomas, 2013). These works have provided valuable insights on how to manually and/or automatically build key components (e.g., semantic parsing, grounding functions between visual features and words, mapping procedures) for a situated referential grounding system. However, most of these works only dealt with the interpretation of single referring expressions, rather than interrelated expressions in collaborative dialogue.",
        "Some earlier work (Edmonds, 1994; Heeman and Hirst, 1995) proposed a symbolic reasoning (i.e. planning) based approach to incorporate collaborative dialogue. However, in situated settings pure symbolic approaches will not be sufficient and new approaches that are robust to uncertainties need to be pursued. DeVault and Stone (2009) proposed a hybrid approach which combined symbolic reasoning and machine learning for interpreting referential grounding dialogue. But their “environment” was a simplistic block world and the issue of mismatched perceptions was not addressed."

        "Previously, we have collected a set of human-human dialogues on an object-naming task (Liu et al., 2012). To simulate mismatched perceptions between a human and an artificial agent, two participants were shown different versions of an image: the director was shown the original image containing some randomly placed objects (e.g., fruits), and the matcher was shown an impoverished version of the image generated by computer vision. They were instructed to communicate with each other to figure out the identities of some “named” objects (only known to the director), such that the matcher could also know which object has what name.",
        "Here is an example excerpt from this dataset: D1",
        ": there is basically a cluster of four objects in the upper",
        "left, do you see that (1) M: yes (2) D: ok, so the one in the corner is a blue cup (3) 1 D stands for the director; M stands for the matcher. M: I see there is a square, but fine, it is blue (4) D: alright, I will just go with that, so and then right under",

        "cup (11) M: yeah (12) D: that is actually an apple (13)",
        "As we can see from this example, both the director and the matcher make extra efforts to overcome the mismatched perceptions through collaborative dialogue. Our ultimate goal is to develop computational approaches that can ground interrelated referring expressions to the physical world, and enable collaborative actions of the dialogue agent (similar to the active role that the matcher played in the human-human dialogue). For the time be-ing, we use this data to evaluate our computational approach for referential grounding, namely, replacing the matcher by our automatic system to ground the director’s referring expressions."

        "Our system first processes the data using automatic semantic parsing and coreference resolution. For semantic parsing, we use a rule-based CCG parser (Bozsahin et al., 2005) to parse each utterance into a formal semantic representation. For example, the utterance “a pear is to the right of the apple” is parsed as [a1, a2] , [P ear(a1), Apple(a2), RightOf(a1, a2)] which consists of a list of discourse entities (e.g., a1 and a2) and a list of first-order-logic predicates that specify the unary attributes of these entities and the binary relations between them.",
        "We then perform pairwise coreference resolution on the discourse entities to find out the discourse relations between entities from different utterances. Formally, let ai be a discourse entity extracted from the current utterance, and aj a discourse entity from a previous utterance. We train a maximum entropy classifier2",
        "(Manning and Klein,",
        "2",
        "The features we use for the classification include the distance between ai and aj, the determiners associated with them, the associated pronouns, the syntactic roles, the extracted unary properties, etc. 14 2003) to predict whether ai and aj should refer to the same object (i.e. positive) or to different objects (i.e. negative).",
        "Based on the semantic parsing and pairwise coreference resolution results, our system further builds a graph representation to capture the collaborative discourse and formulate referential grounding as a probabilistic labeling problem, as described next. 4.2 Graph Representation We use an Attributed Relational Graph (Tsai and Fu, 1979) to represent the referential grounding discourse (which we call the “dialogue graph”). It is constructed based on the semantic parsing and coreference resolution results. The dialogue graph contains a set A of N nodes: A = {a1, a2, . . . , aN } in which each node ai represents a discourse entity from the parsing results. And for each pair of nodes ai and aj there can be an edge aiaj that represents the physical or discourse relation (i.e. coreference) between the two nodes.",
        "Furthermore, each node ai can be assigned a set of “attributes”: xi = { x (1) i , x(2)",
        "i , . . . , x (K) i } which are used to specify information about the unary properties of the corresponding discourse entity. Similarly, each edge aiaj can also be assigned a set of attributes xij to specify information about the binary relations between two discourse entities. The node attributes are from the semantic parsing results, i.e., the unary properties associated to a discourse entity. The edge attributes can be either from parsing results, such as a spatial relation between two entities (e.g., RightOf (a1, a2)); Or from pairwise coreference resolution results, i.e., two entities are coreferen-tial (coref = +) or not (coref = −).",
        "Besides the dialogue graph that represents the linguistic discourse, we build another graph to represent the perceived environment. This graph is called the “vision graph” (since this graph is built based on computer vision’s outputs). It has a set Ω of M nodes: Ω = {ω1, ω2, . . . , ωM } in which each node ωα represents a physical object in the scene. Similar to the dialogue graph, the vision graph also has edges (e.g., ωαωβ), node attributes (e.g., x̆α) and edge attributes (e.g., x̆αβ). Note that the attributes in the vision graph mostly have numeric values extracted by computer vision algorithms, whereas the attributes in the dialogue graph have symbolic values extracted from the linguistic discourse. A set of “symbol grounding functions” are used to bridge between the heterogeneous attributes (described later).",
        "Given these two graph representations, referential grounding then can be formulated as a “node labeling” process, that is to assign a label θi to each node ai. The value of θi can be any of the M node labels from the set Ω. 4.3 Probabilistic Labeling Algorithm The probabilistic labeling algorithm (Christmas et al., 1995) is formulated in the Bayesian framework. It provides a unified evidence-combining scheme to integrate unary attributes, binary relations and prior knowledge for updating the labeling probabilities (i.e. P (θi = ωα)). The algorithm finds proper labelings in an iterative manner: it first initiates the labeling probabilities by considering only the unary attributes of each node, and then updates the labeling probability of each node based on the labeling of its neighbors and the relations with them.",

The prior probability can be used to encode any prior knowledge about possible labelings. Especially in incremental processing of the dialogue, the prior can encode previous grounding hypotheses, and other information from the collaborative dialogue such as confirma-tion, rejection, or replacement.",
        "P (ai | θi = ωα) is called the “compatibility coefficient” between ai and ωα, which is computed based on the attributes of ai and ωα: P (ai | θi = ωα) = P (xi | θi = ωα) ≈ ∏ k P ( x (k) i | θi = ωα ) and we further define 15 P ( x(k) i | θi = ωα ) = p ( x (k) i | x̆(k)",

On average, a dialogue graph consists of 33 discourse entities from the director’s utterances that need to be grounded.",

The state-space search algorithm actually only results in multiple hypotheses for the overall matching, and it fails to produce multiple hypotheses for many individual discourse entities. Multiple grounding hypotheses can be very useful to generate responses such as clarification questions or nonverbal feedback (e.g. pointing, gazing). For example, if there are two competing hypotheses, the dialogue manager can utilize them to generate a response like “I see two objects there, are you talking about this one (pointing to) or that one (pointing to the other)?”. Such proactive feedback is often an effective way in referential communication (Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986; Liu et al., 2013).",

The efficiency of the probabilistic labeling algorithm thus makes it more appealing for real-time interaction applica-tions.",

With no surprise, the coreference resolution performance plays an important role in the final grounding performance (see the grounding performance of using manually annotated coreference in the bottom part of Table 1). Due to the simplicity of our current coreference classifier and the flexibility of the human-human dialogue in the data, the pairwise coreference resolution only achieves 0.74 in precision and 0.43 in recall. The low recall of coreference resolution makes it difficult to link interrelated referring expressions and resolve them jointly. So it is important to develop more sophisticated coreference resolution and dialogue management components to reliably track the discourse relations and other dynamics in the dialogue to facilitate referential grounding."
