        "This paper demonstrates the importance of relation equivalence for entity translation pair discovery. Existing approach of understanding relation equivalence has focused on using explicit features of co-occurring entities. In this paper, we explore latent features of temporality for understanding relation equivalence, and empirically show that the explicit and latent features complement each other. Our proposed hybrid approach of using both explicit and latent features improves relation translation by 0.16 F1-score, and in turn improves entity translation by 0.02."

        "Understanding relations is important in entity tasks. In this paper, we illustrate such importance using named entity (NE) translation mining problem. Early research on NE translation used phonetic similarities, for example, to mine the translation ‘Mandelson’ →‘ 曼 德 尔 森’[ManDeErSen] with similar sounds (Knight and Graehl, 1998; Wan and Verspoor, 1998). However, not all NE translations are based on transliterations, but they might be based on semantics (e.g., ‘WTO’ →‘ 世 贸组织’[ShiMaoZuZhi]), or even arbitrary (e.g., ‘Jackie Chan’ →‘ 成龙’[ChengLong]).",
        "To address this challenge, current state-of-the-art approaches build an entity graph for each language corpus, and align the two graphs by propagating the seed translation similarities (Figure 1) (Kim et al., 2011; You et al., 2012). For example, arbitrary translation pair such as (Jackie Chan, 成龙) can be obtained, if he is connected to his film ‘Drunken Master’ ( 醉拳) in both graphs. That is, we can propagate the seed translation similarity of (Drunken Master, 醉拳) to neighbor entities ‘Jackie Chan’ and ‘ 成龙’ in each graph.  (Drunken Master)",
        "(Kung Fu)  (Hong Kong)  (Jackie Chan) Drunken Master Kung Fu Hong Kong Jackie Chan English Entity Graph Chinese Entity Graph D k M tDr ( Jackie ChanJackie Chan Known translations Propagated translations Figure 1: Entity translation by propagation.",
        "When two graphs are obtained from parallel corpora, graphs are symmetric and “blind propagation” described above is effective. In contrast, Lee and Hwang (2013) propose “selective propagation” for asymmetric graphs, of compar-ing the semantics of relations. A key contribution of this paper is using relation temporality for determining relation equivalence. Existing work (Nakashole et al., 2012; Mohamed et al., 2011; Lee and Hwang, 2013) uses only co-occurring entity pairs, or explicit features (EF). For example, for a relation pay an official visit to, with a statement (Bush, pay an official visit to, China), an entity pair (Bush, China) is in the “support set”, which is a set of co-occurring entity pairs of pay an official visit to. When its support set is {(Bush, China), (Mandelson, Moscow), (Rice, Israel)}, and that of visit is {(Bush, China), (Rice, Israel), (Medvedev, Cuba)}, we can infer their semantic equivalence based on the set intersection: {(Bush, China), (Rice, Israel)}.",
        "In contrast, we propose to explore corpus latent features (LF), to complement the sparsity problem of EF: Out of 158 randomly chosen correct relation translation pairs we labeled, 64% has only one co-occurring entity pair, which makes EF not very effective to identify these relation translations. Therefore, we leverage relation temporality, which is both orthogonal and complementary to existing efforts leveraging entity temporality (Kle-848 mentiev and Roth, 2006; Kim et al., 2012; You et al., 2013). In particular, we discover three new challenges on using temporality for relation understanding in comparable corpora, which we discuss in detail in Section 3.2. Based on these challenges, we identify three new features for LF.",
        "We observe the complementary nature of EF and LF, then propose a hybrid approach combining both features. Our new hybrid approach significantly improves the relation translation (0.16 higher F1-score than EF), and in turn improves the entity translation (0.02 higher F1-score)."

In our experiments, we use a non-selective (hence not requiring relation translations) propagation approach (You et al., 2012) with (Lam et al., 2007) for a base translation matrix. The focus of this paper is STEP 2, building the translation score T",

        "STEP 2 and STEP 3 reinforce each other to improve the final entity translation function. While STEP 3 is well-defined in (Lee and Hwang, 2013), to propagate entity translation scores when the relation semantics of the edges are equivalent, STEP 2 has been restricted to the explicit feature, i.e., co-occurring entities or shared context. In clear contrast, by discovering novel latent features based on temporal properties, we can increase the accuracy of both entity and relation translations.

        "In this section, we present our approaches to obtain relations of equivalent semantics across languages (e.g., visit→访 问). Formally, our goal is to build the relation translation score function TR(rE, rC ) for English relation rE and Chinese relation rC . 3.1 Baseline: Explicit Feature Approach (EF) In this section, we briefly illustrate a baseline method EF (Lee and Hwang, 2013). As we mentioned in the introduction, traditional approaches leverage common co-occurring entity-pairs. This observation also holds in the bilingual environment by exploiting seed entity translations. For example, let us say that we have two extracted statements: (Bruce Willis, star in, The Sixth Sense) and (布 鲁 斯·威 利 斯 (Bruce Willis), 主演 (star in), 第六感 (The Sixth Sense)). Knowing a few seed entity translations using TN , ‘Bruce Willis’ →‘ 布鲁斯·威利斯’ and ‘The Sixth Sense’ →‘ 第六感’, we can find star in and 主演 are semantically similar.",
        "Specifically, we quantify this similarity based on the number of such common entity pairs that we denote as |H(rE, rC )| for an English relation rE and a Chinese relation rC . The existing approaches are variations of using |H(rE, rC )|. Our baseline implementation uses the one by (Lee and Hwang, 2013), and we refer the reader to the paper for formal definitions and processing steps we omitted due to the page limit.",
        "Unfortunately, this approach suffers from sparsity of the common entity pairs due to the incomparability of the corpora and those entities that cannot be translated by TN . Therefore, we leverage corpus latent features as an additional signal to overcome this problem. 3.2 Latent Feature Approach (LF) Temporal Feature Discovery We exploit the temporal distribution d[x](t) of textual element x during t-th week in statements; we count the occurrences of the element x on a weekly basis, and normalize them to observe∑",

        "To address the first challenge, we use a finergranularity unit for observing the temporality. More specifically, we exploit a coupling of a relation and an entity: d[e, r, ∗] where e is an entity, r a relation, and * is a placeholder indicating that any noun phrase is accepted for the second argument of a statement.1",

For example, Figure 3 shows entity-dominating entity-relation temporality. If an entity has a peak at some period (Figure 3a), most relations that are coupled with the entity would have a peak at the very same period (Figure 3b). This makes all relations that appear with this entity very similar to 1",

We extract English and Chinese statements from news articles in 2008 by Xinhua news who publishes news in both English and Chinese, which were also used by Lee and Hwang (2013). The number of English articles is 100,746, and that of Chinese articles is 88,031. As we can see from the difference in the numbers of the documents, the news corpora are not direct translations, but they have asymmetry of entities and relations. 4.1 Entity Translation In this section, we present experimental settings and results on translating entities using our proposed approaches.

We measure precision, recall, and F1-score based on the returned translation pairs for each English entity as it is done in (Lee and Hwang, 2013).",
        "We compare our hybrid approach, which is denoted by LF+EF with EF (Lee and Hwang, 2013), a combined approach PH+SM of phonetic similarity and letter-wise semantic translation for better accuracy for organizations (Lam et al., 2007), and the seed translations Seed that we adopt (You et al., 2012) with PH+SM as a base translation matrix.3",
        "We process one iteration of the entire framework (STEP 1-3) for both LF+EF and EF.",
        "Table 2 shows the comparison of the methods. Our proposed approach LF+EF shows higher F1-score than the baselines. In particular, our approach outperforms EF. For example, ‘Matthew Emmons’ is a lesser known entity, and we have only few statements mentioning him in the corpora. The corpus explicit feature EF alone cannot translate the relation win and, in turn, ‘Matthew Emmons’. However, LF+EF translates him correctly into 马修·埃蒙斯 through the relation win. 4.2 Relation Translation This section considers the relation translation task. Each relation translation method translates an English relation rE into a list of Chinese relations, and we check whether a Chinese relation rC with the highest translation score is the correct translation. We consider the relation translation is correct when the semantics are equivalent. For example, 去 (leave for/go to) is a correct translation of leave for, but 离开 (leave) is not.

        "Note that the absolute numbers (due to the harsh evaluation criteria) may look low. But the top translations are still relevant (e.g., fight is translated to 驻 (deploy troops)). In addition, the lower ranked but correct relation translations also affect entity translation. Therefore, even lowerperforming EF boosted the entity translations, and in effect, our approach could achieve higher F1-score in the entity translation task.",
        "To illustrate the detailed effects of the corpus latent features, Table 4 shows the ranks of correct Chinese translations for English relations by methods using selected features for the challenges. For comparison, the ranks of the correct translations when using EF are shown.
