        "This volume contains the abstracts of the ACL 2014 tutorials. We received 19 high-quality proposals, and it was a difficult task to make a final selection. We applied the following criteria for evaluation: appropriateness, technical fit, novelty, potential interest, presenters, and experience. In the end we accepted eight tutorials. All eight of these are organized as half-day tutorials. We are very grateful to David Yarowsky (local chair), Alexander Koller and Yusuke Miyao (publication chairs), Daniel Marcu (general chair), Johan Bos and Keith Hall (the ACL 2013 tutorial chairs), and of course Priscilla Rasmussen, for various kinds of help, advice and assistance offered during the process of putting the tutorial programme and materials together. Most importantly, we would like to thank the tutorial presenters for the time and effort in preparing and presenting the tutorials. We hope you will enjoy the tutorials!
