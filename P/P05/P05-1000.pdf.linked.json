Well, what’s fun about that? Between Istanbul, Singapore, and Los Angeles, we could easily solve problems in real time; by the time Kemal arrived at the office after breakfast, Hwee Tou was just back from lunch, and I was done carrying out the late-night raid on my own refrigerator. No problem. I’d like to start by thanking everyone who submitted research work to ACL-05. I’d especially like to thank researchers new to the field – this is a great time to be in computational linguistics. Excellent research is one of the Two Critical Ingredients of a successful ACL conference. Program Co-Chairs Hwee Tou Ng and Kemal Oflazer deserve our gratitude for putting an immense amount of work into the main session program. They and the Area Chairs got a large number of submissions this year, and the program is diverse and exciting. Thanks also to Erika Barragan-Nunez for arranging the program committee meeting in California. Stefan Riezler assembled a program of five excellent tutorials to begin the meeting, and Mirella Lapata organized the workshop program, assisted by Mark Dras, Mary Harper, Dan Klein, and Shuly Winter. Masaaki Nagata and Ted Pedersen put together a high-quality demo session, including software systems from all over the world. Jason Eisner and Philipp Koehn put in a tremendous amount of thought, effort, and persistence into publications. Each time ACL doubles the number of papers, the work way more than doubles. Mark Johnson, as sponsorship chair, requested that the money be shown to him (and it was!), so thanks very much to the sponsors, and to Mark. Richard Wicentowski took on two chair roles – exhibits and publicity – the latter of which included writing the useful ACL-05 newsletters forwarded by ubiquifamous Priscilla Rasmussen. Regina Barzilay, Chris Callison-Burch and Stephen Wan organized the Student Research Workshop (and thanks again to all the students who submitted their research). Richard Power graciously agreed to do pre-submission mentoring for authors. The ACL Executive Committee provided help on a number of issues and responded quickly to questions – thank you, Martha Palmer, Jun’ichi Tsujii, Mark Steedman, Kathy McCoy, Sandee Carberry, Johanna Moore, Priscilla Rasmussen, Annie Zaenen, Walter Daelemans, and Keh-Yih Su. Dragomir Radev went far beyond the call of duty as Local Arrangements Chair. He raised and solved lots of strategic issues, followed up on every wire and cable, and cajoled other ACL chairs into solving important problems fast. I believe he may even be responsible for the weather and for making sure your luggage arrived on the same day you did. Thanks to the whole local team: Rich Thomason, Steve Abney, Joyce Chai, San Duanmu, Kurt Godden, Acrisio Pires, Martha Pollack, Keith van der Linden, Rick Lewis, Sara Schwartz, and Bill Vlisides, and to James Sweeney, who served as the conference webmaster. On behalf of Dragomir, please let me thank the University of Michigan’s School of Information, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and Department of Linguistics for their support. Dragomir also arranged the banquet at the Henry Ford Museum, where ACL President Martha Palmer will no doubt make an excellent speech – that’s of course the Other Critical Ingredient of a successful ACL. iii Finally, I’d also like to thank all the other folks who helped create ACL-05, including student volunteers, exhibitors, tutorialists, and everyone else not listed here. To ACL attendees: thanks for coming, and please have a good conference!

This year, we received a record number of 423 submissions. The program committee accepted 77 papers, for an acceptance rate of 18%, continuing the tradition of the annual ACL conference as being one of the most competitive and selective conferences. Of the accepted papers, 42 are from North America, 18 from Europe and the Middle East, and 17 from Asia and Australia. We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to all the authors who submitted their papers, to the 231 program committee members who worked tirelessly to review all submissions, and to the ten Area Chairs who oversaw the review process, collated the reviews, led discussions on papers with conflicting reviews, and solicited additional reviews for controversial papers. The Program Committee Co-Chairs and the area chairs then met for two days at the program committee meeting held at USC/ISI to select the final set of accepted papers. We would like to thank Kevin Knight, the General Conference Chair, who made available USC/ISI as the meeting venue, and his assistant Erika Barragan-Nunez who took care of the meeting arrangements and logistics. The ACL-05 main program lasts three days, and includes plenary sessions, three parallel paper sessions, demo and poster sessions, and the student research workshop. We are grateful to Professor Justine Cassell (Northwestern University) and Professor Michael Jordan (University of California, Berkeley) who have kindly accepted our invitation to present invited talks at the conference. The ACL-05 conference will also feature the ACL Lifetime Achievement Award. This prestigious award is presented to a most distinguished researcher for his or her pioneering work in computational linguistics. Past distinguished recipients of this award are Aravind Joshi, Makoto Nagao, and Karen Spärck-Jones. The recipient of this award in 2005 will be announced at a special plenary session at ACL-05, followed by a special lecture by the award recipient. ACL-05 will also continue the tradition of presenting the Best Paper Award to an outstanding paper. This award will be announced in the plenary session at the end of the conference. A conference like ACL would not succeed without the many volunteers who offer their generous help. We deeply appreciate the advice and support of Kevin Knight, General Conference Chair, Dragomir Radev, Local Arrangements Chair, and the Local Arrangements Committee. We are also grateful to the ACL Executive Committee for their guidance, and Walter Daelemans and Marilyn Walker, ACL-04 Program Co-Chairs, for sharing their experience. We would also like to thank Jason Eisner and Philipp Koehn, Publication Co-Chairs, for putting together the proceedings of this conference. We wish you an enjoyable time at ACL-05!
