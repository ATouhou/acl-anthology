The field which began as a study of mechanical translation has broadened to include much more. The Program Committee tried to have as many areas represented here as possible, In the conference's sessions are papers on topics as varied as speech perception, the formal definition of knowledge representations, the reality of a cognitive model of spatial knowledge, and computer-assisted dialect adaption. At the same time, we have tried to highlight current trends. So there are several papers on topics like word-driven versus rule-driven parsers, graph representations of knowledge, dialogue models, and natural language access to databases. Any success this conference enjoys is due to a great deal of volunteer effort. Foremost among the people who must be thanked are Bonnie Lynn Webber, who organized the conference, Don Walker, who handled the finances, and Jim Levin, who handled local arrangements. I also want to thank the other two members of the Program Committee, Barbara Sangster and Ralph Weischedel, and the president of the ACL, Ron Kaplan. Thanks are due to the organlzers of the La Jolla Conference on Cognitive Science and the Office of the Conference Coordinator of the University of California at San Diego for their cooperation. Thanks are also due to several people at Sperry Univac: my boss, Dick Wexelblat, who made my time available, and my secretary, Barbara Gebhar~t, who handled the typing, mailing, and copying. The Research Department at Univac also paid for the preparation of the conference advertising and the printing of these proceedings. Thanks are also due to the authors of these papers who provide the rationale for the meeting. Finally, thanks are due to the authors of the many excellent papers who, unfortunately, had to be turned away due to llmlted time in the program. We hope you enjoy the conference and find these proceedings useful. I look forward to seeing you at next year's meeting in Philadelphia. Norman K.
