It contains both the refereed papers presented at the meeting, and written versions of two of the three invited talks given there.","As a reflection of continuing growth and specialization within computational linguistics, the program committee felt that several intellectual developments of potentially wide interest require some introduction for non-specialists. We invited the authors of submitted papers in two of these areas to give instead more extensive presentations with more tutorial content, and they kindly accepted our invitations. The meeting included an invited talk by David Israel on computational implications of Barwise and Perry's newly emergent theory of situation semantics and a tutorial overview by Mark Liberman on the new round of applications of techniques from artificial intelligence and computational linguistics to low-level speech analysis and phonetically-based speech recognition (not included in the proceedings).","The sole panel discussion at the meeting is closely linked to a set of papers which are part of a new wave of work focusing on the computational complexity of various grammatical formalisms and on the relevance of such analyses. The program committee felt the differing views expressed in these papers strongly invited wider discussion. Ray Perrault organized a panel on these topics, and set the stage with a tutorial prese.nting relevant formal underpinnings and historical background. Particular thanks are due him for taking on this dual responsibility in addition to his other extensive duties at the meeting.","As chair, I would to thank the rest of the program committee: Phil Cohen (Fairchild), Lauri Karttunen (University of Texas), Bill Mann (USC/ISI), Robert Moore (SRI International), Ann Robinson (Symantec), and Robert Wilensky (University of California, Berkeley). Every member of the committee read and evaluated each of the 04 papers submitted to the conference. The selection of final papers is always difficult; this year was no exception. Thanks to all those who took the time and effort to submit papers to the conference; particular thanks go to those whose submissions could not be accommodated due to the time limits of the meeting.","The support and assistance of a number of people were instrumental in organizing this conference. Don Walker produced the Call for Papers, the Advance Program, and the Proceedings (!), and generally made sure things were on track. Jon Allen, assisted by Judy Sobel, was responsible for local arrangements for the meeting, including coordinating the demonstrations. Ray Perrault provided counsel every step of the way, in addition to his direct contributions to the program. I myself owe special thanks to June Fostik of Bell Labs for secretarial and organizational assistance: her help was invaluable.","Several institutions provided a~sistance; their contribution should be acknowledged. SRI International's facilities were used to produce the Call for Papers, the Advanced Program, and these Proceedings. Bell Labs provided clerical and secretarial support to the program committee. MIT provided support for local arrangements.","And finally, thanks to the people attending the meeting. Without their presence, much of this effort would lose its meaning.
