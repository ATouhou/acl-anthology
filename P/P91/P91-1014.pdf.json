We are also grateful to Aravind Joehi for his support of this research. We also thank Robert Frank. All remaining errors are the author's responsibility alone.

Their practical superiority is mainly obtained because of the top-down filtering accomplished by the predictive component of the parser. Compiling out as much as possible this predictive component before run-time will result in a more efficient parser so long as the worst case behavior is not deteriorated.","Approaches in this direction have been investigated (Earley, 1968; Lang, 1974; Tomita, 1985; Tomita, 1987), however none of them is satisfying, either because the worst case complexity is deteriorated (worse than Earley's parser) or because the technique is not general. Furthermore, none of these approaches have been formally proven to have a behavior superior to well known parsers such as Earley's parser.","Earley himself ([1968] pages 69-89) proposed to pre-compile the state sets generated by his algorithm to make it as efficient as LR(k) parsers (Knuth, 1965) when used on LR(k) grammars by precomputing all possible states sets that the parser could create. However, some context-free grammars, including most likely most natural language grammars, cannot be compiled using his technique and the problem of knowing if a grammar can be compiled with this technique is undecidable (Earley [1968], page 99).","Lang (1974) proposed a technique for evaluating in pseudo-parallel non-deterministic push down automata. Although this technique achieves a worst case complexity of O(n3)-time with respect to the length of input, it requires that at most two symbols are popped from the stack in a single move. When the technique is used for shift-reduce parsing, this constraint requires that the context-free grammar is in Chomsky normal form (CNF). As far as the grammar size is concerned, an exponential worst case behavior is reached when used with the characteristic LR(0) 106 machine. 1","Tomita (1985; 1987) proposed to extend LR(0) parsers to non-deterministic context-free grammars by explicitly using a graph structured stack which represents the pseudo-parallel evaluation of the moves of a non-deterministic LR(0) push-down automaton. Tomita's encoding of the non-deterministic push-down automaton suffers from an exponential time and space worst case complexity with respect to the input length and also with respect to the grammar size (Johnson [1989] and also page 72 in Tomita [1985]). Although Tomita reports experimental data that seem to show that the parser behaves in practice better than Earley's parser (which is proven to take in the worst case O([G[2n3)-time), the duplication of the same experiments shows no conclusive outcome. Modifications to Tomita's algorithm have been proposed in order to alleviate the exponential complexity with respect to the input length (Kipps, 1989) but, according to Kipps, the modified algorithm does not lead to a practical parser. Furthermore, the algorithm is doomed to behave in the worst case in exponential time with respect to the grammar size for some ambiguous grammars and inputs (Johnson, 1989). 2 So far, there is no formal proof showing that the Tomita's parser can be superior for some grammars and inputs to Earley's parser, and its worst case complexity seems to contradict the experimental data.","As explained, the previous attempts to compile the predictive component are not general and achieve a worst case complexity (with respect to the grammar size and the input length) worse than standard parsers.","The methodology we follow in order to compile the predictive component of Earley's parser is to define a predictive bottom-up pushdown machine equivalent to the given grammar which we drive in pseudo-parallel. Following Johnson's (1989) argument, any parsing algorithm based on the LR(0) characteristic machine is doomed to behave in exponential time with respect to the grammar size for some ambiguous grammars and inputs. This is a result of the fact that the number of states of an LR(0) characteristic machine can be exponential and that there are some grammars and inputs for which an exponential number of states must be reached (See Johnson [1989] for examples of such grammars and inputs). One must therefore design a different pushdown machine which","1 The same arguraent for the exponential graramar size complexity of Tomita's parser (Johnson, 1989) holds for Lang's technique.","2 This problem is particularly acute for natural language processing since in this context the input length is typically small (10-20 words) and the granunar size very large (hundreds or thousands of rules and symbols). can be driven efficiently in pseudo-parallel.","We construct a non-deterministic predictive push-down machine given an arbitrary context-free grammar whose number of states is proportional to the size of the grammar. Then at run time, we efficiently drive this machine in pseudo-parallel. Even if all the states of the machine are reached for some grammars and inputs, a polynomial complexity will still be obtained since the number of states is bounded by the grammar size. We therefore introduce a shift-reduce driver for this machine in which all of the predictive component has been compiled in the finite state control of the machine. The technique makes no requirement on the form of the context-free grammar and it behaves in the worst case as well as Earley's parser (Earley, 1970). The push-down machine is built before run-time and it is encoded as parsing tables in the which the predictive behavior has been compiled out.","In the worst case, the recognizer behaves in the same O([Gl2nS)-time and O([G[n2)-space as Earley's parser. However in practice it is always superior to Earley's parser since the prediction steps have been eliminated before run-time. We show that the items produced in the chart correspond to equivalence classes on the items produced for the same input by Earley's parser. This mapping formally shows its practical superior behavior. 3","Finally, we explain how other more efficient variants of the basic parser can be obtained by determinizing portions of the basic non-deterministic push-down machine while still using the same pseudo-parallel driver."]},{"title":"2 The Parser","paragraphs":["The parser we propose handles any context-free grammar; the grammar can be ambiguous and need not be in any normal form. The parser is a predictive shift-reduce bottom-up parser that uses compiled top down prediction information in the form of tables. Before run-time, a non-deterministic push down automaton (NPDA) is constructed from a given context-free grammar. The parsing tables encode the finite state control and the moves of the NPDA. At run-time, the NPDA is then driven in pseudo-parallel with the help of a chart. We show the construction of a basic machine which will be driven non-deterministically.","In the following, the input string is w -- al...an and the context-free grammar being considered is G = (~, NT, P, S), where ~ is the set of terminal","3The characteristic LR(0) machine is the result of determinizing the n~acldne we introduce.

These variants lead to a set of more efficient machines since the non-determinism is decreased."]},{"title":"8 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We have introduced a shift-reduce parser for unrestricted context-free grammars based on the construction of a non-deterministic machine and we have formally proven its superior performance compared to Earley's parser.","The technique which we employed consists of constructing before run-time a parsing table that encodes a non-deterministic machine in the which the predictive behavior has been compiled out. At run time, the machine is driven in pseudo-parallel with the help a chart.","By defining two kinds of shift moves (on kernel dotted rules and on non-kernel dotted rules) and two kinds of reduce moves (on kernel and non-kernel dotted rules), we have been able to efficiently evaluate in pseudo-parallel the non-deterministic push down machine constructed for the given context-free grammar.","The same worst case complexity as Earley's recognizer is achieved:"]},{"title":"O(IGl2na)-time","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"O(IG]n2) -","paragraphs":["space. However, in practice, it is superior to Earley's parser since all the prediction steps and some of the completion steps have been compiled before run-time.","The parser can be modified to simulate other types of machines (such LR(k)-like or SLR-like automata). It can also be extended to handle unification based grammars using a similar method as that employed by Shieber (1985) for extending Earley's algorithm.","Furthermore, the algorithm can be tuned to a particular grammar and therefore be made more efficient by carefully determinizing portions of the non-deterministic machine while making sure that the number of states in not increased. These variants lead to more efficient parsers than the one based on the basic non-deterministic push-down machine. Furthermore, the same pseudo-parallel driver can be used for all these machines.","We have adapted the technique presented in this paper to other grammatical formalism such as tree-adjoining grammars (Schabes, 1991)."]},{"title":"Bibliography","paragraphs":["A.
