Balkanski Harvard University, Aiken Computation Lab Cambridge, MA 02138 Introduction","paragraphs":["Although most NLP researchers agree that a level of \"logical form\" is a necessary step toward the goal of representing the meaning of a sentence, few people agree on the content and form of this level of representation. An even smaller number of people have considered the complex action sentences that are often expressed in task-oriented dialogues. Most existing logical form representations have been developed for single-clause sentences that express assertions about properties or"]},{"title":"actual","paragraphs":["actions and in which time is not a main concern.

When the red fight goes off, push the handle.","In the following sections, I discuss the issues that arise in defining the logical form of these three types of sentences. The Davidsonian treatment of action sentences is the most appropriate for my purposes because it treats actions as individuals [7]. For example, the logical form of \"Jones buttered the toast\" is a three place predicate, including an argument position for the action being described, i.e., 3x"]},{"title":"butter(jones, toast, x).","paragraphs":["The presence of the action variable makes it possible to represent optional modifiers as predications of actions and to refer to actions in subsequent discourse. Furthermore, and more importantly for the present purpose, it facilitates the representation of sentences about multiple actions and relations between them.

The approach I am currently investigating is to extend Itobbs' representation by introducing predicates stating the existence of actions in future, hypothetical or typical worlds as well as in the actual world.","Another possibility is to adopt the standard philosophical approach to the representation of properties, and for that matter, of actions, that are not actually instantiated, namely possible worlds (cf. [13, 2]). Furthermore, and independently of the approach that is adopted, there is a need to identify the different"]},{"title":"types","paragraphs":["of unrealized actions and determine whether they should be distinguished in the logical form. Multi-clause sentences Another area of logical form that has not received much attention is the representation of sentences about multiple actions and relations between them. I have been investigating sentences including by- and to- purpose clauses because they are used to communicate two action relations, namely generation and enablement, which I have defined elsewhere [3]. In a Davidsonian logical form, the connectives \"by\" and \"to\" can be represented as two-place predicates ranging over action tokens1; e.g.: (2) To learn how to use the system, read the manual."]},{"title":"learn(you, system, xa )","paragraphs":["A"]},{"title":"read(you, manual,","paragraphs":["x2)A"]},{"title":"inorderto(x2, xa)","paragraphs":["Clauses may also be joined with coordination conjunctions, e.g., (3a), and the resulting constituent may participate in another action relation, as in (lb) and repeated below in (3b).

Furthermore, the first does not capture the intuitive notion that these sentences express action relations, and the second introduces a lack of homogeneity between logical forms of sentences involving action relations and those that do not."]},{"title":"Time","paragraphs":["Still another feature that has been overlooked in the study of logical form is time.

The lack of concern for temporal issues is also characteristic of the literature on semantic interpretation (e.g., [10, 15, 16]). On the other hand, there is a vast literature on the interpretation and representation of tense, aspect and temporal modifiers, but these papers do not describe the logical forms from which their representations are generated (e.g., [4, 6, 8, 12, 17, 18]).","Clearly, there is a missing link between the literature on logical form and that on tense and aspect. Providing such a link is one of the goals of this research. Davidson's treatment of action sentences does not provide a fully satisfying starting point. Although his initial paper does not include any example of temporal modifiers, he would probably represent them as predicates over action tokens, e.g.,"]},{"title":"next_week(x),","paragraphs":["a representation that does not make explicit reference to time (to which anaphors might refer).

There has been work in each of the above areas, but this research has been fragmentary and still needs to be integrated with that on the logical form of action sentences. Ironically, the conclusion that Moore arrived at, ten years ago, is still valid today [14]: \"If real progress is to be made on understanding the logical form of natural-language utterances, it must be studied in a unified way and treated as an important research problem in its own right.\" In ray talk, I will present an initial attempt to do so."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["[1] H.
