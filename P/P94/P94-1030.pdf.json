Since spoken language is incomplete in various ways, i.e., containing speech errors, ellipsis, metonymy, etc., spoken language understanding systems should have the ability to process incomplete inputs by hypothesizing the underlying information. The abduction-based approach (Hobbs et al., 1988) has provided a simple and elegant way to realize such a task.","Consider the following 3apanese sentence: (1) Sfseki katta (a famous writer) buy PAST This sentence contains two typical phenomena aris-ing in spoken language, i.e., metonymy and the el-lipsis of a particle. When this sentence is uttered under the situation where the speaker reports his experience, its natural interpretation is the speaker bought a SSseki novel. To derive this interpretation, we need to resolve the following problems:","• The metonymy implied by the noun phrase S6seki is expanded to a S6seki novel, based on the pragmatic knowledge that the name of a writer is sometimes used to refer to his novel.","• The particle-less thematic relation between the verb katta and the noun phrase SSseki is determined to be the object case relation, based on the semantic knowledge that the object case relation between a trading action and a commodity can be linguistically expressed as a thematic relation.","This interpretation is made by abduction. For instance, the above semantic knowledge is stated, in terms of the predicate logic, as follows: (2) sem(e,x) C trade(e) A commodity(x) A obj(e,x) Then, the inference process derives the consequent sem(e,x) by hypothesizing an antecedent obj(e,x), which is never proved from the observed facts. This process is called abduction.","Of course, there may be several other possibilities that support the thematic relation sem(e,x). For instance, the thematic relation being determined to be the agent case relation, sentence (1) can have another interpretation, i.e., Sfseki bought something, which, under some other situations, might be more feasible than the first interpretation. To cope with feasibility, the abduction-based model usually manages the mechanism for evaluating the goodness of the interpretation. This is known as cost-based abduction (Hobbs et al., 1988)."]},{"title":"In","paragraphs":["cost-based abduction, each assumption bears a certain cost. For instance, the assumption obj(e,x), introduced by applying rule (2), is specified to have a cost of, say, $2. The goodness of the interpretation is evaluated by accumulating the costs of all the assumptions involved. The whole process of interpreting an utterance is depicted in the following schema: 1. Find all possible interpretations, and 2. Select the one that has the lowest cost.","In our example, the interpretation that assumes the thematic relation to be the object case relation, with the metonymy being expanded to a S6seki novel, is cheaper than the interpretation that assumes the thematic relation to be the agent case relation; hence, the former is selected.","An apparent problem here is the high computational cost; because abduction allows many possibilities, the schema involves very heavy computation. Particularly in the spoken language understanding task, we need to consider a great number of possibilities when hypothesizing various underlying information. This makes the abduction process 218 computationally demanding, and reduces the practicality of abduction-based systems. The existing models do not provide any basic solution to this problem.

They showed that parsing of DCG can be seen as a special case of deduction of Horn clauses; conversely, deduction can be seen as a generalization of parsing. Their idea of using chart parsers as deductive-proof procedures can easily be extended to the idea of using chart parsers as abductive-proof procedures. Because chart parsers have many advantages from the viewpoint of computational efficiency, chart-based abductive-proof procedures are expected to nicely solve the computation problem.

Figure 2 shows an example of charts with many-to-many connections, where the connections are represented by pointers A, B; etc. The Algorithm We, so far, have considered deduction but not abduction. Here, we extend our idea to apply to abduction, and present the definition of the algorithm.","The extension for abduction is very simple. First, we add a new procedure, which introduces an assumption G for a given goal G. An assumption is treated as if it were a fact. This means that an assumption, as well as a fact, is represented as a passive edge in terms of the chart algorithm. Second, we associate a set S of assumptions with each edge e in the chart; S consists of all the assumptions that are contained in the completed part of the (partial) proof represented by the edge e. More formally, the assumption set 5 associated with an edge e is determined as follows:","1. If e is a passive edge representing an assumption A, then S-- {A}.","2. If e is a passive/active edge introduced from a non-chain rule, including fact, then S is empty.","3. If e is a passive/active edge predicted from a chain rule with a passive edge e' being the left-corner key, then S is equal to the assumption set S' of e'.","4. If e is a passive/active edge created by combining an active edge el and a passive edge e2, then ,-q = $1 U $2 where 81 and ~q2 are the assumption sets of el and e2, respectively.","Taking these into account, the definition of our algorithm is as follows, f is a function that assigns a unique vertex to each chart lexicon. The notation A:S stands for the label of an edge e, where A is the label of e in an ordinary sense and S is the assumption set associated with e.","Initialization Add an active edge [[?IG]-I-:¢ to the chart, looping at vertex 0, where G is the initial goal.

That is, the dependency between a verbal concept e and a nominal concept x is supported if there is an entity y such that x and y have a pragmatic relation, i.e., a metonymy relation, and e and y have a semantic relation, i.e., a thematic relation. The metonymy relation is defined by the pragmatic rules, based on certain knowledge, such as that the name of a writer is sometimes used to refer to his novel. Also, the thematic relation is defined by the semantic rules, based on certain knowledge, such as that the object case relation between a trading action and a commodity can be linguistically expressed as a thematic relation.","The subscript $c of a formula A represents the cost of assuming formula A. A is easy to as-sume when c is small, while A is difficult to as-sume when c is large. For instance, the cost of interpreting the thematic relation between a trading action and a commodity as the object case relation is low, say $2, while the cost of interpreting the thematic relation between an intentional action and a third person as the agent case relation is high, say $20. This assignment of costs is suitable for a situation in which the speaker reports his experience. In spite of the difficulty of assigning suitable costs in general, the cost-based interpretation is valuable, because it provides a uniform criteria for syntax, semantics and pragmatics. Hopefully, several techniques, independently developed in these areas, e.g., stochastic parsing, example-based/corpus-based techniques for word sense/structural disambiguation, etc., will be us-able for better cost assignment. Probability will also be a key technique for the cost assignment (Charniak and Shimony, 1990).","Figure 4 and Table 1 show the chart that is created when a sentence (1) is parsed and interpreted using our algorithm.

The table clearly shows how the three features of our algorithm improve the computational efficiency.

Our algorithm needs subsumption-checking only when a new edge is introduced by the combination procedure. In the parsing of augmented grammars, even when two edges have the same nonterminal symbol, they are different in the annotated structures associated with those edges, e.g., feature structures; in such a case, we cannot use one edge in place of another. Likewise, in our algorithm, edges are always annotated by the assumption sets, which, in most cases, prevent those edges from being reused. Therefore, in this case, subsumption-checking is not effective. In our algorithm, reuse of edges only be-comes possible when a new edge is introduced by the introduction procedure. However, this is done only by adding a pointer to the edge to be reused, and, to invoke this operation,"]},{"title":"equality-checking","paragraphs":["of lexicons, not edges, is sufficient.","Finally, our algorithm has a stronger connection with chart parsing than Earley deduction does. Pereira and Warren noted that the indexing of formulas is just an implementation technique to in-crease efficiency. However, indexing plays a considerable role in chart parsing, and how to index formulas in the case of proof procedures is not so obvious. In our algorithm, from the consideration of head-driven derivation, the index of a formula is determined to be the first argument of that formula. All formulas with the same index are derived the first time that index is introduced in the chart. Pointers among lexicons are also helpful in avoiding nonproductive attempts at applying the combination procedure. All the devices that were originally used in chart parsers in a restricted way are in-cluded in the formalism, not in the implementation, of our algorithm. Concluding Remarks In this paper, we provided a basic and practical solution to the computation problem of cost-based abduction. We explained the basic concept of our algorithm and presented the details of the algorithm along with simple examples. We also showed how our algorithm improves computational efficiency on the basis of the results of the preliminary experiments.","We are now developing an abduction-based spoken language understanding system using our algorithm. The main problem is how to find a good search strategy that can be implemented with the agenda control mechanism. We are investigating this issue using both theoretical and empirical approaches. We hope to report good results along these lines in the future.
