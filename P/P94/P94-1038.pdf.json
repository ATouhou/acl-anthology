For example, a speech recognizer may need to determine which of the two word combinations \"eat a peach\" and \"eat a beach\" is more likely. Statistical NLP methods determine the likelihood of a word combination according to its frequency in a training corpus. However, the nature of language is such that many word combinations are infrequent and do not occur in a given corpus. In this work we propose a method for estimating the probability of such previously unseen word combinations using available information on \"most similar\" words.","We describe a probabilistic word association model based on distributional word similarity, and apply it to improving probability estimates for unseen word bigrams in a variant of Katz's back-off model. The similarity-based method yields a 20% perplexity improvement in the prediction of unseen bigrams and statistically significant reductions in speech-recognition error."]},{"title":"Introduction","paragraphs":["Data sparseness is an inherent problem in statistical methods for natural language processing. Such methods use statistics on the relative frequencies of configurations of elements in a training corpus to evaluate alternative analyses or interpretations of new samples of text or speech. The most likely analysis will be taken to be the one that contains the most frequent configurations. The problem of data sparseness arises when analyses contain configurations that never occurred in the training corpus. Then it is not possible to estimate probabilities from observed frequencies, andsome other estimation scheme has to be used.","We focus here on a particular kind of configuration, word cooccurrence.

For example, in the bigram models that we study here, the probability P(w21wl) of a conditioned word w2 that has never occurred in training following the conditioning word wl is calculated from the probability of w~, as estimated by w2's frequency in the corpus (Jelinek, Mercer, and Roukos, 1992; Katz, 1987). This method depends on an independence assumption on the cooccurrence of Wl and w2: the more frequent w2 is, the higher will be the estimate of P(w2[wl), regardless of Wl.","Class-based and similarity-based models provide an alternative to the independence assumption. In those models, the relationship between given words is modeled by analogy with other words that are in some sense similar to the given ones.","Brown et a]. (1992) suggest a class-based n-gram model in which words with similar cooccurrence distributions are clustered in word classes. The cooccurrence probability of a given pair of words then is estimated according to an averaged cooccurrence probability of the two corresponding classes. Pereira, Tishby, and Lee (1993) propose a \"soft\" clustering scheme for certain grammatical cooccurrences in which membership of a word in a class is probabilistic. Cooccurrence probabilities of words are then modeled by averaged cooccurrence probabilities of word clusters.","Dagan, Markus, and Markovitch (1993) argue that reduction to a relatively small number of predetermined word classes or clusters may cause a substantial loss of information. Their similarity-based model avoids clustering altogether. Instead, each word is modeled by its own specific class, a set of words which are most similar to it (as in k-nearest neighbor approaches in pattern recognition). Using this scheme, they predict which unobserved cooccurrences are more likely than others. Their model, however, is not probabilistic, that is, it does not provide a probability estimate for unobserved cooccurrences. It cannot therefore be used in a complete probabilistic framework, such as n-gram language models or probabilistic lexicalized grammars (Schabes, 1992; Lafferty, Sleator, and Temperley, 1992).","We now give a similarity-based method for estimating the probabilities of cooccurrences unseen in training. 272 Similarity-based estimation was first used for language modeling in the"]},{"title":"cooccurrence smoothing","paragraphs":["method of Essen and Steinbiss (1992), derived from work on acoustic model smoothing by Sugawara et al.

Then we redistribute that mass to unseen cooccurrences according to an averaged cooccurrence distribution of a set of most similar conditioning words, using relative entropy as our similarity measure.

The values of f~, 7 and t are the best ones found for each k. 3","From equation (6), it is clear that the computational cost of applying the similarity model to an unseen bigram is O(k). Therefore, lower values for k (and also for t) are computationally preferable. From the table, we can see that reducing k to 30 incurs a penalty of less than 1% in the perplexity improvement, so relatively low values of k appear to be sufficient to achieve most of the benefit of the similarity model. As the table also shows, the best value of 7 increases as k decreases, that is, for lower k a greater weight is given to the conditioned word's frequency. This suggests that the predictive power of neighbors beyond the closest 30 or so can be modeled fairly well by the overall frequency of the conditioned word.","The bigram similarity model was also tested as a language model in speech recognition. The test data for this experiment were pruned word lattices for 403 WSJ closed-vocabulary test sentences. Arc scores in those lattices are sums of an acoustic score (negative log likelihood) and a language-model score, in this case the negative log probability provided by the baseline bigram model.","From the given lattices, we constructed new lattices in which the arc scores were modified to use the similarity model instead of the baseline model. We compared the best sentence hypothesis in each original lattice and in the modified one, and counted the word disagreements in which one of the hypotheses is correct. There were a total of 96 such disagreements. The similarity model was correct in 64 cases, and the back-off model in 32. This advantage for the similarity model is statistically significant at the 0.01 level. The overall reduction in error rate is small, from 21.4% to 20.9%, because the number of disagreements is small compared with","3Values of fl and t refer to base 10 logarithms and exponentials in all calculations. the overall number of errors in our current recognition setup.","Table 2 shows some examples of speech recognition disagreements between the two models.

Notice, however, that the choice of back-off or interpolation is independent from the similarity model used. Further Research Our model provides a basic scheme for probabilistic similarity-based estimation that can be developed in several directions. First, variations of (6) may be tried, such as different similarity metrics and different weight-ing schemes. Also, some simplification of the current model parameters may be possible, especially with respect to the parameters t and k used to select the nearest neighbors of a word. A more substantial variation would be to base the model on similarity between conditioned words rather than on similarity between conditioning words.","Other evidence may be combined with the similarity-based estimate.

Although the scheme was originally proposed as a preferred way of implementing the independence assumption, we suggest that it is also appropriate for implementing similarity-based models, as well as class-based models. It enables us to rely on direct maximum likelihood estimates when reliable statistics are available, and only otherwise resort to the estimates of an \"indirect\" model.","The improvement we achieved for a bigram model is statistically significant, though modest in its overall effect because of the small proportion of unseen events. While we have used bigrams as an easily-accessible plat-form to develop and test the model, more substantial improvements might be obtainable for more informative configurations.
