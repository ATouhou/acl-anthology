In this paper, I will discuss the effect of using variables in lexical category assignments in CCGs. It will be shown that using variables in lexical categories can increase the weak generative capacity of CCGs beyond the class of grammars listed above."]},{"title":"A Formal Definition for CCGs","paragraphs":["In categorial grammars, grammatical entities are of two types:"]},{"title":"basic categories and functions.","paragraphs":["A basic category such as NP serves as a shorthand for a set of syntactic and semantic features.

Steedman uses type-raising of NPs to capture syntactic coordination and extraction facts. In Steedman's Dutch grammar (1985), variables are used in the lexical category for type-raised NPs, i.e. the variable v in the category v/(v\\NP) generalizes across all possible verbal categories. The use of variables allows the type-raised NPs in the following coordinated sentence to easily combine together, using the forward composition rule, even though they are arguments of different verbs.","(1) ...dat [Jan Piet] en [Cecilia Henk] zag zwemmen. ...that [Jan Pietl and [Cecilia Henkl saw swim. ...that Jan saw Piet and Cecilia saw Henk swim.

If we assume that L' is a Tree-Adjoining Language (TAL), then L would be a TAL as well since TALs are closed under intersection with Regular languages. However, since we know that L is not a TAL, L' cannot be a TAL either. Thus, G' generates a language that TAGs and CCGs cannot. Conclusions We have seen that using variables in the lexical categories of a CCG can increase its weak generative capacity. However, there is some linguistic motivation for looking at the more powerful formalism of VAR-CCGs. As argued by Gazdar (1985), this extra power may be necessary in order to capture coordination in natural languages. We have seen that type-raised categories with variables in CCGs can be used to capture syntactic coordination and extraction facts in Dutch (Steedman 1985). Further research is needed to decide whether this linguistic motivation warrants the move to a more powerful formalism.","Although VAR-CCGs have a greater weak generative capacity than the class including TAGs, HGs, CCGs, and LIGs, we conjecture that it is still a mildly context-sensitive grammar as defined by Joshi (1985). The language discussed above is a mildly context-sensitive language since it observes the constant growth and semilinearity properties. It is an open question whether VAR-CCGs can generate languages which are beyond mildly context-sensitive. Note that MC-TAGs, which are a more powerful extension of TAGs, can also generate languages like L, and they are known to be mildly context-sensitive formalisms (Weir 1988). In future research, we will investigate exactly what the resulting generative capacity of VAR-CCGs is.
