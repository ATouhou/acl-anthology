The cluster of papers in the final section stems from the student session, featured at the meeting for the 3rd successive year and testifying to the vigor of this emerging tradition.","The number and quality of submitted papers was again gratifying, and all authors deserve our collective plaudits for the efforts they invested despite the well-known risks of submitting to a highly selective conference. It was their efforts that once again ensured a Meeting (and Proceedings) reflecting the highest standards in computational linguistics, offering a tour of some of the most significant recent advances and most lively research frontiers.","Special thanks go to our invited speakers, Wolfgang Wahlster, Geoff Nunberg and Barbara Partee, for contributing their insights and panache to the conference; to Philip Cohen for concocting and coordinating a varied and relevant tutorial program, and to Helen Gigley, Steve Small, Alexis Manaster Ramer, Wlodek Zadrozny, Kent Wittenburg, David D. Lewis, and Elizabeth D. Liddy for offering the tutorials; to Linda Suri and Sandra Carberry for very effectively co-organizing the program for the student sessions (see the separate preface for the student session papers); to Terry Patten for directing local arrangements, and to Robert Kasper for helping with local arrangements and coordinating exhibits and demonstrations.","In an effort to increase the fairness of reviewing, we opted for \"blind\" reviewing this year. Also, to reduce the load upon program committee members to a more humanly manageable level, to curtail frantic last-minute searches for specialist reviewers, and to allow more methodical, uniform, interactive reviewing of submissions, the size of the program committee was expanded this year to include 22 members be-sides the chair. The load was still heavy, but the committee members performed their duties in an exemplary fashion; in the five-week reviewing period which culminated in the one-day program committee meeting, they spared no efforts to arrive at detailed, accurate and principled assessments, and at the best possible program for the Meeting. Their heroic service is hereby acknowledged: Robert Carpenter,"]},{"title":"Carnegie Mellon University;","paragraphs":["Garrison Cottrell,"]},{"title":"University of California at San Diego;","paragraphs":["Robert Dale,"]},{"title":"University of Edinburgh;","paragraphs":["Bonnie Dorr,"]},{"title":"University of Maryland;","paragraphs":["Julia Hirschberg,"]},{"title":"AT&T Bell Labs;","paragraphs":["Paul Jacobs,"]},{"title":"General Electric Corporate R&D;","paragraphs":["Robert Kasper,"]},{"title":"Ohio State","paragraphs":["U; Slava Katz,"]},{"title":"IBM TJ Watson Research Center;","paragraphs":["Judith Klavans,"]},{"title":"Columbia U;","paragraphs":["Bemard Lang,"]},{"title":"IN-RIA;","paragraphs":["Diane Litman,"]},{"title":"AT&T Bell Laboratories;","paragraphs":["Mitch Marcus,"]},{"title":"University of Pennsylvania; Kath-","paragraphs":["leen McCoy,"]},{"title":"University of Delaware;","paragraphs":["Marc Moens,"]},{"title":"University of Edinburgh;","paragraphs":["Johanna Moore,"]},{"title":"University of Pittsburgh;","paragraphs":["John Nerbonne,"]},{"title":"German Research Center for","paragraphs":["A/; James Pustejovsky,"]},{"title":"Brandeis University;","paragraphs":["Uwe Reyle,"]},{"title":"University of Stuttgart;","paragraphs":["Richard Sproat,"]},{"title":"AT&T Bell Laboratories;","paragraphs":["Jun-ichi Tsujii,"]},{"title":"University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology;","paragraphs":["Gregory Ward,"]},{"title":"Northwestern University;","paragraphs":["Janyce Wiebe,"]},{"title":"New Mexico State University,","paragraphs":["At this point it is also appropriate for me to convey my appreciation and gratitude to Peggy Meeker, who handled the flood of regular and email correspondence, the massive record-keeping and accounting, and the arrangement of meetings in connection with the activities of the program committee. She helped expertly and unstintingly, despite all her other duties, and usually had things done by the time I thought of doing them. Many thanks also to the Computer Science Department at Rochester for accommodating the extra load created by the reviewing and program planning process.","Throughout the entire planning for the meeting, starting well before the formation of the program committee, the ACL executive provided continuous and invaluable help in the committee search and on many matters of policy and logistics. If the meeting was a success, it was very much through their guidance. One of the mainstays of that committee is, of course, Don Walker. I now know that the effusive tributes I had noticed in previous Proceedings to Don's manifold and essential role are more than deserved. He is indeed the cohesive force, the publicist, the keeper and provider of records, traditions and standards for ACL, and most of all an ever-ready, ever-effective helper and advisor. My heartfelt thanks to him as well as to Betty Walker who as ever put her shoulder to the wheel alongside his.

While neither this brain hardware nor the specific computations for producing and comprehending language are well understood, certain facts are available and a number of well supported hypotheses are under investigation. It is our view that the study of language performance has a potentially large role to play in computational linguistics, and that the study of brain mechanisms underlying this performance may yield insights into issues of importance for construction of artificial systems that process natural language.","This tutorial is organized into two sections. The first part describes the functional neuroanatomy of the brain, with greatest emphasis on methods of testing language function in the brain, the sorts of results that have been obtained, and what these imply for the structure of brain computations and for the nature of human language. Demonstrations of people with language impairments (live or on videotape) as well as example computed tomographic and/or magnetic resonance images will supplement descriptive material.","The second part of the tutorial will discuss two broad computational subjects, cognitive modelling and practical natural language processing. A number of researchers are constructing computer models of cognitive neuropsychological phenomena, many involving language, using both symbolic and connectionist methods. Several examples of such models and the neurobiological and psychological data that constrain their processing architectures will be discussed. While certain aspects of linguistic data and theory have been successfully applied to the construction of practical NLP systems, theoretical notions from neurobiology have not played much role. This topic will be discussed with practical suggestions on using data and theory from cognitive neuroscience to construct new NLP systems or to improve existing ones. Mathematics of Language: How to Measure the Complexity of Natural Languages Alexis Manaster Ramer, Wayne State University Wlodek Zadrozny, IBM T.J. Watson Research Center","This tutorial will survey the uses of formal language, automata, and complexity theory in computational linguistics, seeking to answer such questions as whether natural languages are, for example, context-free or parsable in deterministic polynomial time. More generally, we will consider the question of how these formal theories can best be applied to NLs in a computational setting, focusing on such issues as the properties of constructions vs. those of languages, the formalization and computational uses Chomsky's intuitions about \"E-\" vs. \"I-language\", the relative power of different models of NL, the formal treatment of computational models of\"performance\", and, finally, some startling new results about the power of models of semantics. Multimedia and Multimodal Parsing Kent Wittenburg, Bellcore","As new information channels and input devices arrive on the scene, the spectrum of possibilities and challenges for in-terpretation increases beyond single-channel text or speech. First, there is integration of more than one modality -- speech and simultaneous pointing being a paramount example. Second, characterizing and processing expressions in nonlinear input media requires extensions to the usual linear, string-based methods. Examples of nonlinear input include static figures and diagrams; interactive gesturing, writing, and drawing; live cameras and stored video; and data from eye-tracking hardware and 3D devices such as spaceballs or datagloves.","This tutorial is directed towards ACL members who would like to be be made aware of current research in parsing and in-terpretation of such media. The focus will be on identifying problems for which extensions to grammatical representation and parsing methods already in common practice in computational linguistics may provide solutions. We will consider the problem of characterizing multidimensional expressions separately and concurrently as languages and then survey techniques for parsing and interpreting them. The tutorial will initially include a brief characterization of current research and practice in interpreting nonlinear and multimodal input along these lines. Then it will highlight some of the more interesting grammatical frameworks, with a brief overview of graph grammars as well as an introduction to current research from the visual languages community. We will close with a detailed example using Relational Grammars, a framework for multidimensional languages that cuts across several of the current proposals for constraint-based grammars and parsing methods. Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval David D. Lewis, AT&T Bell Laboratories Elizabeth D. Liddy, Syracuse University","This tutorial will discuss the application of natural language processing methods to support more effective text retrieval and text categorization. We will present a comprehensive discussion of the use of NLP methods to address particular characteristics of human language that make these tasks difficult. In parallel, we will also consider more traditional \"non-NLP\" methods for addressing the same problems, and discuss the tradeoffs for each. One theme of the tutorial is that the line between NLP and non-NLP methods in IR is becoming quite fuzzy, with the increasing use of statistical and other robust techniques in NLP. Linguistic examples will be drawn primarily from English, plus some from Japanese and other languages. ooo VUl"]},{"title":"TABLE OF CONTENTS","paragraphs":["Char_align: A Program for Aligning Parallel Texts at the Character Level Kenneth Ward Church .......................................................................................................................................... 1","Aligning Sentences in Bilingual Corpora Using Lexical Information Stanley Chen ......................................................................................................................................................... 9","An Algorithm for Finding Noun Phrase Correspondences in Bilingual Corpora Julian Kupiec ...................................................................................................................................................... 17","Structural Matching of Parallel Texts Yuji Matsumoto, Hiroyuki Ishimoto, Takehito Utsuro, & Makoto Nagao ........................................................ 23","Towards History-Based Grammars: Using Richer Models for Probabilistic Parsing Ezra Black, Fred Jelinek, John Lafferty, David M.
