This paper presents the experience of attempting a two-level phonology for certain Indian languages; the problems faced in this attempt and their resolution. The languages we consider are Tamil and Hindi. For the languages considered we want to show that practical descriptions of their morphology can be achieved by a simple generalization of the two-level model. Although the basic two-level model has been generalized in this paper, the extensions do not affect the complexity or the basic tenets of the two-level model."]},{"title":"SOME PROBLEMS FOR THE TWO-LEVEL MODEL","paragraphs":["The two-level model is descriptively adequate for most morphological processes occuring in Indian languages.

As all phonological rules are applied simultaneously, the two-level model can describe the above data only with the use of arbitrary diacritics in the lexical representation. The same problem occurs in Hindi. In Table 1 (6) and (7) follow regular Hindi phonology, while (4) and (5) which have descended from Sanskrit display the use of Sanskrit phonology. All these examples show that any model of this phonological be-haviour will have to allow access for a certain class of words to the phonology of another language whose rules might conflict with its own. 304"]},{"title":"Nom.

To handle (8) and (9) we could have lexical forms padiI and padiY tagged with the appropriate sense and with duplicated phonological rules. But introducing artificial lexical representations has the disadvantage that two-level rules that assume the same lexical environment across classes of words have to be duplicated, lead-ing to an inefficient set of rules. A more adequate method, which increases notational felicity without affecting the computational complexity of the two-level model is described in the next section."]},{"title":"EXTENDING THE TWO-LEVEL MODEL","paragraphs":["The extended two-level model presented allows each lexical entity to choose a set of phonological rules that can be applied for its recognition and generation.","Consider the two level rules 1 that apply to example (1).

To overcome this, each lexical entry is associated with a subset of two-level rules chosen from the complete set of possible rules. Each morpheme applies its respec: tive subset in word recognition and generation.","Consider a fictional example--(ll) below--to illustrate how the extended model works.","1 2 3","(II) LR: haX + mel + lek SR: hom Orael OOek Rlla: a:o ~ C X: (+:0) Rllb:X:{m,O} ~ a: (+:0) {m, m} Rllc: l:0 ~ l:l (+:0) Rlla transforms a to o in the proper environment, Rllb geminates m and Rllc degeminates 1. 3 Assume rule Rlla that is applied to a in morpheme 1--haX--cannot be used in a general way without conflicts with the complete set of two-level rules applicable. To avoid conflict we assign a subset of two-level rules, say P1, to morpheme 1 which it applies between its morpheme boundaries. Morphemes 2 and 3 both apply rule subset P2 between their respective boundaries. For instance, P1 here will be the rule set {Rlla, Rllb, Rllc} and P2 will be {Rllb, lZllc}.

All the rules are still applied in parallel. At any time in the recognition or generation process there is still only one complete set of two-level rules being used. Any rule (finite state transducer) that fails and which does not belong to the subset claimed by a morpheme being realized is set back to the start state. This mechanism allows mutually conflicting phonological rules to co-exist in the two-level rulebase and allow them to apply in their appropriate environments.","For instance, if we have a lexical entry laX in addition to the morphemes introduced in (11), then we can have realizations such as (12) by adding R12 to the above rules."]},{"title":"(12) LR: laX+mel+lek SR:","paragraphs":["limOmelOOek R12: a:i ¢: C X: (+:0)","Thus lax uses a rule subset P3 which consists of rules {R12, Rllb, Rllc}.

Can this be justified within the two-level model? Each rule has a lexical to surface realization which it applies when it finds that the left context and the right context specified in the rule is satisfied. In the extended model, if a rule fails and it does not belong to the rule set associated with the current morpheme, then by resetting it to its start state we are assuming that the rule's left context has not yet begun. The left context of the rule can begin with the next character in the same morpheme. This property means that we can have conflicting rules that apply within the same word.","In practice it is better to use an equivalent method where a set of two-level rules that"]},{"title":"cannot","paragraphs":["apply between its boundaries is stored with a morpheme. If one or more of these rules fail and they belong to the set associated with that morpheme then the rule is simply reset to the start state else we try another path towards the analysis of the word.","The model presented handles both additive and mutually exclusive rules, whereas in a system in which a few morphs specify additional rules and inherit the rest, mutually exclusive rules have to be handled with the additional complexity of the defeasible inheritance of two-level rules.","It is easy to see that the extensions do not increase the computational complexity of the basic two-level model. We have one additional lexical tag per morpheme and one check for set membership at every failure of a rule. CONCLUSION We have shown that some examples from languages such as Tamil and Hindi cannot be effectively described under Kimmo's two-level model. An extension to the basic two-level model is discussed which allows morphemes to associate with them rule subsets which correspond to a certain phonology which gives the morpheme a valid description. The extension to Kimmo's two-level model gives us the following advantages: * rules that conflict in surface realization can be","used, • it gives more descriptive power, • the number of rules are reduced, • no increase in computational complexity over","Kimmo's two-level model.
