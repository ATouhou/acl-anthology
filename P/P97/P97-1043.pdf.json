Contrary to previous studies on heavily restricted dependency grammars, we prove that recognition (and thus, parsing) of linguistically adequate dependency grammars is~A/T'-complete."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["The introduction of dependency grammar (DG) into modern linguistics is marked by Tesni~re (1959). His conception addressed didactic goals and, thus, did not aim at formal precision, but rather at an intuitive understanding of semantically motivated dependency relations. An early formalization was given by Gaifman (1965), who showed the generative capacity of DG to be (weakly) equivalent to standard context-free grammars. Given this equivalence, interest in DG as a linguistic framework diminished considerably, although many dependency grammarians view Gaifman's conception as an unfortunate one (cf. Section 2). To our knowledge, there has been no other formal study of DG.This is reflected by a recent study (Lombardo & Lesmo, 1996), which applies the Earley parsing technique (Earley, 1970) to DG, and thereby achieves cubic time complexity for the analysis of DG. In their discussion, Lombardo & Lesmo express their hope that slight increases in generative capacity will correspond to equally slight increases in computational complexity. It is this claim that we challenge here.","After motivating non-projective analyses for DG, we investigate various variants of DG and identify the separation of dominance and precedence as a major part of current DG theorizing. Thus, no current variant of DG (not even Tesni~re's original formulation) is compatible with Gaifman' s conception, which seems to be motivated by formal considerations only (viz., the proof of equivalence). Section 3 advances our proposal, which cleanly separates dominance and precedence relations. This is illustrated in the fourth section, where we give a simple encoding of an A/P-complete problem in a discontinuous DG. Our proof of A/79-completeness, however, does not rely on discontinuity, but only requires unordered trees. It is adapted from a similar proof for unordered context-free grammars (UCFGs) by Barton (1985)."]},{"title":"2 Versions of Dependency Grammar","paragraphs":["The growing interest in the dependency concept (which roughly corresponds to the O-roles of GB, subcategorization in HPSG, and the so-called domain of locality of TAG) again raises the issue whether non-lexical categories are necessary for linguistic analysis. After reviewing several proposals in this section, we argue in the next section that word order -- the description of which is the most prominent difference between PSGs and DGs"]},{"title":"--","paragraphs":["can adequately be described without reference to non-lexical categories.","Standard PSG trees are projective, i.e., no branches cross when the terminal nodes are projected onto the input string. In contrast to PSG approaches, DG requires non-projective analyses. As DGs are restricted to lexical nodes, one cannot, e.g., describe the so-called unbounded dependencies without giving up projectivity. First, the categorial approach employing partial constituents (Huck, 1988; Hepple, 1990) is not available, since there are no phrasal categories. Second, the coindexing (Haegeman, 1994) or structure-sharing (Pollard & Sag, 1994) approaches are not available, since there are no empty categories.","Consider the extracted NP in \"Beans, I know John likes\" (cf. also to Fig.1 in Section 3). A projective tree would require \"Beans\" to be connected to either \"I\" or \"know\" - none of which is conceptually directly related to \"Beans\". It is \"likes\" that determines syntactic"]},{"title":"fea-","paragraphs":["337 tures of \"Beans\" and which provides a semantic role for it. The only connection between \"know\" and \"Beans\" is that the finite verb allows the extraction of \"Beans\", thus defining order restrictions for the NP. This has led some DG variants to adopt a general graph structure with multiple heads instead of trees. We will refer to DGs allowing non-projective analyses as discontinuous DGs.","Tesni~re (1959) devised a bipartite grammar theory which consists of a dependency component and a translation component (' translation' used in a technical sense denoting a change of category and grammatical function). The dependency component defines four main categories and possible dependencies between them. What is of interest here is that there is no mentioning of order in TesniSre's work. Some practitioneers of DG have allowed word order as a marker for translation, but they do not prohibit non-projective trees.","Gaifman (1965) designed his DG entirely analogous to context-free phrase structure grammars. Each word is associated with a category, which functions like the non-terminals in CFG. He then defines the following rule format for dependency grammars:"]},{"title":"(1) X(Y,,... , Y~, ,, Y~+I,..., Y,,)","paragraphs":["This rule states that a word of category X governs words of category Y1,... , Yn which occur in the given order. The head (the word of category X) must occur between the i-th and the (i + 1)-th modifier. The rule can be viewed as an ordered tree of depth one with node labels. Trees are combined through the identification of the root of one tree with a leaf of identical category of another tree. This formalization is restricted to projective trees with a completely specified order of sister nodes. As we have argued above, such a formulation cannot capture semantically motivated dependencies."]},{"title":"2.1 Current Dependency Grammars","paragraphs":["Today's DGs differ considerably from Gaifman's conception, and we will very briefly sketch various order descriptions, showing that DGs generally dissociate dominance and precedence by some mechanism. All variants share, however, the rejection of phrasal nodes (although phrasal features are sometimes allowed) and the introduction of edge labels (to distinguish different dependency relations).","Meaning-Text Theory (Mer 5uk, 1988) assumes seven strata of representation. The rules mapping from the unordered dependency trees of surface-syntactic representations onto the annotated lexeme sequences of deepmorphological representations include global ordering rules which allow discontinuities. These rules have not yet been formally specified (Mel' 5uk & Pertsov, 1987, p. 187f), but see the proposal by Rambow & Joshi (1994). Word Grammar (Hudson, 1990) is based on general graphs. The ordering of two linked words is specified to-gether with their dependency relation, as in the proposition \"object of verb succeeds it\". Extraction is analyzed by establishing another dependency, visitor, between the verb and the extractee, which is required to precede the verb, as in \"visitor of verb precedes it\". Resulting inconsistencies, e.g. in case of an extracted object, are not resolved, however.","Lexicase (Starosta, 1988; 1992) employs complex feature structures to represent lexical and syntactic entities. Its word order description is much like that of Word Grammar (at least at some level of abstraction), and shares the above inconsistency.","Dependency Unification Grammar (Hellwig, 1988) defines a tree-like data structure for the representation of syntactic analyses. Using morphosyntactic features with special interpretations, a word defines abstract positions into which modifiers are mapped. Partial orderings and even discontinuities can thus be described by allowing a modifier to occupy a position defined by some transitive head. The approach cannot restrict discontinuities properly, however.","Slot Grammar (McCord, 1990) employs a number of rule types, some of which are exclusively concerned with precedence. So-called head/slot and slot/slot ordering rules describe the precedence in projective trees, referring to arbitrary predicates over head and modifiers. Extractions (i.e., discontinuities) are merely handled by a mechanism built into the parser.","This brief overview of current DG flavors shows that various mechanisms (global rules, general graphs, procedural means) are generally employed to lift the limitation to projective trees. Our own approach presented below improves on these proposals because it allows the lexicalized and declarative formulation of precedence constraints. The necessity of non-projective analyses in DG results from examples like \"Beans, 1 know John likes\" and the restriction to lexical nodes which prohibits gapthreading and other mechanisms tied to phrasal categories."]},{"title":"3 A Dependency Grammar with Word Order Domains","paragraphs":["We now sketch a minimal DG that incorporates only word classes and word order as descriptional dimensions. The separation of dominance and precedence presented here grew out of our work on German, and retains the local flavor of dependency specification, while at the same time covering arbitrary discontinuities. It is based on a (modal) logic with model-theoretic interpretation, which is presented in more detail in (Br~ker, 1997). 338"]},{"title":"f know //~,,,@x i ~es ~ ) I dl d2","paragraphs":["Figure 1: Word order domains in \"Beans, I know John likes\" 3.1 Order Specification Our initial observation is that DG cannot use binary precedence constraints as PSG does. Since DG analyses are hierarchically flatter, binary precedence constraints result in inconsistencies, as the analyses of Word Grammar and Lexicase illustrate. In PSG, on the other hand, the phrasal hierarchy separates the scope of precedence restrictions. This effect is achieved in our approach by defining word order domains as sets of words, where precedence restrictions apply only to words within the same domain. Each word defines a sequence of order domains, into which the word and its modifiers are placed.","Several restrictions are placed on domains. First, the domain sequence must mirror the precedence of the words included, i.e., words in a prior domain must precede all words in a subsequent domain. Second, the order domains must be hierarchically ordered by set inclusion, i.e., be projective. Third, a domain (e.g., dl in Fig.l) can be constrained to contain at most one partial dependency tree. l We will write singleton domains as \"_\", while other domains are represented by \"-\". The precedence of words within domains is described by binary precedence restrictions, which must be locally satisfied in the domain with which they are associated. Considering Fig. 1 again, a precedence restriction for \"likes\" to precede its object has no effect, since the two are in different domains. The precedence constraints are formulated as a binary relation \"~\" over dependency labels, including the special symbol \"self\" denoting the head. Discontinuities can easily be characterized, since a word may be contained in any domain of (nearly) any of its transitive heads. If a domain of its direct head contains the modifier, a continuous dependency results. If, however, a modifier is placed in a domain of some transitive head (as \"Beans\" in Fig. 1), discontinuities occur. Bound-ing effects on discontinuities are described by specifying that certain dependencies may not be crossed. 2 For the tFor details, cf. (Br6ker, 1997). 2German data exist that cannot be captured by the (more","common) bounding of discontinuities by nodes of a certain purpose of this paper, we need not formally introduce the bounding condition, though.","A sample domain structure is given in Fig.l, with two domains dl and d2 associated with the governing verb \"know\" (solid) and one with the embedded verb \"likes\" (dashed). dl may contain only one partial dependency tree, the extracted phrase, d2 contains the rest of the sentence. Both domains are described by (2), where the domain sequence is represented as \"<<\". d2 contains two precedence restrictions which require that \"know\" (represented by self) must follow the subject (first precedence constraint) and precede the object (second precedence constraint)."]},{"title":"(2) __ { } << ----. { (subject -.< self), (self --< object)} 3.2 Formal Description","paragraphs":["The following notation is used in the proof.
