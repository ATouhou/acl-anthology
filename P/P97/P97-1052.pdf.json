Although f-structures are first and foremost syntactic representations they do encode some semantic information, namely basic predicate argument structure in the semantic form value of the PRED attribute.

The details of the LFG and UDRT formalisms are described at length elsewhere: here we briefly present the very basics of the UDRS formalism; we define a language of wff-s (well-formed f-structures); we define a mapping 7\" from f-structures to UDRSs together with a reverse mapping r -1 and we show correctness with respect to an independent semantics (Dalrymple et al., 1996). Finally, unlike QLF the UDRS formalism comes equipped with an inference mechanism which operates directly on the underspecified representations without the need of considering cases. We illustrate our approach with a simple example involving the UDRS deduction component (see also (KSnig and Reyle, 1996) where amongst other things the possibility of direct deductions on f-structures is discussed). 2 Underspecified Discourse Representation Structures In standard DRT (Kamp and Reyle, 1993) scope relations between quantificational structures and operators are unambiguously specified in terms of the structure and nesting of boxes. UDRT (Reyle, 1993; Reyle, 1995) allows partial specifications of scope relations. Textual definitions of UDRSs are based on a labeling (indexing) of DRS conditions and a statement of a partial ordering relation between the labels. The language of UDRSs is based on a set L of labels, a set Ref of discourse referents and a set Rel of relation symbols. It features two types of conditions: 1","1. (a) if/E L and x E Refthen l : x is a condition (b) if 1 E L, R E Rel a n-place relation and","Xl, ..,Xn E Ref then l :"]},{"title":"P(Xl, ..,Xn)","paragraphs":["is a condition (c) if li, lj E L then li : '~lj is a condition","(d) if li, lj, Ik E L then li : lj ::¢, l~ is a condition","(e) if l, ll,...,ln E L then l: V(ll,...,ln) is a condition","2. if li, Ij E L then li < lj is a condition where _< is a partial ordering defining an upper semi-lattice with a top element. UDRSs are pairs of a set of type 2 conditions with a set of type 1 conditions:","• A UDRS /C is a pair (L,C) where L = (i,<) is an upper semi-lattice of labels and C a set of conditions of type 1 above such that if li : ~lj E","1The definition abstracts away from some of the complexities in the full definitions of the UDRS language (Reyle, 1993).

They ensure, e.g., that verbs are subordinated with respect to their scope inducing arguments, that scope sensitive elements obey the restrictions postulated by whatever syntactic theory is adopted, that potential antecedents are scoped with respect to their anaphoric potential etc. Below we list the basic cases:","• Clause Boundedness: the scope of genuinely quantificational structures is clause bounded.

We have formulated a reverse translation from UDRSs back into f-structures and established a one-to-one correspondence between subsets of the LFG and UDRT formalisms. As it stands, however, the level of f-structure representation does not express the full range of subordination constraints available in UDRT. In this paper we have covered the most basic parts, the easy bits. The method has to be extended to a more extensive fragment to prove (or disprove) its mettle. The UDRT and QLF (Genabith and Crouch, 1996) interpretations of f-structures invite comparison of the two semantic formalisms.
