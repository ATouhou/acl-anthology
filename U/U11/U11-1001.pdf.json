This talk will view topic models as a technique within these paradigms. Some visualisations will be reviewed, as well as a variety of different topic models, and some of the natural language processing issues involved in working with the models. Finally, some of the non-parametric statistical methods underlying the analysis will be reviewed because they are fascinating as well."]},{"title":"Short Biography","paragraphs":["Dr. Wray Buntine joined NICTA in Canberra Australia in April 2007 and is a Principal Researcher working on applying machine learning and probabilistic methods to tasks such as information access and text analysis.
