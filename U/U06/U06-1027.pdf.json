This paper proposes a novel mark-up tag set to cover a wide variety of semantics in the description of clinical case studies in the clinical literature. A manually annotated corpus which consists of 75 clinical reports with 5,117 sentences has been created and a sentence classification system is reported as the preliminary attempt to exploit the fast growing online repositories of clinical case reports."]},{"title":"1 Corpus and Mark-up Tags","paragraphs":["This paper proposes a mark-up scheme aimed at recovering key semantics of clinical case reports in journal articles. The development of this mark-up tag set is the result of analysing information needs of clinicians for building a better health information system. During the development of this tag set, domain experts were constantly consulted for their input and advice. 1.1 The Mark-up Tag Set","• Sign is a signal that indicates the existence or nonexistence of a disease as observed by clinicians during the diagnostic and treatment procedure. Typical signs of a patient include the appearance of the patient, readings or analytical results of laboratory tests, or responses to a medical treatment.","• Symptom is also an indication of disorder or disease but is noted by patients rather than by clinicians. For instance, a patient can experience weakness, fatigue, or pain during the illness.","• Medical test is a specific type of sign in which a quantifiable or specific value has been identified by a medical testing procedure, such as blood pressure or white blood cell count.","• Diagnostic test gives analytical results for diagnosis purposes as observed by clinicians in a medical testing procedure. It differs from a medical test in that it generally returns no quantifiable value or reading as its result. The expertise of clinicians is required to read and analyse the result of a diagnostic test, such as interpreting an X-ray image.","• Diagnosis identifies conditions that are diagnosed by clinicians.","• Treatment is the therapy or medication that patients received.","• Referral specifies another unit or department to which patients are referred for further examination or treatment.","• Patient health profile identifies characteristics of patient health histories, including social behaviors.","• Patient demographics outlines the details and backgrounds of a patient.","• Causation is a speculation about the cause of a particular abnormal condition, circumstance or case.","• Exceptionality states the importance and merits of the reported case. 167 Total articles 75 Total sentences 5,117 Total sentences with tag 2,319 Total tokens 112,382 Total tokens with tag 48,394 Table 1: Statistics of the Corpus","• Case recommendations marks the advice for clinicians or other readers of the report.","• Exclusion rules out a particular causation or phenomenon in a report. 1.2 The Corpus The corpus described in this paper is a collection of recent research articles that report clinical findings by medical researchers. To make the data representative of the clinical domain, a wide variety of topics have been covered in the corpus, such as cancers, gene-related diseases, viral and bacteria infections, and sports injuries. The articles were randomly selected and downloaded from BioMed Central1",". During the selection stage, those reports that describe a group of patients are removed. As a result, this corpus is confined to clinical reports on individual patients. A single human annotator (first author) has manually tagged all the articles in the corpus. The statistical profile of the corpus is shown in Table 1."]},{"title":"2 The Sentence Classification Task","paragraphs":["The patient case studies corpus provides a promis-ing source for automatically extracting knowledge from clinical records. As a preliminary experiment, an information extraction task has been conducted to assign each sentence in the corpus with appropriate tags. Among the total of 2,319 sentences that have tags, there are 544 (23.5%) sentences assigned more than one tag. This overlapping feature of the tag assignment makes a single multi-class classifier approach not appropriate for the task. Instead, each tag has been given a separate machine-learned classifier capable of as-signing a binary ’Yes’ or ’No’ label for a sentence according to whether or not the sentence includes the targeted information as defined by the tag set. Meanwhile, a supervised-learning approach was adopted in this experiment. 1 http://www.biomedcentral.com/ Tag Precision Recall F1 Diagnostic test 66.6 46.8 55.0 Medical test 80.4 51.6 62.9 Treatment 67.6 44.7 53.8 Diagnosis 62.5 33.8 43.8 Sign 61.2 50.5 55.4 Symptom 67.8 45.8 54.7 Patient demographics 91.6 73.1 81.3 Patient health profile 53.0 24.1 33.2 Table 2: Sentence Classification Result for Some Semantic Tags","A Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) classifier2","and a SVM classifier (SVM-light) with tree kernel (Moschitti, 2004; Joachims, 1999) were used in the experiment. The SVM classifier used two different kernels in the experiment: a linear kernel (SVM t=1), and a combination of sub-tree kernel and linear kernel (SVM t=6). The introduction of the tree kernel was an attempt to evaluate the effectiveness of incorporating syntactic clues for the task. The feature set used in the experiment consists of unigrams, bigrams, and title of the current section. The experiment results for selected mark-up tags are shown in Table 2."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["We wish to thank Prof Deborah Saltman for defin-ing the tag categories and Joel Nothman for refin-ing their use on texts."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Thorsten Joachims. 1999.
