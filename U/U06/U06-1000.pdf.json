This is the fourth annual installment of the workshop in its most-recent incarnation, and the continuation of an annual workshop series that has existed under various guises since the early 90s. The goals of the workshop are:","• to bring together the growing Language Technology (LT) community in Australia and New Zealand and encourage interactions; • to foster interaction between academic and industrial researchers; • to encourage dissemination of research results for new and ongoing projects; and • to increase the visibility of LT research in Australia and New Zealand. This year’s Australasian Language Technology Workshop includes regular talks as well as poster presentations and student posters. Of the 36 papers submitted, 19 papers were selected by the program committee for publication and appear in these proceedings. Of these, 13 are oral presentations papers and 6 are poster presentations. Additionally, we have included 6 student posters to encourage feedback on early results. Each full-length submission was independently peer reviewed by at least two members of the international program committee, in accordance with the DEST requirements for E1 conference publications. We would like to thank all the authors who submitted papers, as well as the members of the program committee for the time and effort they contributed in reviewing the papers. Our thanks also go to local organizer Rolf Schwitter, to Jiawen Rong for installing and configuring the submission management system, and to members of the ALTA executive for their support in organizing the workshop. This year, ALTW is held as part of the HCSNet (ARC Network in Human Communication Science) SummerFest. We thank HCSNet for its invaluable financial and organisational support, including organising the venue and refreshments, printing the proceedings, handling registration, and particularly for providing travel funds to all presenters, including the invited international speaker: Michael Johnston (AT&T Labs Research). A special thanks goes to Kym Buckley of HCSNet for her immense effort in managing the organisation of the HCSNet events, including ALTW.
