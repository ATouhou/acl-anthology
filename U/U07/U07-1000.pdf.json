This is the fifth annual installment of the workshop in its most recent incarnation, and the continuation of an annual workshop series that has existed under various guises since the early 90s. The goals of the workshop are:","• to bring together the growing Language Technology (LT) community in Australia and New Zealand and encourage interactions; • to encourage interactions between this community and the international LT community; • to foster interaction between academic and industrial researchers; • to encourage dissemination of research results; • to provide a forum for the discussion of new and ongoing research and projects;","• to provide an opportunity for the broader artificial intelligence community to become aware of local LT research; and, finally, • to increase visibility of LT research in Australia, New Zealand and overseas. This year has seen quite some activity in language technology in Australia, with PACLING 2007, the 10th Conference of the Pacific Association for Computational Linguistics, being hosted in September also in Melbourne. In addition, this year ALTA is co-located with the Australian Document Computing Symposium (ADCS), including a joint session of papers and talks of interest to both communities. This year’s Australasian Language Technology Workshop includes regular talks as well as poster presentations and student posters. Of the 23 papers submitted, 16 papers were selected by the program committee for publication and appear in these proceedings. Of these, 10 are oral presentations and 6 are poster presentations. Additionally, we have included 3 student posters to encourage feedback on early results. Each full-length submission was independently peer reviewed by at least two members of the international program committee, in accordance with the DEST requirements for E1 conference publications. We would like to thank all the authors who submitted papers; the members of the program committee for the time and effort they contributed in reviewing the papers; and our invited speakers, Sophia Ananiadou, Nick Thieberger and Justin Zobel. Our thanks also go to local organisers Nicola Stokes and Lawrence Cavedon, to members of the ALTA executive for their support in organising the workshop, and to our sponsors (NICTA, CSIRO, Inference Communications, Appen, and the University of Melbourne), who enabled us in particular to support student participation in the event.
