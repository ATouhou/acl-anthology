However, linguists are expensive so researchers seek automatic techniques that correlate well with human performance. Linguists working on the ScamSeek project were given the task of deciding how many and which document classes existed in this previously unseen corpus. This paper investigates whether the document classes identified by the linguists correlate significantly with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topics induced from that corpus. Monte-Carlo simulation is used to measure the statistical significance of the correlation between LDA models and the linguists’ characterisations. In experiments, more than 90% of the linguists’ classes met the level required to declare the correlation between linguistic insights and LDA models is significant. These results help verify the usefulness of the LDA model in NLP and are a first step in showing that the LDA model can replace the efforts of linguists in certain tasks like subdividing a corpus into classes."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Since linguists are expensive to employ, there is a preference in most NLP projects to use automatic processes especially where it can be shown that the automatic process approaches the performance of the linguists. Several linguists were used on the ScamSeek project (Patrick, 2006). ScamSeek was created for the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) government agency to identify financial scam websites based on the linguistic properties of the webpage content. A major task they performed by the project linguists was to partition the corpus into classes. Besides defining the classes in terms of the documents assigned to them, the linguists also identified phrases they believed were indicative of each class.","The LDA corpus model (Blei, 2004) can automatically generate a likely set of corpus topics and subdivide the corpus words among those topics. We will show that there are similarities between the task the LDA performs and the tasks the ScamSeek linguists performed. This paper attempts to determine to what degree LDA topics correlate with the judgments of linguists in partitioning a corpus into document classes.","Formally, we set a null hypothesis, H0, to claim that the relationship between the linguists’ document classes and LDA topics is random. The alternative hypothesis, Ha, claims those document classes and the topics have a significant amount of correspondence or correlation between them. In order to measure how significant the correlation is, principled methods of measuring the statistical significance of the correlation must be found. If the p-value for the correlation between a document class and the best correlating topic for that class is less than α = 0.05, then H0 will be rejected in favor of Ha. The determination of the p-values are discussed in the Methods section.

In this model, a topic is a multinomial distribution over terms. According to the LDA model, an author first determines, through a random process, the topic proportions of a new document. Thereafter, the author chooses a topic for the next word and then draws that word randomly according to the chosen topic distribution.","The LDA model can be represented as a graphical model as shown in figure 1. Graphical models represent the dependencies between probabilistic model hyper-parameters and variables. A good introduction can be found in (Buntine, 1995). The LDA model includes two hyper-parameters, α and β as well as three random variables (RV’s), θ1:D, z and w, where D is the number of corpus of documents."]},{"title":"βθ z w","paragraphs":["m,n m,n"]},{"title":"Nm α M","paragraphs":["m Figure 1: The LDA graphical model α takes a scalar value that affects the amount of smoothing of the symmetric Dirichlet (dir) distribution that produces the multinomial (multi) distributed θm, representing the topic proportions for document m. The hyper-parameter β is a k × V matrix of probabilities where V is the size of the corpus vocabulary. Each row of β is a topic multinomial where βij = p(w = j|z = i). The RV z is an index variable that indicates which topic was chosen for each document word (Steyvers and Griffiths, 2005)(Blei, 2004).","Formally, each document m is assumed to be formed by the following generative steps: 1. Choose proportions θm|α ∼ Dir(α). 2. For n ∈ {1, · · · , Nm}:","(a) Choose topic zm,n ∼ M ulti(θm)","(b) Choose word wm,n from p(wm,n|zm,n, βzm,n) where Nm is the number of words in document m.","Under graphical model notation, shaded elements are observed and unshaded elements are latent. Thus, the circle denoting the w element, representing the words of a document, is the only observed element. The other elements are latent. In order for the LDA model to be useful in practical settings, these latent RV’s and hyper-parameters need to be estimated.","If α and β are assumed fixed, then the posterior probability w.r.t. θ and z can be expressed as follows: p(θ, z|w, α, β) =","p(w|θ, z, α, β)p(θ, z|α, β) p(w|α, β) = p(θ, z, w|α, β) ∫ θ","∑ z p(θ, z, w|α, β) dθ","Unfortunately, this posterior probability is in-tractable to calculate due to the integral over the Dirichlet variable. There are several methods for approximating θ and z. The LDA topic data used in this research was induced using the mean field variational method which is an iterative algorithm that converges on estimates of θ and z for each document and each word in those documents. Once these estimates have been obtained, then estimates for α and β can be obtained by holding the values of θ and z fixed and using an empirical bayes estimation technique. By alternating between the mean field variational estimation and the empirical bayes estimate the values of the latent elements are guaranteed to eventually converge to stable values. For further details on this latent element estimation technique see (Blei, 2004).","In the experiment section the topic proportions θ1:D of each document and the topic rows of β will be compared to similar data produced by linguists.","Table 1 shows the 25 top terms from four sample topics induced from the ScamSeek corpus for a 64 topic model.

The last row shows the cumulative probability mass that the top 25 topic words account for. Three of these example topics are most associated with scam classes. Only the topic most associated with the Licensed Operator class is a non-scam class. A good indicator of this is that the word, “risk”, is one of the most probable terms.

One challenge of this task is that the classes and the topics are in different forms and the topics are nonparametric distributions. We achieve this aim by utilizing one form of the Monte Carlo Simulation method where a number of random pseudo-LDA models are produced. The correlations between the linguists classes and both the real LDA model as 1","The correlation measure used to determine the most correlated class is the distributional intersection (DI) measure which is described later in the methods section. well as the pseudo-models are measured. The correlation scores between all the pseudo-models and the linguists classes are sorted and the real model’s correlation score is ranked against the pseudo-models. The percentage of pseudo-model scores that the real model score beats is taken to be the significance level of the real correlation.","Let the correlation between the classes and the LDA topics be called the real correlation. From the ranking of the real correlation within all the random correlations an approximate p-value is derived. Let r be the number of random correlations that are the same or better than the real correlation and let n be the number of random models. Then2",": p-value = r/n","(B. V. North and Sham, 2002) report that using Monte-Carlo procedures to calculate empirical p-values has become commonplace in statistical analysis and give three major motivating factors:","1. Many test statistics do not have a standard asymptotic distribution.","2. Even if such a distribution does exist, it may not be reliable in realistic sample sizes.","3. Calculation of the exact sampling distribution through exhaustive enumeration of all possible samples may be too computationally intensive.","Reason #1 definitely applies to the case of trying to find a distribution for possible LDA models. The LDA estimation algorithm is nonparametric itself so there is no reason to think it would produce topic multinomials that fit a parametric distribution. Reason #2 does not apply. Reason #3 is a major factor for using Monte-Carlo techniques in the case of this research. Each randomised topic has N = 18, 000 terms. To randomise a LDA model each topic has its terms and probabilities shuffled in a pseudorandom matter. There are N ! different shuffles for each topic which is for all practical purposes infinite in this case.","2","There is some dispute as to whether r/n or (r +1)/(n+1) is the better p-value estimator. (Ewens, 2003) and (Broman and Caffo, 2003) prove that (r +1)/(n+1) is biased so we use r/n here. 15"]},{"title":"3 Similarities and differences between document classes and LDA topics","paragraphs":["The LDA generative corpus model assumes that every corpus document draws its terms from κ topics, where κ is a parameter of the LDA model. One of the products of the LDA model estimation process is a γ-vector for each document which gives the estimated distribution of a document’s terms over the topics. Normalizing this vector by dividing by the total number of document terms gives the document topic proportions which is the same information that the LDA model’s θm RV represents for a given document m.","Unlike topics, the document classes the linguists constructed are meant to be mutually exclusive; a document may belong to one and only one of those classes. Although this is a significant difference between topics and these document classes, in practice the two are not too dissimilar. An analysis of all the normalised γ-vectors shows that, on average, each document devotes around 60% of its terms to a major topic, and allocates between 4-20% of its remaining content to each of four or five minor topics, leaving only small amounts of the topic mass to the rest of the topics. This pattern seems to hold irrespective of the number of topics used to generate the LDA model, as table 2 shows. Since most documents have a single topic with more than a majority of the topic mass, we will assume that topics can approximate the behavior of document classes.","Topic rank","Topics 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 8 61.0 21.7 10.0 4.5 1.8 0.7 0.2 16 58.8 20.7 9.8 5.0 2.7 1.4 0.7 32 55.4 19.7 10.0 5.8 3.5 2.1 1.3 64 57.5 17.8 9.2 5.6 3.5 2.2 1.4 128 61.6 16.8 8.2 4.7 2.9 1.8 1.1 256 69.1 14.7 6.6 3.7 2.2 1.3 0.8","mean 60.6 18.6 9.0 4.9 2.8 1.6 0.9 Table 2: The average percentage of the 7 top ranked topics from each document in six different LDA models.","In addition to creating document classes, the linguists also created motif classes to embody certain qualities of documents that transcend the document classes. In this way, the motifs are closer to topics than document classes. The linguists identified characteristic phrases for the motif classes just as they did for the document classes. An example of a motif class is one called the persuasion class which has indicative phrases that are common to many scams in which a scammer tries to persuade victims to do something. Many of the scam documents exhibit some of these persuasion phrases. Unfortunately, exact phrases cannot be revealed because parts of the ScamSeek project are proprietary.","For the remainder of the paper, the term classes will be used to signify both document classes and motif classes."]},{"title":"4 Methods","paragraphs":["Two types of methods were employed to estimate a p-value for the correlation between the linguists classes and the LDA topics: categorical and term-based. The categorical method attempts to measure the randomness in the relationship between the topics and the linguists’ document classes. The term-based methods measure correlations between word distributions in the LDA topics and the linguists’ class characteristic phrases.","LDA models were generated on 1917 documents from the ScamSeek corpus. Eight models were induced with the following numbers of topics: 2, 4, 8, 16, 64, 128, 256. These models are referred to as the “real” models to differentiate them from the random LDA models introduced below. 4.1 Using the χ2","test The χ2","test(Devore, 1999) can be used to test if two categorical variables are statistically independent. A contingency table is used to show the counts of some entity for every possible pairing of categories, one from each of the two variables. The empirical counts are compared to the counts that would be expected if the two variables were independent.","The χ2","experiments described in this section only utilise the document classes and not the motif classes.","The raw LDA γ-vectors give a document’s term count for each topic therefore topics are categorical in this context. To make a document class into a categorical variable, the γ-vectors for all the documents in the same document class can be summed so that each cell contains the total term count for one topic 16 over all the documents in that class. Then, each cell (i, j) of the χ2","contingency table will hold the total number of words from document class i that were assigned to topic j.","There is one problem with using the χ2","test in this setting. Completely correct usage of the χ2","test requires that each joint event from the contingency table is independent of all the others. However, according to (Blei, 2004, pg. 20), under LDA, the terms of the document are exchangeable, meaning that their order does not matter. This implies the terms are not independent of each other but rather conditionally independent with respect to the latent topics. Because of this potential problem, any results must be viewed with some caution.","The χ2","statistic was calculated using each of the eight LDA models to determine the relationship between the document classes and the topics. These tests all indicated that the relationship was highly significant with a p-value of zero.","To verify this result, control experiments were performed where 10 random test sets were generated by shuffling the documents assigned to each class. The χ2","test was run on each of the randomised sets. For the random sets, the χ2","statistic was much lower than the value obtained from the real class assign-ments. Unexpectedly, the calculated p-value was still zero, indicating that even the randomised tests were highly significant.","We concluded that this method of applying the χ2 test was not appropriate for the task of rejecting H0, and that the most likely reason is that the document words are not completely independent. 4.2 Using Monte-Carlo Simulation Next, we turn to a term-based method of trying to verify the Ha hypothesis, using word distribution correlations between topics and classes rather than a categorical analysis. To test this hypothesis Monte-Carlo simulation was used as described in the Background section 2.2. Futher details are provided in there section.","Again in this method, an approximate p-value is calculated from the ranking of real correlations within a sorted list of pseudo-correlations. The real correlations are between the words of the linguists’ class characteristic phrases and real LDA topics while the pseudo-correlations are between those phrase words and a set of randomly generated pseudo-topics. 4.2.1 Forming the random LDA models","To begin with, for each of the eight real models (models with 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256 topics), one hundred randomised models were generated. Real LDA models have topics that concentrate most of their probability mass on a relatively small number of terms compared to the total number of terms in the distribution. The method of randomization was chosen so as to maintain the same level of probabilistic “clumpiness” in the random topics. To form a pseudo-random LDA model from a real model, for each real topic, the terms and their probabilities are separated. To form a pseudo-topic, the terms are shuffled and assigned to one of the pre-existing multinomial probabilities from the real model’s corresponding topic. 4.2.2 Correlating one class with one LDA topic","Again, we are trying to rank the best correlation of a real topic with a class among the correlations of that class with the best correlations among all the pseudo-topics in each randomised LDA model. This section defines some notation needed in discussing these class/topic correlations. This notation assumes a specific model (defined by the number of topics) and a specific correlation measure have been chosen. Different kinds of correlation measures will be explained below.","Below, classes are referred to with the index i. Topics are referred to with the index k. An index of r refers to the one real model while an integer index j refers to one of the 100 random models.","In our notation, Cirk , refers to the correlation of the ith class and real model’s kth topic and Cijk refers to the correlation of the ith class and jth random model’s kth topic.","In order to obtain the p-value for each class, correlation measures are calculated for each pairing of class and topic, both real and random. First Cirk is calculated for the one real model. Next, Cijk is calculated for each of the hundred random LDA models. The real topic that shows the best correlation score with class i is, ̂Cir. Next, the procedure is performed on each of the 100 random LDA models so a correlation Cijk between the class and each 17 pseudo-topic k in each random model j is calculated. The best correlation for each random model ̂Cij is found. The best correlations for each random model are sorted from least correlated to most correlated. Then the rank of the best real topic correlation is found within the sorted list of random best correlations. Since our criteria for significance is α = 0.05 then for a given number of topics, type of correlation measure and class i, if: ̂Cir > ̂Cij for 95 of the 100 random models then we would take this as sufficient evidence that the null hypothesis can be rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis.","The following subsections first define a method for forming multinomial distributions from class indicative phrase and next specifies three correlation measures defined on two multinomial distributions over the same range of terms. 4.2.3 A distribution from class phrases","The LDA topics are multinomial distributions over 18,000 terms. One way to correlate a class with these topics is to form a multinomial distribution from the class. The phrases that the linguists generated as being characteristic of the class can be used to achieve this goal. All the phrases are treated as though they came from a single document and processed in the same way the corpus documents were processed before the LDA models were built from them. This means joining terms together into multiword expressions (MWE) where appropriate and eliminating stopwords. Next, a histogram is formed with the terms and MWE’s as elements. Finally, the count for each element is normalised by the total number of elements, thus yielding a probability distribution. 4.2.4 The vector cosine correlation measure","Now that a distribution, Ci, has been formed for each class i, we can correlate them with each topic distribution, Tk. One way to do this is by treating the two distributions as vectors in term space. The cosine of the angle between these two vectors can be seen as a measure of how similar the two distributions are. If the angle is zero then the two distributions are the same whereas if they are perpendicular they are maximally dissimilar. The cosine of the angle, θ, between Ci and Tk can be gotten from the formula: cos θ =","C · T","||C|| ||T||","This measure will vary in the range [0, 1] where 1","indicates the two distributions are identical.","4.2.5 The hypergeometric distribution correlation measure","The hypergeometric distribution (HD) (Devore, 1999, pg. 122) is often associated in with the probability of drawing lottery numbers that match the winning numbers. In the way the HD is used here, the winning lotto numbers are analogous to the words of the class indicated phrases and the most probable terms in a topic are analogous to the numbers on the lotto ticket. The HD assumes the following:","1. There is a population of size N to be sampled from.","2. Each member of the population can either be a success or a failure. There are M successes in the population.","3. A sample of size n is drawn in an independent and identically distributed manner.","N = 18, 000 is the total number of terms in both the class and topic multinomial distributions. For a given class, C, a term is defined as a success if it matches one of the terms from the class characteristic phrases, for a total of M possible successes. CM denotes the set of those success terms. Now, given the kth topic Tk, Tk, M̂ is the set of the M most probable terms in that topic. Let Ik be the number of elements in the intersection set CM ∩ Tk, M̂ . The probability of Ik, for the subset of hypergeometric distributions where n = M is: P (Ik|N, M ) = ( M Ik ) ( N − M M − Ik ) ( N M )","The lower the above probability is the greater the chance of correlation between Ci and Tk. Since this probability can be extremely small, log probabilities are used to express it. Therefore, the range of this correlation measure is (−∞, 0). 18","4.2.6 The distribution intersection correlation measure","Another simpler measure of distribution correlation is the amount of probability mass the two distributions share. The formula for calculating this measure for the distributions of the ith class Ci and the kth topic Tk is: DI(Ci, Tk) = N ∑ j=1 min(Ci[j], Tk[j]) where DI stands for “distribution intersection”, N is the total number of terms in each distribution. This measure also has the range of [0, 1] with 1 meaning the two distributions are the same."]},{"title":"5 Results 5.1 Results for using 100 random models","paragraphs":["To reiterate the problem definition, we seek to determine if there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. Since we set α = 0.05, this means that the real model must have a better correlation should score then 95% of the random models, for a given model and type of correlation measure. The final performance results are measured in terms of the percentage of classes where the H0 could be rejected. In many cases, the real model did better than all 100 of the pseudo-models so results are also provided for the case where we had set our H0 rejection threshold to α = 0.01.","Three different correlation measures were used: vector cosine (VC), distribution intersection (DI), and hypergeometric distribution (HD).

One problem with the VC measure is that the angle between the problem with Ci and Tk vectors is only measuring differences in the terms that have nonzero probabilities. Therefore, this measure is less restrictive, allowing for a greater chance that a random topic may have the right combination of terms so that its correlation with a class will be better than the corresponding real model’s best correlation.","The HP measure was the worst that α = 0.05 but in the middle for α = 0.01. one interesting trend is that it does much better then the VC measure for high topic models (128, 256.)","The DI correlation measure shows the generally higher correlation scores which does not necessarily mean it is the best measure for our purpose.
