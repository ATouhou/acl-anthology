In particular I will discuss term normalisation techniques, named entity recognition and a smart dictionary look up. This research forms part of the National Centre for Text Mining (www.nactem.ac.uk) and the project BOOTStrep. Proceedings of the Australasian Language Technology Workshop 2007, pages 1-1 1"]}]}
