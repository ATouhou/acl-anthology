However, they can differ from each other subtly in both meaning and usage—consider the pair of near-synonyms frugal and stingy—and therefore choosing the appropriate near-synonym for a given context is not a trivial problem. Initial work by Edmonds (1997) suggested that corpus statistics methods would not be particularly effective, and led to subsequent work adopting methods based on specific lexical resources. In earlier work (Gardiner and Dras, 2007) we discussed the hypothesis that some kind of corpus statistics approach may still be effective in some situations, particularly if the near-synonyms differ in sentiment from each other, and we presented some preliminary confirmation of the truth of this hypothesis. This suggests that problems involving this type of near-synonym may be particularly amenable to corpus statistics methods. In this paper we investigate whether this result extends to a different corpus statistics method and in addition we analyse the results with respect to a possible confound-ing factor discussed in the previous work: the skewness of the sets of near synonyms. Our results show that the relationship between success in prediction and the nature of the near-synonyms is method dependent and that skewness is a more significant factor."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Choosing an appropriate word or phrase from among candidate near-synonyms or paraphrases is a significant language generation problem since even though near-synonyms and paraphrases are close in meaning, they differ in connotation and denotation in ways that may be significant to the desired effect of the generation output: for example, word choice can change a sentence from advice to admonishment. Particular applications that have been cited as having a use for modules which make effective word and phrase choices among closely related options are summarisation and rewriting (Barzilay and Lee, 2003). Inkpen and Hirst (2006) extended the generation system HALogen (Langkilde and Knight, 1998; Langkilde, 2000) to include such a module.","We discuss a particular aspect of choice between closely related words and phrases: choice between words when there is any difference in meaning or attitude. Typical examples are frugal and stingy; slender and skinny; and error and blunder.","In this paper, as in Gardiner and Dras (2007), we explore whether corpus statistics methods have promise in discriminating between near-synonyms with attitude differences, particularly compared to near-synonyms that do not differ in attitude. In our work, we used the work of (Edmonds, 1997), the first to attempt to distinguish among near-synonyms, adopting a corpus statistics approach. Based on that work, we found that there was a significant difference in attitudinal versus non-attitudinal near-synonyms. However, the Edmonds algorithm pro-duced on the whole poor results, only a little above the given baseline, if at all. According to (Inkpen, 2007), the poor results were due to the way the al-Proceedings of the Australasian Language Technology Workshop 2007, pages 31-39 31 gorithm handled data sparseness; she consequently presented an alternative algorithm with much better results. We also found that attitudinal versus non-attitudinal near-synonyms differed significantly in their baselines as a consequence of skewness of synset distribution, complicating analysis.","In this paper then we develop an algorithm based on that of Inkpen, and use a far larger data set and a methodology suited to large data sets, to see whether this alternative method will support our previous findings. In addition we analyse results with regard to a measure of synset skewness. In Section 2 we outline the near-synonym task descrip-tion; in Section 3 we present our method based on Inkpen; in Section 5 we present out method based on Inkpen, and our experimental method using it; in Section 4 we evaluate its effectiveness in comparison with Inkpen’s own method; in Section 5 we test our hypothesis, present our results and discuss them; and in Section 6 we conclude."]},{"title":"2 Task Description","paragraphs":["Our experiment tests a system’s ability to fill a gap in a sentence from a given set of near-synonyms. This problem was first described by Edmonds (1997). Edmonds describes an experiment that he designed to test whether or not co-occurrence statistics are sufficient to predict which word in a set of near-synonyms fills a lexical gap. He gives this example of asking the system to choose which of error, mistake or oversight fits into the gap in this sentence:","(1) However, such a move also of cutting deeply into U.S. economic growth, which is why some economists think it would be a big .","Performance on the task is measured by comparing system performance against real word choices: that is, sentences such as example 1 are drawn from real text, a word is removed, and the system is asked to choose between that word and all of its near-synonyms as candidates to fill the gap."]},{"title":"3 An approximation to Inkpen’s solution to the near-synonym choice problem","paragraphs":["We know of two descriptions of algorithms used to choose between near-synonyms based upon context: that described by Edmonds (1997) and that described by Inkpen (2007).","In our previous work we used Edmonds’ method for discriminating between near-synonyms as a basis for comparing whether near-synonyms that differ in attitude in predictability from near-synonyms that do not. The more recent work by Inkpen is a more robust and reliable approach to the same problem, and therefore in this paper we develop a methodology based closely on that of Inkpen, using a different style of training corpus, in order to test whether the differences between the performance of near-synonyms that differ in sentiment and those that do not persists on the better performing method.","Edmonds’ and Inkpen’s approaches to near-synonym prediction have the same underlying hypothesis: that the choice between near-synonyms can be predicted to an extent from the words immediately surrounding the gap. Returning to example 1, their approaches use words around the gap, eg big, to predict which of error, mistake or oversight would be used. They do this using some measure of how often big, and other words surrounding the gap, is used in contexts where each of error, mistake and oversight are used. Edmonds uses every word in the sentence containing the gap, whereas Inkpen uses a generally smaller window of words surrounding the gap.","In this section we briefly describe Edmonds’ approach to discriminating between near-synonyms in Section 3.1 and describe Inkpen’s approach in more detail in Section 3.2. We then describe our adapta-tion of Inkpen’s approach in Section 3.3. 3.1 Edmonds’ approach In Edmonds’ approach to the word choice problem, the suitability of any candidate word c for a sentence S can be approximated as a score(c, S) of suitability, and where score(c,S) is a sum of the association between the candidate c and every other word w in the sentence. score(c, S) = ∑ w∈S sig(c, w)(2)","In Edmonds’ original method, which we used in Gardiner and Dras (2007), sig(c, w) is computed using either the t-score of c and w or a second degree association: a combination of the t-scores of c with 32 a word w0 and the same word w0 with w. Edmonds’ t-scores were computed using co-occurrence counts in the 1989 Wall Street Journal, and the performance did not improve greatly over a baseline of choosing the most frequent word in the synset to fill all gaps. 3.2 Inkpen’s approach In Inkpen’s method, the suitability of candidate c for a given gap is approximated slightly differently: the entire sentence is not used to measure the suitability of the word. Instead, a certain sized window of k words either side of the gap is used. For example, if k = 3, the word missing from the sentence in example 3 is predicted using only the six words shown in example 4.","(3) Visitors to Istanbul often sense a second, layer beneath the city’s tangible beauty.

N is the total number of words in the text.","Inkpen estimated C(x), C(y) and C(x, y) by issuing queries to the Waterloo MultiText System (Clarke and Terra, 2003). She defined C(x, y) the number of times where x is followed by y within a certain query frame of length q within a corpus, so that, for example, if q = 3, example 7 would count as a co-occurrence of fresh and mango, but example 8 would not: (7) He likes fresh cold mango.","(8) I like fresh fruits in general, particularly mango.","She also experimented with document counts where C(x) is the number of documents that x is found in and C(x, y) is the number of documents in which both x and y are found, called PMI-IR (Turney, 2001); but found that this method did not perform as well, although the difference was not statistically significant.","Inkpen’s method outperformed both the baseline and Edmonds’ method by 22 and 10 percentage points respectively. 3.3 Our variation of Inkpen’s approach Our variation on Inkpen’s approach is designed to estimate PMI(x, y), the pointwise mutual information of words x and y, using the Web 1T 5-gram corpus Version 1 (Brants and Franz, 2006).","Web 1T contains n-gram frequency counts, up to and including 5-grams, as they occur in a trillion words of World Wide Web text.

This will allow us to determine whether our approximation is effective enough to allow us to compare attitudinal and non-attitudinal near-synonyms. 4.1 Test sets In order to compare the two methods, we use five sets of near-synonyms, also used as test sets by both Edmonds and Inkpen: • the adjectives difficult, hard and tough; • the nouns error, mistake and oversight; • the nouns job, task and duty;","• the nouns responsibility, burden, obligation and commitment; and • the nouns material, stuff and substance.","Inkpen compared her method to Edmonds’ using these five sets and two more, both sets of verbs, which we have not tested on, as our attitudinal and non-attitudinal data does not included annotated verbs. We are therefore interested in the predictive power of our method compared to Inkpen’s and Edmond’s on adjectives and nouns. 4.2 Test contexts We performed this experiment, as Edmonds and Inkpen did, using the 1987 Wall Street Journal as 34 a source of test sentences.4","Where ever one of the words in a test set is found, it is removed from the context in which it occurs to generate a gap for the algorithm to fill.","So, for example, when sentence 15 is found in the test data, the word error is removed from it and the system is asked to predict which of error, mistake or oversight fills the gap at 16:","(15) . . .his adversarys’ characterization of that minor sideshow as somehow a colossal error on the order of a World War. . ..

Her results were reported using k = 2 and q = 5, chosen via tuning on the development set.","We have retained the setting k = 2 and explored results where q = 2 and q = 4: due to Web 1T containing 5-grams but no higher order n-grams we cannot measure the frequency of two words occurring together with any more than three intervening words, so q = 4 is the highest value q can have. 4.4 Results and Discussion Table 1 shows the performance of Edmonds’ method and Inkpen’s method as given in Inkpen (2007)5","and","4","All references to the Wall Street Journal data used in this paper refer to Charniak et. al (2000).","5","Inkpen actually gives two methods, one using PMI estimates from document counts, one using PMI estimates using word counts. Here we are discussing her word count method and use those values in our table. our modified method on each of the test sets described in Section 4.1. Note that Inkpen reports different baseline results from us—we have not been able to reproduce her baselines. This may be due to choosing different part of speech tags: we simply used JJ for adjectives and NN for nouns.","Inkpen’s improvements for the test synsets given in Section 4.1 were between +3.2% and 30.6%. Our performance is roughly comparable, with improvements as high as 31.2%. Further, we tend to improve especially largely over the baseline where Inkpen also does so: on the two sets error etc and responsibility etc..","The major anomaly when compared to Inkpen’s performance is the set job, task and duty, where our method performs very badly compared to both Edmonds’ and Inkpen’s methods and the baseline (which perform similarly).

This results in 60 synsets in total: 8 where the annotators agreed that there was definitely an attitude difference between words in the synset, and 52 where the annotators agreed that there were definitely not attitude differences between the words in the synset.","An example of a synset agreed to have attitudinal differences was: (17) bad, insecure, risky, high-risk, speculative","An example of synsets agreed to not have attitudinal differences was: (18) sphere, domain, area, orbit, field, arena","The synsets are not used in their entirety, due to the differences in the number of words in each synset (compare {violence, force} with two members to {arduous, backbreaking, grueling, gruelling, hard, heavy, laborious, punishing, toilsome} with nine, for example). Instead, a certain number n of words are selected from each synset (where n ∈ {3, 4}) based on the frequency count in the 1989 Wall Street Journal corpus. For example hard, heavy, gruelling and punishing are the four most frequent words in the {arduous, backbreaking, grueling, gruelling, hard, heavy, laborious, punishing, toilsome} synset, so when n = 4 those four words would be selected. When the synset’s length is less than or equal to n, for example when n = 4 but the synset is {violence, force}, the entire synset is used.","These test sets are referred to as top3 (synsets re-duced to 3 or less members) and top4 (synsets re-duced to 4 or less members). 5.2 Test contexts Exactly as in Section 4.2, our lexical gaps and their surrounding contexts are drawn from sentences in the 1987 Wall Street Journal containing one of the words in the test synsets. 5.3 Parameter settings As described in Sections 3.2 and 4.3, there are two parameters that can be varied regarding the context around a lexical gap (k), and the nearness of two words x and y in the corpus in order for them to be considered to occur together (q).","As per Inkpen’s results on her development set, and as in Section 4 we use the setting k = 2 and vary q such that q = 2 on some test runs and q = 4 on others. We cannot test with Inkpen’s suggested q = 5, as that would require 6-grams. 5.4 Results and Discussion The overall performance of our method on our sets of attitudinal and non-attitudinal near-synonyms is shown in Table 2.","We did four test runs in total, two each on sets top3 and top4 varying q between q = 2 and q = 4.

Calculat-ing the z-statistic as is standard for comparing two proportions (Moore and McCabe, 2003) we find that the difference between the pair of attitudinal and non-attitudinal results for each test are all statistically significant (p < 0.01). Thus, again, it is difficult from the data in Table 2 alone to determine whether the better performance of non-attitudinal synsets is due to the higher baseline performance for those same synsets.","There are two major aspects of this result requiring further investigation. The first is that our method performs very similarly to the baseline according to these aggregate numbers, which wasn’t anticipated based on the results in Section 4, which showed that on a limited set of synsets our method performed well above the baseline, although not as well as Inkpen’s original method.","Secondly, inspection of individual synsets and their performance reveals that this aggregate is not representative of the performance as a whole: it is simply an average of approximately equal numbers of good and bad predictions by our method. Table 3 shows that for one test run (top3, k = 2, q = 2) there were a number of synsets on which our method performed very well with an improvement of more than 20 percentage points over the baseline but also a substantial number where it performed very badly, los-ing more than 20 percentage points from the baseline.","In our previous work we expressed a suspicion that the success of Edmonds’ prediction method might be being influenced by the evenness of distribution of frequencies within a synset. That is, if a synset contains a very dominant member (which will cause the baseline to perform well) then the Edmonds method may perform worse against the baseline than it would for a synset in which the word choices were distributed fairly evenly among the members of the set.","Given the results of the test runs shown in Table 2, and the wide distribution of prediction successes shown in Table 3, we decided to test this hypothesis that the distribution of words in the synsets influence the performance of prediction methods that use context. This is described in Section 5.4.1. 5.4.1 Entropy analysis","In this section, we describe an analysis of the results in Section 5.4 in terms of whether the balance of frequencies among words in the synset contribute to the quality of our prediction result.","In order to measure a correlation between the balance of frequencies of words and the prediction result, we need a measure of ‘balance’. In this case we have chosen information entropy (Shannon, 1948), the measure of bits of information required to convey a particular result. The entropy of a synset’s frequencies here is measured using the proportion 37 Test set q Category Entropy top3 2 −0·11 0·41∗ top3 4 −0·10 0·36∗ top4 2 −0·17∗ 0·38∗ top4 4 −0·15∗ 0·34∗ Table 4: Regression co-efficients between independent variables synset category and synset entropy, and dependent variable prediction improvement over baseline (statistically significant results p < 0.05 marked *) of total uses of the synset that each particular word represents. A synset in which frequencies are reasonably evenly distributed has high information entropy and a synset in which one or more words are very frequent as a proportion of use of that synset as a whole have low entropy.","We then carried out multiple regression analysis using the category of the synset (attitudinal or not attitudinal, coded as 1 and 0 for this analysis) and the entropy of the synset’s members’ frequencies as our two independent variables; this allows us to separate out the two effects of synset skewness and at-titudinality. Regression co-efficients are shown in Table 4.","Table 4 shows that in general, performance is negatively correlated with both category but positively with entropy, although the correlation with category is not always significant. The positive relationship with entropy confirms our suspicion in Gardiner and Dras (2007) that statistical techniques perform better when the synset does not have a highly dominant member. The negative correlation with category implies that the reverse of our main hypothesis holds: that our statistical method works better for predicting the use of non-attitudinal near-synonyms.","There are two questions that arise from the result that our Inkpen-based method gives a different result from the Edmonds-based one.","First, is our approximation to Inkpen’s method in-herently faulty or can it be improved in some way? We know from Section 4 that it tends to perform well where her method performs well. An obvious second test is to compare our results to another test described in Inkpen (2007) which used a larger set of near-synonyms and tested the predictive power using the British National Corpus as a source of test contexts. This test will test our system’s performance in genres quite different from news-wire text, and allow us to make a further comparison with Inkpen’s method.","Second, why do we perform significantly better for near-synonyms without attitude difference? One possible explanation that we intend to explore is that attitude differences are predicted by attitude differences exhibited in a very large context; perhaps an entire document or section thereof. Sentiment analysis techniques may be able to be used to detect the attitude bearing parts of a document and these may serve as more useful features for predicting attitudinal word choice than surrounding words."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion and Future Work","paragraphs":["In this paper we have developed a modification to Inkpen’s method of making a near-synonym choice that on a set of her test data performs reasonably promisingly; however, when tested on a larger set of near-synonyms on average it does not perform very differently to the baseline. We have also shown that, contrary to our hypothesis that near-synonyms with attitude differences would perform better using statistical methods, on this method the near-synonyms without attitude differences are predicted better when there’s a difference in predictive power.","Ultimately, we plan to develop a system that will acquire and predict usage of attitudinal near-synonyms, drawing on statistical methods and methods from sentiment analysis. In order to achieve this we will need a comprehensive understanding of why this method’s performance was not adequate for the task."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["Thank you to: Diana Inkpen for sending us a copy of Inkpen (2007) while it was under review; and Tobias Hawker for providing a copy of his Web 1T processing software, Get 1T, before its public release.","This work has been supported by the Australian Research Council under Discovery Project DP0558852. 38"]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Regina Barzilay and Lillian Lee. 2003.
