Standard linguistic accounts of meaning are impracticable for such purposes, both because they assume nonmonotonic operations such as quantifier movement, and because they lack a representation for the meaning of content words that supports efficient computation of entailment. Iâ€™ll discuss practical solutions to some of these problems within a near-context free grammar formalism for a working wide-coverage parser, in current work with Mike Lewis, and show how these solutions can be usefully applied in NLP tasks.
