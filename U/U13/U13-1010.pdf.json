The first procedure was a multivariate kernel density (MVKD) procedure which has been successfully applied to various types of forensic evidence, including glass fragments, handwriting, fingerprint, voice, and texts. The second procedure was a Gaussian mixture model – universal background model (GMM-UBM), which has been commonly used in forensic voice comparison (FVC) with so-called automatic features. Previous studies have applied the MVKD system to electronically-generated texts to estimate LRs, but so far no previous studies seem to have applied the GMM-UBM system to such texts. It has been reported that the latter GMM-UBM system outperforms the MVKD system in FVC. The data used for this study was chatlog messages collected from 115 authors, which were divided into test, background and development databases. Three different sample sizes of 500, 1500 and 2500 words were used to investigate how the performance is susceptible to the sample size. Results show that regardless of sample size, the performance of the GMM-UBM system was better than that of the MVKD system with respect to both validity (= accuracy) (of which the metric is the log-likelihood-ratio cost, Cllr) and reliability (= precision) (of which the metric is the 95% credible interval, CI)."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["There are a large number of authorship analysis studies claiming to be forensic, particularly in the fields of computational linguistics and natural language processing (Iqbal et al. 2008, Iqbal et al. 2010, Lambers & Veenman 2009, Teng et al. 2004). Although they describe highly sophisticated statistical and computational methodologies, many of them consider the problem as a classification problem: for example, whether a system correctly identifies text as having been written by the same author or by different authors, etc. However, it is critical to appreciate that the role of the forensic scientist in this situa-tion is not to give a definitive answer to the ques-tion of authorship or to give an opinion on the likely authorship (whether the incriminating text was written by the suspect or not). This is the task of the trier-of-fact. (Aitken 1995, Aitken & Stoney 1991, Aitken & Taroni 2004, Robertson & Vignaux 1995). The above point is emphasised in the following quote. It is very tempting when assessing evidence to try to determine a value for the probability of guilt of a suspect, or the value for the odds in favour of guilt and perhaps even reach a decision regarding the suspect’s guilt. However, this is the role of the jury and/or judge. It is not the role of forensic scientist or statistical expert witness to give an opinion on this (Aitken 1995: 4).","So, what is the role of the forensic scientist? Aitken and Stoney (1991), Aitken and Taroni (2004) and Robertson and Vignaux (1995) state that the role of forensic scientist is to estimate the strength of evidence, technically called the likelihood ratio (LR).","This paper employs the LR framework, which has been advocated in major textbooks (e.g. Robertson & Vignaux 1995) and by forensic statisticians (e.g. Aitken & Stoney 1991, Aitken & Taroni 2004) as a logically and legally correct way of analysing and presenting forensic evidence. The LR framework is also the standard framework in DNA profiling. Emulating DNA forensic science, many fields of forensic scienc-Shunichi Ishihara. 2013. A Comparative Study of Likelihood Ratio Based Forensic Text Comparison in Procedures: Multivariate Kernel Density vs. Gaussian Mixture Model-Universal Background Model. In Proceedings of Australasian Language Technology Association Workshop, pages 71−79. es, such as fingerprint (Neumann et al. 2007), handwriting (Bozza et al. 2008), voice (Morrison 2009) and so on, have started adopting the LR framework to quantify evidential strength (= LR).","Researchers engaged in forensic authorship analysis are well aware of LR and its importance in forensic comparative science. For example, the word ‘LR’ appears many times in papers, included in the 2","nd","issue of volume 21 of Journal of Law and Policy, which was published in 2013 as the proceedings of the papers presented at a forensic authorship attribution workshop","1","held in October 2012. However, LR-based studies on forensic authorship analysis are conspicuous in their rarity. To the best of our knowledge, only a handful of studies so far have been based on the LR framework (e.g. Ishihara 2011, 2012a, b, Grant 2007).","There are several different procedures for calculating LRs (e.g. Lindley 1977, Aitken & Lucy 2004, Reynolds et al. 2000, Ishihara & Kinoshita 2010, Ishihara 2011). The Multivariate Kernel Density (MVKD) procedure is a popular one which has been successfully applied to various types of forensic evidence, such as voice (Rose et al. 2004), handwriting (Bozza et al. 2008) and text messages (Ishihara 2012b). Approaches based on Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) are commonly used in forensic voice comparison (FVC) (Meuwly & Drygajlo 2001) and, in particular, it was reported that the adapted version of the GMM procedure, namely the Gaussian Mixture Model - University Background Model (GMM-UBM) procedure outperformed the MVKD procedure in FVC (Morrison 2011a). However, to the best of our knowledge, the GMM-UBM procedure has not been applied to texts yet.","Thus, the first aim of this study is to test the GMM-UBM procedure for use on electronically-generated texts, more specifically chatlog messages, in order to investigate how the GMM-UBM procedure performs in comparison to the MVKD procedure. The second aim is to investigate how their performance is influenced by sample size.","The performance of these procedures was assessed in terms of the log-likelihood-ratio cost (Cllr) (Brümmer & du Preez 2006) and the 95% credible interval (CI) (Morrison 2011b) (see §3.5). 1 http://www.brooklaw.edu/newsandevents/events/2012/10-11-2012a.aspx","We have called our study ‘Forensic Text Comparison (FTC)’ study, instead of using the term ‘forensic authorship analysis’, to emphasise that the task of the forensic expert is to estimate and present the strength of evidence (= LR) in order to assist the decision of the trier-of-fact."]},{"title":"2 Likelihood Ratio","paragraphs":["The LR is the probability that the evidence would occur if an assertion was true, relative to the probability that the same evidence would occur if the assertion was not true (Robertson & Vignaux 1995).  Thus, the LR can be expressed as 1).","For FTC, it will be the probability of observing the difference (referred to as the evidence, E) between the offender’s and the suspect’s samples if they had come from the same author (Hp) (i.e. if the prosecution hypothesis is true) relative to the probability of observing the same evidence (E) if they had been produced by different authors (Hd) (i.e. if the defence hypothesis is true). The relative strength of the given evidence with respect to the competing hypotheses (Hp vs. Hd) is reflected in the magnitude of the LR. The more the LR deviates from unity (LR = 1; logLR = 0), the greater support for either the prosecution hypothesis (LR > 1; logLR > 0) or the defence hypothesis (LR < 1; logLR < 0).","For example, an LR of 20 means that the evidence (= the difference between the offender and suspect samples) is 20 times more likely to occur if the offender and the suspect had been the same individual than if they had been different individuals. Note that an LR value of 20 does not mean that the offender and the suspect are 20 times more likely to be the same person than different people, given the evidence."]},{"title":"3 Testing","paragraphs":["Two types of comparisons are necessary to as-sess the performance of an FTC system: one is so-called same-author comparisons (SA comparisons) and the other is different-author comparisons (DA comparisons). For SA comparisons, two groups of messages produced by the same author will be compared and evaluated with the derived LR. Given that they are written by the same author, it is expected that the derived LR is higher than 1. In DA comparisons, two groups of messages written by different authors will be   1) 72 compared and evaluated. They are expected to receive LR lower than 1, given that they are written by different authors. 3.1 Database In this study, we used an archive of chatlog messages 2","which is a collection of real pieces of chatlog evidence used to prosecute paedophiles. As of August 2013, the archive contains messages from 550 criminals (= authors). From the archive, we used messages collected from 115 authors (Dall), which were reformatted for the present study.","In order to set up SA and DA comparisons, we needed two non-contemporaneous groups of messages from each of the authors. For this, we added messages one by one from the chronologically ordered messages to the groups. For one message group, we started from the top of the chronologically sorted messages, while for the other group of the same author, we started from the bottom, and then the two groups of messages were checked to see if they were truly non-contemporaneous.","The 115 authors of the Dall were divided into three mutually-exclusive sub databases of the test database (Dtest = 39 authors), the background database (Dbackground = 38 authors) and the development database (Ddevelopment = 38 authors). The Dtest is for assessing the performance of the FTC system; the Dbackground as the reference database for calculating LRs, and the Ddevelopment is for calibrat-ing the derived LRs for the SA and DA comparisons of the Dtest. From the testing database (Dtest) of 39 authors, we can conduct independent 39 SA and 1482 DA comparisons.","For the actual testing, we differentiate the number of words included in each message group; 500, 1500, and 2500, in order to investigate the second research aim. 500 means that each message group was modelled using a total of approximately 500 words. Since we cannot perfectly control the number of words appearing in one message, it needs to be approximately 500 words. 3.2 Text processing and feature extractions The chatlog messages were tokenised using the WhitespaceTokenizer function of the Natural Language Toolkit 3",". As the name indicates, the WhitespaceTokenizer provides a simple tokenisa-tion based on whitespaces. Thus, messages were 2 http://pjfi.org/ 3 http://nltk.org/ whitespace-tokenised one by one. A message may have contained two or more sentences, but the words of each message were treated as a sequence of words without parsing them into sentences.","We used three different features in this study, of which the effectiveness has been proven in previous studies (Ishihara 2012a, b). They are:"," the number of words appearing in each message;"," the average character number per word in each message; and"," the ratio of punctuation characters (, . ? ! ; : ’ ”) to the total number of characters in each message. The results of Ishihara (2012a, b), in which the different permutations of 12 so-called word- and character-based lexical features were investigat-ed in their performances, showed that 1) a vector of four to five features (not as many as 12) yield-ed the best performing results and 2) the above three features performed consistently well regardless of the sample size. Thus, the above-listed features were chosen. 3.3 Likelihood ratio procedures As mentioned earlier, two different procedures were used in order to calculate LRs: the Multivariate Kernel Density (MVKD) procedure (Aitken & Lucy 2004) and the Gaussian Mixture Model - Universal Background Model (GMM-UBM) procedure (Reynolds et al. 2000). Multivariate kernel density (MVKD) procedure In their paper, Aitken and Lucy (2004) addressed the problem of estimating LRs from correlated variables, and proposed the MVKD procedure for this problem. This procedure allows us to estimate a single LR from correlated variables, discounting the correlation between them. Following the initial application of the procedure to data from glass fragments, it has been successfully applied to various types of forensic evidence, such as voice (Rose et al. 2004), handwriting (Bozza et al. 2008), and text (Ishihara 2012b). The MVKD procedure is described mathematically in"]},{"title":"(2","paragraphs":[") and"]},{"title":"(3","paragraphs":[") which are the numerator and denominator of the formula respectively. 73","Although the reader needs to refer to Aitken and Lucy (2004) for the full mathematical exposition of the formula, we would like to point out some important parts of the formula, having its application to this study in mind. The numerator of the MVLR formula (2) calculates the likelihood of evidence, which is the difference between the offender and suspect samples (e.g. the difference between the message group produced by the offender and that by a suspect) when it is assumed that both of them came from the same origin (e.g. both message groups were produced by the same author, or the prosecution hypothesis (Hp) is true). For that, we need the mean vectors of the offender and suspect samples which are denoted as ̅ ̅ respectively in the formula, and the within-group (= within-author) variance, which is given in the form of a variance/covariance matrix (denoted as U in the formula). The same mean vectors of the offender and suspect samples ( ̅ ̅ ) and the between-group (= between-author) variance (denoted as C in the formula) are used in the denominator of the formula (3), to estimate the likelihood of getting the same evidence when it is assumed that they are from different origins (e.g. the defence hypothesis (Hd) is true). These within-group and between-group variances (U and C of the formula) are estimated from the Dbackground consisting of 38 authors (m = 38), from each message group from which the above-mentioned three feature values (a three-dimensional feature vector) (p = 3) were extracted.","The difference of two feature vectors is evaluated using a Mahalanobis distance of which the general form is the product ̅ ̅","","̅ ̅ in the formula (e.g. the difference between offender and suspect means ( ̅ ̅ ) = ̅ ̅","","̅ ̅ . The MVKD formula assumes normality for within-group variance while it uses a kernel density model for between-group variance. The remaining complexities of the formula result mainly from modelling a kernel density for the between-group variance.

In FTC, GMM parameters are estimated from the training data (e.g. suspect samples) using the iterative Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm with the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation. The main idea of the GMM-UBM is that the GMM, which was built in the above process for a suspect, is adapted to a universal background model (UBM) which was built based on the Dbackground. This way of estimating GMM parameters is called Maximum A Posterior (MAP) estimation. The above process is mathematically represented in terms of GMM parameters: mixture weight ( ), mixture mean ( ) and mixture variance/covariance ( ) in (4), (5) and (6) respectively. The formulae given in (4), (5) and (6) are based on Reynolds et al. (2000), but modified for text data.","If a mixture component (i) of the UBM has a low count for the corresponding mixture component of a given author’s (n) sample, thus low in ",", then",". This will result in deemphasising the parameters of this mixture component of the UBM, and emphasising the given author’s original GMM parameters.","A score, which was transformed to an LR using a calibration technique (refer to §3.4) in a subsequent process, was calculated as the relative value of the adapted GMM function of the suspect and the UBM function at each of the values extracted from the offender sample.","In this study, we conducted a series of experiments by altering the number of Gaussian components and the relevance factor (r) between 8 and 24. The number of iteration for the EM algorithm was set to 7. 3.4 Calibration A logistic-regression calibration (Brümmer & du Preez 2006) was applied to the derived LRs (or scores) from the MVKD and GMM-UBM procedures. Given two sets of LRs (or scores) derived from the SS and DS comparisons and a decision boundary, calibration is a normalisation procedure involving linear monotonic shifting and scaling of the LRs relative to the decision boundary in order to minimise a cost function. The FoCal toolkit 4","was used for the logistic-regression calibration in this study (Brümmer & du Preez 2006). The logistic-regression weight was obtained from the Ddevelopment.","3.5 Evaluation of performance: validity and reliability The performance of the FTC system was assessed using the log-likelihood-ratio cost (Cllr) (Brümmer & du Preez 2006) and the 95% credible intervals (CI) (Morrison 2011b) which are the metrics of validity and reliability respectively. Suppose that we have two authors and two sets of message groups for each of author. We denote the sets of messages as A1.1, A1.2, A2.1, and A2.2, where A = author, and 1 & 2 = the first set and the second set of messages (A1.1 refers to the first set of messages collected from (A)uthor1, and A1.2 the second set from that same author). From these sets, two independent DA comparisons are possible; A1.1 vs. A2.1 and A1.2 vs. A2.2. Suppose then that we conducted two separate FTC tests in the same way, but using two different features (Features 1 and 2), and that we obtained the log10LRs given in Table 1 for these two DA comparisons. 4 https://sites.google.com/site/nikobrummer/focal","̂ [","  "," ","] (4)","̂  ","  "," (5)","̂   ","  ","(6) where,",",","and","= the weight, mean and variance/covariance of the i-th component of speaker n’s GMM; ",",","and","= the weight, mean and variance/covariance of the i-th component of UBM; ̂",", ̂","and ̂","= the adapted weight, mean and variance/covariance of the i-th component of speaker n’s GMM;  = a data-dependent adaptation","coefficient, which is defined as","   ","","","; r = a relevance factor which controls the magnitude of the adaptation step in each iteration; T = the number of background samples used to train UBM is automatically computed over all adapted mixture weights to ensure that they sum to unity.

For Feature 1, both of the comparisons revealed log10LR < 0 while for Feature 2, only one of them showed a log10LR < 0. Feature 1 is better not only in that both log10LR values are smaller than 0 (supporting the correct hypothesis) but also in that their magnitude is a lot greater than the log10LR values of Feature 2. As a result it can be said that the validity (= accuracy) of Feature 1 is higher than that of Feature 2. This is the basic concept of validity.","As pointed out in §1, almost all previous studies of forensic authorship analysis treated the problem as a two-way classification problem (correct vs. incorrect). Consequently the validity of the methodology has been assessed in terms of classification accuracy such as precision, recall, equal error rate (EER), F-score, etc. However, Morrison (2011b: 93) argues that these metrics based on classification-accuracy/classification-error rates are inappropriate for use within the LR framework because they implicitly refer to posterior probabilities, which is the province of the trier-of-fact, rather than LRs, which is the province of forensic scientists. Furthermore, “they are based on a categorical thresholding, error versus non-error, rather than a gradient strength of evidence.” Thus it has been argued that an appropriate metric for the validity of the LR-based forensic comparison system is the log-likelihood-ratio cost (Cllr), which is a gradient metric based on LRs. See 7) for calculating Cllr (Brümmer & du Preez 2006). ll = 1 2 (  1  ∑ l 2 (1 1 i )  i =  1 ","∑ l 2(1 j)  j = )  7)","In 7), NHp and NHd are the numbers of SA and of DA comparisons, and LRi and LRj are the LRs derived from the SA and DA comparisons respectively. If the system is producing desired LRs, all the SA comparisons should produce LRs greater than 1, and the DA comparisons should produce LRs less than 1. In this approach, LRs which support counter-factual hypotheses are given a penalty. The size of this penalty is determined according to how significantly the LRs deviate from the neutral point. That is, an LR supporting a counter-factual hypothesis with greater strength will be penalised more heavily than the ones whose strength is closer to the unity, because it is more misleading. The FoCal toolkit4","was also used for calculating C","llr in this study (Brümmer & du Preez 2006). The lower the Cllr value is, the better the performance.","Both of the DA comparisons given in Table 1 are the comparisons between A1 and A2. Thus one can expect that the LR values obtained for these two DA comparisons to be similar since they are comparing the same authors. However, one can see that the log10LR values based on Feature 1 are closer to each other (-3.5 and -3.3) than those log10LR values based on Feature 2. In other words, the reliability (= precision) of Feature 1 is higher than that of Feature 2. This is the basic concept of reliability.","As the metric of reliability (= precision), we used credible intervals which are the Bayesian analogue of frequentist confidence intervals. Following Morrison (Morrison 2011b: 62), we calculated the 95% credible intervals (CI) using the parametric method on the DA comparison pairs.","That is, for each member of the pair of LRs from each DA pair of authors (xa and xb), the mean value of the pair ( ̅ ) was subtracted, as shown in 8).","The equations given in 8) convert each absolute value (xa and xb) to a deviation-from-mean value (ya and yb). Then, the deviation-from-mean value from each DA comparison pair of authors was pooled altogether to calculate CI. The smaller the credible intervals, the better the reliability.","Tippett plots were also used in this study to visually present the magnitude of the derived LRs, including both consistent-with-fact and contrary-to-fact LRs. A more detailed explana-tion of Tippett plots is given in §4, in which some Tippett plots are presented."]},{"title":"4 Experimental Results and Discussions","paragraphs":["The results of the experiments are given as Tippett plots in Figure 1, in which the calibrated LRs, which are equal to or greater than the value indicated on the x-axis, are cumulatively plotted separately for the SA comparisons (black) and for the DA comparisons (grey). Please note that the log10LR is used in Figure 1, and so the unity is not 1 but 0. For the GMM-UMB, the best performing results are given for the different sample sizes (500, 1500, 2500 words) with the number of Gaussian mixture (g) and the relevance factor = ̅, = ̅, ̅= 8) 76 (r), displayed in Figure 1. Figure 1 also contains EER values, but these are only for reference.","We can observe from Figure 1 that regardless of the sample size, the GMM-UBM procedure outperforms the MVKD procedure in terms of both validity and reliability. However, the difference in performance, in particular in validity, becomes less salient as the sample size increases. For example, the difference in Cllr between the MVKD and GMM-UBM procedures is as large as 0.142 (= 0.638-0.496) when the sample size is 500, while the difference is only 0.026 (= 0.294-0.268) when the sample size is 2500. That is, when the sample size is small - which is more realistic in real casework - the GMM-UBM procedure can be judged to be more appropriate to employ than the MVKD procedure.","Another clear difference between the two procedures is that the MVKD produced greater LRs (with some extreme ones, e.g. LR >",") for the DA comparisons than the GMM-UBM, although the former is less well-calibrated than the latter. MVLR GMM-UBM "," Figure 1: Tippett plots of the MVLR system on the left, and those of the GMM-UBM system (only best-performing ones) on the right. Sample size 500 (a,d); sample size 1500 (b,e). The calibrated SA LRs (solid black line), and the calibrated DA LRs (solid grey line) are plotted separately with the ±95% CI band (dotted grey lines) superimposed on the DA LRs. The Cllr, CI and EER values are also given in the plots. x-axis = log10LR; y-axis = cumulative proportion. g = number of Gaussian mixtures; r = the relevance factor. The results of the sample size of 2500 are given on the following page. 77 On the other hand, the LRs derived from the GMM-UBM are fairly conservative, in particular for the DA comparisons, but at the same time, their counter-factual LRs are also very weak. This point is particularly evident when the sample size is small (500), in the sense that the DA LRs are overall greater in the MVKD than the GMM-UBM, whereas the former also produced greater contrary-to-fact SA LRs (e.g. LR = ca. - 4). This led to heavy penalties in terms of validity, resulting in a higher Cllr value (0.638) for the MVKD system. The greater DA LRs for the MVKD procedure in comparison to the GMM-UBM procedure appears to be a general trend as the same trend has been reported in Morrison (2011a), in which these two procedures were compared on speech data.","As for the reliability of the system, the GMM-UBM is far better than the MVKD in that the CI is constantly less than 1 in the former whereas it can be higher than 3 in the latter. This higher CI value (= lower in reliability) of the MVKD system, being compared to the GMM-UBM, has also been pointed out in Morrison (2011a).","It is worth pointing out that although the GMM-UBM procedure performs better in validity and reliability than the MVKD procedure, the LRs that the GMM-UBM estimated in the current study are fairly weak (this is also true of the MVKD procedure to a certain extent), in particular from the view point that the log10LR between -1 and 1 can only provide limited support for either hypothesis. (Champod & Evett 2000). This is partly because only three features were used in this study, but some previous studies (e.g. Ishihara 2012b) also reported that the LRs obtained from electronically-generated texts are relatively weak."]},{"title":"5 Conclusions and Future Directions","paragraphs":["In this study, two procedures for the calculation of LRs: MVKD and GMM-UBM, were tested on the same feature set extracted from chatlog messages, and their performance was compared in terms of validity (= accuracy) and reliability (= precision). The experimental results demonstrat-ed that the GMM-UBM system performed better in both validity and reliability than the MVKD system. Moreover, regardless of the sample size (500, 1500 and 2500 words), the reliability of the GMM-UBM system was consistently better than the MVKD system while the difference in validity between the two procedures decreased as the sample size increased. Results also showed that although the GMM-UBM is generally better in performance than the MVKD, the magnitude of the DA LRs is more conservative in the former than the latter.","As mentioned in §1, there are several different procedures for estimating LRs.
