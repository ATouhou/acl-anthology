We initially thought to have a female-only line-up for the keynote speakers, but settled","with a population representative 50%. Please note that no gender biases were intentionally","introduced into paper reviewing or acceptance; however, the authors on the accepted papers","are fully one third female.","The goals of the workshop are to:","• bring together the Language Technology (LT) community in the Australasian region and","encourage interactions and collaboration;","• foster interaction between academic and industrial researchers, to encourage dissemina-","tion of research results;","• provide a forum for students and young researchers to present their research;","• facilitate the discussion of new and ongoing research and projects;","• increase visibility of LT research in Australasia and overseas and encourage interactions","with the wider international LT community.","This year’s ALTA Workshop presents 16 peer-reviewed papers, including nine full, four short papers, and three papers that will be presented as posters. We received a total of 24 submissions. Each paper, apart from two submissions that were deemed outside of the conference scope at submission time, was reviewed by three members of the program committee. The reviewing for the workshop was double blind, and done in accordance with the DIISRTE requirements for E1 conference publications. Furthermore, great care was taken to avoid all conflicts of interest; in particular, no paper was assessed by a reviewer from the same institution as any of the authors. In the case of submissions involving a co-chair, the double-blind review process was upheld, and acceptance decisions were made by the non-author co-chair.","The proceedings include abstracts of the invited talks by Mark Steedman and Bonnie Webber, both from the University of Edinburgh. We are delighted to take advantage of their visit to Australia to bring them to Brisbane and are honoured to welcome them to ALTA. This volume also contains an overview of the ALTA Shared Task, its use as a class project, and a description of the winning system. These contributions were not peer-reviewed.","We would like to thank, in no particular order: all of the authors who submitted papers to ALTA; the program committee for the time and effort they put into maintaining the high standards of our reviewing process; the local organiser Laurianne Sitbon for taking care of all the physical logistics and lining up some great social events; our invited speakers Mark Steedman and Bonnie Webber for agreeing to share their extensive experience and insights with us; the team from the NeCTAR Human Communication Science virtual laboratory (HCSvLab) and David Milne for agreeing to host two fascinating tutorials, and Paul Cook and Scott Nowson, the program co-chairs of ALTA 2012, for their valuable help and support. We would like to acknowledge the constant support and advice of the ALTA Executive Committee for providing input critical to the success of the workshop.","Finally, we gratefully recognise our sponsors: CSIRO, Google, and NICTA. Their generous support enabled us to fund student paper awards, as well as offer travel subsidies to three students to attend and present at ALTA. The University of Queensland also sponsored afternoon tea on Friday afternoon. We thank them as well.
