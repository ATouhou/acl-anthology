This is the eighth annual instalment of the ALTA workshop in its most-recent incarnation, and the continuation of an annual workshop series that has existed in various forms Down Under since the early 1990s. The goals of the workshop are: • to bring together the growing Language Technology (LT) community in Australia and","New Zealand and encourage interactions; • to encourage interactions and collaboration within the community and with the wider","international LT community; • to foster interaction between academic and industrial researchers, to encourage dissemi-","nation of research results; • to provide a forum for the discussion of new and ongoing research and projects; • to provide an opportunity for the broader artificial intelligence community to become","aware of local LT research; • and finally, to increase visibility of LT research in Australia, New Zealand and overseas. This year’s ALTA Workshop includes full papers (9 pages in length) as well as short papers (5 pages in length). We received a total of 19 submissions including 5 short papers. 12 papers including 2 short papers were selected by the program committee for publication in these proceedings. Each paper in the ‘reviewed papers’ section was independently peer-reviewed by at least two members of an international program committee, in accordance with the DEST requirements for E1 conference publications. The review process was double-blind: Great care was exercised to avoid all conflicts of interest whenever an author also served as program committee/co-chair or the reviewer worked at the same institution as an author. Such conflicts of interest were resolved by transferring the reviewing task to other members of the program committee. A key feature of this year’s workshop is a special session of invited speakers from industry. In this ‘industry session’, which aims to bridge the gap between academia and industry, members of different companies talk about how they apply language technology (research) in their work. Another exciting feature of this year’s workshop is the Language Technology Programming Competition. It is formatted as a “shared task”: all participants compete to solve the same problem. The problem highlights an active area of research and programming in the area of language technology. Details of the shared task are published in the proceedings and also presented in a special session (along with the winner of the competition.) We would like to thank all the authors who submitted papers to ALTA, the members of the program committee for the time and effort they put into the review process and to our invited speakers: Rodolfo Delmonte (University Ca’Foscari, Italy) and Casey Whitelaw (Google Inc, Sydney). We would also like to thank all the invited speakers for our industry session for making it such a success and hope that it will feature in future ALTA workshops as well. Finally, we would like to thank our sponsors, NICTA and the University of Melbourne, for supporting the workshop.
