This is the sixth annual installment of the workshop since the formation of ALTA, and the continuation of an annual workshop series that existed under various guises throughout the 1990s. The goals of the workshop are: • to bring together the Language Technology (LT) community in Australasia; • to encourage interactions with the international LT community; • to foster interaction between academic and industrial researchers; • to encourage dissemination and peer evaluation of research results; • to provide a forum for the discussion of new and ongoing research and projects; • to allow the broader AI community to become aware of local LT research; • to increase visibility of LT research in Australia, New Zealand and overseas; • to promote, support and encourage the participation of students in LT research. Once again, this year ALTA is co-located with the Australasian Document Computing Symposium (ADCS), including a joint session of papers and talks of interest to both communities. This year’s Australasian Language Technology Workshop includes regular talks as well as poster presentations which rank equally as papers. The number of papers submitted increased by 52% compared to last year, and 20 papers were selected by formal review to appear in these proceedings. This represents an increase of just 25% in the number of papers accepted, and acceptance rate is thus 57% as compared to 70% last year. Ten of the submissions came from outside Australasia, and two submissions were accepted from Indonesia. Of the 20 accepted papers, 14 are oral presentations and 6 are poster presentations. Each fulllength submission was independently peer reviewed by at least two members of the international program committee, in accordance with the DEST requirements for E1 conference publications. The conference is classified as category B in the Computing Research and Education Association of Australasia (CORE) classification system which will form the basis of ranking computer science conference publications for ARC. We would like to thank all the authors who submitted papers, the members of the program committee for the time and effort they contributed in reviewing the papers; Rosie Jones (Yahoo!) for joining us as Keynote Speaker, as well as ADCS for their joint support of the conference and keynotes. Our thanks also go to local organizers Dipak Bhandari and Shlomo Berkovsky (CSIRO), to webmasters Darius Pfitzner and Richard Leibbrandt (Flinders University) for their logistical support, to members of the ALTA executive for their assistance in organizing the workshop, and to our sponsors (NICTA and CSIRO) who enabled us in particular to support student participation and accommodation, as well as free registration for all early registrants.
