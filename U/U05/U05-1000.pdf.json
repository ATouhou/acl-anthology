This is the third annual installment of the workshop in its most-recent incarnation, and the continuation of an annual workshop series that has existed under various guises since the early 90s. The goals of the workshop are:","• to bring together the growing Language Technology (LT) community in Australia and New Zealand and encourage interactions; • to encourage interactions between this community and the international LT community; • to foster interaction between academic and industrial researchers; • to encourage dissemination of research results; • to provide a forum for the discussion of new and ongoing research and projects;","• to provide an opportunity for the broader artificial intelligence community to become aware of local LT research; and, finally, • to increase visibility of LT research in Australia, New Zealand and overseas. One innovation in this year’s Australasian Language Technology Workshop was the introduction of poster presentations in addition to the regular talks. Our intention here was to optimise the presentation medium for each submission, and reviewers were accordingly instructed to independently rate the acceptability of each submitted paper first as a regular paper and second as a poster. Specifically, consideration was given to: (a) which mode of delivery was most appropriate for a given submission (e.g. papers which were felt to benefit from a more interactive presentation were preferred as posters), (b) what was the technical merit of the submission (e.g. highly technical papers which relied on detailed explanation of a series of equations were preferred as regular papers), and (c) was the submission of general interest (e.g. papers describing general results with ramifications for a range of fields were preferred as regular papers). It is important to note that research quality and technical rigour were not taken into consideration in determining whether to accept a paper as a regular paper or poster. As such, regular papers and posters are of identical academic status. Of the 45 papers submitted, 30 papers were selected by the programme committee for publication and appear in these proceedings. Of these, 14 are regular papers and 16 are posters. Each full-length submission was independently peer reviewed by at least two members of the international program committee, in accordance with the DEST requirements for F1 conference publications. We would like to thank all the authors who submitted papers, as well as the members of the program committee for the time and effort they contributed in reviewing the papers, and Dan Flickinger, Kathy McKeown and Virach Sornlertlamvanich for providing the ideal complement to the workshop with their invited talks. Our thanks go also to members of the ALTA executive, and particularly Steven Bird and Cécile Paris for encouragement and support in organising the workshop. Finally, we would like to thank the sponsors (DSTO, NICTA, CSIRO and Appen) for their generous help in supporting the workshop, and Dominique Estival as sponsorship chair.
