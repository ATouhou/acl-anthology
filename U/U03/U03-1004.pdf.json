Otherwise, the text becomes un-natural. Specifically, a redundant noun in Korean is frequently omitted while a redundant noun in English is replaced by a pronoun. This paper proposes a generation algorithm of the zero pronoun, using a Cost-based Centering Model which considers the inference cost. For an objective evaluation of our algorithm, we collected 87 texts from three genres, and manually recovered the omitted elements. Using the collected texts, we verify that our algorithm is well defined to explain the phenomenon of the zero pronoun in Korean. We also show that the proposed approach resolves both the over-generation of the zero pronoun in Continue and its under-generation in other transitions in terms of Centering."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Text generation is the process of producing comprehensible texts in natural languages from nonlinguistic representation of information. To generate a coherent text, we must pay attention to each stage of generation, such as content determination, text structuring, aggregation, and generation of anaphoric expression (pronominalization). Among these stages, we are especially interested in the generation of anaphoric expression focusing on zero pronouns, because generating the appropriate zero pronoun is directly connected with text coherence.

In this paper, we call the omitted element a zero pronoun. appears repeatedly as an object and a subject in sentence (2) and (3). Korean is a highly contextdependent language, and any arguments recoverable from the context are freely dropped. In the above text, ellipsis of redundant nouns, ‘na (I)’ and ‘os (dress)’, in sentence (2) and (3) is recommended to generate a natural Korean text. Otherwise, the text is not coherent because of redundancy.","Our goal is to generate natural anaphoric expressions in Korean, particularly the zero pronoun, using a Cost-based Centering Model which considers the inference cost. In this paper, the cost-based centering model refers to the revised centering model by Strube and Hahn (1999), which extends the original 4 transition types to 6 types and defines the cost between transition pairs with respect to the cost for inferring.","This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the centering model, which is the main background knowledge for our algorithm to generate anaphoric expression. In Section 3, we briefly describe related works on the generation of anaphoric expressions. In Section 4, we investigate the characteristics of the zero pronoun in Korean, and in Section 5 we describe a cost-based centering model and our proposed algorithm. In Section 6, we discuss the experimental validation. Finally, in Section 7, we summarize the features of our work and future work."]},{"title":"2  The Centering Model","paragraphs":["The centering model (Grosz et al., 1986; 1995) provides a framework for the interaction of cohesion and salience in the internal organization of a text. The model is formalized in terms of Cb, the backward-looking center, Cf, a list of forwardlooking centers for each utterance Un, (i.e., nth","utterance or sentence), and Cp, preferred center which is the most salient candidate for subsequent utterances. Cf(Un), i.e., the entities mentioned in Un are ranked by some measures such as a grammatical role. Cp(Un) is the highest ranked center of Cf(Un) and is predicted to be Cb(Un+1). If two successive utterances have no reference in common, the second will have no Cb. "]},{"title":"3","paragraphs":["2 Korean is a topic-prominent language. Topic, an element which is attached topic marker ‘un/nun’, not only marks the grammatical function of the head noun, but also adds some special meaning to them like \"only\", \"also/too\", \"even\", \"in contrast to.\"","Transition type across pairs of adjacent utterances is defined in terms of two factors: cohesion and salience. Cohesion is achieved if the Cb(Un-1) and the Cb(Un) are the same, and salience is achieved if the Cb(Un) and the Cp(Un) are the same.","The model consists of three constraints and two rules.  ▣ Constraints 1.

Several studies have been made on Cf-ranking (e.g., Strube and Hahn, 1999; Turan, 1998; Cote, 1998), because Cf-ranking is language-dependent. Cf-ranking for Korean is different from Cf-ranking for English in that two languages have different features in terms of word-order and functional typology. In this paper, we followed the Cf-ranking proposed by Roh (2003).  topic > subject > directly-associated-entity (DAE) > dir-obj > indir-obj > immediately pre-verbal entity (IPV) ","The topic-first principle is attributed to the topic prominence of Korean."]},{"title":"Related Work","paragraphs":["Several studies focus on the problem of anaphoric expression generation. The most primitive method used for early anaphoric generation (e.g., McDonald, 1980; McKeown, 1985) is to use a simple rule: if the current sentence contains the same word mentioned in the previous sentence, use a pronoun to refer to the word. However, this simple rule tends to over-generate pronouns, which causes serious ambiguity.","Recently, some studies attempted to use the centering model for the generation of anaphoric expression. Kibble (2000) used the model to plan coherent texts and to select anaphoric expressions. He considered different strategies for choosing when to use a pronoun, and found the following to be the best: pronominalize the Cb only after a Continue. However, he did not provide experimental results to verify that the method is superior to other strategies.","Mitsuko et al. (2001) adopted the centering model to generate the zero pronoun in Japanese. In English, all arguments of a verb must be expressed in a sentence, and redundant arguments used in previous sentence are usually replaced by pronouns. However, Japanese allows arguments to be freely omitted when they are recoverable from a given context. Korean is quite similar to Japanese from this perspective. Mitsuko argued that all Cb are generated as zero pronouns in either Continue or Smooth-Shift transitions. This can be interpreted as they prefer the zero pronoun when salience rather than cohesion obtains. However, they did not explain the reason why they regarded salience rather than cohesion as an important factor in the zero pronoun."]},{"title":"4  Zero Pronoun in Korean","paragraphs":["From the perspective of interpretation of zero pronoun, several studies (e.g., Kim, 1994; Kim, 1999; Ryu, 2000) about zero pronoun were performed by linguists in Korea. Most Korean linguists agree that the zero pronoun generally comes from the continuity of topic, salience of topic, and redundancy of discourse.","More concretely, from the perspective of information structure 3","proposed by Vallduvi (1990),   3 In information structure, the sentence is articulated into a trinomial hierarchical structure consisting of ‘focus’ and ‘ground’, with the latter further subdivided into ‘link’ and ‘tail’. The focus corresponds to new information unknown to the hearer within a sentence. The ground is the complement of the focus. A link is an address pointer in the sense that it di-Kim (1999) investigated the conditions of the zero pronoun in Korean: redundant focus, redundant link, and redundant tail. However, these conditions cannot be applied easily, because the focus, link, tail, and their redundancy are not automatically detected, and are determined pragmatically rather than structurally.","Kim (1999) also proposed certain conditions when the zero pronoun would be prohibited, claim-ing that old information that changes its role is not omitted. For example, when old information in the current sentence becomes a new topic in the next sentence, the role of the old information changes from the old focus to link for the new topic. This situation frequently occurs in the process of topic transition to expand the content of text. From the perspective of Centering, this condition can be interpreted to mean that the Cp of Retain which was one element of the previous sentence cannot be omitted in the transition sequence of Continue, Retain, and Smooth-Shift. Because this transition sequence, called a Topic-Shift-Sequence in this paper, is used to smoothly change the current topic to a new topic, and the new topic is generally realized as Cp in Retain. This will be examined as one of the hypotheses to generate anaphoric expression in the next Section.","Ryu (2000) investigated the zero pronoun in terms of Centering. He postulated that the zero pronoun is used to continue the center in Korean, i.e., zero pronoun usually comes from the Cb of Continue. This is supported by many Korean linguists. He also clarified that the zero pronoun rarely appears in written texts when compared with spoken texts.","In Ryu’s experimental results, the zero pronoun in Smooth-Shift is worthy of attention. He counted the zero pronouns which comes from the Cb of each transition in four kinds of texts — written, quasi-written, quasi-spoken, and spoken, respectively. In written texts, only 6% of Cb in Smooth-Shift is omitted, and 86% is overtly expressed as a topic with topic marker. Similarly, in quasi-written texts only 12% of Cb in Smooth-Shift is omitted. This phenomenon contrasted with Mitsuko ’s generation policy of zero pronoun: generate Cb as a zero pronoun in Smooth-Shift. Perhaps this differ-"," rects the hearer’s knowledge-store, which is the information-anchoring role of the ground. The tail is the complement of the link within the ground. ence is caused by the characteristics of the texts used in the experiments.","To summarize previous research related to zero pronoun in Korean, we conclude that the zero pronoun generally comes from the Cb of Continue. However, some problems still remain from the generation perspective.  ♦ Which of Cb in Continue is omitted or not, among Cb of Continues? ♦ Ellipsis of Cb in the other transitions except for Continue ♦ Pronoun generation except for zero pronoun of Cb and Cf ","According to Ryu’s experimental results, only 26% of Cb in Continues is omitted from written texts. This means that only a partial portion of Cb in Continues becomes a zero pronoun. Recall that all previous research which used the centering model to generate pronouns or zero pronouns follow this principle: pronominalize (or omit in Japanese) Cb in all Continues. Considering Ryu’s experimental results and our experimental results (see Section 6 for more details), this traditional strategy causes a serious over-generation of pronouns, including zero pronouns.","Concerning the second problem, almost all previous research considers only pronominalization in Continue, except for Mitsuko (2000) who included Smooth-Shift as well as Continue. However, we confirm that the zero pronoun of Cb in the other transitions also occurs from our corpus test. Therefore, the previous strategy causes the under-generation of pronouns including zero pronouns in the other transitions except for Continue.","Concerning the final problem, in Korean the redundant noun is generally realized as the original one rather than as a pronoun when the zero pronoun is forbidden, unlike English. Consider the following English sentence.  I love my mother and I cannot imagine the world without her.","","(1) Na-nun (I) wuli (my) emeni-lul (mother) salanghako (love) kunye (her) eps-nun (without) sesang-un (the world) sangsang-hal-su eps-ta (cannot imagine).","(2) Na-nun (I) wuli (my) emeni-lul (mother) salanghako (love) emeni (mother) eps-nun (without) sesang-un (the world) sangsang-hal-su eps-ta (cannot imagine). ","In a English-to-Korean translation, sentence (2) which translates ‘her’ into ‘emeni (mother)’ is more natural than sentence (1) which translates ‘her’ into ‘kunye (her)’4",". In this paper, we consider only two types of noun expression, the original noun and the zero pronoun because of these kinds of Korean-dependent characteristics."]},{"title":"5 5.1  Generation of Zero Pronoun Cost-based Centering Model","paragraphs":["We propose a generation algorithm for anaphoric expression in Korean, particularly a zero pronoun, using a cost-based centering model.

The same applies to a Continue with this characteristic.

More concretely, Strube and Hahn (1999) proposed to classify all the occurrences of transition pairs with respect to the implied inference costs.6","In this paper, the pair whose cost is cheap is called a Preferred Transition Pair, such as (CC,CC), (CC,R), (R,CSS), etc.  Cheap (CC,CC), (CC,R), (R,CSS), (CSS,CC), (RS,CSS) Expensive Other pairs   ","We investigate some transition pairs proposed by Strube and Hahn (1999), and partially adopt them to generate anaphoric expression, as shown in Table 3."]},{"title":"5.2","paragraphs":["enon.  Generation Algorithm of Zero Pronoun As the first step in our proposal, we must examine the reason why the revised transition types and preferred transition pairs considering inference cost are appropriate to the generation of the zero pronoun. We argue that the Cb of Cheap-Continue is more redundantly prominent than the Cb of Expensive-Continue. This assumption is reasonable if we consider that Expensive-Continue follows Retain which smoothly changes the topic. The prominence of Cb in Expensive-Continue decreases because of Retain. The following text, extracted from our corpus, is a description of an exhibition ‘Cakwi (a kind of Korean traditional farming tools)’, and is a good example to illustrate this phenom "," 6 Strube and Hahn (1999) argue that, given a sequence of utterances, inference cost is needed to understand them. They claim that the inference cost is ‘cheap’ if successive facts realize preferred transition pairs; otherwise, it is ‘expensive’.","(1) Cakwi-nun (Cakwi, topic) wuli-nala-uy (Korean) centhong-cekin (traditional) nong-kikwu-i-ta (farming tool is) (Cakwi is a Korean traditional farming tool.)","(2) Cakwi-uy (Cakwi, adnom) nal-un (edge, topic) celsaknal (celsaknal) ilako-hanta (is called).

This implies that the topic of the next sentence is ‘nal’, and it decreases the prominence of Cb, ‘Cakwi’, in sentence (2). However, in sentence (3), the topic is returned to ‘Cakwi’ from ‘nal’, and Expensive-Continue occurs. In sentence (4), ‘Cakwi’ is maintained as topic, and Cheap-Continue occurs. In this situation, it is natural that the Cb of sentence (3), ‘Cakwi’, is less prominent than Cb of sentence (4), ‘Cakwi’, even though both ‘Cakwi’ are the same as Cb of Continue transitions. If ‘Cakwi’ in sentence (3) is omitted, the topic (or subject) of ‘pisus-hata (is similar to)’ can be misinterpreted as ‘nal’ not ‘Cakwi’. Table 3. Cost of Transition Pairs","The basic idea of anaphor generation is that the more the noun is redundantly prominent, the more the noun is pronominalized (or omitted).7","Accordingly, we postulate that the Cb of Expensive-Continue is less elliptical than that of Cheap-Continue. For this reason, we adopt revised transition types considering the inference cost in order to generate the zero pronoun. The case of Smooth-Shift can also be explained in the same manner. For the same reason, it is reasonable that Cb of Continue which follows Continue is more prominent than the Cb of Continue which follows Rough-Shift. For this reason, we adopt the concept of preferred transition pairs.","With these issues in mind, we first construct the following assumptions to generate anaphoric expressions.   7 Generally, redundantly prominent noun corresponds to Cb within a sentence. (1) Do generate zero pronoun minimally in written texts. (2) Do not pronominalize for new information. (3) Do not make a zero pronoun when it causes ambiguity.
