As well as using single loanwords, compound nouns, multiword expressions (MWEs), etc. constructed from loanwords can be found in use in very large quantities. In this paper we describe a system which has been developed to segment Japanese loanword MWEs and construct likely English translations. The system, which leverages the availability of large bilingual dictionaries of loanwords and English n-gram corpora, achieves high levels of accuracy in discriminating between single loanwords and MWEs, and in segmenting MWEs. It also generates useful translations of MWEs, and has the potential to being a major aid to lexicographers in this area."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["The work described in this paper is part of a broader project to identify unrecorded lexemes, including neologisms, in Japanese corpora. Since such lexemes include the range of lexical units capable of inclusion in Japanese monolingual and bilingual dictionaries, it is important to be able to identify and extract a range of such units, including compound nouns, collocations and other multiword expressions (MWEs: Sag et al. (2002; Baldwin and Kim (2009)).","Unlike some languages, where there is of-ficial opposition to the incorporation of foreign words, Japanese has assimilated a large number of such words, to the extent that they constitute a sizeable proportion of the lexicon. For example, over 10% of the entries and sub-entries in the major Kenkyūsha New Japanese-English Dictionary (5th ed.) (Toshiro et al., 2003) are wholly or partly made up of loanwords. In addition there are several published dictionaries consisting solely of such loanwords. Estimates of the number of loanwords and particularly MWEs incorporating loanwords in Japanese range into the hundreds of thousands. While a considerable number of loanwords have been taken from Portuguese, Dutch, French, etc., the over-whelming majority are from English.","Loanwords are taken into Japanese by adapting the source language pronunciation to conform to the relatively restricted set of syllabic phonemes used in Japanese. Thus “blog” becomes burogu, and “elastic” becomes erasutikku. When written, the syllables of the loanword are transcribed in the katakana syllabic script (ブログ, エラスティック), which in modern Japanese is primarily used for this purpose. This use of a specific script means possible loanwords are generally readily identifiable in text and can be extracted without complex morphological analysis.","The focus of this study is on multiword loanwords. This is because there are now large collections of basic Japanese loanwords along with their translations, and it appears that many new loanwords are formed by adopting or assembling MWEs using known loanwords. As evidence of this, we can cite the numbers of katakana sequences in the the Google Japanese n-gram corpus (Kudo and Kazawa, 2007). Of the 2.6 million 1-grams in that cor-James Breen, Timothy Baldwin and Francis Bond. 2012. Segmentation and Translation of Japanese Multi-word Loanwords. In Proceedings of Australasian Language Technology Association Workshop, pages 61−69. pus, approximately 1.6 million are in katakana or other characters used in loanwords.1","Inspection of those 1-grams indicates that once the words that are in available dictionaries are removed, the majority of the more common members are MWEs which had not been segmented during the generation of the corpus. Moreover the n-gram corpus also contains 2.6 million 2-grams and 900,000 3-grams written in katakana. Even after allowing for the multiple-counting between the 1, 2 and 3-grams, and the imperfections in the segmentation of the katakana sequences, it is clear that the vast numbers of multiword loanwords in use are a fruitful area for investigation with a view to extraction and translation.","In the work presented in this paper we describe a system which has been developed to segment Japanese loanword MWEs and construct likely English translations, with the ultimate aim of being part of a toolkit to aid the lexicographer. The system builds on the availability of large collections of translated loanwords and a large English n-gram corpus, and in testing is performing with high levels of precision and recall."]},{"title":"2 Prior Work","paragraphs":["There has not been a large amount of work published on the automatic and semiautomatic extraction and translation of Japanese loanwords. Much that has been reported has been in areas such as back-transliteration (Matsuo et al., 1996; Knight and Graehl, 1998; Bilac and Tanaka, 2004), or on extraction from parallel bilingual corpora (Brill et al., 2001). More recently work has been carried out exploring combinations of dictionaries and corpora (Nakazawa et al., 2005), although this lead does not seem to have been followed further.","Both Bilac and Tanaka (2004) and Nakazawa et al. (2005) address the issue of segmentation of MWEs. This is discussed in 3.1 below.","1","In addition to katakana, loanwords use the ー (chōoN) character for indicating lengthened vowels, and on rare occasions the ヽ and ヾ syllable repeti-tion characters."]},{"title":"3 Role and Nature of Katakana Words in Japanese","paragraphs":["As mentioned above, loan words in Japanese are currently written in the katakana script. This is an orthographical convention that has been applied relatively strictly since the late 1940s, when major script reforms were carried out. Prior to then loanwords were also written using the hiragana syllabary and on occasions kanji (Chinese characters). The katakana script is not used exclusively for loanwords. Other usage includes: a. transcription of foreign person and place","names and other named entities. Many","Japanese companies use names which","are transcribed in katakana. Chinese","(and Korean) place names and person","names, although they are usually avail-","able in kanji are often written in katakana","transliterations; b. the scientific names of plants, animals,","etc. c. onomatopoeic words and expressions, al-","though these are often also written in hi-","ragana; d. occasionally for emphasis and in some","contexts for slang words, in a similar","fashion to the use of italics in English. The proportion of katakana words that were not loanwords was measured by Brill et al. (2001) at about 13%. (The impact and handling of these is discussed briefly at the end of Section 4.) When considering the extraction of Japanese loan words from text, there are a number of issues which need to be addressed. 3.1 Segmentation As mentioned above, many loanwords appear in the form of MWEs, and their correct analysis and handling often requires separa-tion into their composite words. In Japanese there is a convention that loanword MWEs have a “middle-dot” punctuation character (・) inserted between the components, however while this convention is usually followed in dictionaries, it is rarely applied else-where. Web search engines typically ignore this character when indexing, and a search for a very common MWE: トマトソース 62 tomatosōsu “tomato sauce”, reveals that it almost always appears as an undifferentiated string. Moreover, the situation is confused by the common use of the ・ character to separate items in lists, in a manner similar to a semi-colon in English. In practical terms, systems dealing with loanwords MWEs must be prepared to do their own segmentation.","One approach to segmentation is to utilize a Japanese morphological analysis system. These have traditionally been weak in the area of segmentation of loanwords, and tend to default to treating long katakana strings as 1-grams. In testing a list of loanwords and MWEs using the ChaSen system (Matsumoto et al., 2003), Bilac and Tanaka (2004) report a precision and recall of approximately 0.65 on the segmentation, with a tendency to under-segment being the main problem. Nakazawa et al. (2005) report a similar tendency with the JUMAN morphological analyzer (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1998). The problem was most likely due to the relatively poor representation of loanwords in the morpheme lexicons used by these systems. For example the IPADIC lexicon (Asahara and Matsumoto, 2003) used at that time only had about 20,000 words in katakana, and many of those were proper nouns.","In this study, we use the MeCab morphological analyzer (Kudo et al., 2004) with the recently-developed UniDic lexicon (Den et al., 2007), as discussed below.","As they were largely dealing with nonlexicalized words, Bilac and Tanaka (2004) used a dynamic programming model trained on a relatively small (13,000) list of katakana words, and reported a high precision in their segmentation. Nakazawa et al. (2005) used a larger lexicon in combination with the JUMAN analyzer and reported a similar high precision. 3.2 Non-English Words A number of loanwords are taken from languages other than English. The JMdict dictionary (Breen, 2004) has approximately 44,000 loanwords, of which 4% are marked as coming from other languages. Inspection of a sample of the 22,000 entries in the Gakken A Dictionary of Katakana Words (Kabasawa and Satō, 2003) indicates a similar proportion. (In both dictionaries loanwords from languages other than English are marked with their source language.) This relatively small number is known to cause some problems with generating translations through transliterations based on English, but the overall impact is not very significant. 3.3 Pseudo-English Constructions A number of katakana MWEs are constructions of two or more English words forming a term which does not occur in English. An example is バージョンアップ bājon’appu “version up”, meaning upgrading software, etc. These constructions are known in Japanese as 和製英語 wasei eigo “Japanese-made English”. Inspection of the JMdict and Gakken dictionaries indicate they make up approximately 2% of katakana terms, and while a nuisance are not considered to be a significant problem. 3.4 Orthographical Variants Written Japanese has a relatively high in-cidence of multiple surface forms of words, and this particularly applies to loan words. Many result from different interpretations of the pronunciation of the source language term, e.g. the word for “diamond” is both ダイヤモンド daiyamondo and ダイアモンド daiamondo, with the two occurring in approximately equal proportions. (The JMdict dictionary records 10 variants for the word “vibraphone”, and 9 each for “whiskey” and “vodka”.) In some cases two different words have been formed from the one source word, e.g. the English word “truck” was borrowed twice to form トラック torakku meaning “truck, lorry” and トロッコ torokku meaning “trolley, rail car”. Having reasonably complete coverage of alternative surface forms is important in the present project."]},{"title":"4 Approach to Segmentation and MWE Translation","paragraphs":["As our goal is the extraction and translation of loanword MWEs, we need to address the twin tasks of segmentation of the MWEs into their constituent source-language components, and generation of appropriate transla-63","tions for the MWEs as a whole. While the","back-transliteration approaches in previous","studies have been quite successful, and have","an important role in handling single-word","loanwords, we decided to experiment with an","alternative approach which builds on the large","lexicon and n-gram corpus resources which","are now available. This approach, which we","have labelled “CLST” (Corpus-based Loan-","word Segmentation and Translation) builds","upon a direction suggested in Nakazawa et al.","(2005) in that it uses a large English n-gram","corpus both to validate alternative segmenta-","tions and select candidate translations.","The three key resources used in CLST are:","a. a dictionary of katakana words which has been assembled from:","i. the entries with katakana headwords","or readings in the JMdict dictionary; ii. the entries with katakana headwords","in the Kenkyūsha New Japanese-","English Dictionary; iii. the katakana entries in the Eijiro dic-","tionary database;2 iv. the katakana entries in a number of","technical glossaries covering biomed-","ical topics, engineering, finance, law,","etc.","v. the named-entities in katakana","from the JMnedict named-entity","database.3 This dictionary, which contains both base words and MWEs, includes short English translations which, where appropriate, have been split into identifiable senses.

In the present project we use a subset of the corpus consisting only of case-folded alphabetic tokens.","The process of segmenting an MWE and deriving a translation is as follows:","a. using the katakana words in (b) above,","generate all possible segmentations","of the MWE. A recursive algorithm","is used for this. Table 1 shows","the segments derived for the MWE","ソーシャルブックマークサービス","sōsharubukkumākusābisu “social book-","mark service”.","b. for each possible segmentation of an","MWE, assemble one or more possible","glosses as follows:","i. take each element in the segmented MWE, extract the first gloss in the dictionary and assemble a composite potential translation by simply concatenating the glosses. Where there are multiple senses, extract the first gloss from each and assemble all possible combinations. (The first gloss is being used as lexicographers typically place the most relevant and succinct translation first, and this has been observed to be often the most useful when building composite glosses.) As examples, for ソーシャル・ブックマーク・サービス the element サービス has two senses “service” and “goods or services without charge”, so the possible glosses were “social bookmark service” and “social bookmark goods or services without charge”. For ソーシャル・ブック・マーク・サービス the element マーク has senses of “mark”, “paying attention”, 64","“markup” and “Mach”, so the","potential glosses were “social book","mark service”, “social book markup","service”, “social book Mach ser-","vice”, etc. A total of 48 potential","translations were assembled for this","MWE. ii. where the senses are tagged as be-","ing affixes, also create combinations","where the gloss is attached to the","preceding or following gloss as ap-","propriate. iii. if the entire MWE is in the dictio-","nary, extract its gloss as well. It may seem unusual that a single sense is being sought for an MWE with polysemous elements. This comes about because in Japanese polysemous loanwords are almost always due to them being derived from multiple source words. For example ランプ ranpu has three senses reflecting that it results from the borrowing of three distinct English words: “lamp”, “ramp” and “rump”. On the other hand, MWEs containing ランプ, such as ハロゲンランプ harogenranpu “halogen lamp” or オンランプ onranpu “on-ramp” almost invariably are associated with one sense or another.","c. attempt to match the potential translations with the English n-grams, and where a match does exist, extract the frequency data. For the example above, only “social bookmark service”, which resulted from the ソーシャル・ブックマーク・サービス segmentation, was matched successfully;","d. where match(es) result, choose the one with the highest frequency as both the most likely segmentation of the MWE and the candidate translation.","The approach described above assumes that the term being analyzed is a MWE, when in fact it may well be a single word. In the case of as-yet unrecorded words we would expect that either no segmentation is accepted or that any possible segmentations have relatively low frequencies associated with the potential translations, and hence can be flagged for closer inspection. As some of the testing described below involves deciding whether a term is or is not a MWE, we have enabled the system to handle single terms as well by check-ing the unsegmented term against the dictionary and extracting n-gram frequency counts for the glosses. This enables the detection and rejection of possible spurious segmentations. As an example of this, the word ボールト bōruto “vault” occurs in one of the test files described in the following section. A possible segmentation (ボー・ルト) was generated with potential translations of “bow root” and “baud root”. The first of these occurs in the English 2-grams with a frequency of 63, however “vault” itself has a very high frequency in the 1-grams so the segmentation would be rejected.","As pointed out above, a number of katakana words are not loanwords. For the most part these would not be handled by the CLST segmentation/translation process as they would not be reduced to a set of known segments, and would be typically reported as failures. The transliteration approaches in earlier studies also have problems with these words. Some of the non-loanwords, such as scientific names of plants, animals, etc. or words written in katakana for emphasis, can be detected and filtered prior to at-tempted processing simply by comparing the katakana form with the equivalent hiragana form found in dictionaries. Some of the occurrences of Chinese and Japanese names in text can be detected at extraction time, as such names are often written in forms such as “...金鍾泌(キムジョンピル)...”5","."]},{"title":"5 Evaluation","paragraphs":["Evaluation of the CLST system was carried out in two stages: testing the segmentation using data used in previous studies to ensure it was discriminating between single loanwords and MWEs, and testing against a collection of MWEs to evaluate the quality of the translations proposed. 5.1 Segmentation The initial tests of CLST were of the segmentation function and the identification of single words/MWEs. We were fortunate to be 5 Kim Jong-Pil, a former South Korean politician. 65 Method Set Recall Precision F CLST EDR 98.67 100.00 99.33 MeCab EDR 92.67 97.20 94.88 CLST NTCIR-2 94.87 100.00 97.37 MeCab NTCIR-2 95.52 92.75 89.37 Table 2: Results from Segmentation Tests able to use the same data used by Bilac and Tanaka (2004), which consisted of 150 out-of-lexicon katakana terms from the EDR corpus (EDR, 1995) and 78 from the NTCIR-2 test collection (Kando et al., 2001). The terms were hand-marked as to whether they were single words or MWEs. Unfortunately we detected some problems with this marking, for example シェークスピア shēkusupia “Shakespeare” had been segmented (shake + spear) whereas ホールバーニング hōrubāningu “hole burning” had been left as a single word. We considered it inappropriate to use this data without amending these terms. As a consequence of this we are not able to make a direct comparison with the results reported in Bilac and Tanaka (2004). Using the corrected data we analyzed the two datasets and report the results in Table 2. We include the results from analyzing the data using MeCab/UniDic as well for comparison. The precision and recall achieved was higher than that reported in Bilac and Tanaka (2004). As in Bilac and Tanaka (2004), we calculate the scores as follows: N is the number of terms in the set, c is the number of terms correctly segmented or identified as 1-grams, e is the number of terms incorrectly segmented or identified, and n = c + e. Recall is calculated as c","N , precision","as c n , and the F-measure as","2×precision×recall","precision+recall .","As can be seen our CLST approach has achieved a high degree of accuracy in identifying 1-grams and segmenting the MWEs. Although it was not part of the test, it also proposed the correct translations for almost all the MWEs. The less-than-perfect recall is entirely due to the few cases where either no segmentation was proposed, or where the proposed segmentation could not be validated with the English n-grams.","The performance of MeCab/UniDic is interesting, as it also has achieved a high level of accuracy. This is despite the UniDic lexicon only having approximately 55,000 katakana words, and the fact that it is operating out-side the textual context for which it has been trained. Its main shortcoming is that it tends to over-segment, which is a contrast to the performance of ChaSen/IPADIC reported in Bilac and Tanaka (2004) where under-segmentation was the problem. 5.2 Translation The second set of tests of CLST was directed at developing translations for MWEs. The initial translation tests were carried out on two sets of data, each containing 100 MWEs. The sets of data were obtained as follows:","a. the 100 highest-frequency MWEs were","selected from the Google Japanese 2-","grams. The list of potential MWEs","had to be manually edited as the 2-","grams contain a large number of over-","segmented words, e.g. アイコン aikon","“icon” was split: アイコ+ン, and","オークション ōkushon “auction” was","split オーク+ション; b. the katakana sequences were extracted","from a large collection of articles from","1999 in the Mainichi Shimbun (a","Japanese daily newspaper), and the 100","highest-frequency MWEs extracted.","After the data sets were processed by CLST the results were examined to determine if the segmentations had been carried out correctly, and to assess the quality of the proposed translations. The translations were graded into three groups: (1) acceptable as a dictionary gloss, (2) understandable, but in need of improvement, and (3) wrong or inadequate. An example of a translation graded as 2 is マイナスイオン mainasuion “minus ion”, where “negative ion” would be better, and one graded as 3 is フリーマーケット furīmāketto “free market”, where the correct translation is “flea market”. For the most part the translations receiving a grading of 2 were the same as would have been produced by a back-transliteration system, and in many cases they were the wasei eigo constructions described above.","Some example segmentations, possible translations and gradings are in Table 3. 66 MWE Segmentation Possible Translation Frequency Grade ログインヘルプ ログイン・ヘルプ login help 541097 1 ログインヘルプ ログ・イン・ヘルプ log in help 169972 - キーワードランキング キーワード・ランキング keyword ranking 39818 1 キーワードランキング キー・ワード・ランキング key word ranking 74 - キャリアアップ キャリア・アップ career up 13043 2 キャリアアップ キャリア・アップ carrier up 2552 - キャリアアップ キャリア・アップ career close up 195 - キャリアアップ キャリア・アップ career being over 188 - キャリアアップ キャリア・アップ carrier increasing 54 - Table 3: Sample Segmentations and Translations Data Failed Translation Grades","Set Segmentations 1 2 3 Precision Recall F Google 9 66 24 1 98.90 90.00 94.24","Mainichi (Set 1) 3 77 19 1 98.97 96.00 97.46","Mainichi (Set 2) 1 83 16 0 100.00 99.00 99.50 Table 4: Results from Translation Tests","The assessments of the segmentation and the gradings of the translations are given in Table 4. The precision, recall and F measures have been calculated on the basis that a grade of 2 or better for a translation is a satisfactory outcome.","A brief analysis was conducted on samples of 25 MWEs from each test set to as-certain whether they were already in dictionaries, or the degree to which they were suitable for inclusion in a dictionary. The dictionaries used for this evaluation were the commercial Kenkyusha Online Dictionary Service6","which has eighteen Japanese, Japanese-English and English-Japanese dictionaries in its search tool, and the free WWWJDIC on-line dictionary7",", which has the JMdict and JMnedict dictionaries, as well as numerous glossaries.","Of the 50 MWEs sampled:","a. 34 (68%) were in dictionaries; b. 11 (22%) were considered suitable for in-","clusion in a dictionary. In some cases the","generated translation was not considered","appropriate without some modification,","i.e. it had been categorized as “2”;","c. 3 (6%) were proper names (e.g. hotels,","6","http://kod.kenkyusha.co.jp/service/","7","http://www.edrdg.org/cgibin/wwwjdic/wwwjdic?1C software packages);","d. 2 (4%) were not considered suitable for inclusion in a dictionary as they were simple collocations such as メニューエリア menyūeria “menu area”.","As the tests described above were carried out on sets of frequently-occurring MWEs, it was considered appropriate that some further testing be carried out on less common loanword MWEs. Therefore an additional set of 100 lower-frequency MWEs which did not occur in the dictionaries mentioned above were extracted from the Mainichi Shimbun articles and were processed by the CLST system. Of these 100 MWEs: a. 1 was not successfully segmented; b. 83 of the derived translations were clas-","sified as “1” and 16 as “2”; c. 8 were proper names.","The suitability of these MWEs for possible inclusion in a bilingual dictionary was also evaluated. In fact the over-whelming majority of the MWEs were relatively straightforward collocations, e.g. マラソンランナー marasonrannā “marathon runner” and ロックコンサート rokkukonsāto “rock concert”, and were deemed to be not really appropriate as dictionary entries. 5 terms were assessed as being dictionary candidates. 67","Several of these, e.g. ゴールドプラン gōru-","dopuran “gold plan” and エースストライカー","ēsusutoraikā “ace striker” were category 2","translations, and their possible inclusion in","a dictionary would largely be because their","meanings are not readily apparent from the","component words, and an expanded gloss","would be required.","Some points which emerge from the analysis","of the results of the tests described above are:","a. to some extent, the Google n-gram test data had a bias towards the types of constructions favoured by Japanese webpage designers, e.g. ショッピングトップ shoppingutoppu “shopping top”, which possibly inflated the proportion of translations being scored with a 2;","b. some of the problems leading to a failure to segment the MWEs were due to the way the English n-gram files were constructed. Words with apostrophes were split, so that “men’s” was recorded as a bigram: “men+’s”. This situation is not currently handled in CLST, which led to some of the segmentation failures, e.g. with メンズアイテム menzuaitemu “men’s item”;"]},{"title":"6 Conclusion and Future Work","paragraphs":["In this paper we have described the CLST (Corpus-based Loanword Segmentation and Translation) system which has been developed to segment Japanese loanword MWEs and construct likely English translations.
