In our model we explored the use of various lexical, structural and sequential features and worked with Conditional Random Fields (CRF) for classification. Results obtained with our proposed method show improvement with respect to current state-of-the-art systems. We have participated in the ALTA shared task 2012 and our best per-forming model is ranked among top 5 systems."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) or Evidence based practice is “systematically locating, appraising, and using contemporaneous research findings as the basis for clinical decisions” (Rosenberg and Donald, 1995). Considering the huge amounts of literature and millions of clinical articles currently available and continuously being added to databases like PubMed1",", automat-ing the information access or searching scientific evidence for EBM is a crucial task. Currently evidence based practitioners use the PICO criterion which was proposed by Armstrong (1999) to construct queries and search information in EBM tasks. The PICO concepts or tag-sets are: Population (P), Intervention (I), Comparison (C) and Outcome (O).","In this paper, we present a method that classifies sentences in the abstract of a clinical article","1","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed according to PIBOSO criteria which is an extension of PICO. PIBOSO has six tags: Population (P), Intervention (I), Background (B), Outcome (O), Study Design (SD) and Other (Oth). This information could be used in constructing queries or searching relevant articles in the EBM task. A clear description of the PIBOSO tag-set is available in (Kim et al., 2011), who proposed the tag-set. Our system is based on the CRF algorithm which was earlier used by Kim et al. (2011) for a similar task and proven to be useful.","The major contribution of this paper is that we use a simple and large set of features such as lexical, structural and sequential features and show major improvements on the task of sentence classification over earlier attempts. Our classification techniques have shown clear improvement over existing state-of-the art systems especially for unstructured abstracts.","The paper is organised as follows: We present our related work in Section 2, describe the dataset for training and evaluation in Section 3, and our method and experimental setup in Section 4. We present the analysis of our results in Section 5 and conclude in Section 6."]},{"title":"2 Related work","paragraphs":["The first attempt to classify abstract sentences based on the PIBOSO schema is made by Kim et al. (2011). They used the Conditional Random Field (CRF) classifier for learning, and their feature set included lexical features (unigram and bigram with part-of-speech), semantic features (using metathesaurus), structural features (sentence positional features) and sequential features (features from previous sentences). They found out that the best features are unigrams, sentence po-Spandana Gella and Duong Thanh Long. 2012.

In this method, the in-put sentences are pre-processed with a namedentity tagger and dependency parser. They used a statistical relational learning approach in which features are constructed declaratively using intentional relation. Unlike us and Kim et al.

Kim et al(2011) annotated this data using abstracts retrieved from MEDLINE. Both the training and test abstracts have two types of abstracts, structured (S) and unstructured (S). In structured abstracts sentences are organised (and labelled) in an orderly fashion such as Aim, Method, Results, Conclusions and Other whereas these labels are absent in unstructured abstracts.","Please note that the way we categorised an abstract as structured or unstructured might be a bit different from previous approaches by Kim et al.

Since unstructured abstracts do not have these ordering labels, we automatically annotate the training and testing data with ordering labels using simple heuristics. In the unstructured training data, sentences are classified into an ordering label based on its PIBOSO label: Background –> Aim, (Population or Intervention or Study Design) –> Method, Outcome –> Results and Other –> Other.

Overall, our system outperformed existing systems in both structured and unstructured in many labels, which are highlighted in Table 3 under our system section.","Finally, combining BOW, lexical, structure and sentence ordering features showed the highest performance for both structured and unstructured data.

We showed that structural and lexical features coupled with a CRF classifier is an effective method for dealing with sentence classification tasks. The best features in our setting are found to be words, lexical features such as part-of-speech information, sentence positional features, collocations and sentence ordering labels. Our system outperformed earlier existing state-of-art systems (Kim et al., 2011; Verbeke et al., 2012)."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["This work is funded by Erasmus Mundus European Masters Program in Language and Communication Technologies.
