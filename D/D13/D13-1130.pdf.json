In this paper, we propose a segmentation criterion combining both lexical cohesion and disruption, enabling a trade-off between the two. We provide the mathematical formulation of the criterion and an efficient graph based decoding algorithm for topic segmentation. Experimental results on standard textual data sets and on a more challenging corpus of automatically transcribed broadcast news shows demonstrate the benefit of such a combination. Gains were observed in all conditions, with segments of either regular or varying length and abrupt or smooth topic shifts. Long segments benefit more than short segments. However the algorithm has proven robust on automatic transcripts with short segments and limited vocabulary reoccurrences."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Topic segmentation consists in evidentiating the semantic structure of a document: Algorithms developed for this task aim at automatically detecting frontiers which define topically coherent segments in a text.","Various methods for topic segmentation of textual data are described in the literature, e.g., (Reynar, 1994; Hearst, 1997; Ferret et al., 1998; Choi, 2000; Moens and Busser, 2001; Utiyama and Isahara, 2001), most of them relying on the notion of lexical cohesion, i.e., identifying segments with a consistent use of vocabulary, either based on words or on semantic relations between words. Reoccurrences of words or related words and lexical chains are two popular methods to evidence lexical cohesion. This general principle of lexical cohesion is further exploited for topic segmentation with two radically different strategies. On the one hand, a measure of the lexical cohesion can be used to determine coherent segments (Reynar, 1994; Moens and Busser, 2001; Utiyama and Isahara, 2001). On the other hand, shifts in the use of vocabulary can be searched for to directly identify the segment frontiers by measuring the lexical disruption (Hearst, 1997).","Techniques based on the first strategy yield more accurate segmentation results, but face a problem of over-segmentation which can, up to now, only be solved by providing prior information regarding the distribution of segment length or the expected number of segments. In this paper, we propose a segmentation criterion combining both cohesion and disruption along with the corresponding algorithm for topic segmentation. Such a criterion ensures a coherent use of vocabulary within each resulting segment, as well as a significant difference of vocabulary between neighboring segments. Moreover, the combination of these two strategies enables regular-izing the number of segments found without resort-ing to prior knowledge.","This piece of work uses the algorithm of Utiyama and Isahara (2001) as a starting point, a versatile and performing topic segmentation algorithm cast in a statistical framework. Among the benefits of this algorithm are its independency to any particular domain and its ability to cope with thematic segments 1314 of highly varying lengths, two interesting features to obtain a generic solution to the problem of topic segmentation. Moreover, the algorithm has proven to be up to the state of the art in several studies, with no need of a priori information about the number of segments (contrary to algorithms in (Malioutov and Barzilay, 2006; Eisenstein and Barzilay, 2008) that can attain a higher segmentation accuracy). It also provides an efficient graph based implementation of which we take advantage.","To account both for cohesion and disruption, we extend the formalism of Isahara and Utiyama using a Markovian assumption between segments in place of the independence assumption of the original algorithm. Keeping unchanged their probabilistic measure of lexical cohesion, the Markovian assumption enables to introduce the disruption between two consecutive segments. We propose an extended graph based decoding strategy, which is both optimal and efficient, exploiting the notion of generalized segment model or semi hidden Markov models. Tests are performed on standard textual data sets and on a more challenging corpus of automatically transcribed broadcast news shows.","The seminal idea of this paper was partially published in (Simon et al., 2013) in the French language. The current paper significantly elaborates on the latter, with a more detailed description of the algorithm and additional contrastive experiments includ-ing more data sets. In particular, new experiments clearly demonstrate the benefit of the method in a realistic setting with statistically significant gains.","The organization of the article is as follows. Existing work on topic segmentation is presented in Section 2, emphasizing the motivations of the model we propose. Section 3 details the baseline method of Utiyama and Isahara before introducing our algorithm. Experimental protocol and results are given in Section 4. Section 5 summarizes the finding and concludes with a discussion of future work."]},{"title":"2 Related work","paragraphs":["Defining the concept of theme precisely is not trivial and a large number of definitions have been given by linguists. Brown and Yule (1983) discuss at length the difficulty of defining a topic and note: ”The notion of ’topic’ is clearly an intuitively satisfactory way of describing the unifying principle which makes one stretch of discourse ’about’ something and the next stretch ’about’ something else, for it is appealed to very frequently in the discourse analysis literature. Yet the basis for the identification of ’topic’ is rarely made explicit”. To skirt the issue of defining a topic, they suggest to focus on topic-shift markers and to identify topic changes, what most current topic segmentation methods do.","Various characteristics can be exploited to identify thematic changes in text data. The most popular ones rely either on the lexical distribution information to measure lexical cohesion (i.e., word reoccurrences, lexical chains) or on linguistic markers such as discourse markers which indicate continuity or discontinuity (Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Litman and Passonneau, 1995). Linguistic markers are however often specific to a type of text and cannot be considered in a versatile approach as the one we are targeting, where versatility is achieved relying on the sole lexical cohesion.","The key point with lexical cohesion is that a significant change in the use of vocabulary is considered to be a sign of topic shift. This general idea translates into two families of methods, local ones targeting a local detection of lexical disruptions and global ones relying on a measure of the lexical cohesion to globally find segments exhibiting coherence in their lexical distribution.","Local methods (Hearst, 1997; Ferret et al., 1998; Hernandez and Grau, 2002; Claveau and Lefèvre, 2011) locally compare adjacent fixed size regions, claiming a boundary when the similarity between the adjacent regions is small enough, thus identifying points of high lexical disruption. In the seminal work of Hearst (1997), a fixed size window divided into two adjacent blocks is used, consecutively centered at each potential boundary. Similarity between the adjacent blocks is computed at each point, the resulting similarity profile being analyzed to find significant valleys which are considered as topic boundaries.","On the contrary, global methods (Reynar, 1994; Choi, 2000; Utiyama and Isahara, 2001; Ji and Zha, 2003; Malioutov and Barzilay, 2006; Misra et al., 2009) seek to maximize the value of the lexical cohesion on each segment resulting from the segmentation globally on the text. Several approaches have 1315 been taken relying on self-similarity matrices, such as dot plots, or on graphs. A typical and state-of-the-art algorithm is that of Utiyama and Isahara (2001) whose principle is to search globally for the best path in a graph representing all possible segmentations and where edges are valued according to the lexical cohesion measured in a probabilistic way.","When the lengths of the respective topic segments in a text (or between two texts) are very different from one another, local methods are challenged. Finding out an appropriate window size and extract-ing boundaries become critical with segments of varying length, in particular when short segments are present. Short windows will render comparison of adjacent blocks difficult and unreliable while long windows cannot handle short segments. The lack of a global vision also makes it difficult to normalize properly the similarities between blocks and to deal with statistics on segment length. While global methods override these drawbacks, they face the problem of over-segmentation due to the fact that they mainly rely on the sole lexical cohesion. Short segments are therefore very likely to be coherent which calls for regularization introduced as priors on the segments length.","These considerations naturally lead to the idea of methods combining lexical cohesion and disruption to make the best of both worlds. While the two criteria rely on the same underlying principle of lexical coherence (Grosz et al., 1995) and might appear as redundant, the resulting algorithms are quite different in their philosophy. A first (and, to the best of our knowledge, unique) attempt at captur-ing a global view of the local dissimilarities is described in Malioutov and Barzilay (2006). However, this method assumes that the number of segments to find is known beforehand which makes it difficult for real-world usage."]},{"title":"3 Combining lexical cohesion anddisruption","paragraphs":["We extend the graph-based formalism of Utiyama and Isahara to jointly account for lexical cohesion and disruption in a global approach. Clearly, other formalisms than the graph-based one could have been considered. However, graph-based probabilistic topic segmentation has proven very accurate and versatile, relying on very minimal prior knowledge on the texts to segment. Good results at the state-of-the-art have also been reported in difficult conditions with this approach (Misra et al., 2009; Claveau and Lefèvre, 2011; Guinaudeau et al., 2012).","We briefly recall the principle of probabilistic graph-based segmentation before detailing a Markovian extension to account for disruption. 3.1 Probabilistic graph-based segmentation The idea of the probabilistic graph-based segmentation algorithm is to find the segmentation into the most coherent segments constrained by a prior distribution on segments length. This problem is cast into finding the most probable segmentation of a sequence of t basic units (i.e., sentences or utterances composed of words) W = ut","1 among all possible segmentations, i.e.,","Ŝ = arg max S P [W |S]P [S] . (1) Assuming that segments are mutually independent and assuming that basic units within a segment are also independent, the probability of a text W for a segmentation S = Sm","1 is given by","P [W |Sm","1 ] = m ∏ i=1 ni","∏","j=1 P [wi","j|Si] , (2) where ni is the number of words in the segment Si, wi","j is the jth","word in Si and m the number of segments. The probability P [wi","j|Si] is given by a Laplace law where the parameters are estimated on Si, i.e.,","P [wi","j|Si] = fi(wi","j) + 1","ni + k , (3) where fi(wi","j) is the number of occurrences of wi","j in Si and k is the total number of distinct words in W , i.e., the size of the vocabulary V. This probability favors segments that are homogeneous, increas-ing when words are repeated and decreasing consistently when they are different. The prior distribution on segment length is given by a simple model, P [Sm","1 ] = n−m",", where n is the total number of words, exhibiting a large value for a small number of segments and conversely.","The optimization of Eq. 1 can be efficiently implemented as the search for the best path in a 1316 weighted graph which represents all the possible segmentations. Each node in the graph corresponds to a possible frontier placed between two utterances (i.e., we have a node between each pair of utterances), the arc between nodes i and j representing a segment containing utterances ui+1 to uj. The corresponding arc weight is the generalized probability of the words within segment Si→j according to v(i, j) = j ∑ k=i+1 ln(P [uk|Si→j]) − αln(n) where the probability is given as in Eq. 3. The factor α is introduced to control the trade-off between the segments length and the lexical cohesion. 3.2 Introduction of the lexical disruption Eq. 2 derives from the assumption that each segment Si is independent from the others, which makes it impossible to consider disruption between two consecutive segments. To do so, the weight of an arc corresponding to a segment Si should take into account how different this segment is from Si−1. This is typically handled using a Markovian assumption of order 1. Under this assumption, Eq. 2 is reformulated as","P [W |Sm","1 ] = P [W |S1] m","∏","i=2 P [W |Si, Si−1] , where the notion of disruption can be embedded in the term P [W |Si, Si−1] which explicitly mentions both segments. Formally, P [W |Si, Si−1] is defined as a probability. However, arbitrary scores which do not correspond to probabilities can be used instead as the search for the best path in the graph of possible segmentations makes no use of probability the-ory. In this study, we define the score of a segment Si given Si−1 as ln P [W |Si, Si−1] = ln P [Wi|Si] − λ∆(Wi, Wi−1)","(4) where Wi designates the set of utterances in Si and the rightmost part reflects the disruption between the content of Si and of Si−1. Eq. 4 clearly combines the measure of lexical cohesion with a measure of the disruption between consecutive segments: ∆(Wi, Wi−1) > 0 measures the coherence between Si and Si−1, the substraction thus account-ing for disruption by penalizing consecutive coherent segments. The underlying assumption is that the bigger ∆(Wi, Wi−1), the weaker the disruption between the two segments. Parameter λ controls the respective contributions of cohesion and disruption.","We initially adopted a probabilistic measure of disruption based on cross probabilities, i.e., P [Wi|Si−1] and P [Wi−1|Si], which proved to have limited impact on the segmentation. We therefore prefer to rely on a cosine similarity measure between the word vectors representing two adjacent segments, building upon a classical strategy of local methods such as TextTiling (Hearst, 1997). The cosine similarity measure is calculated between vectors representing the content of resp. Si and Si−1, denoted vi and vi−1, where vi is a vector containing the (tf-idf) weight of each term of V in Si. The cosine similarity is classically defined as cos(vi−1, vi) = ∑","v∈V vi−1(v) vi(v) √ ∑","v∈V v2","i−1(v) ∑","v∈V v2","i (v) . (5) ∆(Wi, Wi−1) is calculated from the cosine similarity measure as","∆(Wi, Wi−1) = (1 − cos(vi−1, vi))−1 , (6) thus yielding a small penalty in Eq. 4 for highly disrupting boundaries, i.e., corresponding to low similarity measure.","Given the quantities defined above, the algorithm boils down to finding the best scoring segmentation as given by","Ŝ = arg max S m ∑","i=1 ln(P [Wi|Si]) − λ m ∑ i=2 ∆(Wi, Wi−1) − αmln(n) . (7) 3.3 Segmentation algorithm Translating Eq. 7 into an efficient algorithm is not straightforward since all possible combinations of adjacent segments need be considered. To do so in a graph based approach, one needs to keep separated the paths of different lengths ending in a given node. In other words, only paths of the same length ending 1317 at a given point, with different predecessors, should be recombined so that disruption can be considered properly in subsequent steps of the algorithm. Note that, in standard decoding as in Utiyama and Isahara’s algorithm, only one of such paths, the best scoring one, would be retained. We employ a strategy inspired from the decoding strategy of segment models or semi-hidden Markov model with explicit duration model (Ostendorf et al., 1996; Delakis et al., 2008).","Search is performed through a lattice L = {V, E}, with V the set of nodes representing potential boundaries and E the set of edges representing segments, i.e., a set of consecutive utterances. The set V is defined as V = {nij|0 ≤ i, j ≤ N } , where nij represents a boundary after utterance ui reached by a segment of length j utterances and N = t+1. In the lattice example of Fig. 1, it is trivial to see that for a given node, all incoming edges cover the same segment. For example, the node n42 is positioned after u4 and all incoming segments contain the two utterances u3 and u4. Edges are defined as E = {eip,jl|0 ≤ i, p, j, l ≤ N ; i < j; i = j − l; Lmin ≤ l ≤ Lmax} , where eip,jl connects nip and njl with the constraint that l = j − i and Lmin ≤ l ≤ Lmax. Thus, an edge eip,jl represents a segment of length l containing utterances from ui+1 to uj, denoted Si→j. In Fig. 1, e01,33 represents a segment of length 3 from n01 to n33, covering utterances u1 to u3. To avoid explo-sion of the lattice, a maximum segment length Lmax is defined. Symmetrically, a minimum segment size can be used.","The property of this lattice, where, by construction, all edges out of a node have the same segment as a predecessor, makes it possible to weight each edge in the lattice according to Eq. 4. Consider a node nij for which all incoming edges encompass utterances ui−j to ui. For each edge out of nij, whatever the target node (i.e., the edge length), one can therefore easily determine the lexical cohesion as defined by the generalized probability of Eq. 3 and the disruption with respect to the previous segment as defined by Eq. 6.","Algorithm 1 Maximum probability segmentation Step 0.

We first present the corpora before presenting and discussing results on each. 4.1 Corpora The artificial data set of Choi (2000) is widely used in the literature and enables comparison of a new segmentation method with existing ones. Choi’s data set consist of 700 documents, each created by concatenating the firstz sentences of 10 articles randomly chosen from the Brown corpus, assuming each article is on a different topic. Table 1 provides 1318 Figure 1: An example of a lattice L. z = 3–11 3–5 6–8 9–11 # samples 400 100 100 100 Table 1: Number of documents in Choi’s corpus (Choi, 2000). the corpus statistics, where z=3–11 means z is randomly chosen in the range [3, 11]. Hence, Choi’s corpus is adapted to test the ability of our model to deal with variable segments length, z=3–11 being the most difficult condition. Moreover, Choi’s corpus provides a direct comparison with results reported in the literature.","One of the main criticism of Choi’s data set is the presence of abrupt topic changes due to the artificial construction of the corpus. We therefore report results on a textual corpus with more natural topic changes, also used in (Eisenstein and Barzilay, 2008). The data set consists of 277 chapters selected from (Walker et al., 1990), a medical textbook, where each chapter—considered here as a document—was divided by its author into thematically coherent sections. The data set has a total of 1,136 segments with an average of 5 segments per document and an average of 28 sentences per segment. This data set is used to study the impact of smooth, natural, topic changes.","Finally, results are reported on a corpus of automatic transcripts of TV news spoken data. The data set consists of 56 news programs (≈1/2 hour each), broadcasted in February and March 2007 on the French television channel France 2, and transcribed by two different automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, namely IRENE (Huet et al., 2010) and LIMSI (Gauvain et al., 2002), with respective word error rates (WER) around 36 % and 30 %. Each news program consists of successive reports of short duration (2-3 min), possibly with consecutive reports on different facets of the same news. The reference segmentation was established by associating a topic with each report, i.e., plac-ing a boundary at the beginning of a report’s in-troduction (and hence at the end of the closing remarks). The TV transcript data set, which corresponds to some real-world use cases in the multimedia field, is very challenging for several reasons. On the one hand, segments are short, with a reduced number of repetitions, synonyms being frequently employed. Moreover, smooth topic shifts can be found, in particular at the beginning of each program with different reports dedicated to the headline. On the other hand, transcripts significantly differ from written texts: no punctuation signs or capital letters; no sentence structure but rather utterances which are only loosely syntactically motivated; presence of transcription errors which may imply an accentuated lack of word repetitions.","All data were preprocessed in the same way: Words were tagged and lemmatized with TreeTag-1319 ger1","and only the nouns, non modal verbs and adjectives were retained for segmentation. Inverse document frequencies used to measure similarity in Eq. 5 are obtained on a per document basis, referring to the number of sentences in textual data and of utterances in spoken data. 4.2 Results Performance is measured by comparison of hypothesized frontiers with reference ones. Alignment assumes a tolerance of 1 sentence on texts and of 10 seconds on transcripts, which corresponds to standard values in the literature. Results are reported using recall, precision and F1-measure. Recall refers to the proportion of reference frontiers correctly detected; Precision corresponds to the ratio of hypothesized frontiers that belong to the reference segmentation; F1-measure combines recall and precision in a single value. These evaluation measures were selected because recall and precision are not sensitive to variations of segment length contrary to the Pk measure (Beeferman et al., 1997) and do not favor segmentations with a few number of frontiers as WindowDiff (Pevzner and Hearst, 2002) (see (Niekrasz and Moore, 2010) for a rigorous analytical explanation of the biases of Pk and WindowDiff ).","Several configurations were considered in the experiments; due to space constraints, only the most salient experiments are presented here. In Eq. 7, the parameter α, which controls the contribution of the prior model with respect to the lexical cohesion and disruption, allows for different trade-offs between precision and recall. For any given value of λ, α is thus varied, providing the range of recall/precision values attainable. Results are compared to a baseline system corresponding to the application of the original algorithm of Utiyama and Isahara (i.e., setting λ = 0). This baseline has been shown to be a highperformance algorithm, in particular with respect to local methods that exploit lexical disruption. Differences in F1-measure between this baseline and our system presented below are all statistically significant at the level of p < 0.01 (paired t-test). Choi’s corpus.

Box and whisker plots graphically depicts the distribution of the F1-measures that can be attained by varying α, plotting the median value, the first and third quartile and the extrema.","Figure 2 shows that, whatever the segments length, results globally improve according to the importance given to the disruption (λ variable). Moreover, the variation in F1-measure diminishes when disruption is considered, thus indicating the influ-ence of the prior model diminishes. When the segments size decreases (see Figs. 2(b), 2(c), 2(d)), the difference in the maximum F1-measure between our results and that of the baseline lowers, however still in favor of our model. This can be explained by the fact that our approach is based on the distribution of words, thus more words better help discriminate between potential thematic frontiers. Finally, using too large values for λ can lead to under-segmentation, as can be seen in Fig. 2(d) where, for λ = 3, the variation of F1-measure increases and the distribution be-comes negatively skewed (i.e., the median is closer to the third quartile than to the first).","These results are confirmed by Table 2 which presents the gain in F1-measure (i.e., the difference between the highest F1-measure obtained when 1320 (a) (b) (c) (d) Figure 2: F1-measure variation obtained on Choi’s corpus.

A qualitative analysis of the segmentations obtained confirmed that employing disruption helps eliminate wrong hypothesis and shift hypothesized frontiers closer to the reference ones (explaining the higher gain at tolerance 0 for 9-11 data set). When smaller segments—thus few word repetitions—and no tolerance are considered (e.g., 3–5), disruption cannot improve segmentation. Our model is globally stable with respect to segment length, with relatively similar gain for 3–11 and 6–8 data sets in which the average number of words (distinct or repeated) is close.","Results discussed up to now are optimistic as they correspond to the best F1 value attainable computed a posteriori.

The corresponding figures with respect to the baseline are 0.6 and 0.4. When considering the F1-measure value for which the number of hypothesized frontiers is the closest to the number of reference boundaries, improvement is of resp. 1.5 and 0.5 with respect to BayesSeg, -0.1 and 0.4 with respect to the baseline. These results show that our model combining lexical cohesion and disruption is also able to deal with topic segmentation of corpora from a homogeneous domain, with smooth topic changes and segments of regular size.","One can argue that the higher number of free parameters in our method explains most of the gain with respect to BayesSeg. While BayesSeg has only one free parameter (as opposed to two in our case), the number of segments is assumed to be provided as prior knowledge. This assumption can be seen as an additional free parameter, i.e., the number of segments, and is a much stronger constraint than we are using. Moreover, cross-validation experiments on the Choi data set show that improvement is not due to over-fitting of the development data thanks to an additional parameter. Gains on development set with parameters tuned on the development set itself and with parameters tuned on a held-out set in cross-validation experiments are in the same range. TV news transcripts corpus Figure 3 provides results, in terms of F1-measure variation, for TV news transcripts obtained with the two ASR systems. On this highly challenging corpus, with short segments, wrongly transcribed spoken words, and thus few word repetitions, the capabilities of our model to overcome the baseline system are reduced. Yet, an improvement of the quality of the segmentation of these noisy data is still observed, and general conclusions are quite similar—though a bit weaker—to those already made for Choi’s corpus. Results are confirmed in Table 4 which presents the gain in F1-measure of our model together with the 95 % confidence interval, where F1-measure values correspond to that of segmentations with a number of hypothesized frontiers the closest to the reference. The two first lines show that the gain is smaller for IRENE transcripts which have a higher WER, thus fewer words available to discriminate between segments belonging to different topics. The impact of transcription errors is illustrated in the last three lines, when segmenting six TV news for which manual reference transcripts were available (line 3), where the higher the WER, the smaller the F1-measure gain."]},{"title":"5 Conclusions","paragraphs":["We have proposed a method to combine lexical cohesion and disruption for topic segmentation.
