Inspired by Generative Lexicon Theory (Pustejovsky, 1995), our goal is a compositional model where both predicate and argument are allowed to modify each others’ meaning representations while generating the overall semantics.

We implement co-compositionality using prototype projections on predicates/arguments and show that this is effective in adapting their word representations. We further cast the model as a neural network and propose an unsupervised algorithm to jointly train word representations with co-compositionality.

The goal is to formulate how individual word representations ought to be combined to achieve phrasal or sentential semantics.","The main questions for semantic compositionality that we are concerned with are: (1) how can polysemy be handled by a single vector representation per word type, learned by either a distributional or neural model, and (2) how does composition resolve 130 these ambiguities. To this end, we are inspired by the idea of type coercion and co-compositionality in Generative Lexicon Theory (Pustejovsky, 1995). Co-compositionality advocates that instead of a predicate-argument view of composition, both predicate and argument influence/coerce each other to generate the overall meaning. For example, consider a polysemous word like run: • (a) He runs the company. • (b) He runs the marathon. Run may have several senses, but the prototypical verbs that select for company differ from those that select for marathon, and thus the ambiguity at the word level is resolved at the sentence level. The same is true for the other direction, where the predicate also coerces meaning to the argument to fit expectation.","We believe that models for semantic composition ought to incorporate elements of co-compositionality. We propose such a model here, using what we call prototype projections. For each predicate, we transform its vector representation by projecting it into a latent space that is prototypical of its argument. This projection is performed analogously for each argument as well, and the final meaning is computed by composition of these trans-formed vectors (Figure 1). In addition, the model is cast as a neural network where word representations could be re-trained or fine-tuned. 1","Our contributions are two-fold:","1. We propose a novel model for semantic co-compositionality. This model, based on prototype projections, is easy to implement and achieves state-of-the-art performance in the sentence similarity dataset developed by Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh (2011). 2. Our results empirically confirm that existing","word representations (eg., SDS and NLM in","Section 2) are sufficiently effective at capturing","1","While we are inspired by co-compositionality, it is important to note that our model does not implement qualia structure and other important components of Generative Lexicon Theory. We operate within the vector space model of distributional semantics, so these ideas are implemented with matrix algebra, which is a natural fit with neural networks. polysemy, as long as we have the proper mechanism to tease out the proper sense during composition. We further propose an unsupervised neural network training algorithm that jointly fine-tunes the word representations within the co-composition model, resulting in even better performance on the sentence similarity task.","We would like to emphasize the second contribution especially. Semantics research is divided in two strands, one focusing on learning word representations without consideration for compositionality, and the other focusing on compositional semantics using the representations only as an input. But issues are actually related from the linguistics perspective, and even more so if we adopt a Generative Lexicon perspective. Our neural network model bridges these two strands of research by modeling co-compositionality and learning word representations simultaneously. We note that methods using context effects have been explored by Erk and Padó (2008; 2009) and Thater et al. (2010; 2011), but to the best of our knowledge, ours is the first model to perform co-compositionality and learning of word representations jointly.","In the following, we first provide background to the word representations employed here (Section 2). We describe the model for co-compositionality in Section 3 and the corresponding neural network in Section 4. Evaluation and experiments are presented in Sections 5 and 6. Finally, we end with related work (Section 7) and conclusions (Section 8)."]},{"title":"2 Word Vector Representations2.1 Simple Distributional Semantic space(SDS) word vectors","paragraphs":["Word meaning is often represented in a high dimensional space, where each element corresponds to some contextual element in which the word is found. Mitchell and Lapata (2010) present a co-occurrence-based semantic space called Simple Distributional Semantic space (SDS). Their SDS model uses a context window of five words on either side of the target word and 2,000 vector components, representing the most frequent context words (excluding a list of stop words). These components vi(t) were set to the ratio of the probability of the context word given the 131 target word to the probability of the context word overall:","vi(t) = p(ci|t) p(ci) = f reqci,t × f reqtotal","f reqt × f reqci (1) where f reqci,t, f reqtotal, f reqt and f reqci are the frequencies of the context word ci with the target word t, the total count of all word tokens, the frequency of the target word t, and the frequency of the context word ci, respectively. 2.2 Neural Language Model (NLM) word embeddings Another popular way to learn word representations is based on the Neural Language Model (NLM) (Bengio et al., 2003). In comparison with SDS, NLM tend to be low-dimensional (e.g. 50 dimensions) but employ dense features. These dense feature vectors are usually called word embeddings, and it has been shown that such vectors can capture interesting linear relationships, such as king − man + woman ≈ queen (Mikolov et al., 2013). In this work, we adopt the model by Collobert and Weston (2008). The idea is to construct a neural network based on word sequences, where one outputs high scores for n-grams that occur in a large unlabeled corpus and low scores for nonsense n-grams where one word is replaced by a random word. This word representation with NLM has been used to good effect, for example in (Turian et al., 2010; Collobert et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2012) where induced word representations are used with sophisticated features to improve performance in various NLP tasks.","Specifically, we first represent the word sequence as a vector x = [d(w1); d(w2); . . . ; d(wm)], where wi is ith word in the sequence, m is the window size, d(w) is the vector representation of word w (an n-dimensional column vector) and [d(w1); d(w2); . . . ; d(wm)] is the concatenation of word vectors as an input of neural network. Second, we compute the score of the sequence,","score(x) = sT (tanh(Wx + b)) (2)","where W ∈ Rh×(mn)","and s ∈ Rh","are the first","and second layer weights of the neural network,","and b ∈ Rh","is the bias unit of hidden layer. The superscript T represents transposition, and tanh is applied element-wise. We also create a corrupted sequence xc = [d(w1); d(w2); . . . ; d(wm′",")] where wm′","is chosen randomly from the vocabulary. We compute the score of this implicit negative sequence xc with the same neural network, score(xc) = sT","(tanh(Wxc + b)). Finally, we get the cost function of this training algorithm as follow. J = max(0, 1 − score(x) + score(xc)) (3) In order to minimize this cost function, we optimize the parameters θ = (s, W, b, x) via backpropagation with stochastic gradient descent (SGD)."]},{"title":"3 The Model3.1 Prototype Projection","paragraphs":["Generative Lexicon Theory (Pustejovsky, 1995) makes a distinction between accidental polysemy (homonyms, e.g. bank as financial institution vs. as river side) and logical polysemy (e.g. figure and ground meanings of door). Our model handles both cases using the concept of projection to latent prototype space. The fundamental idea is that for each word w and a syntactic/semantic (binary) relation R (such as verb-object relation), w has a set of prototype words with which it frequently occurs in relation R. For example, if w is a word company, and R is the object-verb relation, prototype words should include start, build, and buy (Figure 1). For each word-relation pair, we pre-compute the latent semantic subspace spanned by these prototype words.","Later, when we encounter a phrase expressing a relation R between two words w1 and w2, each word is first projected onto a latent subspace determined by the other word and relation R. The projection operation shifts the meaning of individual words in accordance with context, and through this operation we realize coercion/co-composition. And finally, the meaning of the phrase is computed from the two projected points in the semantic space.","Let us describe how to compute the latent subspace associated with a word w0 and a relation R. First, we collect from a corpus a set of prototype words that occur frequently in relation R with target word w0. So for example in Figure 1, if w0 = 132 verb object landmark similarity(verb, landmark) similarity(projected verb, landmark) run company operate 0.40 0.70 meet criterion satisfy 0.49 0.71 spell name write 0.04 0.50 Table 1: Examples of verb-object pairs.

We make an m×n matrix C(R,w0) by stacking the prototype word vectors, i.e., C(R,w0) = [d(w1), d(w2), · · · , d(wm)]T (4) and then apply Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to extract the latent space from this matrix:","C(R,w0) ≈ UkΣkVT k .

Hence, when we observe a relation R(w0, w), the projected representation of word w in this context is computed by prpj(R,w0)(w) defined as follows: prpj(R,w0)(w) = P(R,w0)d(w). (6) Table 1 shows several examples of how meanings change after prototype projection using word embeddings of Collobert and Weston (2008).2 3.2 Co-Compositionality In order to model co-compositionality, we apply prototype projection to both the verb and the object. In particular, suppose verb is wv and object is wo, C(VerbOf,wo) is used to project wv and C(ObjOf,wv) is used to project wo. The vector that represents the overall meaning of verb-object with prototype projection is computed by: cocomp(wv, wo) = f (prpj(VerbOf,wo)(wv), prpj(ObjOf,wv)(wo)) (7) Function f can be a compositional computation like simple addition or element-wise multiplication of two vectors. This is graphically shown in Figure 1."]},{"title":"4 Unsupervised Learning ofCo-Compositionality","paragraphs":["In this section, we propose a new neural language model that learns word representations while jointly accounting for compositional semantics.

We will show that such an assumption is quite reasonable under our model, since the prototype projections successfully tease out the proper semantics from these aggregate representations.","However, it is natural to wonder whether one can do better if one incorporates the compositional model into the training of the word representations in the first place. To do so, we formulate a novel model called Compositional Neural Language Model (Section 4.1). This model is a combination of an unsupervised training algorithm with basic compositionality (addition/multiplications). Then, we extend this model with the projection idea in section 3.2 to formulate a Co-Compositional Neural Language Model (Section 4.2). 4.1 Compositional Neural Language Model (C-NLM) Compositional Neural Language Model (C-NLM) is a combination of a word representation learning method and compositional rule. In contrast to other compositional models based on machine learning, our model has no complex parameters for modeling composition. Composition is modeled using straightforward vector addition/multiplications; instead, what is learned is the word representation.","Figure 3 shows the C-NLM.

The new verb vector vnew trained within additive compositionality is just vnew = znew − o. Note that if we also want to optimize o, we may want to also corrupt the object and run SGD in step 2 as well. 4.2 Co-Compositional Neural Language Model (CoC-NLM) We now add prototype projection into C-NLM, making our final model: Co-Compositional Neural 134 Language Model (CoC-NLM). We define the score function as dot product of s and additional vector of prototype projected vectors (Figure 4). Let Pobj = P(VerbOf,wo) and Pverb = P(ObjOf,wv),","score(v, o) = sT (Pobjv + Pverbo).

The dataset consists of similarity judgments between a landmark verb and a triple consisting of a transitive target verb, subject and object extracted from the BNC corpus. Human judges give scores between 1 to 7, with higher scores implying higher semantic similarity.

The contextual model of Erk and Padó (SDS) also performed relatively well (ρ = 0.39), in fact outperforming the Van de Cruy et al. (2013) result as well. This means that the general idea of adapting word representations based on context is a very powerful one. However, Erk and Padó’s model using the NLM representation is extremely poor (ρ = 0.03). The reason is that it uses a product operation under-the-hood to adapt the vectors, which inherently assumes a sparse representation. In this sense, our projection approach is more robust.","The state-of-the-art result for our model in Table 3 does not yet make use of the training algorithm described in Section 4. It is simply implementing the co-compositionality idea using prototype projections (Section 3.2). Next in Section 6.2 we will show additional gains using unsupervised learning. 6.2 Improvements from unsupervised learning In this experiment, we examine how much gain is possible by re-training the word representation of verbs using the unsupervised algorithm described in Section 4.

In contrast to other previous compositional models, our model does not require estimating a large number of parameters for computation of compositional vectors and word representation itself is more suitable for it. Furthermore, learning is very fast, taking about 10 minutes for C-NLM on a standard machine with Intel Core i7 2.93Ghz CPU and 8GB of RAM. 6.3 The number of prototype words The number of prototype words (m in Figure 1) we use to generate the prototype space is one hyperparameter that our model has. Here, we analyze the effect of the choice of m. Figure 5 shows the relation of m and the performance of co-compositional model with prototype projections using either SDS or NLM representations. In general, both NLM and SDS show relatively smooth and flat curves across m, indicating the relative robustness of the approach. Nevertheless, results do degrade for large m, due to increase in noise from non-prototype words. Further, it does appear that NLM has a slower drop in correlation with increasing m compared with SDS. This suggests that NLM is more robust, which is possibly attributable to the dense and low-dimensional distributed features. 6.4 Variations in model configuration We have presented a compositional model of the form d(ws) + cocomp(wv, wo), where prototype projections are performed on both wv and wo and ws is composed as is without projection. In general, we have the freedom to choose what to project and what not to project under this co-compositional framework. Here in Table 5 we show the results of Figure 5: The relation between the number of prototype words and correlation of SDS or NLM.

Mitchell and Lapata (2010), Erk (2012) and Baroni et al. (2013) are recommended survey papers. 137","One of the first approaches is the vector addition/multiplication idea of Mitchell and Lapata (2008). The appeal of this kind of simple approach is its intuitive geometric interpretation and its robustness to various datasets. However, it may not be sufficiently expressive to represent the various factors involved in compositional semantics, such as syntax and context. To this end, Baroni and Zamparelli (2010) present a compositional model for adjectives and nouns. In their model, an adjective is a matrix operator that modifies the noun vector into an adjective-noun vector. Zanzotto et al. (2010) and Guevara (2010) also proposed linear transformation models for composition and address the issue of estimating large matrices with least squares or regression techniques. Socher et al. (2012) extend this linear transformation approach with the more powerful model of Matrix-Vector Recursive Neural Networks (MV-RNN). Each node in a parse tree is assigned both a vector and a matrix. The vector captures the actual meaning of the word itself, while the matrix is modeled as a operator that modify the meaning of neighboring words and phrases. This model captures semantic change phenomenon like not bad is similar to good due to a composition of the bad vector with a meaning-flipping not matrix. But this MV-RNN also need to optimize all matrices of words from initial value (identity plus a small amount of Gaussian noise) with supervised dataset like movie reviews. Our prototype projection model is similar to these models as a matrix-vector operation, except that the matrix is not learned and computed from prototype words. In future work, we can imagine integrating the two models, using these prototype projection matrices as initial values for MV-RNN training (Socher et al., 2012).","Another approach is exemplified by Coecke et al. (2010). In their mathematical framework unifying categorical logic and vector space models, the sentence vector is modeled as a function of the Kronecker product of its word vectors. Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh (2011) implement this based on unsupervised learning of matrices for relational words and apply them to the vectors of their arguments. Their idea is that words with relational types, such as verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are matrices that act as a filter on their arguments. They also developed a new semantic similarity task based on transitive Composition Operator Parameter Add: w1u + w2v w1, w2 ∈ R","Multiply: uw1 ⊙ vw2 w1, w2 ∈ R FullAdd: W1u + W2v W1, W2 ∈ Rn×n LexFunc: Auv Au ∈ Rn×n","FullLex: σ([W1Auv, W2Avu])  Au, Av ∈ Rn×n W1, W2 ∈ Rn×n Ours (Add): P(R,v)u + P(R,u)v SVD’s ( m, k) Ours (Mult): P(R,v)u ⊙ P(R,u)v SVD’s ( m, k) Table 6: Comparison of composition operators that combine two word vector representations, u, v ∈ Rn","and their learning parameters. Our model only needs two hyper-parameters: the number of prototype words m and dimensional reduction k in SVD verbs, which is the dataset we used here.

They model compositionality as a multi-way interaction between latent factors, which are automatically constructed from corpus data via matrix factorization.","Comprehensive evaluation of various existing models are reported in (Blacoe and Lapata, 2012; Dinu et al., 2013). Blacoe and Lapata (2012) highlight the importance of jointly examining word representations and compositionality operators. However, two out of three composition methods they evaluate are parameter-free, so that they can side-step the issue of parameter estimation. Dinu et al. (2013) describe the relation between word vector and compositionality in more detail with free parameters. Table 6 summarizes some ways to compose the meaning of two word vectors (u, v), following (Dinu et al., 2013). These range from simple operators (e.g. Add and Multiply) to expressive models with many free parameters (e.g. LexFunc, FullLex). Many of these models need to optimize n × n parameters, which may be large. On the other hand, our model only needs two hyper-parameters: the number of prototype words m and dimensional reduction k in SVD (Table 6). Furthermore, our model performance with neural language model word embeddings is robust to variations in m.","Most closely related to our work is the work by Erk and Padó (2008; 2009) and Thater et al. (2010; 2011), which falls under the research theme of computing word meaning in context. Both methods are characterized by the use of selectional prefer-138 ence information for subjects, verbs, and objects in context; our prototype word vectors are essentially equivalent to this idea. The main difference is in how we modify the target word representation v using this information: whereas we project v onto a latent subspace formed by collection of prototype vectors, Erk and Padó (2008; 2009) and Thater et al. (2010; 2011) use the prototype vectors to directly modify the elements of v, i.e. by element-wise product with the centroid prototype vector. Intuitively, both our method and theirs essentially delete part of a word vector representation to adapt the meaning in context. We believe the projection is more robust to the underlying word representation (and this is shown in the results for SDS vs. NLM representations), but we note that we may be able to borrow some of more sophisticated ways to find prototype vectors from Erk and Padó (2008; 2009) and Thater et al. (2010; 2011)."]},{"title":"8 Conclusion and Future Work","paragraphs":["We began this work by asking how it is possible to handle polysemy issues in compositional semantics, especially when adopting distributional semantics methods that construct only one representation per word type. After all, the different senses of the same word are all conflated into a single vector representation. We found our inspiration in Generative Lexicon Theory (Pustejovsky, 1995), where ambiguity is resolved due to co-compositionality of the words in the sentence, i.e., the meaning of an ambiguous verb is generated by the properties the object it takes, and vice versa. We implement this idea in a novel neural network model using prototype projections. The advantages of this model is that it is robust to the underlying word representation used and that it enables an effective joint learning of word representations. The model achieves the current state-of-the-art performance ( ρ = 0.47) on the semantic similarity task of transitive verbs (Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh, 2011).","Directions for future research include:","• Experiments on other semantics tasks, such as paraphrase detection, word sense induction, and word meaning in context. • Extension to more holistic sentence-level composition using a matrix-vector recursive framework like (Socher et al., 2012).","• Explore further the potential synergy between Distributional Semantics and the Generative Lexicon."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This work was partially supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 24800041, JSPS KAKENHI 2430057 and Microsoft Research CORE Project.
