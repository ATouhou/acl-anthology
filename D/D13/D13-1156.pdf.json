In contrast, joint compression and summarization can use smaller units such as words and phrases, resulting in summaries containing more information. The goal of compressive summarization is to find a subset of words that max-imize the total score of concepts and cut-ting dependency arcs under the grammar constraints and summary length constraint. We propose an efficient decoding algorithm for fast compressive summarization using graph cuts. Our approach first relaxes the length constraint using Lagrangian relaxation. Then we propose to bound the relaxed objective function by the supermodular binary quadratic programming problem, which can be solved efficiently using graph max-flow/min-cut.

Summarization techniques can be roughly divided into two categories: extractive and abstractive. Extractive summarization casts the summarization task as a sentence selection problem: identifying important summary sentences from one or multiple documents. Many methods have been developed in the past decades, including supervised approaches that use classifiers to predict summary sentences, graph based approaches to rank the sentences, and recent global optimization methods such as integer linear programming (Gillick et al., 2008) (ILP) and submodular maximization methods (Lin and Bilmes, 2011). Though extractive summarization is popular because of its simplicity and high readability, it has limitations in that it selects each sentence as a whole, and thus may miss informative partial sentences.","To improve the informativeness, joint compression and summarization was proposed (Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2011), which uses words as summarization units, unlike extractive summarization where each sentence is a basic undecomposable unit. To achieve better readability, manually defined grammar constraints or automatically learned models based on syntax trees are added during the summarization process. Up to now, the state of the art compressive systems are based on integer linear programming (ILP). Because ILP suffers from exponential complexity, word-based compression summarization is an order of magnitude slower than sentence-based extraction.","One common way to solve an ILP problem is to use its LP relaxation and round the results. However Berg-Kirkpatrick et al. (2011) found that LP relaxation gave poor results, finding unacceptably suboptimal solutions. For speedup, they proposed a two stage method where they performed some sentence selection in the first step to reduce the number of candidates. Despite their empirical success, such 1492 a pruning approach has its inherent problem in that it may eliminate correct sentences in the first step. Recently, Almeida and Martins (2013) proposed a fast joint decoding algorithm based on dual decomposition. For fast convergence, they added quadratic penalty terms to alleviate the learning rate problem.","In this paper, we propose an efficient decoding algorithm for fast ILP based compressive summarization using graph cuts. Our assumption is that all concepts are word n-grams and non-negatively scored. The rationale for the non-negativity assumption is s-traightforward: the score of a concept reflects its informativeness, hence should be non-negative. Given a set of documents, each word is associated with a binary variable, indicating whether the word is selected in the summary. Our idea is to approximate the ILP as a binary quadratic programming problem where coefficients of all quadratic terms are non-negative. It is well known that such binary quadratic function is supermodular, and its maximum can be solved efficiently using graph max-flow/min-cut. Hence the key is to find the coefficients of the supermodular binary quadratic function (SBQF) so that its maximum is close to the optimal ILP objective function. Our solution consists of 3 steps. First, we show that the subtree deletion model and grammar constraints can be eliminated by adding SBQFs to the objective function. Second, we relax the summary length constraint using Lagrangian relaxation. Third, we propose a family of SBQFs that are lower bounds of the ILP objective function. Since finding the tightest lower bound suffers from local optimality, we choose to use convex relaxation for initialization. To demonstrate our technique, we conduct experiments on Text Analysis Conference (TAC) datasets using the same train/test splits as previous work (Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2011). We compare our approach with the state-of-the-art ILP based approach in terms of summary quality (ROUGE scores and sentence quality) and speed. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves competitive performance with ILP, while about 100 times faster."]},{"title":"2 Compressive Summarization2.1 Extractive Summarization","paragraphs":["As our method is an approximation of ILP based method, we first briefly review the ILP based extractive summarization and compressive summarization. Gillick and Favre (2009) introduced the concept-based ILP for summarization. A concept is a basic semantic unit. They used word bigrams as such language concepts. Their system achieved the highest ROUGE score on the TAC 2009 evaluation. This approach selects sentences so that the total score of language concepts appearing in the summary is maximized. The association between the language concepts and sentences serves as the constraints, in addition to the summary length constraint.","Formally, given a set of sentences S = {sn}N","n=1, extractive summarization can be represented by a binary vector y, where yn indicates whether sentence sn is selected. Let C = {c1, . . . cJ } denote the set of concepts in S, e.g., word bigrams (Gillick and Favre, 2009). Each concept cj is associated with a given score wj and a binary variable vj indicating if cj is selected in the summary. Let njk denote the index of the sentence containing the kth","occurrence of concept cj, and ln denote the length of sentence sn. The ILP based extractive summarization system can be formulated as below: max y,v J ∑ j=1 wjvj s.t.","vj = ⋃ k ynjk 1 ≤ j ≤ J (1) N ∑ i=1 ynln ≤ L v, y are binary The first constraint is imposed by the relation between concept selection and sentence selection: selecting a sentence leads to the selection of all the concepts it contains, and selecting a concept only happens when it is present in at least one of the selected sentences. The second constraint is the summary length constraint.","As solving an ILP problem is generally NP-hard, pre-pruning of candidate concepts and sentences is necessary for efficient summarization. For exam-1493 ple, the ICSI system (Gillick et al., 2008) removed the sentences that are too short or have non-overlap with the queries, and concepts with document frequency less than 3, resulting in 95.8 sentences and about 80 concepts per topic on the TAC2009 dataset. Therefore the actual scale of ILP is rather small after pruning (e.g., 176 variables and 372 constraints per topic). Empirical studies showed that such small scale ILP can be solved within a few seconds (Gillick and Favre, 2009). 2.2 Compressive Summarization The quality of sentence-based extractive summarization is limited by the informativeness of the original sentences and the summary length constraint. To remove the unimportant part from a long sentence, sentence compression is proposed to generate more informative summaries (Liu and Liu, 2009; Li et al., 2013a). Recent studies show that joint sentence compression and extraction, namely compressive summarization, outperforms pipeline systems that run extractive summarization on the compressed sentences or compress selected summary sentences (Martins and Smith, 2009; Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2011; Chali and Hasan, 2012). In Berg-Kirkpatrick et al. (2011), compressive summarization integrates the concept model for extractive summarization (Gillick and Favre, 2009) and subtree deletion model for sentence compression. The score of a compressive summary consists of two parts, scores of selected concepts, and scores of the broken arcs in the dependency parse trees. The selected words must satisfy the length constraint and grammar constraints that include subtree constraint and some manually defined hard constraints.","Formally, let x = x1 . . . xI denote the word sequence of documents, where s1 = x1, . . . xl1 corresponds to the first sentence, s2 = xl1+1, . . . , xl1+l2 corresponds to the second sentence, and so on. A compressive summary can be represented by a binary vector z, where zi indicates whether word xi is selected in the summary. Let ahm denote the arc xh → xm in the dependency parse tree of the corresponding sentence containing words xh and xm, and A = {ahm} denote the set of dependency arcs. The subtree constraint ensures that word xm is selected only if its head xh is selected. In order to guarantee the readability, grammar constraints are added to prohibit the breaks of some specific arcs. For example, Clarke and Lapata (2008) never deleted an arc whose dependency label is SUB, OBJ, PMOD, SBAR or VC. In this paper, we use B ⊆ A to denote the set of these arcs that must not be broken in summarization. We use ojk to denote the indices of words corresponding to the kth occurrence of cj. For example, suppose the jth concept European Union appears twice in the document: x22x23 = x50x51 =European Union, then oj1 = {22, 23}, oj2 = {50, 51}.","The compressive summarization model can be formulated as an integer programming problem max z,v J ∑","j=1 wj · vj + ∑ ahm∈A wahmzh(1 − zm) s.t.","vj = ⋃ k ∏","i∈ojk zi ∀j ∑ i zi ≤ L zh ≥ zm ∀ahm ∈ A (2) zh = zm ∀ahm ∈ B z, v are binary According to the subtree deletion model, the score of arc ahm is included if zh = 1 and zm = 0, which can be formulated as wahm · zh(1 − zm). The first constraint is similar to that in extractive summarization, that is, a concept is selected if and only if any of its occurrence is selected. The third and fourth constraints are the subtree constraints and manually defined grammar constraints respectively. In the rest of the paper, without loss of generality, we remove the fourth constraint by directly substituting one variable for the other.","Finding the optimal summary is generally NP-hard. Unlike extractive summarization where the scale of the problem (the number of sentences and concepts) is small, the number of variables in compressive summarization is linear in the number of words, which is usually thousands on the TAC datasets. Hence solving such a problem using ILP based decoding algorithms is not efficient especially when the document set is large. 1494"]},{"title":"3 Fast Decoding via Graph Cuts","paragraphs":["In this section, we introduce our fast decoding algorithm. We assume that all the concepts are word n-grams, and their scores are non-negative. The non-negativity assumption can reduce the computational complexity, but is also reasonable: the score of a concept denotes its informativeness, hence should be non-negative. For example, Li et al. (2013b) proposed to use the estimated normalized frequencies of concepts as scores, which are essentially non-negative. The basic idea of our method is to approximate the above optimization problem (2) by the supermodular binary quadratic programming (SBQP) problem: max z ∑","i βizi + ∑ ij αijzizj s.t. z is binary (3) where αij ≥ 0. It is known that such a binary quadratic function is supermodular, and its maximum can be solved efficiently using graph max-flow/min-cut (Billionnet and Minoux, 1985; Kolmogorov and Zabih, 2004). Now the problem is to find the optimal α, β for a good approximation. 3.1 Formulate Grammar Constraints and Subtree Deletion Model by SBQF We show that the subtree deletion model can be formulated equivalently using SBQF. First, we can eliminate the constraint zh ≥ zm by adding a penalty term to the objective function. That is, max f (z) s.t. zh ≥ zm z is binary is equivalent to max f (z) − ∞(1 − zh)zm s.t. z is binary We can see that the penalty term −∞(1 − zh)zm excludes zh = 0, zm = 1 from the feasible set, and for zh ≥ zm, both problems have the same objective function value. Hence the two problems are equivalent. Notice that the coefficient of quadratic term in −∞(1 − zh)zm is positive, hence the penalty term is supermodular.","Now we eliminate the third constraint in problem (2) using the penalized objective function described above. Note that the fourth constraint has been eliminated by variable substitution, we have max z,v J ∑","j=1 wj · vj + ∑ ahm∈A wahmzh(1 − zm)","−∞ ∑ ahm∈A(1 − zh)zm s.t.","vj = ⋃ k ∏","i∈ojk zi ∀j (4) ∑ i zi ≤ L z, v are binary We can see that for each arc ahm, there must be a positive quadratic term +∞zhzm in the objective function, which guarantees the supermodularity of the objective function, no matter what wahm is. 3.2 Eliminate Length Constraint Using Lagrangian Relaxation Problem (4) is NP-hard, because for any feasible v, it is a SBQP with a length constraint. Since size constrained minimum cut problem is generally NP-hard (Nagano et al., 2011), Problem (4) can not be cast as a SBQP as long as P ̸= NP. One popular way to deal with the size constrained optimization problem is Lagrangian relaxation. We introduce Lagrangian multiplier λ to the length constraint in Problem (4), and get min λ max","z,v J ∑","j=1 wj · vj + ∑ ahm∈A wahmzh(1 − zm)","−∞ ∑ ahm∈A(1 − zh)zm","+λ(L − ∑ i zi) s.t.","vj = ⋃ k ∏","i∈ojk zi ∀j (5) λ ≥ 0 z, v are binary","We solve the relaxed problem iteratively. In each iteration, we fix λ and solve the inner maximization problem (details described below). The score of 1495 each word is penalized by λ — with larger λ, few-er words are selected. Hence the summary length can be adjusted by λ. The optimal λ can be found using binary search. We maintain an upper bound λmax , and a lower bound λmin, which is initially 0. In each iteration, we choose λ = 1","2 (λmax + λmin) and search the optimal z. If the duality gap vanishes, i.e., λ(L − ∑","i zi) = 0 and ∑","i zi ≤ L, then we get the global solution of Problem (4). Otherwise, if ∑","i zi > L, then the current λ is too small, so we set λmin = λ; otherwise, λ > 0 and ∑","i zi < L, we set λmax = λ. The search process terminates if λmax − λmin is less than a predefined threshold. 3.3 Eliminate v Using Supermodular Relaxation Now we consider the inner maximization Problem (5). It is still not a SBQP, since the objective function is not a linear function of zizj. We propose to approximate the objective function using SBQP. Our solution consists of two steps. First we relax the first constraint of Problem (5) by bounding the objective function with a family of supermodular pseudo boolean functions (Boros and Hammer, 2002). Second we reformulate these pseudo boolean functions equivalently as quadratic functions.","Similar to the bounding strategy in (Qian and Liu, 2013), we relax the logical disjunction by lineariza-tion.

Though one can use techniques such as branch-and-bound for exact inference (Qian and Liu, 2013; Gormley and Eisner, 2013), here for fast decoding, we use convex relaxation to choose a good seed p(0). Recall that pjk denotes the percentage of the kth","occurrence contributing to cj. The larger pjk is, the more likely the kth","occurrence is selected.

Specifically, the sentence compression dataset (Clarke and Lapata, 2008) (referred as CL08) is used for subtree deletion model training (θarc).

There are 3, 178 out of 5, 739 such pairs. The concept model (θconcept) is learned from the TAC2009 dataset.

ROUGE has been widely used for summarization performance and can measure the informativeness of the summaries (content match between system and reference summaries).

Therefore we conduct human evaluation for the linguis-","1","we choose the GLPK as our ILP solver, which is used in (Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2011) tic quality for various systems. The linguistic quality consists of two parts. One evaluates the grammar quality within a sentence. Annotators marked if a compressed sentence is grammatically correct. Typical grammar errors include lack of verb or subordinate clause. The other evaluates the coherence between sentences, including the order of sentences and irrelevant sentences. For compressive summaries, we removed the sentences with grammar errors when evaluating coherence. The overall linguistic quality score is the combined score of the percentage of grammatically correct sentences and the correct ordering of the summary sentences. The score is scaled and ranges from 1 (bad) to 10 (good). 5.2 Results on the Development Set We conducted a series of experiments on the development dataset to investigate the effect of the non-negative score assumption, SBQP approximation, and initialization.

Almeida and Martins (2013) trained their model on extra corpora using multi-task learning, and achieved better results than ours. The results of our system and theirs showed that Lagrangian relaxation based method combined with combinatorial optimization algorithms such as dynamic programming or minimum cut can exploit the inner structure of problems and achieve significant speedup over ILP.","Four example summaries produced by our system are shown below. Words in gray are not selected in the summary. 1500 India’s space agency is ready to send a man to space within seven years if the government gives the nod, while preparations have lready begun for the launch of an unmanned lunar mission, a top official said. India will launch more missions to the moon if its maiden unmanned spacecraft Chandrayaan-1, slated to be launched by 2008, is successful a top space fficial said Tuesday. The United States, the European Space Agency, China, Japan and India are all planning lunar missions during the ext decade.India is “a step ahead” of China in satellite technology and can surpass Beijing in space research by tapping the talent of its huge pool of young scientists, India’s space research chief said Monday. The space agencies of India and France signed an agreement on Friday to cooperate in launching a satellite in four years that will help make climate predictions more accurate. The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) has short-listed experiments from five nation-s including the United States, Britain and Germany, for a slot on India’s unmanned moon mission Chandrayaan-1 to be undertaken by 2006-2007, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported Monday. A three-member Afghan delegation is in Bangalore seeking help to set up a high-tech telemedicine facility in 10 Afghan cities linked via Indian satellites, Indo-Asian News Service reported Saturday. A woman was killed in Mississippi when a tree crashed on her car, becoming the 11th fatality blamed on the powerful Hurricane Katrina that slammed the US Gulf coast after pounding Florida, local TV reported Monday. The bill for the Hurricane Katrina disaster effort has so far reached 2.87 billion dollars, federal officials said on Tuesday. The official death toll from Hurricane Katrina has risen to 118 people in and around the swamped city of New Orleans, officials said Thursday. The Foreign Ministry on Friday reported the first confirmed death of a Guatemalan due to Hurricane Katrina in the United States. The Ugandan government has pledged 200,000 US dollars toward relief and rebuilding efforts in the after-math of Hurricane Katrina, local press reported on Friday. Swiss Reinsurance Co., the world’s second largest reinsurance company on Monday doubled to 40 billion US dollars its initial estimate of the global insured losses caused by Hurricane Katrina in the United States. The A380 ’superjumbo’, which will be presented to the world in a lavish ceremony in southern France on Tuesday, will be profitable from 2008, its maker Airbus told the French financial newspaper La Tribune. The A380 will take over from the Boeing 747 as the biggest jet in the skies. An association of residents living near Paris’s Charles-de-Gaulle airport on Wednesday denounced the noise pollution generated by the giant Airbus A380, after the new airliner’s maiden flight. One problem that Airbus is encountering with its new A380 is that the craft pushes the envelope on the maximum size of a commercial airplane. With a whisper more than a roar, the largest passenger airliner ever built, the Airbus 380, took off on its maiden flight Wednesday. “When she came in, she was in good spirits,” a prison staffer told the New York Daily News. Martha Stewart, the American celebrity homemaker who had her own cooking and home improvement TV show, reported to a federal prison in Alderson, West Virginia, on Friday to serve a five-month sentence for lying about a stock sale. Home fashion guru Martha Stewart said on Friday that she has adjusted to prison life and is keeping busy behind bars since reporting a week ago to a federal penal camp in West Virginia, where she is serving a five-month sentence for lying about a stock sale. The lawyer said he did not know what she is writing, but Stewart has suggested since her conviction that she might write a book about her recent experience with the legal system. Walter Dellinger, the lawyer leading the appeal, said on NBC’s “Today” that Stewart is exploring “innovative ways to do microwave cooking” The lawyer said he did not know with her fellow inmates. As Martha Stewart arrives at the red-brick federal prison in Alderson, W. Va., on Friday to begin a five-month sentence, the company she founded is focused both on life without her and on life once she returns.","In most cases, the removed phrases do not hurt the readability of the summaries. The errors are mainly caused by the break of sub-clauses or main clauses that are separated by commas, for example, the fourth sentence in the last summary, The lawyer said he did not know what she is writing. The compressed sentence is grammatically correct, but semantically incomplete. Other errors are due to the lack of verb, subject, or object, or incorrect removal of PP, such as the last sentence of the last summary."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion","paragraphs":["In this paper, we propose a fast decoding algorithm for compressive summarization using graph cuts. Our idea is to approximate the original ILP problem using supermodular binary quadratic programming (SBQP) problem. Under the assumption that scores of concepts are non-negative, we eliminate subtree constraints and grammar constraints, and relax the length constraint and non-supermodular part of the problem step by step. Our experimental results showed that the graph cut based method achieved competitive performance compared to ILP, while about 100 times faster.","There are several possibilities for further research involving our graph cut algorithms. One idea is to apply it to the language model based compression method (Clarke and Lapata, 2008). The other is to adapt it to social media text summarization task, where text is much more noisy. As graph cut is a general method, applying it to other binary structured learning tasks is also an interesting direction."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["We’d like to thank three anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments.
