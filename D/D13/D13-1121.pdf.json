In Japanese, the relationship between a predicate and its argument is usually represented by using case particles1","(Kawahara and Kurohashi, 2006; Taira et al., 2008; Yoshikawa et al., 2011). However, since case particles vary depending on the voices, we have to take case alternation into account to represent predicate-argument structure. There are thus two major types of representations: one uses surface cases, and the other uses normalized-cases for the base form of predicates. For example, while the Kyoto University Text Corpus (Kawahara et al., 2004), one of the major Japanese corpora that contains annotations of predicate-argument structures, adopts","1","Japanese is a head-final language. Word order does not mark syntactic relations. Instead, postpositional case particles function as case markers. the former representation, the NAIST Text Corpora (Iida et al., 2007), another major Japanese corpus, adopts the latter representation.","Examples (1) and (2) describe the same event in the passive and active voices, respectively. When we use surface cases to represent the relationship between the predicate and its argument in Example (1), the case of “ (woman)” is ga2","and the case of “ (man)” is ni.2","On the other hand, when we use the normalized-cases for the base form, the case of “ (woman)” is wo2","and the case of “ (man)” is ga, which are the same as the surface cases in the active voice as in Example (2). (1)    woman-ga man-ni was pushed down (A woman was pushed down by a man.) (2)    man-ga woman-wo pushed down (A man pushed down a woman.)","Both representations have their own advantages. Surface case analysis is easier than normalized-case analysis, especially when we consider omitted arguments, which are also called zero anaphors (Nagao and Hasida, 1998). In Japanese, zero anaphora frequently occurs, and the omitted unnormalized-case of a zero anaphor is often the same as the surface case of its antecedent (Sasano and Kurohashi, 2011). Therefore, surface case analysis suits zero anaphora resolution. On the other hand, when 2","Ga, wo, and ni are typical Japanese postpositional case particles. In most cases, they indicate nominative, accusative, and dative, respectively. 1213 we focus on the resulting predicate argument structures, the normalized-case structure is more useful. Specifically, since a normalized-case structure represents the same meaning in the same representation, normalized-case analysis is useful for recognizing textual entailment and information retrieval.","Therefore, we need a system that first analyzes surface cases and then alternates the surface cases with normalized-cases. In particular, we focus on the transformation of the passive voice into the active voice in this paper. Passive-to-active voice transformation in English can be performed system-atically, which does not depend on lexical information in most cases. However, in Japanese, the method of transformation depends on lexical information. For example, while the case particle ni in Example (1) is alternated with ga in the active voice, the case particle ni in Example (3) is not alternated in the active voice as in Example (4) even though both their predicates are “ (be pushed down).” (3)    woman-ga sea-ni was pushed down (A woman was pushed down into the sea.) (4)    woman-wo sea-ni pushed down (φ pushed down a woman into the sea.)","The ni case in Example (1) indicates agent.On the other hand, the ni case in Example (3) indicates direction. To determine the difference is important for many NLP applications including machine translation. In fact, Google Translate (GT)3","translates Examples (1) and (3) as “Woman was pushed down in the man” and “Woman was pushed down in the sea,” respectively, which may be because GT cannot distinguish between the roles of ni in Examples (1) and (3). (5)    prize-ga man-ni was awarded (A prize was awarded to a man.) In example (5), although the ni-case argument “ (man)” is the same as in Example (1), the case particle ni indicates recipient and is not alternated in the active voice. These examples show that case 3","http://translate.google.com, accessed 2013-2-20. alternation between the passive and active voices in Japanese depends on not only predicates but also arguments, and we have to consider their combinations. Since it is impractical to manually describe the case alternation rules for all combinations of predicates and arguments, we have to acquire such knowledge automatically.","Thus, in this paper, we present a method for acquiring the knowledge for case alternation between the passive and active voices in Japanese. Our method leverages several linguistic constraints on alternation patterns and lexical case frames obtained from a large Web corpus, which are constructed for each meaning and voice of each predicate."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Levin (1993) grouped English verbs into classes on the basis of their shared meaning components and syntactic behavior, defined in terms of diathesis alternations. Hence, diathesis alternations have been the topic of interest for a number of researchers in the field of automatic verb classification, which aims to induce possible verb frames from corpora (e.g., McCarthy 2000; Lapata and Brew 2004; Joanis et al. 2008; Schulte im Walde et al. 2008; Li and Brew 2008; Sun and Korhonen 2009; Theijssen et al. 2012). Baroni and Lenci (2010) used distributional slot similarity to distinguish between verbs undergo-ing the causative-inchoative alternations, and verbs that do not alternate.","There is some work on passive-to-active voice transformation in Japanese. Baldwin and Tanaka (2000) empirically identified the range and frequency of basic verb alternation, including active-passive alternation, in Japanese. They automatically extracted alternation types by using hand-crafted case frames but did not evaluate the quality. Kondo et al. (2001) dealt with case alternation between the passive and active voices as a subtask of paraphras-ing a simple sentence. They manually introduced case alternation rules on the basis of verb types and case patterns and transformed passive sentences into active sentences.","Murata et al.

Each case frame describes surface cases that each predicate has and instances that can fill a case slot, which is fully lexicalized like the subcategorization lexicon VALEX (Korhonen et al., 2006).","We list some Japanese postpositional case particles with their typical grammatical functions in Table 1 and show examples of case frames in Table 2.4","Ideally, one case frame is constructed for each meaning and voice of the target predicate.

While Kawahara and Kurohashi’s method basically collects arguments of the target predicate, the phrase of no-case that modifies the direct object of the predicate is also collected as no-case.

For example, the verb in the base form “ (tsukiotosu, push down)” is transformed into the past passive form “ (tsukiotosa-reta, was pushed down).” Case alternations accompany passive-active transformation in Japanese. There are only two case alternations at most in passive-active transformation. One is the case represented as ga in the passive voice, and the other is the case represented as ga in the active voice.","Japanese passive sentences can be classified into three types in accordance with what is represented as ga-case in the passive voice: direct passive, indirect passive, and possessor passive.","In direct passive sentence, the object of the predicate in the active voice is represented as ga-case.

For example, the ga-case argument “ (woman)” in the passive sentence of Example (9) does not appear as an argument of the predicate “ (hit)” in the active sentence but appears in the phrase that modifies the direct object “ (head)” with the case particle no, which indicates that “ (woman)” is the possessor of “ (head).” (9) P: ......

We leverage lexical case frames obtained from a large Web corpus by using Kawahara and Kurohashi (2002)’s method and align cases of a case frame in the passive voice and cases of a case frame in the active voice. As described in Section 2, several case frames are constructed for each voice of each predicate. Our task consists of the following two subtasks:","1. Identify a corresponding case frame in the active voice.","2. Find an alignment between cases of case frames in the passive and active voice.","Figure 1 shows the overview of our task. If a case frame in the passive voice is input, we identify a corresponding case frame in the active voice, and find an alignment between cases by using the algorithm described in Section 5.3. In this example, an active case frame “-4 (push down-4)” is identified as a corresponding case frame for the input passive case frame “ -5 (be pushed down-5)” and ga, ni, and kara-cases in the passive case frame are aligned to wo, ga, and kara-cases in the active case frame, respectively. 5.2 Clues for Knowledge Acquisition We exploit three clues for corresponding case frame identification and case alignment as follows:","1.

Semantic similarity The instances of the aligned cases should be similar. For example, the instances of the ga-case of the case frame “ -5 (be pushed down-5)” and the wo-case of the case frame “ -4 (push down-4),” which are considered to be aligned and represent patient, are similar. Thus, we exploit semantic similarity simSEM between the instances of the corresponding cases.","We first define an asymmetric similarity measure between C1 and C2, each of which is a set of case slot instances, as follows:","sima(C1,C2)= 1","|C1| ∑","i1∈C1 max","i2∈C2(sim(i1,i2)), where sim(i1,i2) is the similarity between instances. In this study, we apply a distributional similarity measure (Lin, 1998), which was computed from the Web corpus used to construct the case frames. We next define a symmetric similarity measure between C1 and C2 as an average of sima(C1,C2) and sima(C2,C1).","sims(C1,C2)= 1 2 (sima(C1,C2)+sima(C2,C1)).","Then we define semantic similarity of a case alignment A between case frames CF1 and CF2.","simSEM (A)= 1 N N ∑ i=1 sims(C1,i,C2,a(i)), 1217 where N denotes the number of case slots of CF1, C1,i denotes a set of instances of the i-th case slot of CF1, and C2,a(i) denotes the set of the aligned case instances of CF2. A denotes the alignment {c1,1→ c2,a(1),c1,2→c2,a(2),...,c1,N →c2,a(N)} where cn,i denotes the case name that corresponds to Cn,i. Case distribution similarity Although arguments are often omitted in Japanese, arguments that are usually mentioned explicitly in the passive voice will be also explicitly mentioned in the active voice. Hence, the frequency distribution of cases can be a clue for case alignment. In this study, we exploit the following cosine similarity of frequency distribution as case distribution similarity: simDIST (A) = cos((|C1,1|,...,|C1,N |), (|C2,a(1)|,...,|C2,a(N)|)). As an example, consider the alignment between a passive case6","“-1 (be selected-1)” and the corresponding active case frame “-13 (select-13)” in Table 4. The alignment A1 = {ga → wo, ni→ ni, NIL → ga} is considered to be correct. However, if we consider only the semantic similarity, an alignment A2 = {ga → ni, ni → ga, wo → wo} is selected, because the alignment A2 has the highest semantic similarity. On the other hand, the case distribution similarity simDIST (A1) = cos((17722, 122273, 0), (33338, 800, 382)) ≈ 0.167 is much larger than simDIST (A2) = cos((17722, 122273, 96), (800, 382, 33338)) ≈ 0.016. Thus, the alignment A1 would be selected by considering the case distribution similarity. Preference of alternation patterns Some alternation patterns often appear, and others do not. For example, as Murata et al. (2006) reported, whereas 96.47% of ga-case is alternated with wo-case in passive-active transformation in Japanese,","6","This case frame should not have wo-case. However, since we constructed case frames automatically, some case frames have improper cases.

Therefore, when we can use development data, we exploit a weighting factor fPP(A) that is determined on the development data and takes into account the preference of alternation patterns. We define fPP(A) as follows: fPP(A)=w(ga→ cga to)×w(cto ga → ga), (i) where cga to is the case in the active voice to which ga-case in the passive voice is aligned, cto ga is the case in the passive voice which is aligned to ga-case in the active voice, and w(c1 → c2) denotes the weight of the case alternation “c1 → c2.” 5.3 Algorithm Algorithm 1 presents our algorithm for identifying a corresponding case frame and finding an alignment between cases in pseudo-code. Our algorithm first makes all possible combinations of a case frame in the active voice (cfactive), a case in the active voice to which ga-case in the passive voice is aligned (cga to), and a case in the passive voice which is aligned to ga-case in the active voice (cto ga) on the basis of the linguistic constraints, and then evaluates the score for the combinations {cfactive,cga to,cto ga} by the following equation:","score = simSEM (A)×simDIST (A)α ×fPP(A), (ii) where α is a parameter that controls the impact of the case distribution similarity.7","When we can use","7","Since fPP(A) is defined with a set of weights of case alternation patterns, fPP(A) contains these weights implicitly, and thus there is only a single explicit weight in equation (ii). 1218 Algorithm 1: Identifying a corresponding case frame and finding an alignment between cases.

Of course, these case frames contain improper ones, that is, several frames mix several meanings or usages of the predicates. Thus, it is difficult to evaluate the acquired knowledge itself. Instead, we evaluate the usefulness of the acquired knowledge on a case alternation task between the passive and active voices. 6.1 Setting and Algorithm for Case Alternation We basically used the same data as Murata et al. (2006). As mentioned in Section 2, they extracted 3,576 case particles in passive sentences from the Kyoto University Text Corpus, and tagged their cases in the active voice. Since they treated possessor passive as a kind of indirect passive, they did not adopt the case alternation between ga and no. In addition, their data included some annotation errors. We thus modified 21 annotations,8","five of which","8","The modified version of the data is publicly available at http://alaginrc.nict.go.jp/case/src/kaku1.1.tar.gz. were changed to the case alternation between ga and no. Note that there were some cases where multiple possible case particles were tagged to one instance. We adopted evaluation metrics called “Eval. B” by Murata et al., that is, we judged the output to be correct when the output was included in possible an-swers. We performed experiments on the following three types of data settings.","1. Experiments without either development or training data. 2. Experiments with development data. 3. Experiments with training data. Experiments without either development or training data In the first setting, we aligned the input passive case frame to one of the active case frames of the same predicate only by using simSEM and simDIST with the parameter α =1. Therefore, this setting is fully unsupervised. In this setting, the input surface cases are alternated as follows:","1. If a passive sentence is input, perform syntactic and surface case structure analysis by using Kawahara and Kurohashi (2006)’s model.9 Their model identified a proper case frame for each predicate, and assigned arguments in the input sentence to case slots of the case frame.","2. By using the acquired knowledge for case alternation, alternate input surface cases with cases in the active voice.","We call this model Model 1. For example, if Example (10) is input, the ga-case argument is assigned to the ga-case of the case frame “-5 (be pushed down-5).” Since this case is aligned to the wo-case of the case frame “-4 (push down-4)” as shown in Figure 1, this ga-case is alternated with wo-case.

In advance, we divided the tagged data into two parts just as Murata et al. (2006) did, both of which contained 1,788 case particles, and performed 2-fold cross-validation. We used one part for development and the other for test-ing, and vice versa.","We tuned w(ga → cga to), w(cto ga → ga) in Equation (i), and α in Equation (ii) by a simple hill-climbing strategy. Since the candidate cases for cga to are ni, niyotte, kara, de, and NIL, and the candidate cases for cto ga are wo, ni, no, and NIL, we defined parameter vector x as follows: x =(w(ga→ ni),w(ga→ niyotte),w(ga→ kara), w(ga→ de),w(ga→ NIL),w(wo→ ga), w(ni → ga),w(wo→ no),w(NIL → ga),α).","Algorithm 2 shows the hill-climbing algorithm for tuning the parameter vector x, where faccuracy(x) is a function that returns the case alternation accuracy on the development data with parameter x.

After acquiring knowledge for case alternation with the tuned parameter, we applied the same method for case alternation as the first setting. We call this model Model 2.

Baseline is a system that outputs the most frequently alternated cases in the development data, which was also used by Murata et al. (2006). The baseline score was higher than that reported by Murata et al. because we modified 21 annotations. We also performed experiments without using case distribution similarity or semantic similarity. We call these models in the first setting Model 1S and Model 1D, and these models in the second setting Model 2S and Model 2D, respectively.","Although Models 1S,1D, and 1 were fully unsupervised models, Models 1S and 1 significantly10 outperformed the baseline model (p-values of McNemar (1947)’s test were smaller than 0.00001). On the other hand, the difference between Models 1S 10 In this paper, we call a difference significant if the p-value","of McNemar (1947)’s test is less than 0.01. 1220 Model Accuracy (Murata et al., 2006) 0.944 (3,376/3,576) Model 3 0.956 (3,417/3,576) Table 6: Comparison between Murata et al. (2006)’s method and our method with training data. and 1 is not statistically significant, and thus the effect of the case distribution similarity was not confirmed by these experiments.","Models 2S,2D, and 2 were models with parameter tuning. Parameter tuning significantly improved the performance. In addition, the difference between Models 2S and 2 and the difference between Models 2D and 2 were both significant (p-values of McNemar’s test were 0.00032 and 0.00039, respectively), and thus we confirmed the usefulness of the two similarity measures. The parameter α that controls the impact of the case distribution similarity was tuned to 0.3, which means semantic similarity between the instances of the aligned cases is more important than case distribution similarity for this task.","Table 6 compares Murata et al.’s method and our method with training data. We used Murata et al.’s method without feature selection because it achieved the highest performance on this setting. Their method’s score was higher than that they reported, again due to the corpus modification. The difference between their method and our method was significant (p-value of McNemar’s test was 0.00011), and we confirmed the usefulness of the acquired knowledge for case alternation.","Table 7 shows an example of case alternation between the passive and active voices. When the passive sentence was input, the argument “  ......(Mr. Matsuki-ga......)” was first assigned to ga-case of the case frame “-2 (be hit-2).” Since this case was aligned to no-case of the case frame “ -2 (hit-2),” the input ga-case was alternated with no-case. On the other hand, the cases of the other arguments “ (bat-de)” and “ (head-wo)” were output as they were in the passive sentence.","We now list three error causes observed in our experiments of the case alternation task: 1) The passive voice in Japanese is expressed by using the auxiliary verbs “ (reru)” and “ (rareru).” However, these auxiliary verbs can rep-Input Text: ···  .....   ··· Mr. Matsuki-ga","..... metal bat-de head-wo was hit","(...Mr. Matsuki was hit on the head with a metal bat ...)","Identified passive case frame:","Case Frame: “-2 (be hit-2)” { (someone):2, (member):1, ···}-niyotte { (woman):5, (girl)):4, ···}-ga","..... { (head):3944, (face):1186, ···}-wo { (blunt weapon):84, (bat):45, ···}-de","···","Corresponding active case frame and case alignment:","Case alignment: {niyotte→ ga, ga → no, wo→ wo, de→ de}","Case Frame: “-2 (hit-2)” { (man):51, (fist):30, (someone):23, ···}-ga { (myself):360, (I):223, ···}-no..... { (head):5424, (face):3215, ···}-wo { (fist):316, (palm):157, (fist):43, ···}-de","··· Table 7: An example of case alternation. The input ga-case was alternated with no-case. resent several other meanings, such as honorific and possibility. Since Kawahara and Kurohashi (2002)’s method does not distinguish between these meanings, our case frames sometimes contain improper cases such as wo-case in case frame “ -1 (be selected-1)” in Table 4. 2) In some passive sentences, there are two surface ni-cases as in Example (11). However, our method does not assume such sentences, and thus cannot deal with them properly. (11)     man-ni office-ni was sent (φ was sent to the office by a man.) 3) Agent of a predicate can be represented by using several types of case particles in the passive voice. For example, “ (company)” in Example (12) is the agent of “ (employed),” which can be represented by either of ni, niyotte, and kara in the passive voice. Since Kawahara and Kurohashi (2002)’s method can not recognize the exchangeablity of case particles, some case frames contain several cases of the same semantic role. However, since our method enforces a one-to-one alignments, only one of these cases is properly aligned to the corresponding case in the active voice. 1221 (12)     company-ga man-wo employed (The company employed a man.) 6.3 Application to Alternation between the Causative and Active Voices To confirm the applicability of our framework to other types of alternation than the active-passive alternation, we applied our framework to case alternation between the causative and active voices. The causative voice in Japanese is a grammatical voice and is expressed by using the auxiliary verbs “ (seru)” and “ (saseru).” We basically used the same algorithm as Algorithm 1 for acquiring the knowledge for case alternation, but used different constraints on case alternation patterns because possible case alternation patterns are different from those of active-passive alternation. Specifically, we replaced the third and fourth lines of Algorithm 1 with “for each cto ga ∈{NIL, ni}” and “for each cga to ∈{wo, ni},” respectively, based on linguistic analysis of active-causative alternation in Japanese.","We used a part of the data created by Murata and Isahara (2003) to evaluate the usefulness of the acquired knowledge. Their data consists of 4,671 case particles in passive or causative sentences from the Kyoto University Text Corpus with their cases in the active voice. We first extracted 524 case particles that were extracted from causative sentences. Since the annotation quality was not very high, we manually checked all tags and modified inappropriate ones. We then performed 2-fold cross validation experiments. Table 8 shows experimental results. Baseline is a system that outputs the most frequently alternated cases in the training data.

The other types of knowledge are automatically acquired from a large raw corpus. Thus, although this paper focused on the active-passive alternation in Japanese, our framework is applicable to the other types of case alternation and to other languages, especially similar languages such as Korean. We plan to apply our framework to other types of case alternation such as case alternation between intransitive and transitive verbs."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 23800025 and 25730131."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Timothy Baldwin and Hozumi Tanaka. 2000.
