In recent years, statistical models have been used for the task. However, such models without any domain knowledge often produce aspects that are not interpretable in applications. To tackle the issue, some knowledge-based topic models have been proposed, which allow the user to input some prior domain knowledge to generate coherent aspects. However, existing knowledge-based topic models have several major shortcomings, e.g., little work has been done to incorporate the cannot-link type of knowledge or to automatically adjust the number of topics based on domain knowledge. This paper proposes a more advanced topic model, called MC-LDA (LDA with m-set and c-set), to address these problems, which is based on an Extended generalized Pólya urn (E-GPU) model (which is also proposed in this paper). Experiments on real-life product reviews from a variety of domains show that MC-LDA outperforms the existing state-of-the-art models markedly."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["In sentiment analysis and opinion mining, aspect extraction aims to extract entity aspects or features on which opinions have been expressed (Hu and Liu, 2004; Liu, 2012). For example, in a sentence “The picture looks great,” the aspect is “picture.” Aspect extraction consists of two sub-tasks: (1) extracting all aspect terms (e.g., “picture”) from the corpus, and (2) clustering aspect terms with similar meanings (e.g., cluster “picture” and “photo” into one aspect category as they mean the same in the domain “Camera”). In this work, we adopt the topic modeling approach as it can perform both sub-tasks simultaneously (see § 2).","Topic models, such as LDA (Blei et al., 2003), provide an unsupervised framework for extracting latent topics in text documents. Topics are aspect categories (or simply aspects) in our context. However, in recent years, researchers have found that fully unsupervised topic models may not produce topics that are very coherent for a particular application. This is because the objective functions of topic models do not always correlate well with human judgments and needs (Chang et al., 2009).","To address the issue, several knowledge-based topic models have been proposed. The DF-LDA model (Andrzejewski et al., 2009) incorporates two forms of prior knowledge, also called two types of constraints: must-links and cannot-links. A must-link states that two words (or terms) should belong to the same topic whereas a cannot-link indicates that two words should not be in the same topic. In (Andrzejewski et al., 2011), more general knowledge can be specified using first-order logic. In (Burns et al., 2012; Jagarlamudi et al., 2012; Lu et al., 2011; Mukherjee and Liu, 2012), seeded models were proposed. They enable the user to specify prior knowledge as seed words/terms for some topics. Petterson et al. (2010) also used word similarity as priors for guidance.","However, none of the existing models is capable of incorporating the cannot-link type of knowledge except DF-LDA (Andrzejewski et al., 2009). Furthermore, none of the existing models, including DF-LDA, is able to automatically adjust the number of topics based on domain knowledge. The domain knowledge, such as cannot-links, may change the number of topics. There are two types of cannot-links: consistent and inconsistent with the domain corpus. For example, in the reviews of 1655","domain “Computer”, a topic model may generate","two topics Battery and Screen that represent two","different aspects. A cannot-link {battery, screen}","as the domain knowledge is thus consistent with","the corpus. However, words Amazon and Price","may appear in the same topic due to their high co-","occurrences in the Amazon.com review corpus. To","separate them, a cannot-link {amazon, price} can","be added as the domain knowledge, which is in-","consistent with the corpus as these two words have","high co-occurrences in the corpus. In this case, the","number of topics needs to be increased by 1 since","the mixed topic has to be separated into two indi-","vidual topics Amazon and Price. Apart from the","above shortcoming, earlier knowledge-based topic","models also have some major shortcomings: Incapability of handling multiple senses: A","word typically has multiple meanings or senses.","For example, light can mean “of little weight” or","“something that makes things visible.” DF-LDA","cannot handle multiple senses because its defini-","tion of must-link is transitive. That is, if A and B","form a must-link, and B and C form a must-link, it","implies a must-link between A and C, indicating A,","B, and C should be in the same topic. This case","also applies to the models in (Andrzejewski et al.,","2011), (Petterson et al., 2010), and (Mukherjee and","Liu, 2012). Although the model in (Jagarlamudi et","al., 2012) allows multiple senses, it requires that","each topic has at most one set of seed words (seed","set), which is restrictive as the amount of","knowledge should not be limited. Sensitivity to the adverse effect of knowledge:","When using must-links or seeds, existing models","basically try to ensure that the words in a must-","link or a seed set have similar probabilities under a","topic. This causes a problem: if a must-link com-","prises of a frequent word and an infrequent word,","due to the redistribution of probability mass, the","probability of the frequent word will decrease","while the probability of the infrequent word will","increase. This can harm the final topics because","the attenuation of the frequent (often domain im-","portant) words can result in some irrelevant words","being ranked higher (with higher probabilities). To address the above shortcomings, we define","m-set (for must-set) as a set of words that should","belong to the same topic and c-set (cannot-set) as a","set of words that should not be in the same topic.","They are similar to must-link and cannot-link but","m-sets do not enforce transitivity. Transitivity is the main cause of the inability to handle multiple","senses. Our m-sets and c-sets are also more con-","cise providing knowledge in the context of a set.","As in (Andrzejewski et al., 2009), we assume that","there is no conflict between m-sets and c-sets, i.e.,","if w1 is a cannot-word of w2 (i.e., shares a c-set","with w2), any word that shares an m-set with w1 is","also a cannot-word of w2. Note that knowledge as","m-sets has also been used in (Chen et al., 2013a)","and (Chen et al., 2013b).","We then propose a new topic model, called MC-","LDA (LDA with m-set and c-set), which is not on-","ly able to deal with c-sets and automatically adjust","the number of topics, but also deal with the multi-","ple senses and adverse effect of knowledge prob-","lems at the same time. For the issue of multiple","senses, a new latent variable s is added to LDA to","distinguish multiple senses (§ 3). Then, we employ","the generalized Pólya urn (GPU) model","(Mahmoud, 2008) to address the issue of adverse","effect of knowledge (§ 4). Deviating from the","standard topic modeling approaches, we propose","the Extended generalized Pólya urn (E-GPU)","model (§ 5). E-GPU extends the GPU model to","enable multi-urn interactions. This is necessary for","handling c-sets and for adjusting the number of","topics. E-GPU is the heart of MC-LDA. Due to the","extension, a new inference mechanism is designed","for MC-LDA (§ 6). Note that E-GPU is generic","and can be used in any appropriate application.","In summary, this paper makes the following","three contributions:","1. It proposed a new knowledge-based topic mod-","el called MC-LDA, which is able to use both","m-sets and c-sets, as well as automatically ad-","just the number of topics based on domain","knowledge.

According to (Liu, 2012), there are three main approaches to aspect extraction: 1) Using word frequency and syntactic dependency of aspects and sentiment words for extraction (e.g., Blairgoldensohn et al., 2008; Hu and Liu, 2004; Ku et al., 2006; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Qiu et al., 2011; Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009; Wu et al., 2009; Yu et al., 2011; Zhang and Liu, 2011; Zhuang et al., 2006); 2) Using supervised sequence labeling/classification (e.g., Choi and Cardie, 2010; Jakob and Gurevych, 2010; Kobayashi et al., 2007; Li et al., 2010); 3) Topic models (Branavan et al., 2008; Brody and Elhadad, 2010; Fang and Huang, 2012; Jo and Oh, 2011; Kim et al., 2013; Lazaridou et al., 2013; Li et al., 2011; Lin and He, 2009; Lu et al., 2009, 2012, 2011; Lu and Zhai, 2008; Mei et al., 2007; Moghaddam and Ester, 2011; Mukherjee and Liu, 2012; Sauper et al., 2011; Titov and McDonald, 2008; Wang et al., 2010, 2011; Zhao et al., 2010). Other approaches include shallow semantic parsing (Li et al., 2012b), bootstrapping (Xia et al., 2009), Non-English techniques (Abu-Jbara et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2012), graph-based representa-tion (Wu et al., 2011), convolution kernels (Wiegand and Klakow, 2010) and domain adap-tion (Li et al., 2012). Stoyanov and Cardie (2011), Wang and Liu (2011), and Meng et al. (2012) studied opinion summarization outside the reviews. Some other works related with sentiment analysis include (Agarwal and Sabharwal, 2012; Kennedy and Inkpen, 2006; Kim et al., 2009; Mohammad et al., 2009).","In this work, we focus on topic models owing to their advantage of performing both aspect extraction and clustering simultaneously. All other approaches only perform extraction. Although there are several related works on clustering aspect terms (e.g., Carenini et al., 2005; Guo et al., 2009; Zhai et al., 2011), they all assume that the aspect terms have been extracted beforehand. We also notice that some aspect extraction models in sentiment analysis separately discover aspect words and aspect specific sentiment words (e.g., Sauper and Barzilay, 2013; Zhao et al., 2010). Our proposed model does not separate them as most sentiment words also imply aspects and most adjectives modify specific attributes of objects. For example, sentiment words expensive and beautiful imply aspects price and appearance respectively.","Regarding the knowledge-based models, be-sides those discussed in § 1, the model (Hu et al., 2011) enables the user to provide guidance interactively. Blei and McAuliffe (2007) and Ramage et al. (2009) used document labels in supervised set-ting. In (Chen et al., 2013a), we proposed MDK-LDA to leverage multi-domain knowledge, which serves as the basic mechanism to exploit m-sets in MC-LDA. In (Chen et al., 2013b), we proposed a framework (called GK-LDA) to explicitly deal with the wrong knowledge when exploring the lexical semantic relations as the general (domain independent) knowledge in topic models. But these models above did not consider the knowledge in the form of c-sets (or cannot-links).","The generalized Pólya urn (GPU) model (Mahmoud, 2008) was first introduced in LDA by Mimno et al. (2011). However, Mimno et al. (2011) did not use domain knowledge. Our results in § 7 show that using domain knowledge can significantly improve aspect extraction. The GPU model was also employed in topic models in our work of (Chen et al., 2013a, 2013b). In this paper, we propose the Extended GPU (E-GPU) model. The E-GPU model is more powerful in handling complex situations in dealing with c-sets."]},{"title":"3 Dealing with M-sets and Multiple Senses","paragraphs":["Since the proposed MC-LDA model is a major extension to our earlier work in (Chen et al., 2013a), which can deal with m-sets, we include this earlier work here as the background.","To incorporate m-sets and deal with multiple senses of a word, the MDK-LDA(b) model was proposed in (Chen et al., 2013a), which adds a new latent variable s into LDA. The rationale here is that this new latent variable s guides the model to choose the right sense represented by an m-set.

At discrete time intervals, balls are added or removed from the urn according to their color distributions.","In the simple Pólya urn (SPU) model, a ball is first drawn randomly from the urn and its color is recorded, then that ball is put back along with a new ball of the same color. This selection process is repeated and the contents of the urn change over time, with a self-reinforcing property sometimes expressed as “the rich get richer.” SPU is actually exhibited in the Gibbs sampling for LDA.","The generalized Pólya urn (GPU) model differs from the SPU model in the replacement scheme during sampling. Specifically, when a ball is randomly drawn, certain numbers of additional balls of each color are returned to the urn, rather than just two balls of the same color as in SPU. 4.2 Promoting M-sets using GPU To deal with the issue of sensitivity to the adverse effect of knowledge, MDK-LDA(b) is extended to MDK-LDA which employs the generalized Pólya urn (GPU) sampling scheme.","As discussed in § 1, due to the problem of the adverse effect of knowledge, important words may suffer from the presence of rare words in the same m-set. This problem can be dealt with the very sampling scheme of the GPU model (Chen et al., 2013a). Specifically, by adding additional As,w′",",w balls of color s into UtS","while keeping the drawn ball, we increase the proportion (probability) of seeing the m-set s under topic t and thus promote m-set s as a whole.

Instead of involving only one urn as in SPU and GPU, E-GPU model considers a set of urns in the sampling process. The E-GPU model allows a ball to be transferred from one urn to another, enabling multi-urn interactions. Thus, during sampling, the populations of several urns will evolve even if only one ball is drawn from one urn. This capability makes the E-GPU model more powerful as it models relationships among multiple urns.","We define three sets of urns which will be used in the new sampling scheme in the proposed MC-LDA model. The first set of urns is the topic urns Um∈{1...M}T",", where each topic urn contains T colors (topics) and each ball inside has a color t ∈ {1 ... T}. It corresponds to the document-topic distribution θ in Table 1. The second set of urns (m-set urn Ut∈ {1...T}S",") corresponds to the topic-m-set distribution φ , with balls of colors (m-sets) s ∈ {1 ... S} in each m-set urn. The third set of urns is the word urns Ut,sW",",where t ∈ {1 ... T} and s ∈ {1 ... S}. Each ball inside a word urn has a color (word) w ∈ {1 ... V}. The distribution η can be reflected in this set of urns. 5.2 Handling C-sets using E-GPU As MDK-LDA can only use m-sets but not c-sets, we now extend MDK-LDA to the MC-LDA model in order to exploit c-sets. As pointed out in § 1, c-sets may be inconsistent with the corpus domain, which makes them considerably harder to deal with. To tackle the issue, we utilize the proposed E-GPU model and incorporate c-sets handling inside the E-GPU sampling scheme, which is also designed to enable automated adjustment of the number of topics based on domain knowledge.","Based on the definition of c-set, each pair of words in a c-set cannot both have large probabilities under the same topic. As the E-GPU model allows multi-urn interactions, when sampling a ball represents word w from a word urn Ut,sW",", we want to transfer the balls representing cannot-words of w (sharing a c-set with w) to other urns (see Step 3 a below). That is, decrease the probabilities of those cannot-words under this topic while increasing their corresponding probabilities under some other topics. In order to correctly transfer a ball that represents word w, it should be transferred to an urn which has a higher proportion of w and its related words (i.e., words sharing m-sets with w). That is, we randomly sample an urn that has a higher proportion of any m-set of w to transfer w to (Step 3 b below). However, the situation becomes more involved when a c-set is not consistent with the corpus. For example, aspects price and amazon may be mixed under one topic (say t) in LDA. The user may want to separate them by providing a c-set {price, amazon}. In this case, according to LDA, word price has no topic with a higher proportion of it (and its related words) than topic t. To transfer it, we need to increment the number of topics by 1 and then transfer the word to this new topic urn (step 3 c below). Based on these ideas, we propose the E-GPU sampling scheme for the MC-LDA model below: 1.

We have made the datasets publically available at the website of the first author. Pre-processing: We ran the Stanford Core NLP Tools1","to perform sentence detection and lemmatization. Punctuations, stopwords 2",", numbers and words appearing less than 5 times in each corpus were removed. The domain name was also removed, e.g., word camera in the domain “Camera”, since it co-occurs with most words in the corpus, leading to high similarity among topics/aspects. Sentences as documents: As noted in (Titov and McDonald, 2008), when standard topic models are applied to reviews as documents, they tend to produce topics that correspond to global properties of products (e.g., brand name), which make topics overlapping with each other. The reason is that all reviews of the same type of products discuss about the same aspects of these products. Only the brand names and product names are different. Thus, using individual reviews for modeling is not very effective. Although there are approaches which model sentences (Jo and Oh, 2011; Titov and McDonald, 2008), we take the approach of (Brody and Elhadad, 2010), dividing each review into sentences and treating each sentence as an independent document. Sentences can be used by all three baselines without any change to their models. Although the relationships between sentences are lost, the data is fair to all models. Parameter settings: For all models, posterior inference was drawn using 1000 Gibbs iterations with an initial burn-in of 100 iterations. For all models, we set α = 1 and β = 0.1. We found that small changes of α and β did not affect the results much, which was also reported in (Jo and Oh, 2011) who also used online reviews. For the number of topics T, we tried different values (see §7.2) as it is hard to know the exact number of topics. While non-parametric Bayesian approaches (Teh et al., 2006) aim to estimate T from the corpus, they are often sensitive to the hyper-parameters (Heinrich, 2009). 1 http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/corenlp.shtml 2 http://jmlr.org/papers/volume5/lewis04a/a11-smart-stop-list Domain #Reviews #Sentences #M-sets #C-sets Camera 500 5171 173 18 Food 500 2416 85 10 Computer 500 2864 92 6 Care 500 3008 119 13 Average 500 3116 103 9 Table 2. Corpus statistics with #m-sets and #c-sets having at least two words.    1661","For DF-LDA, we followed (Andrzejewski et al., 2009) to generate must-links and cannot-links from our domain knowledge. We then ran DF-LDA3","while keeping its parameters as proposed in (Andrzejewski et al., 2009) (we also experimented with different parameter settings but they did not produce better results). For our proposed model, we estimated the thresholds using cross validation in our pilot experiments. Estimated value σ = 0.2 in equation 3 yielded good results. The second stage (steps 2 and 3) of the Gibbs sampler for MC-LDA (for dealing with c-sets) is applied after burn-in phrase. Domain knowledge: User knowledge about a domain can vary a great deal. Different users may have very different knowledge. To reduce this variance for a more reliable evaluation, instead of asking a human user to provide m-sets, we obtain the synonym sets and the antonym sets of each word that is a noun or adjective (as words of other parts-of-speech usually do not indicate aspects) from WordNet (Miller, 1995) and manually verify the words in those sets for the domain. Note that if a word w is not provided with any m-set, it is treated as a singleton m-set {w}. For c-sets, we ran LDA in each domain and provide c-sets based on the wrong results of LDA as in (Andrzejewski et al., 2009). Then, the knowledge is provided to each model in the format required by each model. The numbers of m-sets and c-sets are listed in columns 4 and 5 of Table 2. Duplicate sets have been removed. 7.2 Objective Evaluation In this section, we evaluate our proposed MC-3 http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~andrzeje/research/df_lda.html LDA model objectively. Topic models are often evaluated using perplexity on held-out test data. However, the perplexity metric does not reflect the semantic coherence of individual topics learned by a topic model (Newman et al., 2010). Recent research has shown potential issues with perplexity as a measure: (Chang et al., 2009) suggested that the perplexity can sometimes be contrary to human judgments. Also, perplexity does not really reflect our goal of finding coherent aspects with accurate semantic clustering. It only provides a measure of how well the model fits the data.","The Topic Coherence metric (Mimno et al., 2011) (also called the “UMass” measure (Stevens and Buttler, 2012)) was proposed as a better alternative for assessing topic quality. This metric relies upon word co-occurrence statistics within the documents, and does not depend on external resources or human labeling. It was shown that topic coherence is highly consistent with human expert labeling by Mimno et al. (2011). Higher topic coherence score indicates higher quality of topics, i.e., better topic interpretability. Effects of Number of Topics Since our proposed models and the baseline models are all parametric models, we first compare each model given different numbers of topics. Figure 4 shows the average Topic Coherence score of each model given different numbers of topics. From Figure 4, we note the following: 1. MC-LDA consistently achieves the highest To-","pic Coherence scores given different numbers","of topics. M-LDA also works better than the","other baseline models, but not as well as MC-","LDA. This shows that both m-sets and c-sets","are beneficial in producing coherent aspects. 2. DF-LDA variants, DF-M and DF-MC, do not","perform well due to the shortcomings discussed  Figure 4. Avg. Topic Coherence score of each model across different number of topics.  Figure 5. Avg. Topic Coherence score for different proportions of knowledge. -1600 -1500 -1400 -1300 -1200 3 6 9 12 15 MC-LDA M-LDA LDA DF-M DF-MC LDA-GPU -1320 -1300 -1280 -1260 -1240 0% 25% 50% 100% MC-LDA M-LDA DF-M DF-MC    1662","in § 1. It is slightly better than LDA when T =","15, but worse than LDA in other cases. We will","further analyze the effects of knowledge on","MC-LDA and DF-LDA shortly. 3. LDA-GPU does not perform well due to its use","of co-document frequency. As frequent words","usually have high co-document frequency with","many other words, the frequent words are","ranked top in many topics. This shows that the","guidance using domain knowledge is more ef-","fective than using co-document frequency. In terms of improvements, MC-LDA outperforms M-LDA significantly ( p < 0.03 ) and all other baseline models significantly (p < 0.01) based on a paired t-test. It is important to note that by no means do we say that LDA-GPU and DF-LDA are not effective. We only say that for the task of aspect extraction and leveraging domain knowledge, these models do not generate as coherent aspects as ours because of their shortcomings discussed in § 1. In general, with more topics, the Topic Coherence scores increase. We found that when T is larger than 15, aspects found by each model be-came more and more overlapping, with several aspects expressing the same features of products. So we fix T = 15 in the subsequent experiments. Effects of Knowledge To further analyze the effects of knowledge on models, in each domain, we randomly sampled different proportions of knowledge (i.e., different numbers of m-sets/must-links and c-sets/cannot-links) as shown in Figure 5, where 0% means no knowledge (same as LDA and LDA-GPU, which do not incorporate knowledge) and 100% means all knowledge. From Figure 5, we see that MC-LDA and M-LDA both perform consistently better than DF-MC and DF-M across different proportions of knowledge. With the increasing number of knowledge sets, MC-LDA and M-LDA achieve higher Topic Coherence scores (i.e., produce more coherent aspects). In general, MC-LDA performs the best. For both DF-MC and DF-M, the Topic Coherence score increases from 0% to 25% knowledge, but decreases with more knowledge (50% and 100%). This shows that with limited amount of knowledge, the shortcomings of DF-LDA are not very obvious, but with more knowledge, these issues become more serious and thus degrade the performance of DF-LDA. 7.3 Human Evaluation Since our aim is to make topics more interpretable and conformable to human judgments, we worked with two judges who are familiar with Amazon products and reviews to evaluate the models subjectively. Since topics from topic models are rankings based on word probability and we do not know the number of correct topical words, a natural way to evaluate these rankings is to use Precision@n (or p@n) which was also used in (Mukherjee and Liu, 2012; Zhao et al., 2010), where n is the rank position. We give p@n for n = 5 and 10. There are two steps in human evaluation: topic labeling and word labeling. Topic Labeling: We followed the instructions in (Mimno et al., 2011) and asked the judges to label each topic as good or bad. Each topic was presented as a list of 10 most probable words in descend-ing order of their probabilities under that topic. The models which generated the topics for labeling were obscure to the judges. In general, each topic was annotated as good if it had more than half of its words coherently related to each other representing a semantic concept together; otherwise bad. Agreement of human judges on topic  Figure 6. Avg. p@5 of good topics for each model across different domains. The models of each bar from left to rights are MC-LDA, M-LDA, LDA, DF-M, DF-MC, LDA-GPU. (Same for Figure 7)  Figure 7. Avg. p@10 of good topics for each model across different domains. 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 Camera Food Computer Care MC-LDA M-LDA LDA DF-M DF-MC LDA-GPU 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 Camera Food Computer Care MC-LDA M-LDA LDA DF-M DF-MC LDA-GPU 1663 labeling using Cohen’s Kappa yielded a score of 0.92 indicating almost perfect agreements according to the scale in (Landis and Koch, 1977). This is reasonable as topic labeling is an easy task and semantic coherence can be judged well by humans. Word Labeling: After topic labeling, we chose the topics, which were labeled as good by both judges, as good topics. Then, we asked the two judges to label each word of the top 10 words in these good topics. Each word was annotated as correct if it was coherently related to the concept represented by the topic; otherwise incorrect. Since judges already had the conception of each topic in mind when they were labeling topics, labeling each word was not difficult which explains the high Kappa score for this labeling task (score = 0.892). Quantitative Results Figures 6 and 7 give the average p@5 and p@10 of all good topics over all four domains. The numbers of good topics generated by each model are shown in Table 3. We can see that the human evaluation results are highly consistent with Topic Coherence results in §7.2. MC-LDA improves over M-LDA significantly ( p < 0.01 ) and both MC-LDA and M-LDA outperforms the other baseline models significantly ( p < 0.005 ) using a paired t-test. We also found that when the domain knowledge is simple with one word usually expressing only one meaning/sense (e.g., in the domain “Computer”), DF-LDA performs better than LDA. In other domains, it performs similarly or worse than LDA. Again, it shows that DF-LDA is not effective to handle complex knowledge, which is consistent with the results of effects of knowledge on DF-LDA in §7.2. Qualitative Results We now show some qualitative results to give an intuitive feeling of the outputs from different models. There are a large number of aspects that are dramatically improved by MC-LDA. Due to space constraints, we only show some examples. To further focus, we just show some results of MC-LDA, M-LDA and LDA. The results from LDA-GPU and DF-LDA were inferior and hard for the human judges to match them with aspects found by the other models for qualitative comparison.","Table 4 shows three aspects Amazon, Price, Battery generated by each model in the domain “Camera”. Both LDA and M-LDA can only discover two aspects but M-LDA has a higher average precision. Given the c-set {amazon, price, battery}, MC-LDA can discover all three aspects with the highest average precision."]},{"title":"8 Conclusion","paragraphs":["This paper proposed a new model to exploit domain knowledge in the form of m-sets and c-sets to generate coherent aspects (topics) from online reviews. The paper first identified and characterized some shortcomings of the existing knowledge-based models. A new model called MC-LDA was then proposed, whose sampling scheme was based on the proposed Extended GPU (E-GPU) model enabling multi-urn interactions. A comprehensive evaluation using real-life online reviews from multiple domains shows that MC-LDA outperforms the state-of-the-art models significantly and discovers aspects with high semantic coherence. In our future work, we plan to incorporate aspect specific sentiments in the MC-LDA model."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This work was supported in part by a grant from National Science Foundation (NSF) under grant no.
