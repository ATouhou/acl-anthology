Since normally anyone can create and edit pages, some articles are written in a promotional tone, violating Wikipedia’s policy requiring a neutral viewpoint. Currently, such articles are identified manually and tagged with an appropriate Cleanup message1","by Wikipedia editors. Given the scale and rate of growth of Wikipedia, it is infeasible to manually identify all such articles. Hence, we present an approach to automatically detect promotional articles.","Related work in quality flaw detection in Wikipedia (Anderka et al., 2012) has relied on meta-features based on edit history, Wikipedia links, structural features and counts of words, sentences and paragraphs. However, we hypothesize that there are subtle differences in the linguistic style that distinguish promotional tone, which we attempt to capture using stylometric features, particularly deeper syntactic features. We model the style of promotional and normal articles using language models","1","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia: Template_messages/Cleanup based on both n-grams and Probabilistic Context Free Grammars (PCFGs). We show that using such stylometric features improves over using only shallow lexical and meta-features."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Anderka et al. (2012) developed a general model for detecting ten of Wikipedia’s most frequent quality flaws. One of these flaw types, “Advert” 2",", refers to articles written like advertisements. Their classifiers were trained using a set of lexical, structural, net-work and edit-history related features of Wikipedia articles. However, they used no features capturing syntactic structure, at a level deeper than Part-Of-Speech (POS) tags.","A related area is that of vandalism detection in Wikipedia. Several systems have been developed to detect vandalizing edits in Wikipedia. These fall into two major categories: those analyzing author information and edit metadata (Wilkinson and Huberman, 2007; Stein and Hess, 2007); and those using NLP techniques such as n-gram language models and PCFGs (Wang and McKeown, 2010; Harpalani et al., 2011). We combine relevant features from both these categories to train a classifier that distinguishes promotional content from normal Wikipedia articles."]},{"title":"3 Dataset Collection","paragraphs":["We extracted a set of about 13,000 articles from English Wikipedia’s category, “Category:All arti-2 “Advert” is the flaw-type of majority of the articles in the","Category ‘Articles with a promotional tone’. 1851 Content Features Number of characters Number of words Number of sentences Average Word Length Average, Minimum, Maximum Sentence Lengths, Ratio of Maximum to minimum sentence lengths Ratio of long sentences (>48 words) to Short Sentences (<33 words) Percentage of Sentences in the passive voice Relative Frequencies of POS tags for pronouns, conjunctions, prepositions, auxiliary verbs, modal verbs, adjectives and adverbs Percentage of sentences beginning with a pronoun, article, conjunction, preposition, adjective, adverb Percentage of special phrases3","such as peacock terms (‘legendary’, ‘acclaimed’, ‘world-class’), weasel terms (‘many scholars state’, ‘it is be-lieved/regarded’, ‘many are of the opinion’, ‘most feel’, ‘experts declare’, ‘it is often reported’) , editorializing terms (‘without a doubt’, ‘of course’, ‘essentially’) Percentage of easy words, difficult words (Dale-Chall List), long words and stop words Overall Sentiment Score based on SentiWordNet4 Table 1: Content Features of a Wikipedia Article cles with a promotional tone” as a set of positive examples. We extracted a set of 26,000 untagged articles to form a noisy set of negative examples, which may contain some promotional articles that have not yet been tagged by Wikipedia editors. To counter this noise, we repeated the experiment using Wikipedia’s Featured Articles and Good Articles (approx. 11,000) as a set of clean negative examples. We used 70% of the articles in each category to train language models for each of the three categories (promotional articles, featured/good articles, untagged articles), and used the remaining 30% to evaluate classifier performance using 10-fold cross-validation."]},{"title":"4 Features4.1 Content and Meta Features of an Article","paragraphs":["We used the content and meta features proposed by","Anderka et al. (2012) as given in Tables 1-4. We also 3 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:","Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch 4 This feature is not included in Anderka et al.

This feature is the average of the sentiment scores assigned by SentiWordnet (Baccianella et al., 2010) to all positive and negative sentiment bearing words in an article. In total, this results in 58 basic document features. 4.2 N-Gram Language Models Language models are commonly used to measure stylistic differences in language usage between authors. For this work, we employed them to model the difference in style of neutral vs. promotional Wikipedia articles. We trained trigram word language models and trigram character language models5","with Witten-Bell smoothing to produce probabilistic models of both classes. 4.3 PCFG Language Models Probabilistic Context Free Grammars (PCFG) capture the syntactic structure of language by modeling sentence generation using probabilistic CFG productions. We hypothesize that sentences in promotional articles and those in neutral articles tend to have different kinds of syntactic structures and therefore, we explored the utility of PCFG models for detecting this difference. Since we do not have ground-truth parse trees for sentences in our dataset, 5 Modeling longer character sequences did not help. 1852 Features based on PCFG models and n-gram Language models Difference in the probabilities assigned to an article by the positive and the negative class character trigram language models (LM char trigram) Difference in the probabilities assigned to an article by the positive and the negative class word trigram language models (LM word trigram) Difference in the mean values of the probabilities assigned to sentences of an article by the positive and negative class PCFG models (PCFG mean) Difference in the maximum values of the probabilities assigned to sentences of an article by the positive and negative class PCFG models (PCFG max) Difference in the minimum values of the probabilities assigned to sentences of an article by the positive and negative class PCFG models (PCFG min) Difference in the standard deviation values of the probabilities of sentences of an article by the positive and negative class PCFG models (PCFG std deviation) Table 5: Features of a Wikipedia Article based on PCFG models and n-gram Language models Edit History Features Age of the article Days since last revision of the article Number of edits to the article Number of unique editors Number of edits made by registered users and by anonymous IP addresses Number of edits per editor Percentage of edits by top 5% of the top contributors to the article Table 4: Edit-History Features of a Wikipedia Article we followed the method of (Raghavan et al., 2010; Harpalani et al., 2011), which uses the output of the Stanford parser to train PCFG models for stylistic analysis. We used the PCFG implementation of Klein and Manning (2003) to learn a PCFG model for each category. 4.4 Classification The n-gram and PCFG language models were used to create a set of additional document features. We used the probability assigned by the language models to each sentence in a test document to calculate document-wide statistics such as the mean, maximum, and minimum probability and standard deviation in probabilities of the set of sentences in an article. The language-modeling features used are shown in Table 5.","Since we have a wide variety of features, we experimented with various ensemble learning techniques and found that LogitBoost performed best empirically. We used the Weka implementation of LogitBoost (Friedman et al., 2000) to train a classifier using various combinations of features. We used Decision Stumps as a base classifier and ran boosting for 500 iterations."]},{"title":"5 Experimental Evaluation5.1 Methodology","paragraphs":["We used 10-fold cross-validation to test the performance of our classifier using various combinations of features. We ran the classifier on the portion (30%) of the dataset not used for language modeling.6","We measured overall classification accuracy as well as precision, recall, F-measure, and area under the ROC curve for all experiments. We tested performance in two settings (Anderka et al., 2012):","• Pessimistic Setting: The negative class consists of articles from the Untagged set. Since some of these could be manually undetected promotional articles, the accuracy measured in this setting is probably an under-estimate.","• Optimistic Setting: The negative class consists of articles from the Featured/Good set. These articles are at one end of the quality spectrum, making it relatively easier to distinguish them from promotional articles. The true performance of the classifier is likely some-where between that achieved in these two settings.","6","We maintain an equal number of positive and negative test cases in both the settings. 1853 Features Pessimistic Setting Optimistic Setting P R F1 AUC P R F1 AUC Bag-of-words Baseline 0.823 0.820 0.821 0.893 0.931 0.931 0.931 0.979 PCFG 0.881 0.870 0.865 0.903 0.910 0.910 0.910 0.961 Character trigrams 0.889 0.887 0.888 0.952 0.858 0.843 0.841 0.877 Word trigrams 0.863 0.863 0.863 0.931 0.887 0.883 0.882 0.931 Character trigrams + Word trigrams 0.89 0.888 0.889 0.952 0.908 0.907 0.907 0.962 PCFG+Char. trigrams+Word trigrams 0.914 0.915 0.914 0.974 0.950 0.950 0.950 0.983 58 Content and Meta Features 0.866 0.867 0.867 0.938 0.986 0.986 0.986 0.996 All Features 0.940 0.940 0.940 0.986 0.989 0.989 0.989 0.997 Table 6: Performance (Precision(P), Recall(R), F1 score, AUC) of the classifier in the two settings 5.2 Results for Pessimistic Setting From Table 6, we see that all features perform better than the bag-of-words baseline. We also see that character trigrams, one of the simplest features, gives the best individual performance. However, deeper syntactic features using PCFGs also performs quite well. Combining all of the language-modeling features (PCFG + character trigrams + Word trigrams) further improves performance. Compared to the 58 content and meta features utilized by Anderka et al., (2012) described in Section 4.1, the PCFG and character trigram features give much better performance, both individually and when combined. It is interesting to note that adding Anderka et al.’s features to the language-modeling ones gives a fairly small improvement in performance. This validates our hypothesis that promotional articles tend to have a distinct linguistic style that is captured well using language models. 5.3 Results for Optimistic Setting In the Optimistic Setting, as shown in Table 6, the content and meta features give the best performance, which improves only slightly when combined with language-modeling features. The bag-of-words baseline performs better than all the language modeling features. This performance could be because there is a much clearer distinction between promotional articles and featured/good articles that can be captured by simple features alone. For example, featured/good articles are generally longer than usual Wikipedia articles and have more references. 5.4 Top Ranked Features and their Performance To analyze the performance of different features, we determined the top ranked features using Information Gain. In the Pessimistic Setting, the top six features are all language-modeling features (character trigram model feature works best), followed by basic meta-features such as character count, word count, category count and sentence count. The new feature we introduced, “Overall Sentiment Score” is the 18th most informative feature in the pessimistic setting, indicating that the cumulative sentiment of a bag of words is not as discriminative as we would in-tuitively assume. Using the 10 top-ranked features, we get an F1 of 0.93, which is only slightly worse than that achieved using all features (F1 = 0.94).","In the Optimistic Setting, the top-ranked features are the number of references and the number of references per section. This is consistent with the observation that featured/good articles have very long and comprehensive lists of references, since Wikipedia’s fundamental policy is to maintain verifiability by citing relevant sources. Features based on the n-gram and PCFG models also appear in the list of ten best features. Using only the top 10 features, gives an F1 of 0.988, which is almost as good as using all features (F1 = 0.989). 5.5 Optimistic and Pessimistic Settings In the optimistic setting, there is a clear distinction between the positive (promotional) and negative (featured/good) classes. But there are only subtle differences between the positive and negative (untagged articles) classes in the pessimistic setting. 1854 Best Features in Pessimistic Setting Best Features in Optimistic Setting LM char trigram Number of References LM word trigram Number of References per Section PCFG min LM word trigram PCFG max Number of Words PCFG mean PCFG mean PCFG std deviation Number of Sentences Number of Characters LM char trigram Number of Words Number of Words Number of Categories Number of Characters Number of Sentences Number of Backlinks Table 7: Top 10 Features (listed in order) in both Settings ranked using Information Gain These two classes are superficially similar, in terms of length, reference count, section count etc. Stylometric features based on the trained language models are successful at detecting the subtle linguistic differences in the two types of articles. This is useful because the pessimistic setting is closer to the real-world setting of articles in Wikipedia. 5.6 Error Analysis Since the pessimistic setting is close to the real setting of Wikipedia articles, it is useful to do an error analysis of the classifier’s performance in this setting. There is an approximately equal proportion of false positives and false negatives.","A significant number of false positives seem to be cases of manually undetected promotional articles. This demonstrates the practical utility of our classifier. But there are also many false positives that seem to be truly unbiased. These articles appear to have been poorly written, without following Wikipedia’s editing policies. Examples include use of very long lists of nouns, use of ambiguous terms like ”many believe” and excessive use of superlatives. Other common characteristics of most of the false positives are presence of a considerable number of complex sentences with multiple subordinate clauses. These stylistic cues seem to be misleading the classifier.","A common thread underlying most of the false negatives is the fact that they are written in a narrative style or they have excessive details in terms of the content. Examples include narrating a detailed story of a fictional character in an unbiased manner or writing a minutely detailed account of the history of an organization. Another source of false negatives comes from biographical Wikipedia pages which are written in a resume style, listing all their qualifications and achievements. These cues could help one manually detect that the article, though not promotional in style, is probably written with the view of promoting the entity. As possible future work, we could incorporate features derived from language models for narrative style trained using an appropriate external corpus of narrative text. This might enable the classifier to detect some cases of unbiased promotional articles."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion","paragraphs":["Our experiments and analysis show that stylometric features based on n-gram language models and deeper syntactic PCFG models work very well for detecting promotional articles in Wikipedia. After analyzing the errors that are made during classification, we realize that though promotional content is non-neutral in majority of the cases, there do exist promotional articles that are neutral in style. Adding additional features based on language models of narrative style could lead to a better model of Wikipedia’s promotional content."]},{"title":"7 Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["This research was supported in part by the DARPA DEFT program under AFRL grant FA8750-13-2-0026 and by MURI ARO grant W911NF-08-1-0242.
