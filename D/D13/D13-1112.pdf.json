Due to scalability is-sues, most of these recent methods can only train on a small dev set of about a thousand sentences rather than on the full training set, and only with 2,000–10,000 rather “dense-like” features (either unlexicalized or only considering highest-frequency words), as in MIRA (Watanabe et al., 2007; Chiang et al., 2008; Chiang, 2012), PRO (Hopkins and May, 2011), and RAMP (Gimpel and Smith, 2012). However, it is well-known that the most important features for NLP are lexicalized, most of which can not","∗","Work done while visiting City University of New York.","†","Corresponding author. be seen on a small dataset. Furthermore, these methods often involve complicated loss functions and intricate choices of the “target” derivations to update towards or against (e.g. k-best/forest oracles, or hope/fear derivations), and are thus hard to replicate. As a result, the classical method of MERT (Och, 2003) remains the default training algorithm for MT even though it can only tune a handful of dense features. See also Section 6 for other related work.","As a notable exception, Liang et al. (2006) do train a structured perceptron model on the training data with sparse features, but fail to outperform MERT. We argue this is because structured perceptron, like many structured learning algorithms such as CRF and MIRA, assumes exact search, and search errors inevitably break theoretical properties such as convergence (Huang et al., 2012). Empirically, it is now well accepted that standard perceptron performs poorly when search error is severe (Collins and Roark, 2004; Zhang et al., 2013).","To address the search error problem we propose a very simple approach based on the recent framework of “violation-fixing perceptron” (Huang et al., 2012) which is designed specifically for inexact search, with a theoretical convergence guarantee and excellent empirical performance on beam search parsing and tagging. The basic idea is to update when search error happens, rather than at the end of the search. To adapt it to MT, we extend this framework to handle latent variables corresponding to the hidden derivations. We update towards “gold-standard” derivations computed by forced decoding so that each derivation leads to the exact reference translation. Forced decoding is also used as a way of data selection, since those reachable sentence pairs are generally more literal and of higher quality, which the training should focus on. When the reachable subset is small for some language pairs, we augment 1112 it by including reachable prefix-pairs when the full sentence pair is not.","We make the following contributions:","1. Our work is the first successful effort to scale online structured learning to a large portion of the training data (as opposed to the dev set).","2. Our work is the first to use a principled learning method customized for inexact search which updates on partial derivations rather than full ones in order to fix search errors. We adapt it to MT using latent variables for derivations.","3. Contrary to the common wisdom, we show that simply updating towards the exact reference translation is helpful, which is much simpler than k-best/forest oracles or loss-augmented (e.g. hope/fear) derivations, avoiding sentence-level BLEU scores or other loss functions.","4. We present a convincing analysis that it is the search errors and standard perceptron’s inability to deal with them that prevent previous work, esp. Liang et al. (2006), from succeed-ing.","5. Scaling to the training data enables us to engineer a very rich feature set of sparse, lexicalized, and non-local features, and we propose various ways to alleviate overfitting. For simplicity and efficiency reasons, in this paper we use phrase-based translation, but our method has the potential to be applicable to other translation paradigms. Extensive experiments on both Chinese-to-English and Spanish-to-English tasks show statistically significant gains in BLEU by up to +2.3/+2.0 on dev/test over MERT, and up to +1.5/+1.5 over PRO, thanks to 20M+ sparse features."]},{"title":"2 Phrase-Based MT and Forced Decoding","paragraphs":["We first review the basic phrase-based decoding algorithm (Koehn, 2004), which will be adapted for forced decoding. 2.1 Background: Phrase-based Decoding We will use the following running example from Chinese to English from Mi et al.

Each hypothesis has a coverage vector capturing the source-language words translated so far, and can be extended into a longer hypothesis by a phrase-pair translating an uncovered segment. For example, the following is one possible derivation: (0 ) : (0, “” ) (•1 ) : (s1, “Bush” ) r1 (• •••6) : (s2, “Bush held talks” ) r2 (•••3•••) : (s3, “Bush held talks with Sharon” ) r3 where a • in the coverage vector indicates the source word at this position is “covered” and where each si is the score of each state, each adding the rule score and the distortion cost (dc) to the score of the previous state. To compute the distortion cost we also need to maintain the ending position of the last phrase (e.g., the 3 and 6 in the coverage vectors). In phrase-based translation there is also a distortion-limit which prohibits long-distance reorderings.","The above states are called −LM states since they do not involve language model costs. To add a bigram model, we split each −LM state into a series of +LM states; each +LM state has the form (v,a",") where a is the last word of the hypothesis.

Here we group +LM states into n bins, with each bin Bi hosting at most b states that cover exactly i Chinese words (see Figure 1). 2.2 Forced Decoding The idea of forced decoding is to consider only those (partial) derivations that can produce (a prefix of) the exact reference translation (assuming single reference). We call these partial derivations “ y-good” derivations (Daumé, III and Marcu, 2005), and those that deviate from the reference translation “ y-bad” derivations. The forced decoding algorithm is very similar to +LM decoding introduced above, with the new “forced decoding LM” to be defined as only accepting two consecutive words on the reference translation, ruling out any y-bad hypothesis: Pforced (b | a) =","{ 1 if ∃j, s.t. a = yj and b = yj+1 0 otherwise","In the +LM state, we can simply replace the boundary word by the index on the reference translation: (0 ,0 ) : (0, “ <s>”) (•1 ,1 ) : (w′","1, “ <s> Bush”) r1 (•","•••6,3 ) : (w′","2, “ <s> Bush held talks”) r2","(•••3•••,5 ) : (w′","3, “ <s> Bush held talks with Sharon”) r3 The complexity of this forced decoding algorithm is reduced to O(2n","n3",") where n is the source sentence length, without the expensive bookkeeping for English boundary words.","Liánhéguó","pàiqiǎn","50","guāncháiyuán","jiāndū","Bōlı̀wéiyà huı̄fù","mı́nzhǔ","zhèngzhı̀","yı̌lái","shǒucı̀","quángúo","dàxuǎn              U.N.              sent              50              observers              to              monitor              the              1st              election              since              Bolivia              restored              democracy 5 3 3 4 1 Figure 3: Example of unreachable sentence pair and reachable prefix-pair. The first big jump is disallowed for a distortion limit of 4, but we can still extract the top-left box as a reachable prefix-pair. Note that this example is perfectly reachable in syntax-based MT. 2.3 Reachable Prefix-Pairs In practice, many sentence pairs in the parallel text fail in forced decoding due to two reasons:","1. distortion limit: long-distance reorderings are disallowed but are very common between languages with very different word orders such as English and Chinese.","2. noisy alignment and phrase limit: the word-alignment quality (typically from GIZA++) are usually very noisy, which leads to unnecessarily big chunks of rules beyond the phrase limit.","If we only rely on the reachable whole sentence pairs, we will not be able to use much of the training set for Chinese-English. So we propose to augment the set of reachable examples by considering reachable prefix-pairs (see Figure 3 for an example)."]},{"title":"3 Violation-Fixing Perceptron for MT","paragraphs":["Huang et al. (2012) establish a theoretical framework called “violation-fixing perceptron” which is tailored for structured learning with inexact search and has provable convergence properties. The high-level idea is that standard full update does not fix search errors; to do that we should instead update when search error occurs, e.g., when the gold-1114 standard derivation falls below the beam. Huang et al. (2012) show dramatic improvements in the quality of the learned model using violation-fixing perceptron (compared to standard perceptron) on incremental parsing and part-of-speech tagging.","Since phrase-based decoding is also an incremental search problem which closely resembles beam-search incremental parsing, it is very natural to employ violation-fixing perceptron here for MT training. Our goal is to produce the exact reference translation, or in other words, we want at least one y-good derivation to survive in the beam search.","To adapt the violation-fixing perceptron framework to MT we need to extend the framework to handle latent variables since the gold-standard derivation is not observed. This is done in a way similar to the latent variable structured perceptron (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005; Liang et al., 2006; Sun et al., 2009) where each update is from the best (y-bad) derivation towards the best y-good derivation in the current model; the latter is a constrained search which is exactly forced decoding in MT. 3.1 Notations We first establish some necessary notations. Let ⟨x, y⟩ be a sentence pair in the training data, and d = r1 ◦ r2 ◦ . . . ◦ r|d| be a (partial) derivation, where each ri = ⟨c(ri), e(ri)⟩ is a rule, i.e., a Chinese-English","phrase-pair. Let |c(d)| ∆","= ∑","i |c(ri)| be the num-","ber of Chinese words covered by this derivation, and e(d) ∆","= e(r1) ◦ e(r2) . . . ◦ e(r|d|) be the English prefix generated so far. LetD(x) be the set of all possible partial derivations translating part of the input sentence x. Let pre(y) ∆","= {y[0:j] | 0 ≤ j ≤ |y|} be the set of prefixes of the reference translation y, and good i(x, y) be the set of partial y-good derivations whose English side is a prefix of the reference translation y, and whose Chinese projection covers exactly i words on the input sentence x, i.e.,","good i(x, y) ∆ = {d ∈ D(x) | e(d) ∈ pre(y), |c(d)| = i}. Conversely, we define the set ofy-bad partial derivations covering i Chinese words to be:","bad i(x, y) ∆ = {d ∈ D(x) | e(d) /∈ pre(y), |c(d)| = i}.","Basically, at each bin Bi, y-good derivations good i(x, y) and y-bad ones bad i(x, y) compete for the b slots in the bin: B0 = {ε} (1)","Bi = topb ⋃ j=1..l{d ◦ r | d ∈ Bi−j, |c(r)| = j} (2) where r is a rule covering j Chinese words, l is the phrase-limit, and topb","S is a shorthand for argtopb","d∈S w · Φ(x, d) which selects the top b derivations according to the current model w. 3.2 Algorithm 1: Early Update As a special case of violation-fixing perceptron, early update (Collins and Roark, 2004) stops decoding whenever the gold derivation falls off the beam, makes an update on the prefix so far and move on to the next example. We adapt it to MT as follows: if at a certain bin Bi, all y-good derivations in good i(x, y) have fallen off the bin, then we stop and update, rewarding the best y-good derivation in good i(x, y) (with respect to current model w), and penalizing the best y-bad derivation in the same step:","d+","i (x, y) ∆","= argmax","d∈goodi(x,y) w · Φ(x, d) (3) d− i (x, y) ∆","=","argmax d∈badi(x,y)∩Bi w · Φ(x, d) (4)","w ← w + ∆Φ(x, d+ i (x, y), d−","i (x, y)) (5) where ∆Φ(x, d, d′",") ∆","= Φ(x, d) − Φ(x, d′",") is a shorthand notation for the difference of feature vectors. Note that the set good i(x, y) is independent of the beam search and current model and is instead precomputed in the forced decoding phase, whereas the negative signal d−","i (x, y) depends on the beam.","In practice, however, there are exponentially many y-good derivations for each reachable sentence pair, and our goal is just to make sure (at least) one y-good derivation triumphs at the end. So it is possible that at a certain bin, all y-good partial derivations fall off the bin, but the search can still continue and produce the exact reference translation through some other y-good path that avoids that bin. For example, in Figure 1, the y-good states in steps 3 and 5 are not critical; it is totally fine to miss them in the search as long as we save the y-good states 1115 e a rl y ma xvi o l a t i o n best in the beam worst in the beam d− i d+ i d+ i∗ d− i∗ d+ |x| dy |x| st d l o ca l","standard update is invalid mo d e l w d− |x| Figure 4: Illustration of four update methods. The blue paths denote (possibly lots of) gold-standard derivations from forced decoding. Standard update in this case is invalid as it reinforces the error of w (Huang et al., 2012). in bins 1, 4 and 6. So we actually use a “softer” version of the early update algorithm: only stop and update when there is no hope to continue. To be more concrete, let l denote the phrase-limit then we stop where there are l consecutive bins without any y-good states, and update on the first among them. 3.3 Algorithm 2: Max-Violation Update While early update learns substantially better models than standard perceptron in the midst of inexact search, it is also well-known to be converging much slower than the latter, since each update is on a (short) prefix. Huang et al. (2012) propose an improved method “ max-violation” which updates at the worst mistake instead of the first, and converges much faster than early update with similar or better accuracy. We adopt this idea here as follows: decode the whole sentence, and find the step i∗","where the difference between the best y-good derivation and the best y-bad one is the biggest. This amount of difference is called the amount of “violation” in Huang et al. (2012), and the place of maximum violation is intuitively the site of the biggest mistake during the search. More formally, the update rule is:","i∗ ∆","= argmin i w · ∆Φ(x, d+","i (x, y), d−","i (x, y)) (6)","w ← w + ∆Φ(x, d+ i∗(x, y), d−","i∗(x, y)) (7) 3.4 Previous Work: Standard and Local Updates We compare the above new update methods with the two existing ones from Liang et al. (2006).","Standard update (also known as “bold update” in Liang et al. (2006)) simply updates at the very end, from the best derivation in the beam towards the best gold-standard derivation (regardless of whether it survives the beam search):","w ← w + ∆Φ(x, d+ |x|(x, y), d−","|x|(x, y)) (8) Local update, however, updates towards the derivation in the final bin that is most similar to the reference y, denoted dy","|x|(x, y):","dy","|x|(x, y) = argmax","d∈B|x| Bleu+1","(y, e(d)) (9)","w ← w + ∆Φ(x, dy","|x|(x, y), d−","|x|(x, y))","(10) where Bleu+1","(·, ·) returns the sentence-level BLEU.","Liang et al. (2006) observe that standard update performs worse than local update, which they at-tribute to the fact that the former often update towards a gold derivation made up of “unreasonable” rules. Here we give a very different but theoretically more reasonable explanation based on the the-ory of Huang et al. (2012), who define an update ∆Φ(x, d+",", d−",") to be invalid if d+","scores higher than d−","(i.e., w · ∆Φ(x, d+",", d−",") > 0, or update ∆w points to the same direction as w in Fig. 4), in which case there is no “violation” or mistake to fix. Perceptron is guaranteed to converge if all updates are valid. Clearly, early and max-violation updates are valid. But standard update is not: it is possible that at the end of search, the best y-good derivation d+ |x|(x, y), though pruned earlier in the search, ranks even higher in the current model than anything in the final bin (see Figure 4). In other words, there is no mistake at the final step, while there must be some search error in earlier steps which expels the y-good subderivation. We will see in Section 5.3 that invalid updates due to search errors are indeed the main reason why standard update fails. Local update, however, is always valid in that definition.","Finally, it is worth noting that in terms of implementation, standard and max-violation are the easiest, while early update is more involved."]},{"title":"4 Feature Design","paragraphs":["Our feature set includes the following 11 dense features: LM, four conditional and lexical translation probabilities (pc(e|f ), pc(f |e), pl(e|f ), pl(f |e)), length and phrase penalties, distortion cost, and three lexicalized reordering features.

The notation uses the Python style subscript syntax. 4.1 Local Sparse Features: Ruleid & WordEdges We first add the rule identification feature for each rule: id(ri). We also introduce lexicalized WordEdges features, which are shown to be very effective in parsing (Charniak and Johnson, 2005) and MT (Liu et al., 2008; He et al., 2008) literatures. We use the following atomic features when applying a rule ri = ⟨c(ri), e(ri)⟩: the source-side length |c(ri)|, the boundary words of both c(ri) and e(ri), and the surrounding words of c(ri) on the input sentence x. See Figure 5 for examples. These atomic features are concatenated to generate all kinds of combo features.

Class size is estimated on the small Chinese-English dataset (Sec. 5.3). The POS tagsets are ICT-CLAS for Chinese (Zhang et al., 2003) and Penn Treebank for English (Marcus et al., 1993). 4.2 Addressing Overfitting With large numbers of lexicalized combo features we will face the overfitting problem, where some combo features found in the training data are too rare to be seen in the test data. Thus we propose three ways to alleviate this problem.","First, we introduce various levels of backoffs for each word w (see Table 1). We include w’s Brown cluster and its prefixes of lengths 4 and 6 (Brown et al., 1992), and w’s part-of-speech tag. If w is Chinese we also include its word type (punctuations, digits, alpha, or otherwise) and (leftmost or right-most) character. In such a way, we significantly in-crease the feature coverage on unseen data.","However, if we allow arbitrary combinations, we can extract a hexalexical feature (4 Chinese + 2 English words) for a local window in Figure 5, which is unlikely to be seen at test time. To control model complexity we introduce a feature budget for each level of backoffs, shown in the last column in Table 1. The total budget for a combo feature is the sum of the budgets of all atomic features. In our experiments, we only use the combo features with a total budget of 10 or less, i.e., we can only include bilexical but not trilexical features, and we can include for example combo features with one Chinese word plus two English tags (total budget: 9).","Finally, we use two methods to alleviate overfitting due to one-count rules: for large datasets, we simply remove all one-count rules, but for small datasets where out-of-vocabulary words (OOVs) abound, we use a simple leave-one-out method: when training on a sentence pair (x, y), do not use the one-count rules extracted from (x, y) itself. 4.3 Non-Local Features Following the success of non-local features in parsing (Huang, 2008) and MT (Vaswani et al., 2011), we also introduce them to capture the contextual in-formation in MT. Our non-local features, shown in Figure 5, include bigram rule-ids and the concatena-tion of a rule id with the translation history, i.e. the last two English words. Note that we also use backoffs (Table 1) for the words included. Experiments (Section 5.3) show that although the set of non-local features is just a tiny fraction of all features, it contributes substantially to the improvement in BLEU. 1117 Scale Language Training Data Reachability ∆BLEU Sections Pair # sent. # words sent. words # feats # refs dev/test small CH-EN 30K 0.8M/1.0M 21.4% 8.8% 7M 4 +2.2/2.0 5.2, 5.3 large 230K 6.9M/8.9M 32.1% 12.7% 23M +2.3/2.0 5.2, 5.4 large SP-EN 174K 4.9M/4.3M 55.0% 43.9% 21M 1 +1.3/1.1 5.5 Table 2: Overview of all experiments.

The local and standard updates, however, underperform MERT; in particular, the latter gets worse as training goes on.","As analysized in Section 3.4, the reason why standard update (or “bold update” in Liang et al. (2006)) fails is that inexact search leads to many invalid updates. This is confirmed by Figure 9, where more","3","Stands for Max-Violation Perceptron w/ Forced Decoding 17181920212223242526 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 BLEU Number of iteration MaxForce MERT early local standard Figure 8: BLEU scores on the heldout dev set for different update methods (trained on small CH-EN data). 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 Ratio beam size +non-local features standard perceptron Figure 9: Ratio of invalid updates in standard update. than half of the updates remain invalid even at a beam of 30. These analyses provide an alternative but theoretically more reasonable explanation to the findings of Liang et al. (2006): while they blame “unreasonable” gold derivations for the failure of standard update, we observe that it is the search errors that make the real difference, and that an update that respects search errors towards a gold sub-derivation is indeed helpful, even if that subderiva-tion might be “unreasonable”.","In order to speedup training, we use mini-batch parallelization of Zhao and Huang (2013) which has been shown to be much faster than previous parallelization methods.

The number of sentence pairs in this subset is 1,032, which contains similar number of words to our 616-sentence dev set (since reachable sentences are much shorter). Thus, it is reasonable to compare different learning algorithms in terms of speed and performance. Figure 10 shows that first of all, mini-batch improves BLEU even in the serial setting, and when run on 24 cores, it leads to a speedup of about 7x. It is also interesting to know that on 1 CPU, minibatch perceptron takes similar amount of time to reach the same performance as MERT and PRO.","Figure 11 compares the learning curves of MAXFORCE, MERT, and PRO.

The results show that PRO-dense performs almost the same as MERT but with a stabler learning curve while PRO-medium improves by +0.6. However, PRO-large decreases the performance significantly, which indicates PRO is not scalable to truly sparse features. By contrast, our method handles large-scale sparse features well and outperforms all other methods by a large margin and with a stable learning curve.","We also investigate the individual contribution from each group of features (ruleid, WordEdges, and non-local features). So we perform experiments by adding each group incrementally. Figure 12 shows the learning curves and Table 4 lists the counts and incremental contributions of different feature sets.

WordEdges (which is the vast majority of features) improves BLEU by +2.0 points and outperforms MERT, when sparse features totally dominate dense features. Finally, the 0.3% non-local features contribute a final +0.7 in BLEU. 5.4 Results on Large Chinese-English Data Table 5 shows all BLEU scores for different learning algorithms on the large CH-EN data. The MERT baseline on Cubit is essentially the same as Moses. Our MAXFORCE activates 23M features on reachable sentences and prefixes in the training data, and takes 35 hours to finish 15 iterations on 24 cores, peaking at iteration 13. It achieves significant improvements over other approaches: +2.3/+2.0 points over MERT and +1.5/+1.5 over PRO-medium on dev/test sets, respectively. 5.5 Results on Large Spanish-English Data In SP-EN translation, we first run forced decoding on the training set, and achieve a very high reachability of 55% (with the same distortion limit of 6), which is expected since the word order between Spanish and English are more similar than than between Chinese and English, and most SP-EN reorderings are local. Table 6 shows that MAXFORCE improves the translation quality over MERT by +1.3/+1.1 BLEU on dev/test. These gains are comparable to the improvements on the CH-EN task, since it is well accepted in MT literature that a change of δ in 1-reference BLEU is roughly equivalent to a change of 2δ with 4 references. system algorithm # feat. dev test Moses MERT 11 27.4 24.4 Cubit MAXFORCE 21M 28.7 25.5 Table 6: BLEU scores (with one reference) on SP-EN."]},{"title":"6 Related Work","paragraphs":["Besides those discussed in Section 1, there are also some research on tuning sparse features on the training data, but they integrate those sparse features into the MT log-linear model as a single feature weight, and tune its weight on the dev set (e.g. (Liu et al., 2008; He et al., 2008; Wuebker et al., 2010; Simianer et al., 2012; Flanigan et al., 2013; Setiawan and Zhou, 2013; He and Deng, 2012; Gao and He, 2013)). By contrast, our approach learns sparse features only on the training set, and use dev set as held-out to know when to stop.","Forced decoding has been used in the MT literature. For example, open source MT systems Moses and cdec have implemented it. Liang et al.
