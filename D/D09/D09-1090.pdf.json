Numerous methods of machine translation require bilingual dictionaries with large coverage, but less-frequent language pairs rarely have any digitalized resources. Since the need for these resources is increasing, but the human resources are scarce for less represented languages, efficient automatized methods are needed. This paper introduces a fully automated, robust pivot language based bilingual dictionary generation method that uses the WordNet of the pivot language to build a new bilingual dictionary. We propose the usage of WordNet in order to increase accuracy; we also introduce a bidirectional selection method with a flexible threshold to maximize recall. Our evaluations showed 79% accuracy and 51% weighted recall, outperforming representative pivot language based methods. A dictionary generated with this method will still need manual post-editing, but the improved recall and precision decrease the work of human correctors."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["In recent decades automatic and semi-automatic machine translation systems gradually managed to take over costly human tasks. This much welcomed change can be attributed not only to major developments in techniques regarding translation methods, but also to important translation resources, such as monolingual or bilingual dictionaries and corpora, thesauri, and so on. However, while widely used language pairs can fully take advantage of state-of-the-art developments in machine translation, certain low-frequency, or less common language pairs lack some or even most of the above mentioned translation resources. In that case, the key to a highly accurate machine translation system switches from the choice and adaptation of the translation method to the problem of available translation resources between the chosen languages.","One possible solution is bilingual corpus acquisition for statistical machine translation (SMT). However, for highly accurate SMT systems large bilingual corpora are required, which are rarely available for less represented languages. Rule or sentence pattern based systems are an attractive alternative, for these systems the need for a bilingual dictionary is essential.","Our paper targets bilingual dictionary generation, a resource which can be used within the frameworks of a rule or pattern based machine translation system. Our goal is to provide a low-cost, robust and accurate dictionary generation method. Low cost and robustness are essential in order to be re-implementable with any arbitrary language pair. We also believe that besides high precision, high recall is also crucial in order to facilitate post-editing which has to be performed by human correctors. For improved precision, we propose the usage of WordNet, while for good recall we introduce a bidirectional selection method with local thresholds.","Our paper is structured as follows: first we overview the most significant related works, after which we analyze the problems of current dictionary generation methods. We present the details of our proposal, exemplified with the Japanese-Hungarian language pair. We evaluate the generated dictionary, performing also a comparative evaluation with two other pivot-language based methods. Finally we present our conclusions."]},{"title":"2 Related works 2.1 Bilingual dictionary generation","paragraphs":["Various corpus based, statistical methods with very good recall and precision were developed starting from the 1980’s, most notably using the 862 Dice-coefficient (Kay & Röscheisen, 1993), correspondence-tables (Brown, 1997), or mutual information (Brown et al., 1998).","As an answer to the corpus-based method’s biggest disadvantage, namely the need for a large bilingual corpus, in the 1990’s Tanaka and Umemura (1994) presented a new approach. As a resource, they only use dictionaries to and from a pivot language to generate a new dictionary. These so-called pivot language based methods rely on the idea that the lookup of a word in an uncommon language through a third, intermediated language can be automated. Tanaka and Umemura’s method uses bidirectional source-pivot and pivot-target dictionaries (harmonized dictionaries). Correct translation pairs are selected by means of inverse consultation, a method that relies on counting the number of pivot language definitions of the source word, through which the target language definitions can be identified (Tanaka and Umemura, 1994).","Sjöbergh (2005) also presented an approach to pivot language based dictionary generation. When generating his English pivoted Swedish-Japanese dictionary, each Japanese-to-English description is compared with each Swedish-to-English description. Scoring is based on word overlap, weighted with inverse document frequency; the best matches being selected as translation pairs.","These two approaches described above are the best performing ones that are general enough to be applicable with other language pairs as well. In our research we used these two methods as baselines for comparative evaluation.","There are numerous refinements of the above methods, but for various reasons they cannot be implemented with any arbitrary language pair. Shirai and Yamamoto (2001) used English to design a Korean-Japanese dictionary, but because the usage of language-specific information, they conclude that their method ‘can be considered to be applicable to cases of generating among languages similar to Japanese or Korean through English’. In other cases, only a small portion of the lexical inventory of the language is chosen to be translated: Paik et al. (2001) proposed a method with multiple pivots (English and Kanji/Hanzi characters) to translate Sino-Korean entries. Bond and Ogura describe a Japanese-Malay dictionary that uses a novel technique in its improved matching through normalization of the pivot language, by means of semantic classes, but only for nouns (2007). Besides English, they also use Chinese as a second pivot. 2.2 Lexical database in lexical acquisition Large lexical databases are vital for many areas in natural language processing (NLP), where large amount of structured linguistic data is needed. The appearance of WordNet (Miller et al., 1990) had a big impact in NLP, since not only did it provide one of the first wide-range collections of linguistic data in electronic format, but it also offered a relatively simple structure that can be implemented with other languages as well. In the last decades since the first, English WordNet, numerous languages adopted the WordNet structure, thus creating a potential large multilingual network. The Japanese language is one of the most recent ones added to the WordNet family (Isahara et al. 2008), but the Hungarian WordNet is still under development (Prószéky et al. 2001; Miháltz and Prószéky 2004).","Multilingual projects, such as EuroWordNet (Vossen 1998; Peters et al. 1998), Balkanet (Stamou et al. 2002) or Multilingual Central Repository (Agirre et al. 2007) aim to solve numerous problems in natural language processing. EuroWordNet was specifically designed for word disambiguation purposes in cross-language information retrieval (Vossen 1998). The internal structure of the multilingual WordNets itself can be a good starting point for bilingual dictionary generation. In case of EuroWordNet, besides the internal design of the initial WordNet for each language, an Inter-Lingual-Index interlinks word meaning across languages is implemented (Peters et al. 1998). However, there are two limita-tions: first of all, the size of each individual language database is relatively small (Vossen 1998), covering only the most frequent words in each language, thus not being sufficient for creating a dictionary with a large coverage. Secondly, these multilingual databases cover only a handful of languages, with Hungarian or Japanese not being part of them. Adding a new language would require the existence of a WordNet of that language."]},{"title":"3 Problems of current pivot language based methods 3.1 Selection method shortcomings","paragraphs":["Previous pivot language based methods generate and score a number of translation candidates, and the candidate’s scores that exceed a certain predefined global threshold are selected as viable translation pairs. However, the scores highly de-863 pend on the entry itself or the number of translations in the pivot language, therefore there is a variance in what that score represents. For this reason, a large number of good entries are entirely left out from the dictionary, because all of their translation candidates scored low, while faulty translation candidates are selected, because they exceed the global threshold. Due to this effect the recall value drops significantly. 3.2 Dictionaries not enough as resource Regardless of the language pair, in most cases the meanings of the corresponding words are not identical; they only overlap to a certain extent. Therefore, the pivot language based dictionary generation problem can be defined as the identification of the common elements or the extent of the relevant overlapping in the source-to-pivot and target-to-pivot definitions.","Current methods perform a strictly lexical overlap of the source-pivot and target-pivot entries. Even if the meanings of the source and target head words are transferred to the pivot language, this is rarely done with the same set of words or definitions. Thus, due to the different word-usage or paraphrases, even semantically identical or very similar head words can have different definitions in different dictionaries. As a result, performing only lexical overlap, current methods cannot identify the differences between totally different definitions resulted by unrelated concepts, and differences in only nuances resulted by lexicographers describing the same concept, but with different words."]},{"title":"4 Proposed method 4.1 Specifics of our proposal","paragraphs":["For higher precision, instead of the familiar lexical overlap of the current methods we calculate the semantically expanded lexical overlap of the source-to-pivot and target-to-pivot translations. In order to do that, we use semantic information extracted from the WordNet of the pivot language.","To improve recall, we introduce bidirectional selection. As we stated above, the global threshold eliminates a large number of good translation pairs, resulting in a low recall. As a solution, we can group the translations that share the same source or target entry, and set local thresholds for each head word. For example, for a source language head word entry_source there could be multiple target language candidates: entry_target1, ... ,entry_targetn. If the top scoring entry_targetk candidates are selected, we ensure that at least one translation will be available for entry_source, maintaining a high recall. Since we can group the entries in the source language and target language as well, we perform this selection twice, once in each direction. Local thresholds depend on the top scoring entry_target, being set to maxscore·c. Constant c varies between 0 and 1, allowing a small window not only for the maximum, but high scoring candidates as well. It is language and selection method dependent (see §5.1 for details). 4.2 Translation resources As an example of a less-common language pair, we have chosen Japanese and Hungarian. For translation candidate generation, we have chosen two freely available dictionaries with English as the pivot language. The Japanese-English dictionary had 197282, while the Hungarian-English contained 189331 1-to-1 entry pairs. The Japanese-English dictionary had part-of-speech (POS) information as well, but to ensure robustness, our method does not use this information.","To select from the translation candidates, we mainly use WordNet (Miller et. al., 1990). From WordNet we consider four types of information: sense categorization, synonymy, antonymy and semantic categories provided by the tree structure of nouns and verbs. 4.3 Dictionary generation method Our proposed method consists of two steps. In step 1 we generate a number of translation pair candidates, while in step 2 we score and select from them based on semantic information extracted from WordNet. Step 1: translation candidate generation Using the source-pivot and pivot-target dictionaries, we connect the source and target entries that share at least one common translation in the pivot language. We consider each source-target pair a translation candidate. With our Japanese-English and English-Hungarian dictionaries we accumulated 436966 Japanese-Hungarian translation candidates. Step 2: translation pair selection We examine the translation candidates one by one, looking up the source-pivot and target-pivot dictionaries, comparing the translations in the pivot language. There are six types of translations that we label A-F and explain below. First, 864 we perform a strictly lexical match based only on the dictionaries. Next, using information extracted from WordNet we attempt to identify the correct translation pairs. (a) Lexically unambiguous translation pairs Some of the translation candidates have exactly the same translations into in the pivot language; we consider these pairs as being correct by default. Also among the translation candidates we identified a number of source entries that had only one target translation; and a number of target entries that had only one source translation. Being the sole candidates for the given entries, we consider these pairs too as being correct. 37391 Japanese-Hungarian translation pairs were retrieved with this method (type A pairs). (b) Using sense description For most polysemous words WordNet has detailed descriptions with synonyms for each sense. We use these synonyms of WordNet’s sense descriptions to disambiguate the meanings of the common translations. For a given source-target translation candidate (s,t) we look up the source-pivot and target-pivot translations (s→I={s→i1,...,s→in} and t→I={t→i1,...,t→im}). We select the elements that are common in the two definitions (I’=(s→I)∩(t→I)) and we look up their respective senses from WordNet (sns(I’)). We identify the words’ senses comparing each synonym in the WordNet’s synonym description with each word from the dictionary definition. As a result, for each common word we arrive at a certain set of senses from the source-pivot definitions (sns((s→I’)) and a certain set of senses from the target-pivot definitions (sns((t→I’)). We mark scoreB(s,t) the maximum ratio of the identical and total number of identified senses (Jaccard coefficient). The higher the scoreB(s,t) is, the more probable is candidate (s,t) a valid translation. ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )' ' ' ' max , ' itsns issns itsns issns ts score ItIsi B → ∪→ → ∩→ = →∩→∈  (1)","For example, 正解 (seikai: correct, right, correct interpretation) and helyes (correct, proper, right, appropriate) have two common translations (I’={right, correct}), thus scoreB(s,t) can be performed with these two words. The adjective right has 13 senses according to WordNet, among them 4 were identified from the Japanese to English definition (sns(right)={#1, #3, #5, #10}, all identified through correct) and 5 from the Hungarian to English definition (sns(right)={#1, #3, #5, #6, #10}, through correct or proper). As a result, 4 senses are common, and 1 is different. Thus the adjective right’s score is 0.8 (scoreB(s,t)[right](正解,helyes)). The adjective correct has 4 senses, all of them are recognized by both definitions through right, therefore the score through correct is 1 (scoreB(s,t)[correct]( 正 解 ,helyes)). The maximum of the above scores is the final score: scoreB(s,t)(正解,helyes)=1.","All translation candidates are verified based on all four POS available from WordNet. Since synonymy information is available for nouns (N), verbs (V), adjectives (A) and adverbs (R), four separate scores are calculated for each POS.","Scores that pass a global threshold are considered correct. 33971 Japanese-Hungarian candidates (type B translations) were selected, with these two languages the global threshold was set to 0.1. Even this low value ensures that at least one of ten meanings is shared by the two entries of the pair, thus being suitable as translation pair. (c) Using synonymy, antonymy and semantic categories We expand the source-to-pivot and target-to-pivot definitions with information from WordNet (synonymy, antonymy and semantic category, respectively). Thus the similarity of the two expanded pivot language descriptions gives a better indication on the suitability of the translation candidate. Using the three relations, the common versus total number of translations (Jaccard coefficient) will define the appropriateness of the translation candidate. ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )i text i sext i text i sext ts score EDC → ∪→ → ∩→ =, ,,  (2)","Since the same word or concept’s translations into the pivot language also share the same semantic value, the extension with synonyms (ext(l→i)=(l→i)∪syn(l→i), where l={s,t}) the extended translation should share more common elements.","In case of antonymy, we expand the initial definitions with the antonyms of the antonyms (ext(l→i)=(l→i)∪ant(ant(l→i)), where l={s,t}). This extension is different from the synonymy extension, in most cases the resulting set of words being considerably larger.","Along with synonymy, antonymy is also available for nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs, four separate scores are calculated for each POS. 865","Semantic categories are provided by the tree structure (hypernymy/hyponymy) of nouns and verbs of WordNet. We transpose each entry from the pivot translations to its semantic categories (ext(l→i)=Σsemcat(l→i), where l={s,t}). We assume that the correct translation pairs share a high percentage of semantic categories. Accordingly, the translations of semantically similar or identical entries should share a high number of common semantic categories.","The scores based on these relations highly depend on the number of pivot language translations; therefore we use the bidirectional selection method with local thresholds for each source and target head word. Local thresholds are set based on the best scoring candidate for a given entry. The thresholds were maxscore·0.9 for synonymy and antonymy; and maxscore·0.8 for the semantic categories (see §5.1 for details).","Using synonymy, 196775 candidate pairs (type C), with antonymy 99614 pairs (type D); while with semantic categories 195480 pairs (type E) were selected. (d) Combined semantic information The three separate lists of type C, D and E selection methods resulted in slightly different results, proving that they cannot be used as standalone selection methods (see §5.2 for details).","Because of the multiple POS labelling of numerous words in WordNet, many translation pairs can be selected up to four times based on separate POS information (noun, verb, adjective, adverb), all within one single semantic information based methods. Since we use a bidirectional selection method, experiments showed that translation pairs that were selected during both direc-tions, in most cases were the correct translations. Similarly, translation pairs selected during only one direction were less accurate. In other words, translation pairs whose target language translation was selected as a good translation for the source language entry; and whose source language translation was also selected as a good translation for the target language entry, should be awarded with a higher score. In the same way, entries selected only during one direction should receive a penalty. For every translation candidate we select the maximum score from the several POS (noun, verb, adjective and adverb for synonymy and antonymy relations; noun and verb for semantic category) based scores, multiplied by a multiplication factor (mfactor). The multiplication factor varies between 0 and 1, awarding the candidates that were selected both times during the double directional selection; and punish-ing when selection was made only in a single direction. The product gives the combined score (scoreF), c1, c2 and c3 are constants. In case of Japanese and Hungarian, these method scored best with the constants set to 1, 0.5 and 0.8, respectively. The combined score also highly depends on the word entry, therefore local thresholds are used in this selection method as well, which were empirically set to maxscore·0.85 (see §5.1 for details)."]},{"title":"( ) ( )( )( )( )( )∏","paragraphs":["    ⋅ + ⋅ +","= rel rel rel F ts mfactorc c ts score c ts score , , max , 3 2 1  (3)","As an example, for the Japanese entry 購入 (kōnyū: buy, purchase) there are 10 possible Hungarian translations; using the above methods 5 of them (#1, #7, #8, #9, #10) are selected as correct ones.

In order to do so, we constructed two other Hungarian-Japanese dictionaries using the methods proposed by Tanaka & Umemura and Sjöbergh, using the same source dictionaries. 6.1 Recall evaluation It is well known that one of the most challenging aspects of dictionary generation is word ambiguity. It is relatively easy to automatically generate the translations of low-frequency keywords, because they tend to be less ambiguous. On the contrary, the ambiguity of the high frequency words is much higher than their low-frequency counterparts, and as a result conventional methods fail to translate a considerable number of them. However, this discrepancy is not reflected in the traditional recall evaluation, since each 867 word has an equal weight, regardless of its frequency of use. As a result, we performed a frequency weighted recall evaluation. We used a Japanese frequency dictionary (FD) generated from the Japanese EDR corpus (Isahara, 2007) to weight each Japanese entry. Setting the standard to the frequency dictionary (its recall value being 100), we automatically search for each entry (w) from the frequency dictionary, looking whether or not it is included in the bilingual dictionary (WD). If it is recalled, we weight it with its frequency from the frequency dictionary."]},{"title":"( )( )","paragraphs":["100⋅ ="]},{"title":"∑∑","paragraphs":["∈∈ DD Fw Ww","w w frequency w frequency recall  (4) method recall our method 51.68 Sjöbergh method 37.03 Tanaka method 30.76 initial candidates 51.68 Japanese-English(*) 73.23","Table 4: Recall evaluation results (* marks a manually created dictionary)","The frequency weighted recall value results show that our method’s dictionary (51.68) out-scores every other automatically generated method’s dictionary (37.03, 30.76) with a significant advantage.

Since no independent evaluator was available for these two languages, after a random identification code being assigned to each of the 600 selected translation pairs (200 from each dictionary), they were mixed. Therefore the evaluator did not know the origin of the translation pairs, only after manual scoring the total score for each dictionary was available, after regrouping based on the initial identification codes. The process was repeated 10 times, 2000 pairs were manually checked from each dictionary."," code","Japanese entry","Hungarian entry classification","k9g6","n5d8 報告 (hōkoku:","information, re-","port) hír (report, information, news) correct","j8h0","k1x5 初 (ubu: innocent,","naive) zöld (green, ver-","dant) undecided","a5b6","n8i3 エントリ (entori:","entry <a contest>) bejárat (entry,","entrance) wrong Table 5: 1-to-1 precision evaluation examples evaluation score (%) method correct undecided wrong our method 79.15% 6.15% 14.70% Sjöbergh method 54.05% 9.80% 36.15% Tanaka method 62.50% 7.95% 29.55% Table 6: 1-to-1 precision evaluation results","To rank the methods we only consider the correct translations.

Discussing the weaknesses of our system, we have to divide the problems into two categories: recall problems deal with the difficulty in connecting the target and source entries through the pivot language, while precision problems discuss the reasons why erroneous pairs are produced. 7.1 Recall problems We managed to maximize the recall of our initial translation candidates, but in many cases certain translation pairs still could not be generated because the link from the source language to the target language through the pivot language simply doesn’t exist. The main reasons are: the entry is missing from at least one of the dictionaries; translations in the pivot language are expressions or explanations; or there is no direct translation or link between the source and target entries. The entries that could not be recalled are mostly expressions, rare entries, words specific to a language (ex: tatami: floor-mat, or gulyás: goulash).","Moreover, a number of head words don’t have any synonym, antonym and/or hypernymy/hyponymy information in WordNet, and as a result these words could not participate in the type B, C, D, E and F scoring. 7.2 Precision problems We identified two types of precision problems. The most obvious reasons for erroneous translations are the polysemous nature of words and the meaning-range differences across languages. With words whose senses are clear and mostly preserved even through the pivot language, most of the correct senses were identified and correctly translated. Nouns, adjectives and adverbs had a relatively high degree of accuracy. However, verbs proved to be the most difficult POS to handle. Because semantically they are more flexible than other POS categories, and the meaning range is also highly flexible across languages, the identification of the correct translation is increasingly difficult. For this reason, the number of faulty translations and the number of meanings that are not translated was relatively high.","One other source of erroneous translations is the quality of the initial dictionaries. Even the unambiguous type A translations fail to produce the desired accuracy, although they are the unique candidate for a given word entry. The main reason for this is the deficiency of the initial dictionaries, which contain a great number of irrelevant or low usage translations, shadowing the main, important senses of some words. In other cases the resource dictionaries don’t contain translations of all meanings; homonyms are 869 present as pivot entries with different meanings, sometimes creating unique, but faulty links."]},{"title":"8 Conclusions","paragraphs":["We proposed a new pivot language based method to create bilingual dictionaries that can be used as translation resource for machine translation. In contrast to conventional methods that use dictionaries only, our method uses WordNet as a main resource of the pivot language to select the suitable translation pairs. As a result, we eliminate most of the weaknesses caused by the structural differences of dictionaries, while profiting from the semantic relations provided by WordNet. We believe that because of the nature of our method it can be re-implemented with most language pairs.","In addition, owing to features such as the bidirectional selection method with local thresholds we managed to maximize recall, while maintaining a precision which is better than any other compared method’s score. During exemplifica-tion, we generated a mid-large sized Japanese-Hungarian dictionary with relatively good recall and promising precision.","The dictionary is freely available online (http://mj-nlp.homeip.net/mjszotar), being also downloadable at request."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Agirre, E., Alegria, I., Rigau, G, Vossen, P. 2007.
