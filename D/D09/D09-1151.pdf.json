Bridging anaphora (Clark, 1975) represents a special part of the general problem of anaphora resolution, which has been studied and discussed for various languages and domains (Hahn et al., 1996; Murata et al., 1999; Poesio et al., 2004; Gasperin and Vieira, 2004; Gasperin and Briscoe, 2008).","Usually bridging anaphora considers two types:1","associative anaphors are noun phrases (NPs) that have an antecedent that is necessary to their interpretation but the relation between the anaphor and its antecedent is different from identity; and indirect anaphors are those that have an identity relation with their antecedents but the anaphor and its antecedent have different head 1 The terminology that we use here is introduced by","Hawkins (1978), which is also used in (Vieira et al., 2006). nouns.","In this paper, we focus on associative anaphora in Japanese.","Associative anaphora resolution is decomposed into two steps: acquiring lexical knowledge for associative anaphora resolution, and resolving associative anaphora using the acquired knowledge.","Grammatical salience plays a lesser role for resolving anaphors with full lexical heads, than for pronominal anaphora (Strube and Hahn, 1999; Modjeska, 2002). Furthermore, since associative anaphors and their antecedents usually have different head nouns, string matching technique cannot be applied. Therefore, a large and diverse amount of lexical knowledge is essential to understand associative anaphora. For example, to recognize the meronymic relation between “a house” and “the roof” in (1), such knowledge as “a roof” is a part of a building or vehicle is required. To recognize the attributive relation between “Prius” and “the price” in (2), such knowledge as “price” is a price of some goods or service is required. (1) There was a house. The roof was white.","(2) Toyota launched the hybrid car Prius in 1997. The price was 21.5 million yen.","To acquire such lexical knowledge, various studies have been carried out. Early studies used hand-crafted lexical knowledge such as Word-Net (Strube and Hahn, 1999; Vieira and Poesio, 2000; Meyer and Dale, 2002), but obtained poor or mediocre results. Hence, Poesio et al. (2002) proposed to exploit “Nh of Nm” phrases in large corpora to resolve associative anaphora in English; Murata et al. (1999) proposed to exploit “Nm no Nh” phrases to resolve associative anaphora in Japanese. Here, the Japanese postposition “no” roughly corresponds to “of,” but it has 1455 much broader usage. These studies obtained reasonable results, but the coverage of the acquired knowledge was not sufficient. Recently, a number of researchers argued for using the Web as a source of lexical knowledge, and the Web has been shown to be a useful resource for anaphora resolution (Bunescu, 2003; Markert et al., 2003; Poesio et al., 2004).","Hence, in this study, we acquire the lexical knowledge for associative anaphora resolution from “Nm no Nh” phrases in the Web by using the method described in (Sasano et al., 2004). We proposed a method for acquiring such lexical knowledge, called nominal case frames (NCFs), using an ordinary language dictionary and “Nm no Nh” phrases, and constructed NCFs from newspaper corpora. In this study, we aim to acquire a sufficient amount of lexical knowledge by constructing NCFs from the Web.","As for associative anaphora resolution itself, we propose an integrated probabilistic model for zero anaphora and associative anaphora resolution, in which associative anaphora is regarded as a kind of zero anaphora and resolved by using the same model as zero anaphora. Our model assumes zero pronouns that represent indispensable entities of target noun phrases, which are called zero adnominal in (Yamura-Takei, 2003), and conducts zero pronoun resolution.","Let us consider the associative anaphoric relation between “Prius” and “kakaku” (price). Although “kakaku” itself is considered as the anaphor from a conventional point of view (3a), our model assumes a zero pronoun φ and considers it as the anaphor (3b).","(3) a. Prius - kakaku (price) [antecedent: Prius, anaphor: kakaku (price)]","b. Prius - (φ-no) kakaku (price (of φ)) [antecedent: Prius, anaphor: φ]","The point of this study is three-fold: the acquisition of the lexical knowledge for associative anaphora resolution from the Web, the application of zero anaphora resolution model to associative anaphora resolution, and the integrated resolution of zero anaphora and associative anaphora."]},{"title":"2 Construction of Nominal Case Frames","paragraphs":["Most nouns have their indispensable entities: “price” is a price of some goods or service, “roof” is a roof of some building, and “coach” is a coach of some sports. The relation between a noun and its indispensable entities is parallel to that between a verb and its arguments or obligatory cases. In this paper, we call indispensable entities of nouns obligatory cases. Note that, obligatory does not mean grammatically obligatory but obligatory to interpret the meaning of the noun. Associative anaphora resolution needs comprehensive information of obligatory cases of nouns. Nominal case frames (NCFs) describe such information, and we construct them from the Web. 2.1 Automatic Construction of NCFs First, we briefly introduce our method for constructing NCFs from raw corpora proposed in (Sasano et al., 2004).","Whereas verbal case frame construction uses arguments of each verb (Kawahara and Kurohashi, 2002), nominal case frame construction basically uses adnominal constituents of each noun. However, while the meaning of a verbal argument can be distinguished by the postposition, such as “ga” (nominative), “wo” (accusative), and “ni” (dative), the meaning of an adnominal constituent can not be distinguished easily, because most adnominal constituents appear with the same postposition “no” (of). Thus, we first conduct a semantic analysis of adnominal constituents, and then construct NCFs using the results as follows:","1. Collect syntactically unambiguous noun phrases “Nm no Nh” from the automatic resulting parses of large corpora.","2. Analyze the relation between Nm and Nh by Kurohashi and Sakai’s method (1999) that exploits an ordinary language dictionary.","3. Depending on the results, classify Nm, and obtain preliminary case slots for Nh.","4. Merge case slots if two preliminary case slots of Nh are similar.","5. Consider frequent case slots as obligatory cases of Nh. The frequency thresholds are varied according to semantic analyses.","6. For each meaning of Nh, collect case slots and construct case frames.","The point of this method is the integrated use of an ordinary dictionary and example phrases from 1456 Table 1: Examples of constructed nominal case frames.

For details see (Sasano et al., 2004). large corpora. Dictionary definition sentences are an informative resource to recognize obligatory cases of nouns. However, it is difficult to resolve associative anaphora by using a dictionary as it is, because all nouns in a definition sentence are not an obligatory case, and only the frequency information of noun phrases tells us which is the obligatory case. On the other hand, a simple method that just collects and clusters “Nm no Nh” phrases based on some similarity measure of nouns cannot construct comprehensive nominal case frames, because of polysemy and multiple obligatory cases. For details see (Sasano et al., 2004).","It is desirable to use a probability distribution for deciding whether a case slot is obligatory or not. However, it is difficult to estimate a probability distribution, since we construct nominal case frames not by using the examples of associative anaphora itself but by using the examples of noun phrases “Nm no Nh” (Nh of Nm). We use such noun phrases because indispensable entities of noun ”Nh” often appear as ”Nm.” However, we can say neither frequently appeared ”Nm” is an indispensable entity of ”Nh.” nor an indispensable entity frequently appears as ”Nm.” For example, the name of a country is considered as an indispensable entity of ”shusho” (prime minister), but does not frequently appear as ”Nm.”2","Thus, it is difficult to estimate a probability distribution and we use a hard decision. 2.2 NCF Construction from the Web We constructed nominal case frames from the Web Corpus (Kawahara and Kurohashi, 2006), which comprises 1.6 billion unique Japanese sentences. In this corpus, there were about 390 million noun phrases “Nm no Nh,” about 100 million unique noun phrases, and about 17 million unique head nouns “Nh.” There were about 4.07 million head nouns that appeared more than 10 times in the corpus, and we used only such head nouns.","The resultant nominal case frames consisted of about 564,000 nouns including compound nouns. We show examples of constructed nominal case frames in Table 1. The average number of case frames for a noun that has case frames was 1.0031, and the average number of case slots for a case frame was 1.0101. However, these statistics differed with the frequency of the noun. Therefore, we investigated the statistics of constructed nominal case frames for each group classified by the frequency of the nouns. Table 2 shows the re-","2","It is because “the prime minister of Japan” is often mentioned by simply “the prime minister” in Japanese. 1457 Table 2: The statistics of constructed NCFs.

Precision Recall F-measure 62/70 (0.89) 62/84 (0.74) 0.81 sult. As for the 10,000 most frequently appeared nouns, which occupied about 70% of all noun appearances, the average number of case frames for a noun was 1.11, and the average number of case slots for a case frame was 1.17.","For evaluating the resultant case frames, we randomly selected 100 nouns from the 10,000 most frequent nouns, and created gold standard case frames for these nouns by hand. For each noun, case frames were given if the noun was considered to have any indispensable entity, and for each case frame, obligatory case slots were given manually: 70 case frames were created that had 84 case slots; 56 case frames had only one case slot, the other 14 case frames had two case slots. 30 nouns had no case frames.","We then evaluated the automatically constructed case slots for these selected nouns. The evaluation result is shown in Table 3: the system output 70 case slots, and out of them, 62 case frames were judged as correct. The F-measure was 0.81. Since the boundary between indispensable cases and optional cases of a noun is not always obvious, this score is considered to be reasonable. 2.3 Generalization of Examples By using nominal case frames constructed from the Web, sparseness problem was alleviated to some extent, but still remained. For instance, there were thousands of named entities (NEs), which could not be covered intrinsically. To deal with this sparseness problem, we generalized the examples of case slots.","First, we used the categories that Japanese morphological analyzer JUMAN3","adds to common nouns. In JUMAN, about twenty categories are defined and tagged to common nouns. For example, “kuruma (car),” “niwatori (chicken),” and “tatemono (building)” are tagged as “VEHICLE,” “ANIMAL” and “FACILITY,” respectively. For each category, we calculated the rate of categorized examples among all case slot examples, and added it to the case slot as “[CT:VEHICLE]:0.13.”","We also generalized NEs. We used a common standard NE definition for Japanese provided by IREX workshop (1999). We first recognized NEs in the source corpus by using an NE recognizer (Sasano and Kurohashi, 2008), and then constructed NCFs from the NE-recognized corpus. As well as categories, for each NE class, we calculated the NE rate among all case slot examples, and added it to the case slot as “[NE:PERSON]:0.22.” The generalized examples are also included in Table 1."]},{"title":"3 Probabilistic Model","paragraphs":["In this study, we apply a lexicalized probabilistic model for zero anaphora resolution proposed in (Sasano et al., 2008) to associative anaphora resolution. 3.1 A Lexicalized Probabilistic Model for Zero Anaphora Resolution In English, overt pronouns such as “she” and definite noun phrases such as “the company” are anaphors that refer to preceding entities (antecedents). On the other hand, in Japanese, anaphors are often omitted, which are called zero pronouns, and zero anaphora resolution is one of the most important techniques for semantic analysis in Japanese.","Here, we introduce our model for zero anaphora resolution (Sasano et al., 2008). This model first resolves coreference and identifies discourse entities; then from the end of each sentence, analyzes each predicate by the following steps: 1. Select a case frame temporarily.","2.

In this model, associative anaphora is regarded as a kind of zero anaphora, that is, the relation between a noun and its obligatory cases is considered to be parallel to that between a verb and its arguments. Omitted obligatory cases are considered to be zero pronouns and resolved by the same process as zero anaphora resolution.","We conduct associative anaphora resolution for only non-coreferent noun phrases.

For example, the second appearance of ”the roof” in (4) means ”the roof of the house,” and it is easy to recognize by looking the first appearance of ”the roof.”","(4) I saw the roof of the house. The roof was painted dark green.","While verbal case frames describe both obligatory and optional cases, nominal case frames describe only obligatory cases. Therefore, we consider all case slots of nominal case frames as the target of associative anaphora resolution.","Let us consider following example:","(5) Toyota-wa 1997-nen hybrid car Prius-wo","year hatsubai. 2000-nen-kara-wa kaigai-demo launched year overseas hanbai-shiteiru.

In order to consider the salience of a discourse entity, we introduce the concept of salience score, which is calculated by the following set of simple rules, and only consider the entities that have the salience score no less than 1 as candidate antecedents of an associative anaphor. •","+2 : mentioned with topical marker “wa,” or at the end of a sentence. • +1 : mentioned without topical marker “wa.” • +1 : assigned to a zero pronoun. • ×α : beginning of each sentence.","We call α a decay rate. If α ≥ 1, we do not filter out any entities. If α = 0, we only consider the entities that appears in the same sentence as candidate antecedents. For example, we consider the salience score of the discourse entity { hybrid-car, Prius} in the example (5) when using α = 0.6. In the first sentence, since { hybrid-car, Prius} is mentioned twice, the salience score is 2.0. At the beginning of the second sentence it becomes 1.2, and after the zero anaphora resolution of “hanbai” it becomes 2.2. At the beginning of the third sentence it becomes 1.32.","Note that, this is an ideal case. Practically, some zero pronouns are not detected and some pronouns are assigned wrong antecedent; thus the salience score varies according to the preceding analysis. In addition, the salience score also depends on whether we resolve only associative anaphora or resolve associative anaphora simultaneously with zero anaphora. If zero pronoun resolution is not 1460 conducted, zero pronouns that represent omitted cases of verbs are not considered.","For example, in case of { hybrid-car, Prius} with α = 0.6, if zero anaphora resolution is not conducted, the salience score at the beginning of the third sentence becomes 0.72, because the zero anaphora resolution of “hanbai” is not considered; and thus { hybrid-car, Prius} is not considered as an antecedent candidate.","In order to recognize discourse structure more properly, our model basically resolves associative anaphora simultaneously with zero anaphora, and aims to consider zero pronouns that represent omitted cases of verbs. 3.4 Summary of Our model Our model is summarized as follows:","1. Parse an input text using the Japanese parser KNP6","and recognize NEs.","2. Resolve coreference, and link each mention to an entity or create a new entity.","3. From the end of each sentence, zero anaphora and associative anaphora resolution is conducted for each verb and non-coreferent noun by the following steps:","(a) Select a case frame temporarily.","(b) Consider all possible correspondences between each input argument and a case slot of the selected case frame.","(c) Regard case slots that have no correspondence as zero pronoun candidates.","(d) Consider all possible correspondences between zero pronoun candidates and existing entities that has a salience score no less than 1.0.","(e) Estimate each correspondence probabilistically, and select the most likely case frame and a correspondence."]},{"title":"4 Experiments4.1 Setting","paragraphs":["We created an anaphoric relation-tagged corpus consisting of 186 web documents (979 sentences), in which all predicate-argument relations and relations between nouns were manually tagged.

NE: Using examples generalized by named entities. * The average of 10 trials is shown. F-measure was about 0.14 lower than the method using generalized examples, and we can also confirm the effectiveness of the generalized examples. While generalization of categories much improved the F-measure, generalization of NEs contributed little. This is because the NE rate was smaller than the common noun rate, and so the effect was limited. This tendency was also seen in zero anaphora resolution (Sasano et al., 2008).","In order to investigate the effects of zero anaphora resolution, we tested our model under three conditions: without zero anaphora resolution (no resolution), with zero anaphora resolution (automatically resolved), and with using correct zero anaphora relations that are manually tagged (manually identified). The performance of automatic zero anaphora resolution resulted in a recall of 0.353, a precision of 0.375, and an F-measure of 0.364. Table 5 shows the experimental results. To resolve associative anaphora simultaneously with zero anaphora improved F-measure by 0.072; using correct zero anaphora relations improved F-measure by 0.103. We can confirm that the performance of associative anaphora resolution is improved by considering zero anaphora.","Note that, strictly speaking, these comparisons are not fair because we set the decay rate α to maximize the performance when using generalized examples and resolving zero anaphora automatically. However, these tendencies described above were also seen with other decay rates. 1462 Table 5: The effects of zero anaphora resolution.

Table 6 shows the causes of them.","22 false negatives were caused by salience score filtering. Note that, it does not mean that these 22 associative anaphoric relations were always recognized correctly if the correct antecedents were not filtered by salience score.","Case frame sparseness caused only 5 false negatives. Considering that the recall of nominal case frames was 74% as shown in Table 3, this seems to be too few. This is because we do not considered the relations that tagged possible, and only considered obviously indispensable relations. From this result, we can say that coverage of nominal case frames for nouns that have obviously indispensable entities is much higher than 74%, which is considered to achieve a coverage of about 95% (105/110). 4.4 Comparison with previous work Murata et al. (1999) proposed a method of utiliz-ing “Nm no Nh” phrases for associative anaphora resolution.7","They basically used all “Nm no Nh” phrases from corpora as a lexical knowledge, and used rule-based approach. They obtained a recall of 0.63 and a precision of 0.68 by using examples of “X no Y” (Y of X), a recall of 0.71 and a precision of 0.82 by assuming ideal nominal case frames. One reason of such high performance may be that they considered referential properties of noun phrases, such as generic, indefinite, and definite, while our model does not. We can also say that their experiments were conducted on small and supposedly easy corpora. Half of their corpora","7","Murata et al. (1999) and we (Sasano et al., 2004) used the terminology indirect anaphora, but concerned with the same phenomena as we concerned with in this paper. Table 6: Causes of false negatives.

However, we regarded some additional relations that can be interpreted by considering coreference relations as associative anaphoric relations.","(9) Chechen Kyôwakoku-no shuto-ni ... Chechen Republic capital","... shuto seiatsu-no saishu dankai-ni ... capital conquer last stage (... to the capital of Chechen Republic ... in the last stage to conquer the capital ...) For example, although the second mention of “shuto” (capital) in example (9) means “Chechen Kyôwakoku-no shuto” (the capital of Chechen Republic), it can be interpreted by recognizing the coreference relation between the first and second mentions of “shuto” (capital). Therefore, as mentioned in Section 3.2, we do not consider such relations as associative anaphora in this study; we included such relations as associative anaphora in (Sasano et al., 2004). The relatively high score is caused by this criterion."]},{"title":"5 Conclusion","paragraphs":["In this paper, we proposed a probabilistic model for associative anaphora resolution. Our model regards associative anaphora as a kind of zero anaphora and resolves it in the same manner as zero anaphora resolution that uses automatically acquired case frames. We also showed that the performance of associative anaphora resolution can be improved by resolving it simultaneously with zero anaphora. As future work, we plan to consider referential properties of noun phrases in associative anaphora resolution. 1463"]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Razvan Bunescu. 2003.
