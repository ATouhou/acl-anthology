Nearly all previous Chinese SRL research took full syntactic parsing as a necessary pre-processing step, such as (Sun and Jurafsky, 2004; Xue, 2008; Ding and Chang, 2008). Many features are extracted to encode the complex syntactic information. In English SRL research, there have been some attempts at relaxing the necessity of using full syntactic parses; better understanding of SRL with shallow parsing is achieved by CoNLL-2004 shared task (Carreras and Màrquez, 2004). However, it is still unknown how these methods perform on other languages, such as Chinese.","To date, the best SRL performance reported on the Chinese Proposition Bank (CPB) corresponds to a F-measure is 92.0, when using the hand-crafted parse trees from Chinese Penn Treebank (CTB). This performance drops to 71.9 when a real parser is used instead1","(Xue, 2008). Comparatively, the best English SRL results reported drops from 91.2 (Pradhan et al., 2008) to 80.56 (Surdeanu et al., 2007). These results suggest that as still in its infancy stage, Chinese full parsing acts as a central bottleneck that severely limits our ability to solve Chinese SRL. On the contrary, Chinese shallow parsing has gained a promising result (Chen et al., 2006); hence it is an alternative choice for Chinese SRL.","This paper addresses the Chinese SRL problem on the basis of shallow syntactic information at the level of phrase chunks. We first extend the study on Chinese chunking presented in (Chen et al., 2006) by raising a set of additional features. The new set of features yield improvement over the strong chunking system described in (Chen et al., 2006). On the basis of our shallow parser, we implement lightweight systems which solve SRL as a sequence labeling problem. This is accomplished by casting SRL as the classification of syntactic chunks (e.g. NP-chunk) into one of semantic labels with IOB2 representation (?). With respect to the labeling strategy, we distinguish two different approaches. The first one directly recognizes semantic roles by an IOB-type sequence tagging. The second approach divides the problem into two independent subtasks: 1) Argument Identification (AI) and 2) Semantic Role Classification (SRC). 1 This F-measure is evaluated on the basis of hand-crafted","word segmentation and POS tagging. 1475","A Chinese word consists of one or more characters, and each character, in most cases, is a morpheme. The problem of how the words are constructed from morphemes, known as word formation, is very important for a majority of Chinese language processing tasks. To capture Chinese verb formation information, we introduce a rule-based algorithm with a number of heuristics. Experimental results indicate that word formation features can help both shallow parsing and SRL.","We present encouraging SRL results on CPB2",". The best F-measure performance (74.12) with gold segmentation and POS tagging can be achieved by the first method. This result yield significant improvement over the best reported SRL performance (71.9) in the literature (Xue, 2008). The best recall performance (71.50) can be achieved by the second method. This result is also much higher than the best reported recall (65.6) in (Xue, 2008)."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Previous work on Chinese SRL mainly focused on how to implement SRL methods which are successful on English, such as (Sun and Jurafsky, 2004; Xue and Palmer, 2005; Xue, 2008; Ding and Chang, 2008). Sun and Jurafsky (2004) did the preliminary work on Chinese SRL without any large semantically annotated corpus of Chinese. Their experiments were evaluated only on ten specified verbs with a small collection of Chinese sentences. This work made the first attempt on Chinese SRL and produced promising results. After the CPB was built, (Xue and Palmer, 2005) and (Xue, 2008) have produced more complete and systematic research on Chinese SRL. Ding and Chang (2008) divided SRC into two sub-tasks in sequence. Under the hierarchical architecture, each argument should first be determined whether it is a core argument or an adjunct, and then be classified into fine-grained categories. Chen et al. (2008) introduced an application of transductive SVM in Chinese SRL. Because their experiments took hand-crafted syntactic trees as input, how transductive SVMs perform in Chinese SRL in realistic situations is still unknown.","Most existing systems for automatic Chinese SRL make use of a full syntactic parse of the sentence in order to define argument boundaries and 2 Our system is available at http://code.google.com/p/csrler/ to extract relevant information for training classifiers to disambiguate between role labels. On the contrary, in English SRL research, there have been some attempts at relaxing the necessity of using syntactic information derived from full parse trees. For example, Hacioglu and Ward (2003) considered SRL as a chunking task; Pradhan et al. (2005) introduced a new procedure to incorporate SRL results predicted respectively on full and shallow syntactic parses. Previous work on English suggests that even good labeling performance has been achieved by full parse based SRL systems, partial parse based SRL systems can still enhance their performance. Though better understanding of SRL with shallow parsing on English is achieved by CoNLL-2004 shared task (Carreras and Màrquez, 2004), little is known about how these SRL methods perform on Chinese."]},{"title":"3 Chinese Shallow Parsing","paragraphs":["There have been some research on Chinese shallow parsing, and a variety of chunk definitions have been proposed. However, most of these studies did not provide sufficient detail. In our system, we use chunk definition presented in (Chen et al., 2006), which provided a chunk extraction tool. The tool to extract chunks from CTB was developed by modify-ing the English tool used in CoNLL-2000 shared task, Chunklink3",", and is publicly available at http://www.nlplab.cn/chenwl/chunking.html. The definition of syntactic chunks is illustrated in Line CH in Figure 1. For example, ”保险公司/the insurance company”, consisting of two nouns, is a noun phrase.","With IOB2 representation (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995), the problem of Chinese chunking can be regarded as a sequence labeling task. In this paper, we first implement the chunking method described in (Chen et al., 2006) as a strong baseline. To conveniently illustrate, we denote a word in focus with a fixed windoww−2w−1ww+1w+2, where w is current token. The baseline features includes:","• Uni-gram word/POS tag feature: w−2, w−1, w, w+1, w+2; • Bi-gram word/POS tag feature: w−2 w−1,","w−1 w, w w+1, w+1 w+2; 3 http://ilk.uvt.nl/team/sabine/chunklink/chunklink 2-2-","2000 for conll.pl 1476 WORD: 截止 目前 保险 公司 已 为 三峡 工  供 保险 服务 POS: [P] [NT] [NN NN] [AD] [P] [NR] [NN] [VP] [NN NN] CH: [PP NP] [NP] [ADVP] [PP NP NP ] [VP] [NP] M1: B-A* I-A*4 B-A0 B-AM-ADV B-A2 I-A2 I-A2 B-V B-A1 M2-AI: B-A I-A B-A B-A B-A I-A I-A B-V B-A M2-SRC: AM-TMP A0 AM-ADV A2 Rel A1 Until now, the insurance company has provided insurance services for the Sanxia Project. Figure 1: An example from Chinese PropBank. That means 18 features are used to represent a given token. For instance, the bi-gram Word features at 5th word position (”公 司/company”) in Figure 1 are ” 保险”, ”保险 公司”, ”公司 已”, ”已 为”.","To improve shallow parsing, we raised an additional set of features. We will discuss these features in section 5."]},{"title":"4 SRL with Shallow Parsing","paragraphs":["The CPB is a project to add predicate-argument relations to the syntactic trees of the CTB. Similar to English PropBank, the semantic arguments of a predicate are labeled with a contiguous sequence of integers, in the form of AN (i.e. ArgN ); the adjuncts are annotated as such with the label AM (i.e. ArgM) followed by a secondary tag that represents the semantic classification of the adjunct. The as-signment of argument labels is illustrated in Figure 1, where the predicate is the verb ”供/provide”. For example, the noun phrase ”保险公司/the insurance company” is labeled as A0, meaning that it is the proto-Agent of 供; the preposition phrase ”截止目前/until now” is labeled as AM-TMP, indicating a temporal component. 4.1 System Architecture SRL is a complex task which has to be decomposed into a number of simpler decisions and tagging schemes in order to be addressed by learning techniques. Regarding the labeling strategy, we can distinguish at least two different strategies. The first one consists of performing role identification directly as IOB-type sequence tagging. The second approach consists of dividing the problem into two independent subtasks. 4","The semantic chunk labels here are B-AM-TMP and I-AM-TMP. Limited to the document length, we cannot put all detailed chunk labels in one line in Figure 1. 4.1.1 One-stage Strategy In the one-stage strategy, on the basis of syntactic chunks, we define semantic chunks which do not overlap nor embed using IOB2 representation. Syntactic chunks outside a chunk receive the tag O. For syntactic chunks forming a chunk of type A*, the first chunk receives the B-A* tag (Begin), and the remaining ones receive the tag I-A* (In-side). Then a SRL system can work directly by using sequence tagging techinique. Since the semantic annotation in the PropBank corpus does not have any embedded structure, there is no loss of information in this representation. The line M1 in Figure 1 illustrates this semantic chunk definition. 4.1.2 Two-stage Strategy In the two-stage architecture, we divide Chinese SRL into two subtasks: 1) semantic chunking for AI, in which the argument boundaries are predicted, and 2) classification for SRC, in which the already recognized arguments are assigned role labels. In the first stage, we define semantic chunks B-A which means begin of an argument and I-A which means inside of an argument. In the second stage, we solve SRC problem as a multi-class classification. The lines M2-AI and M2-SRC in Figure 1 illustrate this two-stage architecture. For example, the noun phrase ”保险公司/the insurance company” is proto-Agent, and thus should be labeled as B-A in the AI chunking phase, and then be tagged as A0. The phrase ”为三峡工/for the Sanxia Project” consists of three chunks, which should be labeled as B-A, I-A, and I-A respectively in the AI chunking phase, then these three chunks as a whole argument should be recognized as A2. 4.1.3 Chunk-by-Chunk There is also another semantic chunk definition, where the basic components of a semantic chunk are words rather than syntactic chunks. A good election for this problem is chunk-by-chunk pro-1477 cessing instead of word-by-word. The motivation is twofold: 1) phrase boundaries are almost always consistent with argument boundaries; 2) chunk-by-chunk processing is computationally less expensive and allows systems to explore a relatively larger context. This paper performs a chunk-by-chunk processing, but admitting a processing by words within the target verb chunks. 4.2 Features Most of the feature templates are ”standard”, which have been used in previous SRL research. We give a brief description of ”standard” features, but explain our new features in detail.5 4.2.1 Features for Semantic Chunking In the semantic chunking tasks, i.e. the one-stage method and the first step in the two-stage method, we use the same set of features. The features are extracted from three types of elements: syntactic chunks, target verbs, links between chunks and target verbs. They are formed making use of words, POS tags and chunks of the sentence. Xue (2008) put forward a rough verb classification where verb classes are automatically derived from the frame files, which are verb lexicon for the CPB annotation. This kind of verb class information has been shown very useful for Chinese SRL. Our system also includes this feature. In our experiments, we represent a verb in two dimensions: 1) number of arguments, and 2) number of framesets. For example, a verb may belong to the class ”C1C2,” which means that this verb has two framesets, with the first frameset having one argument and the second having two arguments.","To conveniently illustrate, we denote a token chunk with a fixed context wi−1[ck wi...wh...wj]wj+1, where wh is the head word of this chunk ck. The complete list of features is listed here. Extraction on Syntactic Chunks Chunk type: ck. Length: the number of words in a chunk. Head word/POS tag. The rules described in (Sun and Jurafsky, 2004) are used to extract head word. IOB chunk tag of head word: chunk tag of head word with IOB2 representation (e.g. B-NP, I-NP). 5 The source code of our system also provides lots of com-","ments for implementation of all features.","Chunk words/POS tags context. Chunk context includes one word before and one word after: wi−1 and wj+1.","POS tag chain: sequential containers of each word’s POS tag: wi ... wj. For example, this feature for ”保险服务” is ”NN NN”.","Position: the position of the phrase with respect to the predicate. It has three values as before, after and here. Extraction on Target Verbs Given a target verb wv and its context, we extract the following features.","Predicate, its POS tag, and its verb class.","Predicate IOB chunk tag context: the chain of IOB2 chunk tags centered at the predicate within a window of size -2/+2.","Predicate POS tag context: the POS tags of the words that immediately precede and follow the predicate.","Number of predicates: the number of predicates in the sentence. Extraction on Links To capture syntactic properties of links between the chunks and the verbs, we use the following features.","Path: a flat path is defined as a chain of base phrases between the token and the predicate. At both ends, the chain is terminated with the POS tags of the predicate and the headword of the token.","Distance: we have two notions of distance. The first is the distance of the token from the predicate as a number of base phrases, and the second is the same distance as the number of VP chunks. Combining Features We also combine above features as some new features.","Conjunctions of position and head word, target verb, and verb class, including: position wh, position wv, position wh wv, position class, and position wh class.","Conjunctions of position and POS tag of head word, target verb, and verb class, including: position wh wv, position wh, and position wh class. 4.2.2 Features for SRC In the SRC stage of the two-stage method, different from previous work, our system only uses word-based features, i.e. features extracted from words and POS tags, to represent a given argument. Experiments show that a good semantic 1478 role classifier can be trained by using only word-based features. To gather all argument position information predicted in AI stage, we design a coarse frame feature, which is a sequential collection of arguments. So far, we do not know the detailed semantic type of each argument, and we use XP as each item in the frame. To distinguish the argument in focus, we use a special symbol to indicate the corresponding frame item. For in-stance, the Frame feature for argument 保 险 服 务 is XP+XP+XP+XP+V+!XP, where !XP means that it is the argument in focus.","Denote 1) a given argument wi−2wi−1[wiwi+1...wj−1wj]wj+1wj+2, and 2) a given predicate wv. The features for SRC are listed as follows.","Words/POS tags context of arguments: the contents and POS tags of the following words: wi, wi−1, wi−2, wi+1, wi+2, wj, wj+1, wj−1, wj−2, wj+1, wj+2; the POS tags of the following words: wi+1, wi+2, wj+1, wj+2.","Token Position.","Predicate, its POS, and its verb class.","Coarse Frame.","Combining features: conjunctions of boundary words, including wi−1 wj+1 and wi−2 wj+2; conjunction of POS tags of boundary words, including wi−1 wj+1 and wi−2 wj+2; conjunction of token position, boundary words, and predicate word, including position wi wj, wi wj wv; position wi wj wv; conjunction of token position, boundary words’ POS tags, and predicate word, also including position wi wj, wi wj wv; position wi wj wv; conjunction of predicate and frame; conjunction of target verb class and frame; conjunction of boundary words’ POS tags, and predicate word."]},{"title":"5 Automatic Chinese Verb FormationAnalyzing5.1 Introduction to Chinese Word Formation","paragraphs":["Chinese words consist of one or more characters, and each character, in most cases, is a morpheme which is the smallest meaningful unit of the language. According to the number of morphemes, the words can be grouped into two sets, simple words (consisting of one morpheme) and compound words (consisting of two morphemes or more). There are 9 kinds of word formation in Chinese compound words, and table 1 shows the detail with examples. Note that, attributive-head and complementarity are not for Chinese verbs. Types Examples reduplication 看看(look) 想想(think) affixation 化(intensify) 着(feel) subject-verb 耳 (hear) 口述(dictate) verb-object 戒 (quit smoking)  发(haircut) verb-complement 通知(inform) 栽 (plant) verb-result  出(exceed)  (boil) adverbial-head 隐居(retreat)  (misuse) coordinate  惜(cherish) 追逐(chase) attributive-head* 谣言(rumor) 医院(hospital) complementarity*  张(paper) 匹(horse) Table 1: Example Words with Formation","The internal structure of a word constraints its external grammatical behavior, and the formation of a verb can provide very important information for Chinese SRL. Take ”出/exceed” as an example, the two characters are both verbal morphemes, and the character ”” means ”pass” and the character ”出” with the meaning of ”over” shows the complement of the action of ””. In this word, ”出” is usually collocated with an object, and hence a Patient role should comes after the verb ” 出”. Note that, the verb ””, however, is unlikely to have an object. Take ” 发/haircut” as another example, the first character ”” is a verbal morpheme with the meaning of ”cut” and the second character ”发” is a nominal morpheme with the meaning of ”hair”. In this word, ”发” acts as the object of ””, and the word ”发” is unlikely to have an Patient any more in the sentential context. 5.2 Verb Formation Analyzing Method To automatically analyze verb formation, we introduce a rule-based algorithm. Pseudo code in Algorithm 1 illustrates our algorithm. This algorithm takes three string (one or more Chinese characters) sets as lexicon knowledge:","• adverbial suffix set A: strings in A are usually realized as the modifier in a adverbial-head type word, e.g. 不/not, 别/not, 总/always, /both, 共/all.","• object head set O: strings in O are usually realized as the head in a verb-object type word, e.g. 变/change, /get, 谈/talk, 发/send. 1479","Algorithm 1: Verb Formation Analyzing.","Data: adverbial suffix setA, object head set","O, complement suffix setC","input : word W = c1...cn and its POS P","output: head character h, adverbial character","a, complement character c, object","character o","begin h = c = a = o = null; if n = 4 and c1 = c3 and c2 = c4 then","return Verb formation of W ′","= c1c3; else if n = 3 and c2 = c3 then","h = c1, c = c2; else if n = 2 and c1 = c2 then","h = c1; else if n = 1 then","h = c1; else if cn ∈ C and cn−1cn ∈ C and P =”VV” then","h = c1, c = cn/cn−1cn; else if c1 ∈ A then","a = c1, h = c2...cn; else if c1 ∈ O and P =”VV” then","h = c1, o = c2...cn; end","• complement suffix set C: strings in C are usually realized as complement in a verb-complement type word: e.g. 出/out, 入/in, /finish,来/come, 不到/not.","Note that, to date there is no word formation annotation corpus, so direct evaluation of our rule-based algorithm is impossible. This paper makes task-oriented evaluation which measures improvements in SRL. 5.3 Using Word Formation Information to improve Shallow Parsing The majority of Chinese nouns are of type attributive-head. This means that for most nouns the last character provides very important information indicating the head of the noun. For example, the word formations of ”桃树/peach”, ”柳 树/willow” and ”杨树/boxtree” (three different kinds of trees), are attributive-head and they have the same head word ”树/tree”. While for verbs, the majority are of three types: verb-object, coordinate and adverbial-head. For example, words ”加 /enlarge”, ”加 剧/make more drastic” and ”加 快/accelerate” have the same head ”加/add”. The head morpheme is very useful in alleviating the data sparseness in word level. However, for any given word, it is very hard to accurately find the head. In the shallow paring experiments, we use a very simple rule to get a pseudo head character: 1) extracting the last word for a noun, and 2) extracting the first word for a verb. The new features include:","Pattern 1: conjunction of pseudo head of wi−1 and POS tags of wi−1 and wi.","Pattern 2: conjunction of pseudo head of wi and POS tags of wi−1 and wi.","Pattern 3: conjunction of length/POS tags of wi−1, wi, wi+1. 5.4 Using Verb Formation Information to improve SRL We use some new verb formation features to improve our SRL system. The new features are listed as follows.

In this paper, we modify CoNLL-2005 shared task software6","to process CPB and CTB. In our experiments, we use the CPB 1.0 and CTB 5.0.

The contexts of the word ” 此/therefore” in the two sentences are similar, where ” 此” is followed by verbal components. In the second sentence, the word ”此/therefore” will be correctly recognized as an adverbial phrase unless classifier knows the following component is a clause.

Comparison between one-stage strategy and two-stage strategy indicates 1) that there is no significant difference in the F-measure; and 2) that two-stage strategy method can achieve higher recall while one-stage strategy method can achieve higher precision. Both the one-stage strategy and two-stage strategy methods yield significant improvements over the best reported SRL performance in the literature, especially in terms of recall performance. Comparison SRL performance with full parses and partial parses indicates that both models have strong and weak points. The full parse based method can implement high precision SRL systems, while the partial parse based methods can implement high recall SRL systems. This is further justification for combination strategies that combine these independent SRL models.","Generally, Table 4 shows that verb formation features can enhance Chinese SRL, especially for fine-grained role classification.

The main reason is that in Chinese, arguments with different semantic types have discriminative boundary words, which can be extracted without parsing. It is very clear that the main bottleneck for Chinese SRL is to accurately identify arguments rather than to disambiguate their detailed semantic types.","Table 5 summarizes the labeling performance for argument of different length. It is not surpris-ing that arguments are more and more difficult to rightly recognize as the increase of their length. But the performance decline slows up when the length of arguments is larger than 10. In other words, some of the arguments that are composed of many words can still be rightly identified. The main reason for this point is that these arguments usually have clear collocation words locating at argument boundaries. Take the sentences below for example, 3. 包括[A1 . . . . . . ] (including ... etc.) the object of the verb ”包括/include” has a definite collocation word ”/etc.”, and therefore this object is easy to be recognized as a A1."]},{"title":"7 Conclusion","paragraphs":["In this paper, we discuss Chinese SRL on the basis of partial syntactic structure. Our systems advance the state-of-the-art in Chinese SRL. We first 1482 extend the study on Chinese shallow parsing and implement a good shallow parser. On the basis of partial parses, SRL are formulated as a sequence labeling problem, performing IOB2 decisions on the syntactic chunks of the sentence. We exploit a wide variety of features based on words, POS tags, and partial syntax. Additionally, we discuss a language special problem, i.e. Chinese word formation. Experimental results show that coarse word formation information can help shallow parsing, especially for NP-chunk recognition. A rule-based algorithm is put forward to automatically acquire Chinese verb formation, which is empirically shown to enhance SRL."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This work is supported by NSFC Project 60873156, 863 High Technology Project of China 2006AA01Z144 and the Project of Toshiba (China) R&D Center.","We would like to thank Weiwei Ding for his good advice on this research.","We would also like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Xavier Carreras and Lluı́s Màrquez. 2004.
