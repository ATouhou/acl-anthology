Treebank Grammars (Scha, 1990; Charniak, 1996) trained on large corpora nowadays present the best available means to parse natural language text.","The performance curve for parsing the WSJ was a steep one at first, as the incorporation of notions such as head, distance, subcategorization (Charniak, 1997; Collins, 1999) brought about a dramatic increase in parsing accuracy to the level of F188. Discriminative approaches, Data-Oriented Parsing (‘all-subtrees’) approaches, and self-training techniques brought further improvements, and recent results are starting to level off at around F192.1 (McClosky et al., 2008).","As the interest of the NLP community grows to encompass more languages, we observe efforts towards adapting an English parser for parsing other languages (e.g., (Collins et al., 1999)), or towards designing a language-independent frame-work based on principles underlying the models for parsing English (Bikel, 2002). The performance curve for parsing other languages with these models looks rather different. A case in point is Modern Standard Arabic. Since the initial effort of (Bikel, 2002) to parse the Arabic treebank (Maamouri et al., 2004), which yielded F175 accuracy, four years and successive revisions have led to no more than F179 (Maamouri et al., 2008).","This pattern from Arabic is not peculiar. The level of state-of-the-art results for other languages still lags behind those for English, even after putting considerable effort into the adaptation.1 Given that these languages are inherently different from English and from one another, it appears that we cannot avoid a question concerning the adequacy of the models used to parse them. That is, given the properties of a language, which modeling strategy would be appropriate for parsing it?","Until recently, there has been practically no computationally affordable alternative to the Head-Driven (HD) approach in the development of phrase-structure based statistical parsing models. Recently, we proposed the Relational-Realizational (RR) approach that rests upon different premises (Tsarfaty and Sima’an, 2008). The question of how the RR model fares against the HD models that have so far been predominantly used has never been tackled. Yet, it is precisely such a comparison that can shed new light on the question of adequacy we posed above.","Empirically quantifying the effects of different modeling choices has been addressed for English by, e.g., (Johnson, 1998; Klein and Manning, 2003), and for German by, e.g., (Dubey, 2004; 1","Consider, e.g., “The PaGe shared task on parsing German” (Kubler, 2008), reporting F175, F179, F183 for the participating parsers. 842 Rafferty and Manning, 2008). This paper provides an empirical systematic comparison of conceptually different modeling strategies with respect to parsing Hebrew. This comparison is intended to provide a first answer to the question of parser adequacy in the face of word-order freedom.","Our two empirical results are unequivocal. Firstly, RR models significantly outperform HD models (about 2 points absolute improvement in F1) in parsing the Modern Hebrew treebank. In particular, RR models show better performance in identifying the constituents for which syntactic positions are relatively free. Secondly, we show a novel variation of the HD model, incorporating the Relational notions of the RR model, on the hypothesis that this might bridge the gap. The RR model remains superior.","Our post-experimental analysis shows that HD modeling is inherently problematic for parsing a language with freer word-order because of the hard-wiring of notions such as left, right and distance from the head. RR models, taking a principled approach towards capturing variable form-function correspondence patterns, are better suited for parsing nonconfigurational phenomena."]},{"title":"2 The Data","paragraphs":["This section describes some properties of Modern Hebrew (henceforth, Hebrew) that make it significantly different from English. These properties affect the syntactic representations found in the Hebrew Treebank and the kind of syntactic phenomena a parser for Hebrew has to cope with.","Modern Hebrew is a Semitic language with a canonical SVO word-order pattern,2","yet it allows considerable freedom in the placement of syntactic constituents in a clause. For example, linguistic elements of any kind may be fronted, triggering an inversion familiar from Germanic languages as in (1b) (Triggered Inversion (TI) in (Shlonsky, 1997)). Under some information structuring conditions, Verb Initial (VI) constructions are also allowed, as in (1c) (Melnik, 2002). All sentences in (1) thus mean “Dani gave the present to Dina”, despite their different word-ordering.

NP objects in Hebrew are marked for accusativity (using the marker et) if they are also marked for definiteness (indicated by the prefix ha). So, in contrast with (2a)-(2b), the indefinite object renders (2c) un-grammatical, and the missing accusativity renders (2d) awkward. The fact that marking NP objects involves the joint contribution of multiple surface elements (et, ha) contributing features to the NP constituent is referred to as extended exponence (Matthews, 1993, p. 182).

The native representation of clause-level categories in the Treebank employs flat structures. This choice was made due to the lack of empirical evidence in Hebrew for grouping freely positioned syntactic elements to form a constituent.3","In order to compensate for the ambiguity in the interpreta-tion of flat structures, additional information such as morphological marking and grammatical function labels is added to the phrase-structure trees. 3.1 The State-Splits Approach The simplest way to encode grammatical functions information on top of the phrase-structure representation in the treebank is by decorating non-terminal nodes with morphological or functional features, similarly to the rich representation format of syntactic categories in GPSG. This is the approach taken by the annotators of the Hebrew treebank in which information about morphological marking appears at multiple levels of constituency (Guthmann et al., 2009), and functional features (such as subject, object, etc.) decorate phrase-level constituent labels (Sima’an et al., 2001). The S-level representation of our example sentences (3a)–(3b) then would be as we depict in figure 1, which can be read off as feature-rich","3","Such clauses are defined formally as exocentric in formal theories of syntax, and are used to describe syntactic structures in, e.g., Tagalog, Hungarian and Warlpiri (Bresnan, 2001, page 110). This flat representation format is characteristic of treebanks for other languages with relatively-free word-order as well, such as German (cf. (Kubler, 2008)). PCFG productions. We refer to this approach as the State-Splits (SP) approach, which serves as the baseline for the rest of our investigation. 3.2 The Head-Driven Approach Following the linguistic wisdom that the internal organization of syntactic constituents revolves around their heads, Head-Driven (HD) models have been proposed by (Magerman, 1995; Charniak, 1997; Collins, 1999). In a generative HD model, the head daughter is generated first, conditioned on properties of the mother node. Then, sisters of the head daughter are generated conditioned on the head, typically by left and right generation processes. Overall, HD processes have the modeling advantage that they capture structurally-marked positions that characterize the argument structure of the sentence. The simplest possible process uses unigram probabilities, but (Klein and Manning, 2003) show that using vertical and horizontal Markovization improves parsing accuracy.4","An unlexicalized generative HD model will generate our two example sentences as we illustrate in figure 2. The generation of the context-free events in figure 1 is then broken down to seven different context-free parameters each, encoding head-parent and head-sister structural relationships — the latter mediated with a structurally-marked delta function (∆i). The rich morphological representation of phrase-level NP objects (+def/acc), for instance, is conditioned on the head sister, its direction, and the distance from the head (check, e.g., nodes ∆L1 , ∆R2 ). 3.3 The Relational-Realizational Approach The Relational-Realizational (RR) parsing model of (Tsarfaty and Sima’an, 2008) similarly decomposes the generation of the context-free events in figure 1 into multiple independent parameters, but does so in a conceptually different way. Instead of decomposing a context-free event to head and sisters, the RR model is best viewed as a generative grammar that decomposes it to form and function.","The RR grammar first generates a set of grammatical functions depicting the Relational Net-work (RN) (Perlmutter, 1982) of the clause. This","4","The success of Head-Driven models (Charniak, 1997; Collins, 2003) was initially attributed to the fact that they were fully lexicalized, but (Klein and Manning, 2003) show that an unlexicalized model combining Head-Driven Markovian processes with linguistically motivated state-splits can approach the performance of fully lexicalized models. 844 (3a) S NP-SBJ Dani VP-PRD natan gave","ADVP","etmol","yesterday NP+D+ACC-OBJ et-hamatana the-present PP-COM","le-dina","to-Dina (3b) S","NP+D+ACC-OBJ et-ha-matana the-present VP-PRD","natan","gave ADVP etmol yesterday NP-SBJ Dani Dani PP-COM le-dina to-Dina Figure 1: The State-Splits Approach for Ex.

Then an ordering of the grammatical relations is generated, includ-ing reserved contextual slots for adjunction and/or punctuation marks. This is called the configuration phase. Finally, each of the grammatical function labels and adjunction slots gets realized as a morphosyntactic representation (a category label plus dominated morphological features) of the respective daughter constituent. This is called the realization phase.6","Figure 3 shows the generation of sentences (3a)–(3b) following the projection, configuration and realization phases corresponding to the top-down context-free layers of the tree. In both cases, the same relational network is generated, capturing the fact that they have the same argument structure. Then the different orderings of the grammatical elements are generated, reserving an adjunction slot for sentential modification (labeled by short context). Interestingly, the HD/RR models for our sentences are of comparable size (seven parameters) but the parameter types encode radically different notions. Illustrative of the difference is the realization of a morphologically marked NP object. In the RR model this is conditioned on a grammatical relation (check, for instance, node OBJ@S) and in the HD model it is conditioned on linear ordering or configurational notions such as left, right and distance."]},{"title":"4 ExperimentsGoal","paragraphs":["We set out to compare the performance of the different modeling approaches for parsing Modern Hebrew.

Evaluation We use standard Parseval measures calculated for the original, flat, canonical representation of the parse trees.10","We report Precision/Recall for the coarse-grained non-terminal categories. In addition to overall Parseval scores we report the accuracy results Per Syntactic Category. We further report model size in terms of the number of parameters. As is well known in Machine Learning, models with more parameters require more data to learn, and are more vulnerable to sparseness.

For all models, we experiment with grandparent encoding. For non-HD models, we also examine the utility of a head-category split.11","9","This setup is more difficult than, e.g., the Arabic parsing setup of (Bikel, 2002), as they assume gold-standard pos-tags as input. Yet it is easier than the setup of (Tsarfaty, 2006; Goldberg and Tsarfaty, 2008) which uses unsegmented surface forms as input. The decision to use segmented and untagged forms was made to retain a realistic scenario. Morphological analysis is known to be ambiguous, and we do not assume that morphological features are known up front. Morphological segmentation is also ambiguous, but for our purposes it is unavoidable. When comparing different models on an individual sentence they may propose segmentation to sequences of different lengths, for which accuracy results cannot be faithfully compared. See (Tsarfaty, 2006) for discussion.","10","The flat canonical representation also allows for a fair comparison that is not biased by the differing branching factors of the different models.","11","In HD models, a head-tag is already assumed in the conditioning context for sister nodes (Klein and Manning, 2003). 846 SP-PCFG Grand-Parent − − + + Head-Tag − + − + Prec/Rec 70.05/72.40 71.14/72.03 74.66/74.35 71.99/72.17 (#Params) (4995) (8366) (7385) (11633) HD-PCFG Grand-Parent − − + + Markov 0 1 0 1 Prec/Rec 66.87/71.64 70.40/74.35 73.04/71.94 73.52/74.84 (#Params) (6678) (10015) (19066) (21399) RR-PCFG Grand-Parent − − + + Head Tag − + − + Prec/Rec 69.90/73.96 72.96/75.73 74.19/75.03 76.32/76.51 (#Params) (3791) (7546) (7611) (13618) Table 4: The Performance of Different Models in Parsing Hebrew: Parsing Results Prec/Recall for Sentences of Length ≤ 40.","For all models, grandparent encoding is helpful. For HD models, a higher Markovian order improves performance. This shows that even in Hebrew there are linear-precedence tendencies that help steer the disambiguation in the right direction, which is in line with our observation that word-order patterns in Modern Hebrew are not completely free (cf. table 1).","The best SP model performs equally or better than all HD models. This might be due to the smaller size of SP grammars, resulting in more robust estimates. But it is remarkable that, given the feature-rich representation, such a simple treebank grammar provides better disambiguation capacity than linguistically articulated HD models. We at-tribute this to the fact that parent-daughter relations have a stronger association with grammatical functions than relations between neighbouring nodes. For Hebrew, such adjacency relations may be arbitrary due to word-order variability.","Overall, RR models show the best performance for the set of all models with parent encoding, and for the set of all models without. Our best RR model shows 6.6%/8.4% Prec/Rec error reduction from the best SP model. The Recall improvement shows that the RR model is much better in generalizing, recovering successfully more of the constituents found in the gold representation. The best RR model also outperforms HD models with 8.7%/6.7% Prec/Rec error reduction from the best In our SP or RR models, head-information is used as yet another feature-value pair rather than an object with a distinguished status during generation.

HD model. The resulting precision improvement of the RR relative to HD is larger than the improvement relative to SP, and the Recall improvement pattern is reversed. So it seems that the HD model generalizes better than the SP model, but also gets generalizations wrong more often than the SP model.","The RR model combines the generalization advantage of breaking down context-free events while it maintains the coherence advantage of learning flat trees (cf. (Johnson, 1998)). The best RR model obtains the best performance among all models: F176.41. To put this result in context, for the setting in which the Arabic parser of (Maamouri et al., 2008) obtains F178.1, — i.e., with gold standard feature-rich tags — the best RR model obtains F183.3 accuracy which is the best parsing result reported for a Semitic language so far. RR models also have the advantage of resulting in more compact grammars, which makes learning and parsing with them much more computationally efficient. 5.2 Per-Category Break-Down Analysis To understand better the merits of the different models we conducted a break-down analysis of performance-per-category for the best performing models of each kind. The break-down results are shown in table 5. We divided the table into three sets of categories: those for which the RR model gave the best performance, those for which the SP model gave the best performance, and those for which there is no clear trend.","The most striking outcome is that the RR model identifies at higher accuracy precisely those syntactic elements that are freely positioned with re-847 spect to the head: NPs, PPs, ADVPs and SBARs. Adjectives, in contrast, have clear ordering constraints — they always appear after the noun. S level elements, when embedded, always appear immediately after a conjunction or a relativizer. In particular, NPs and PPs realize arguments and adjuncts that may occupy different positions relative to the head. The RR model is better than the other models in identifying those elements partly because morphological information helps to disambiguate syntactically relevant chunks and make correct attachment decisions about them.","Remarkably, predicative (verb-less) phrases (PREDP), which are characteristic of Semitic languages, are hard to parse, but here too the RR does slightly better than the other two, as it allows for variability in the means to realize a (verbal or verb-less) predicate. Both RR and HD models outperform SP for VPs, which is due to the specific nature of VPs in the MHTB – they exist only for complement phrases with strict linear ordering."]},{"title":"6 Distances, Functions andSubcategorization Frames","paragraphs":["Markovian processes to the left and to the right of the head provide a first approximation of the predicate’s argument structure, as they capture trends in the co-occurrences of constituents reflected in their pattern of positioning and adjacency.

Each of the two trees consists of an event realizing an “object”, one for an NP to the right of the head, and the other for an NP to its left. In both cases, an object constituent will be generated jointly with the morphological features associated with it.

What seems to be still standing in the way of getting useful disambiguation cues for HD models is the fact that the left and right direction of realization is hard-wired in their representation. This breaks down a coherent distribution over morphosyntactic representations realizing grammatical relations to arbitrary position-dependent fragments, which results in larger grammars and inferior performance.14","13","The startegy of adding grammatical functions as state-splits is used in, e.g., German (Rafferty and Manning, 2008).","14","Due to the difference in the size of the grammars, one could argue that smoothing will bridge the gap between the HD and RR modeling strategies. However, the better size/accuracy trade-off shown here for RR models suggests that they provide a good bias/variance balancing point, especially for feature-rich models characterizing morphologi-"]},{"title":"7 A Typological Detour","paragraphs":["Hebrew, Arabic and other Semitic Languages are known to be substantially different from English in that English is strongly configurational. In configurational languages word-order is fixed, and information about the grammatical functions of constituents (e.g., subject or object) is often cor-related with structurally-marked positions inside highly-nested constituency structures. Nonconfigurational languages (Hale, 1983), in contrast, allow for freedom in their word-ordering and information about grammatical relations between constituents is often marked by means of morphology.","Configurationality is hardly a clear-cut notion. The difference in the configurationality level of different languages is often conceived as depicted in figure 7. In linguistic typology, the branch of linguistics that studies the differences between languages (Song, 2001), the division of labor between linear ordering and morphological marking in the realization of grammatical relations is often viewed as a continuum. Common wisdom has it that the lower a language is on the configurationality scale, the more morphological marking we expect to be used (Bresnan, 2001, page 6).","For a statistical parser to cope with nonconfigurational phenomena as observed in, for instance, Hebrew or German, it should allow for flexibility in the form of realization of the grammatical functions within the phrase-structure representation of trees. Recent morphological theories employ Form-Function separation as a widelyaccepted practice for enhancing the adequacy of models describing variability in the realization of grammatical properties. Our results suggest that the adequacy of syntactic processing models is related to such typological insights as well, and is enhanced by adopting a similar form-function separation for expressing grammatical relations. cally rich languages. A promising strategy then would be to smooth or split-and-merge (Petrov et al., 2006)) RR-based models rather than to add an elaborate smoothing component to configurationally-based HD models. 849 configurational —————– nonconfigurational Chinese>English>{German,Hebrew}>Warlpiri Figure 5: The Configurationality Scale","The HD assumptions take the function of a constituent to be transparently related to its formal position, which entails word-order rigidity. Such transparent relations between configurational positions and grammatical functions are assumed by other kinds of parsing frameworks such as the ‘all-subtrees’ approach of Data-Oriented Parsing, and the distinction between left and right application in CCG-based parsers.","The RR modeling strategy stipulates a strict separation between form — parametrizing explicitly basic word-order (Greenberg, 1963) and morphological realization (Greenberg, 1954) — and function — parametrizing relational networks borrowed from (Perlmutter, 1982) — which makes it possible to statistically learn complex form-function mapping reflected in the data. This is an adequate means to capture, e.g., morphosyntactic interactions, which characterize the less-configurational languages on the scale."]},{"title":"8 Conclusion","paragraphs":["In our comparison of the HD and RR modeling approaches, the RR approach is shown to be empirically superior and typologically more adequate for parsing a language exhibiting word-order variation interleaved with extended morphology. HD models are less accurate and more vulnerable to sparseness as they assume transparent mappings between form and function, based on left and right decompositions hard-wired in the HD representation. RR models, in contrast, employ form and function separation which allows the statistical model to learn complex correspondance patterns reflected in the data. In the future we plan to in-vestigate how the different models fare against one another in parsing different languages. In particular we wish to examine whether parsing different languages should be pursued by different models, or whether the RR strategy can effectively cope with different languages types. Finally, we wish to explore the implications of RR modeling for applications that consider the form of expression in multiple languages, for instance Statistical Machine Translation (SMT)."]},{"title":"9 Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["We thank Jelle Zuidema, Inbal Tsarfati, David McCloskey and Yoav Golderg for excellent comments on earlier versions.
