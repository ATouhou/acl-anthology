We apply unsupervised topic modeling to the ACL Anthology to analyze historical trends in the field of Computational Linguistics from 1978 to 2006. We induce topic clusters using Latent Dirichlet Allocation, and examine the strength of each topic over time. Our methods find trends in the field including the rise of probabilistic methods starting in 1988, a steady increase in applications, and a sharp decline of research in semantics and understanding between 1978 and 2001, possibly rising again after 2001. We also introduce a model of the diversity of ideas, topic entropy, using it to show that COLING is a more diverse conference than ACL, but that both conferences as well as EMNLP are becoming broader over time. Finally, we apply Jensen-Shannon divergence of topic distributions to show that all three conferences are converging in the topics they cover."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["How can we identify and study the exploration of ideas in a scientific field over time, noting periods of gradual development, major ruptures, and the wax-ing and waning of both topic areas and connections with applied topics and nearby fields? One important method is to make use of citation graphs (Garfield, 1955). This enables the use of graph-based algorithms like PageRank for determining researcher or paper centrality, and examining whether their influence grows or diminishes over time.","However, because we are particularly interested in the change of ideas in a field over time, we have chosen a different method, following Kuhn (1962). In Kuhn’s model of scientific change, science proceeds by shifting from one paradigm to another. Because researchers’ ideas and vocabulary are constrained by their paradigm, successive incommensurate paradigms will naturally have different vocabulary and framing.","Kuhn’s model is intended to apply only to very large shifts in scientific thought rather than at the micro level of trends in research foci. Nonetheless, we propose to apply Kuhn’s insight that vocabulary and vocabulary shift is a crucial indicator of ideas and shifts in ideas. Our operationalization of this insight is based on the unsupervised topic model Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA; Blei et al. (2003)).","For many fields, doing this kind of historical study would be very difficult. Computational linguistics has an advantage, however: the ACL Anthology, a public repository of all papers in the Computational Linguistics journal and the conferences and workshops associated with the ACL, COLING, EMNLP, and so on. The ACL Anthology (Bird, 2008), and comprises over 14,000 documents from conferences and the journal, beginning as early as 1965 through 2008, indexed by conference and year. This resource has already been the basis of citation analysis work, for example, in the ACL Anthology Network of Joseph and Radev (2007). We apply LDA to the text of the papers in the ACL Anthology to induce topics, and use the trends in these topics over time and over conference venues to address questions about the development of the field. 363 Venue # Papers Years Frequency Journal 1291 1974–Present Quarterly","ACL 2037 1979-Present Yearly EACL 596 1983–Present ∼2 Years NAACL 293 2000–Present ∼Yearly","Applied NLP 346 1983–2000 ∼3 Years","COLING 2092 1965-Present 2 Years","HLT 957 1986–Present ∼2 Years","Workshops 2756 1990-Present Yearly TINLAP 128 1975–1987 Rarely MUC 160 1991–1998 ∼2 Years IJCNLP 143 2005 —— Other 120 —— —— Table 1: Data in the ACL Anthology","Despite the relative youth of our field, computational linguistics has witnessed a number of research trends and shifts in focus. While some trends are obvious (such as the rise in machine learning methods), others may be more subtle. Has the field got-ten more theoretical over the years or has there been an increase in applications? What topics have declined over the years, and which ones have remained roughly constant? How have fields like Dialogue or Machine Translation changed over the years? Are there differences among the conferences, for example between COLING and ACL, in their interests and breadth of focus? As our field matures, it is important to go beyond anecdotal description to give grounded answers to these questions. Such answers could also help give formal metrics to model the differences between the many conferences and venues in our field, which could influence how we think about reviewing, about choosing conference topics, and about long range planning in our field."]},{"title":"2 Methodology 2.1 Data","paragraphs":["The analyses in this paper are based on a text-only version of the Anthology that comprises some 12,500 papers. The distribution of the Anthology data is shown in Table 1. 2.2 Topic Modeling Our experiments employ Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA; Blei et al. (2003)), a generative latent variable model that treats documents as bags of words generated by one or more topics. Each document is characterized by a multinomial distribution over topics, and each topic is in turn characterized by a multinomial distribution over words. We perform parameter estimation using collapsed Gibbs sampling (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004).","Possible extensions to this model would be to in-tegrate topic modelling with citations (e.g., Dietz et al. (2007), Mann et al. (2006), and Jo et al. (2007)). Another option is the use of more fine-grained or hierarchical model (e.g., Blei et al. (2004), and Li and McCallum (2006)).","All our studies measure change in various as-pects of the ACL Anthology over time. LDA, however, does not explicitly model temporal relationships. One way to model temporal relationships is to employ an extension to LDA. The Dynamic Topic Model (Blei and Lafferty, 2006), for example, represents each year’s documents as generated from a normal distribution centroid over topics, with the following year’s centroid generated from the preceding year’s. The Topics over Time Model (Wang and McCallum, 2006) assumes that each document chooses its own time stamp based on a topic-specific beta distribution.","Both of these models, however, impose constraints on the time periods. The Dynamic Topic Model penalizes large changes from year to year while the beta distributions in Topics over Time are relatively inflexible. We chose instead to perform post hoc calculations based on the observed probability of each topic given the current year. We define p̂(z|y) as the empirical probability that an arbitrary paper d written in year y was about topic z: p̂(z|y) = ∑ d:td=y p̂(z|d)p̂(d|y) = 1 C ∑ d:td=y p̂(z|d) = 1 C ∑ d:td=y ∑ z′ i∈d","I(z′ i = z) (1) where I is the indicator function, td is the date document d was written, p̂(d|y) is set to a constant 1/C."]},{"title":"3 Summary of Topics","paragraphs":["We first ran LDA with 100 topics, and took 36 that we found to be relevant.

First, not surprisingly, we note that the vast majority (9 of 10) of the papers appeared in conference proceedings rather than the journal, confirming that in general new ideas appear in conferences. Second, of the 9 conference papers, most of them appeared in the COLING conference (5) or the ANLP workshop (3) compared to only 1 in the ACL conference. This suggests that COLING may have been more receptive than ACL to new ideas at the time, a point we return to in Section 6. Finally, we examined the background of the authors of these papers. Six of the 10 papers either focus on speech (C88-1010, A88-1028, C88-1071) or were written by authors who had previously published on speech recognition topics, including the influential IBM (Brown et al.) and AT&T (Church) labs (C88-1016, A88-1005, A88-1019). Speech recognition is historically an electrical engineering field which made quite early use of probabilistic and statistical methodologies. This suggests that researchers work-ing on spoken language processing were an important conduit for the borrowing of statistical method-ologies into computational linguistics. 4.2 Topics That Have Declined Figure 2 shows several topics that were more prominent at the beginning of the ACL but which have shown the most precipitous decline.

To see if this was in fact the case we created a metatopic called semantics in which we combined various semantics topics (not including pragmatic topics like anaphora resolution or discourse coherence) including: lexical semantics, conceptual semantics/story 367 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 Semantics Figure 3: Semantics over time understanding, computational semantics, WordNet, word sense disambiguation, semantic role labeling, RTE and paraphrase, MUC information extraction, and events/temporal. We then plotted p̂(z ∈ S|y), the sum of the proportions per year for these topics, as shown in Figure 3. The steep decrease in semantics is readily apparent. The last few years has shown a levelling off of the decline, and possibly a revival of this topic; this possibility will need to be confirmed as we add data from 2007 and 2008.","We next chose two fields, Dialogue and Machine Translation, in which it seemed to us that the topics discovered by LDA suggested a shift in paradigms in these fields. Figure 4 shows the shift in translation, while Figure 5 shows the change in dialogue.","The shift toward statistical machine translation is well known, at least anecdotally. The shift in dialogue seems to be a move toward more applied, speech-oriented, or commercial dialogue systems and away from more theoretical models.","Finally, Figure 6 shows the history of several topics that peaked at intermediate points throughout the history of the field. We can see the peak of unification around 1990, of syntactic structure around 1985 of automata in 1985 and again in 1997, and of word sense disambiguation around 1998."]},{"title":"5 Is Computational Linguistics Becoming More Applied?","paragraphs":["We don’t know whether our field is becoming more applied, or whether perhaps there is a trend to-wards new but unapplied theories.

Traditionally, COLING was larger, with parallel sessions and presumably a wide variety of topics, while ACL had single sessions and a more narrow scope. In recent years, however, ACL has moved to parallel sessions, and the conferences are of similar size. Has the distinction in breadth of topics also been blurred? What are the differences and similarities in topics and trends between these two conferences?","More recently, the EMNLP conference grew out of the Workshop on Very Large Corpora, sponsored by the Special Interest Group on Linguistic Data and corpus-based approaches to NLP (SIGDAT). EMNLP started as a much smaller and narrower 369 conference but more recently, while still smaller than both COLING and ACL, it has grown large enough to be considered with them. How does the breadth of its topics compare with the others?","Our hypothesis, based on our intuitions as conference attendees, is that ACL is still more narrow in scope than COLING, but has broadened considerably. Similarly, our hypothesis is that EMNLP has begun to broaden considerably as well, although not to the extent of the other two.","In addition, we’re interested in whether the topics of these conferences are converging or not. Are the probabilistic and machine learning trends that are dominant in ACL becoming dominant in COLING as well? Is EMNLP adopting some of the topics that are popular at COLING?","To investigate both of these questions, we need a model of the topic distribution for each conference. We define the empirical distribution of a topic z at a conference c, denoted by p̂(z|c) by: p̂(z|c) = ∑ d:cd=c p̂(z|d)p̂(d|c) = 1 C ∑ d:cd=c p̂(z|d) = 1 C ∑ d:cd=c ∑ z′ i∈d","I(z′ i = z) (2) We also condition on the year for each conference, giving us p̂(z|y, c).","We propose to measure the breadth of a conference by using what we call topic entropy: the conditional entropy of this conference topic distribution. Entropy measures the average amount of information expressed by each assignment to a random variable. If a conference has higher topic entropy, then it more evenly divides its probability mass across the generated topics. If it has lower, it has a far more narrow focus on just a couple of topics. We therefore measured topic entropy: H(z|c, y) = − K ∑ i=1 p̂(zi|c, y) log p̂(zi|c, y) (3)","Figure 10 shows the conditional topic entropy of each conference over time.

As expected, COLING has been historically the broadest of the three conferences, though perhaps slightly less so in recent years. ACL started with a fairly narrow focus, but became nearly as broad as COLING during the 1990’s. However, in the past 8 years it has become more narrow again, with a steeper decline in breadth than COLING. EMNLP, true to its status as a “Special Interest” conference, began as a very narrowly focused conference, but now it seems to be catching up to at least ACL in terms of the breadth of its focus.","Since the three major conferences seem to be converging in terms of breadth, we investigated whether or not the topic distributions of the conferences were also converging. To do this, we plotted the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence between each pair of conferences. The Jensen-Shannon divergence is a symmetric measure of the similarity of two pairs of distributions. The measure is 0 only for identical distributions and approaches infinity as the two differ more and more. Formally, it is defined as the average of the KL divergence of each distribution to the average of the two distributions: DJS(P ||Q) = 1 2 DKL(P ||R) + 1 2 DKL(Q||R) R = 1 2 (P + Q) (4)","Figure 11 shows the JS divergence between each pair of conferences over time.

We also showed a convergence over time in topic coverage of ACL, COLING, and EMNLP as well an expansion of topic diversity.
