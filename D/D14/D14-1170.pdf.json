An author often needs to help readers to understand the context of his or her research problem and compare his or her current work with previous works. A related work section is often used for this purpose to show the differences and advantages of his or her work, compared with related research works. In this study, we attempt to automatically generate a related work section for a target academic paper with its reference papers. This kind of related work sections can be used as a basis to reduce the author’s time and effort when he or she wants to complete his or her final related work section.","Automatic related work section generation is a very challenging task. It can be considered a topic-biased, multiple-document summarization problem. The input is a target academic paper, which has no related work section, along with its reference papers. The goal is to create a related work section that describes the related works and addresses the relationship between the target paper and the reference papers. Here we assume that the set of reference papers has been given as part of the input. Existing works in the NLP and recommendation systems communities have already focused on the task of finding reference papers. For example, citation prediction (Nallapati et al., 2008) aims at finding individual paper citation patterns.","Generally speaking, automatic related work section generation is a strikingly different problem and it is much more difficult in comparison with general multi-document summarization tasks. For example, multi-document summarization of news articles aims at synthesizing contents of similar news and removing the redundant information contained by the different news articles. However, each scientific paper has much specific content to state its own work and contribution. Even for the papers that investigate the same research topic, their contributions and contents can be totally different. The related work section generation task needs to find the specific contributions of individual papers and arrange them into one or several paragraphs.","In this study, we focus on the problem of automatic related work section generation and propose a novel system called ARWG to address the 1624 problem. For the target paper, we assume that the abstract and introduction sections have already been written by the author and they can be used to help generate the related work section. For the reference papers, we only consider and extract the abstract, introduction, related work and conclusion sections, because other sections like the method and evaluation sections always describe the extreme details of the specific work and they are not suitable for this task. Then we generate the related work section using both sentence sets which are extracted from the target paper and reference papers, respectively.","Firstly, we use a PLSA model to group both sentence sets of the target paper and its reference papers into different topic-biased clusters. Secondly, the importance of each sentence in the target paper and the reference papers is learned by using two different Support Vector Regression (SVR) models. At last, a global optimization framework is proposed to generate the related work section by selecting sentences from both the target paper and the reference papers. Mean-while, the framework selects sentences from different topic-biased clusters globally.","Experimental results on a test set of 150 target papers show our method can generate related work sections with better quality than those of several baseline methods. With the ROUGE toolkit, the results indicate the related work sections generated by our system can get higher ROUGE scores. Moreover, our related work sections can get higher rating scores based on a user study. Therefore, our related work sections can be much more suitable for the authors to prepare their final related work sections."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["There are few studies to directly address automatic related work generation. Hoang and Kan (2010) proposed a related work summarization system given the set of keywords arranged in a hierarchical fashion that describes the paper’s topic. They used two different rule-based strategies to extract sentences for general topics as well as detailed ones.","A few studies focus on multi-document scientific article summarization. Agarwal et al., (2011) introduced an unsupervised approach to the problem of multi-document summarization. The input is a list of papers cited together within the same source article. The key point of this approach is a topic based clustering of fragments extracted from each co-cited article. They rank all the clusters using a query generated from the context surrounding the co-cited list of papers. Yeloglu et al., (2011) compared four different approaches for multi-document scientific articles summarization: MEAD, MEAD with corpus specific vocabulary, LexRank and W3SS.","Other studies investigate mainly on the single-document scientific article summarization. Early works including (Luhn 1958; Baxendale 1958; Edumundson 1969) tried to use various features specific to scientific text (e.g., sentence position, or rhetorical clues features). They have proved that these features are effective for the scientific article summarization. Citation information has been already shown effective in summarize the scientific articles. Works including (Mei and Zhai 2008; Qazvinian and Radev 2008; Schwartz and Hearst 2006; Mohammad et al., 2009) employed citation information for the single scientific article summarization. Earlier work (Nakov et al., 2004) indicated that citation sentences may contain important concepts that can give useful descriptions of a paper.","Various methods have been proposed for news document summarization, including rule-based methods (Barzilay and Elhadad 1997; Marcu and Daniel 1997), graph-based methods (Mani and Bloedorn 2000; Erkan and Radev 2004; Michalcea and Tarau 2005), learning-based methods (Conroy et al., 2001; Shen et al., 2007; Ouyang et al., 2007; Galanis et al., 2008), optimization-based methods (McDonald 2007; Gillick et al., 2009; Xie et al., 2009; Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2011; Lei Huang et al., 2011; Woodsend et al., 2012; Galanis 2012), etc.","The most relevant work is (Hoang and Kan, 2010) as mentioned above. They also assumed the set of reference papers was given as part of the input. They also adopt the hierarchical topic tree that describes the topic structure in the target paper as an essential input for their system. However, it is non-trivial to build the hierarchical topic tree. Moreover, they do not consider the content of the target paper to construct the related work section, which is actually crucial in the related work section. To the best of our knowledge, no previous works have used supervised learning and optimization framework to deal with the multiple scientific article summarization tasks."]},{"title":"3 Problem Analysis and Corpus 3.1 Problem Analysis","paragraphs":["1625 We firstly analyze the structure of related work sections briefly. By using examples for illustra-tion, we can gain insight on how to generate related work sections. A specific related work example is shown in Figure 1.","This related work section introduces previous related works for a paper on Automatic Taxonomy Induction. From Figure 1, we can have a glance at the structure of related work sections. Related work sections usually discuss several different topics, such as “ pattern-based” and “cluster-based” approaches shown in the Figure 1. Besides the knowledge of previous works, the author often compares his own work with the previous works. The differences and advantages are generally mentioned. The example in Figure 1 also indicates this phenomenon.","Therefore, we design our system to generate related work sections according to the related work section structure mentioned above. Our system takes the target paper for which a related work section needs to be drafted besides its reference papers as input. The goal of our system is to generate a related work section with the above structure. The generated related work section should have several topic-biased parts. The author's own work is also needed to be described and its difference with other works is needed to be emphasized on. 3.2 Corpus and Preprocessing We build a corpus that contains academic papers and their corresponding reference papers. The academic papers are selected from the ACL Anthology 1",". The ACL Anthology currently hosts"]},{"title":"","paragraphs":["1 http://aclweb.org/anthology/ over 24,500 papers from major conferences such as ACL, EMNLP, COLING in the fields of computational linguistics and natural language processing. We remove the papers that contain related work sections with very short length, and randomly select 1050 target papers to construct our whole corpus.","The papers are all in PDF format. We extract their texts by using PDFlib 2","and detect their physical structures of paragraphs, subsections and sections by using ParsCit 3",". For the target papers, the related work sections are directly extracted as the gold summaries. The references are also extracted. For the references that can be found in the ACL Anthology, we download them from the ACL Anthology. The other reference papers are searched and downloaded by using Google Scholar. References to books and PhD theses are discarded, for their verbosity may change the problem drastically (Mihalcea and Ceylan, 2007).","The input of our system includes the abstract and introduction sections of the target paper, and the abstract, introduction, related work and conclusion sections of the reference papers. As mentioned above, the method and evaluation sections in the reference papers are not used as input because these sections usually describe extreme details of the methods and evaluation results and they are not suitable for related work generation. Note that it is reasonable to make use of the abstract and introduction sections of the target paper to help generate the related work section, because an author usually has already written the abstract and introduction sections before he or she wants to write the related work section for the target paper. Otherwise, we cannot get any information about the author’s own work. All other sections in the target paper are not used."]},{"title":"4 Our Proposed System 4.1 Overview","paragraphs":["In this paper, we propose a system called ARWG to automatically generate a related work section for a given target paper.

As we mentioned earlier, two main approaches are pattern-based and clustering-based. Pattern-based approaches are the main trend for automatic taxonomy induction. ... Pattern-based approaches started from and still pay a great deal of attention to the most common is-a relations. ... Clustering-based approaches usually represent word contexts as vectors and cluster words based on similarities of the vectors (Brown et al., 1992; Lin, 1998). ... Many clustering-based approaches face the challenge of appropriately labeling non-leaf clusters. ... In this paper, we take an incremental clustering approach,... The advantage of the incremental approach is that it eliminates the trouble of inventing cluster labels and concentrates on placing terms in the correct positions in a taxonomy hierarchy. The work by Snow et al. (2006) is the most similar to ours ... Moreover, our approach employs heterogeneous features from a wide range; while their approach only used syntactic dependency.","Two different topics Comparison with the author’s work 1626 ly. The importance scores for sentences in the target paper and the reference papers are as-signed by using two SVR based sentence scoring models. The two SVR models are trained for sentences in the target paper and the reference papers, respectively. Meanwhile, a topic model is applied to the whole set of sentences in both the target paper and reference papers. The sentences are grouped into several different topic-biased clusters. The sentences with importance scores and topic cluster information are taken as the input for the global optimization framework. The optimization framework extracts sentences to describe both the author’s own work and background knowledge. More details of each part will be discussed in the following sections. 4.2 Topic Model Learning As mentioned in the previous section, the related work section usually addresses several different topics. The topics may be different research themes or different aspects of a broad research theme. The related work section should describe the specific details for each topic, respectively.","Therefore, we aim to discover the hidden topics of the input papers, and we use the Probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) (Hofmann, 1999) to solve this problem.","The PLSA approach models each word in a document as a sample from a mixture model. The mixture components are multinomial random variables that can be viewed as representa-tions of “topics”. Different words in a document may be generated from different topics. Each document is represented a list of mixing propor-tions for these mixture components and can be reduced to a probability distribution on a fixed set of topics.","Considering that the sentences in one paper may relate to different topics, we treat each sentence as a “document” d. We treat the noun phases in the sentences as the “words” w. In order to extract the noun phrases, chunking implemented by the OpenNLP toolkit 4","is applied to the sentences. Noun phrases that contain words such as “paper” and “data” are discarded.","Then the sentences with their corresponding noun phrases are taken as input into the PLSA model. Here both the sentences in the target paper and the sentences in the reference papers are treated the same in the model. Finally, we can get the sentence set with topic information and use it in the subsequent steps. Each sentence has a topic weight t in each topic. 4.3 Sentence Important Assessment In our proposed system, sentence importance assessment aims to assign an importance score to each sentence in the target paper and reference papers. The score of each sentence will be used in the subsequent optimization framework. We propose to use the support vector regression model to achieve this goal. In the above topic model learning process, we do not distinguish the sentences in the target paper and reference papers. In contrast, we train two different support vector regression models separately for the sentences in the target paper and the sentences in the reference papers. In the related work section, the sentences that describe the author’s own work usually address the differences from the related works, while the sentences that describe the related works often focus on the specific details. We think the two kinds of sentences should be treated differently. Scoring Method To construct training data based on the papers collected, we apply a similarity scoring method to assign the importance scores to the sentences in the papers. The main hypothesis is that the sentences in the gold related work sections should summarize the target paper and reference papers as well. Thus the sentences in the papers which are more similar to the sentences in the gold related work sections should be considered more important and suitable to be selected. Our scoring method should assign higher scores to them."]},{"title":"","paragraphs":["4 http://opennlp.apache.org/   Figure 2: System Architecture Target paper Reference papers Preprocessing Topic Model Sentence Score Assessment(target)","Sentence Score Assessment(reference) Optimization Framework Postprocessing","Related Work Section 1627","We define the importance score of a sentence","in the papers as below:","�����(�) = ���","�i∗","∈�∗(���(�, ��∗",")) (1) where s is a sentence in the papers, �∗","is the set of the sentences in the corresponding gold related work section. The standard cosine measure is employed as the similarity function.","Considering the difference between the sentences that describe the author’s work and the sentences that describe the related works, we split the set of sentences in the gold related work section into two parts: one discusses the author’s own work and the other introduces the related works. We observe that sentences related to the author’s own work often feature specific words or phrases (such as “we”, “our work”, “in this paper” etc.) in the related work section. So we check the sentences about whether they contain clue words or phrases (i.e., “in this paper”, “our work” and 18 other phrases). If the clue phrase check fails, the sentence belongs to the related work part. If not, it belongs the own work part.","Thus for the sentences in the target paper, �∗"," is the set of sentences in the own work part of the gold related work section, while for the sentences in the reference papers, �∗","is the set of sentences in the related work part of the gold related work section. Then we can use the scoring method to compute the target scores of the sentences in the training set. It is noteworthy that two SVR models can be trained on the two parts of the training data, respectively. Feature Each sentence is represented by a set of features. The common features used for the sentences of the target paper and reference papers are shown in Table 1. The additional features applied to the sentences of the target paper are introduced in Table 2.","Here, s is a sentence that needs to extract features. th is paper title, section headings and subsection headings set of the reference papers or target paper for the two SVR models, respectively. Each feature with “*” represent a feature set that contains similar features.","All the features are scaled into [0, 1]. Thus we can learn SVR models based on the features and importance scores of the sentences, and then use the models to predict an importance score for each sentence in the test set.

Here, we introduce a global optimization framework to generate the related work section.","According to the structure of the related work section mentioned above, the related work section usually discusses several topics. In each topic, the related works and their details are introduced. Besides, the author often compares his own work with these previous works.","Therefore, we propose to formulate the generation as an optimization problem.

In our assumption, sentences with higher importance scores are better to be selected. In addition, very short sentences should be penalized. So we introduce the first part of our objective function below:","∑ (������ ∑ �������)�","�=1��","�=1 (2)","We add the sentence length as a multiplication factor in order to penalize the very short sentences, or the objective function tends to select more and shorter sentences. At the same time, the objective function does not tend to select the very long sentences. The total length of the sentences selected is fixed. So if the objective function tends to select the longer sentences, the fewer sentences can be selected. A tradeoff needs to be made between the number and the average length of the sentences selected.","The constraints introduced below ensure that the sentence can only be selected into one topic and the topic weight is used to measure the degree that the sentence is relevant to the specific topic.","2) Second, similar to the first part, we should consider the own work part of the related work section. Thus the second part of our objective function is shown as follows:","∑ (������ ∑ �������)�","�=1��","�=1 (3)","3) At last, redundancy reduction should be considered in the objective function. The last part of the objective function is shown below:","∑ ��i��|�|","�=1 (4) The intuition is that the more unique bi-","grams the related work section contains, the","less redundancy the related work section has.","We add ��i as the weight of the bigram in or-","der to include more important bigrams.","By combing all the parts defined above, we","have the following full objective function:","max��,�� λ1 ∑ ( ��i","αL��x ��� ∑ �������)�","�=1 +��","�=1 λ2 ∑ ( ��i (1−α)L��x ��� ∑","�������)� �=1 �� �=1 + λ3 ∑ �� i�i |�∗","| |�| �=1       (5)","Subject to: ∑ ��������� �=1 + ∑ ���������","�=1 < L�, ��� � = 1, ... ,","� (6) ∑ ∑","�������� �=1 �� �=1 < αL��� (7) ∑ ∑","�������� �=1 �� �=1 < (1 − α)L��� (8)  ∑","����� �=1 ≤ 1, ��� � = 1, ... , ��    (9) ∑","����� �=1 ≤ 1, ��� � = 1, ... , ��  (10) ∑ �� �k∈�i  ≥ |��| ∑","����� �=1 , ��� � = 1, ... , �� (11) ∑ �� �k∈�i  ≥ |��| ∑","����� �=1 , ��� � = 1, ... , �� (12) ∑ ∑","����� �=1 + ∑ ∑","����� �=1 ��i∈��k ��i∈��k ≥ ��, � = 1, ... |�|      (13) ����, ����, �� ∈ {0,1} (14)","All the three parts in the objective function are normalized to [0, 1] by using the maximum length L��� and the total number of bigrams |�∗","|. λ1, λ2 and λ3 are parameters for tuning the three parts and we set λ1+λ2+λ3 = 1.","We explain the constraints as follows:","Constraint (6): It ensures that the total word count of the part of topic j does not exceed L�.","Constraints (7), (8): The two constraints try to balance the lengths of the previous works part and the own work part, respectively. α is set to 2/3.","Constraints (9), (10): These two constraints guarantee that the sentence can only be included into one topic. 1629","Constraints (11), (12): When these two constraints hold, all bigrams that �� has are selected if �� is selected.","Constraint (13): This constraint makes sure that at least one sentence in ��� or ��� is selected if bigram �� is selected.","Therefore, we transform our optimization problem into a linear programing problem. We solve this linear programming problem by using the IBM CPLEX optimizer5",". It generally takes tens of seconds to solve the problem and it is very efficient.","Finally, ARWG post-processes sentences to improve readability, including replacing agentive forms with a citation to the specific article (e.g., “our work” → “(Hoang and Kan, 2010)”) for the sentences extracted from reference papers.

All the three parts in the objective function are useful to generate related work sections with good quality.","The average scores rated by human judges for each method are showed in Table 5. We can see that the related work sections generated by our system are more related to the target papers. Moreover, because of the good structure of our generated related work sections, our generated related work sections are considered more readable and more useful for the author to prepare the final related work sections.","T-test results show that the performance improvements of our method over baselines are statistically significant on both automatic and manual evaluations. Most of p-values for t-test are far smaller than 0.01.","Overall, the results indicate that our method can generate much better related work sections 0 0.6 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0 0.3 0.6 0.9 λ 1 R O U G E - 1 λ2 ROUGE-1 0.4-0.6 0.20.4 0 0.6 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0 0.3 0.6 0.9 λ 1 R O U G E - 2 λ2 ROUGE-2 0.1-0.15 0.05-0.1 0 0.6","00.050.10.150.2 0 0.3 0.6 0.9 λ 1 R O U G E - SU4 λ2 ROUGE-SU4 0.15 -0.2 0.1-0.15 Figure 3: Parameter influences (horizontal, vertical axis are λ1, λ2 , respectively, λ3 = 1 − λ1 − λ2 ) 1631 than the baselines on both automatic and human evaluations.","Table 6 shows the comparison results between ARWG and RWGOF. We can see ARWG performs better than RWGOF. It proves that the SVR models can better estimate the importance scores of the sentences. For the SVR models are trained from the large dataset, the sentence scores predicted by the SVR models can be more reliable to be used in the global optimization framework."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion and Future Work","paragraphs":["This paper proposes a novel system called ARWG to generate related work sections for academic papers. It first exploits a PLSA model to split the sentence set of the given papers into different topic-biased parts, and then applies regression models to learn the importance scores of the sentences. At last an optimization framework is proposed to generate the related work section. Evaluation results show that our system can generate much better related work sections than the baseline methods.","In future work, we will make use of citation sentences to improve our system. Citation sentences are the sentences that contains an explicit reference to another paper and they usually highlight the most important aspects of the cited papers. So citation sentences are likely to contain important and rich information for generating related work sections."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["The work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (61170166, 61331011), Beijing Nova Program (2008B03) and National Hi-Tech Research and Development Program (863 Program) of China (2012AA011101).
