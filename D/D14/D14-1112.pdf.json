Many comparative methods have been used to establish relationships between languages, to determine language families and to reconstruct their proto-languages (Durie and Ross, 1996). If grouping of languages in linguistic families is generally accepted, the relationships between languages belonging to the same family are periodically investigated. In spite of the fact that linguistic literature abounds in claims of classification of natural languages, the degrees of similarity between languages are far from being certain. In many situations, the similarity of natural languages is a fairly vague notion, both linguists and non-linguists having intuitions about which languages are more similar to which others. McMahon and McMahon (2003) and Rama and Borin (2014) note that the computational historical linguistics did not receive much attention until the beginning of the 1990s, and argue for the necessity of development of quantitative and computational methods in this field. 1.1 Related Work According to Campbell (2003), the methods based on comparisons of cognate lists and sound correspondences are the most popular approaches employed for establishing relationships between languages. Barbanco̧n et al. (2013) emphasize the variety of computational methods used in this field, and state that the differences in datasets and approaches cause difficulties in the evaluation of the results regarding the reconstruction of the phylogenetic tree of languages. Linguistic phylogeny reconstruction proves especially useful in historical and comparative linguistics, as it enables the analysis of language evolution. Ringe et al. (2002) propose a computational method for evolutionary tree reconstruction based on a “perfect phylogeny” algorithm; using a Bayesian phylogeographic approach, Alekseyenko et al. (2012), continuing the work of Atkinson et al. (2005), model the expansion of the Indo-European language family and find support for the hypothesis which places its homeland in Anatolia; Atkinson and Gray (2006) analyze language divergence dates and argue for the usage of computational phylogenetic methods in the question of Indo-European age and origins. Using modified versions of Swadesh’s lists1",", Dyen et al. (1992) investigate the classification of Indo-European languages by applying a lexicostatistical method.","The similarity of languages is interesting not only for historical and comparative linguistics, but for machine translation and language acquisition as well. Scannell (2006) and Hajič et al. (2000) argue for the possibility of obtaining a better translation quality using simple methods for very closely related languages. Koppel and Ordan (2011) study the impact of the distance between languages on the translation product and conclude that it is directly correlated with the ability to distinguish translations from a given source language from non-translated text. Some genetically related languages are so similar to each other, that 1 http://www.wordgumbo.com/ie/cmp/iedata.txt 1047 speakers of such languages are able to communicate without prior instruction (Gooskens, 2007). Gooskens et al. (2008) analyze several phonetic and lexical predictors and their conclusion is that lexical similarity can be seen as a predictor of language intelligibility. The impact of language similarities in the process of second language acquisi-tion is argued by the contrastive analysis hypothesis, which claims that where similarities between the first and the second language occur, the acquisition would be easier compared with the situation in which there were differences between the two languages (Benati and VanPatten, 2011). 1.2 Our Approach Although there are multiple aspects that are relevant in the study of language relatedness, such as the orthographic, phonetic, syntactic and semantic differences, in this paper we focus only on the orthographic similarity. The orthographic approach relies on the idea that sound changes leave traces in the orthography, and alphabetic character correspondences represent, to a fairly large extent, sound correspondences (Delmestri and Cristianini, 2010).","In this paper we propose an orthographic similarity method focused on etymons (direct sources of the words in a foreign language) and cognates (words in different languages having the same etymology and a common ancestor). In a broadly accepted sense, the higher the similarity degree between two languages, the closer they are.","One of our motivations is that when people encounter a language for the first time in written form, it is most likely that they can distinguish and individualize words which resemble words from their native language. These words are probably either inherited from their mother tongue (etymons), or have a common ancestor with the words in their language (cognates).","Our first goal is, given a corpus C, to automatically detect etymons and cognates. In Section 2 we propose a dictionary-based approach to automatically extract related words, and a method for computing the orthographic similarity of natural languages. Most of the traditional approaches in this field focus either on etymology detection or on cognate identification, most of them reporting results only on small sets of cognate pairs (usually manually determined lists of about 200 cognates, for which the cognate judgments are made by human experts (Rama and Borin, 2014)). Our approach implies a detailed investigation which accounts not only for the number of related words, as it is usually done in lexicostatistics (where the relationships between languages are determined based on the percentage of related words), but also for their forms, quantifying orthographic similarities. We employ three string similarity metrics for a finer-grained analysis, as related words in different languages do not have identical forms and their partial similarity implies different degrees of recognition and comprehensibility. For example, the Romanian word lună (moon) is closer to its Latin etymon luna than the word bătrân (old) to its etymon veteranus, and the Romanian word vânt (wind) is closer to its French cognate pair vent than the word castel (castle) to its cognate pair château.","In this paper we investigate the orthographic similarity between Romanian and related languages. Romanian is a Romance language, belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European language family, and is of particular interest regarding its geographic setting. It is surrounded by Slavic languages and its relationship with the big Romance kernel was difficult. Besides general typological comparisons that can be made between any two or more languages, Romanian can be studied based on comparisons of genetic and geographical nature, participating in numerous areally-based similarities that define the Balkan convergence area. Joseph (1999) states that, regarding the genetic relationships, Romanian can be studied in the context of those languages most closely related to it and that the well-studied Romance languages enable comparisons that might not be possible otherwise, within less well-documented families of languages. The position of Romanian within the Romance family is controversial (McMahon and McMahon, 2003): either marginal or more integrated within the group, depending on the versions of the cognate lists that are used in the analysis.","In Section 3.1 we apply our method on Romanian in different stages of its evolution, running our experiments on high-volume corpora from three historical periods: the period approximately between 1642 and 1743, the second half of 19th century (1870 - 1889), and the present period. In Section 3.2 we make use of a fourth corpus, Europarl, with a double goal: on the one hand, to check if degrees of similarity between Romanian 1048 and other languages in the present period are consistent across two different corpora, and on the other hand, to investigate whether there are differences between the overall degrees of similarity obtained for the entire corpus and those obtained in various experiments at sentence level. The conclusions of our paper are outlined in Section 4."]},{"title":"2 Methodology and Algorithm","paragraphs":["In this section we introduce a technique for determining the orthographic similarity of languages. In order to obtain accurate results, we investigate both etymons and cognates. First, we automati-cally identify etymons and cognates, then we measure the distances between related words, and finally we compute the overall degrees of similarity between pairs of languages. We also applied this method for investigating the mutual intelligibility of the Romance languages, and preliminary results are presented in (Ciobanu and Dinu, 2014b). 2.1 Similarity Method Let C w1, w2, ..., wNwords be a corpus in L1 and let L2 be a related language. We assume, without any loss of generality, that the elements of C are ordered such that CL w1, w2, ..., wNlingua is the subset of C containing all the words that have an etymon or a cognate pair in L2. We use the following notations: Nwords is the number of token words in C, Nlingua is the number of token words in CL, λ is the empty string and xi is the etymon or cognate pair of wi in L2. Given a string distance ∆, we define the distance betweenL1 and L2 (non-metric distance), with frequency support from corpus C, as follows: ∆ L1, L2 1 Nlingua Nwords  N lingua i 1 ∆ wi, xi","Nwords (1)","Hence, the similarity between languages L1 and L2 is defined as follows: Sim L1, L2 1 ∆ L1, L2 (2) 2.2 Algorithm We present here the algorithm based on linguistic relationships detection and string similarity methods for determining the orthographic similarity between languages, with frequency support from corpora in the source language.

After a preprocessing phase, which is detailed in Subsection 2.2.1, we analyze words and begin by identifying their etymologies. 2.2.1 Preprocessing Given a corpus C, we start by preprocessing the text. Step 1. Data Cleaning. We perform basic word segmentation, using whitespace and punctuation marks as delimiters and we lower-case all words. We remove from the datasets tokens that are irrelevant for our investigation, such as dates, numbers and non-textual annotations marked by non-alphanumeric characters. Step 2. Stop Words Removal. We focus on analyzing word content and, in order to obtain relevant results, we remove stop words from the datasets. We use the lists of stop words for Romanian provided by the Apache Lucene2","text search engine library. In Table 1 we list the total number of stop words from each corpus. 2 http://lucene.apache.org 1049 Step 3. Lemmatization. We use lemmas for identifying words’ definitions in dictionaries and for computing adequate distances between words and their cognates or etymons. We use the Dexonline3","machine-readable dictionary to lemmatize Romanian words. Step 4. Diacritics Removal. Many words have undergone transformations by the augmentation of language-specific diacritics when entering a new language. From an orthographic perspective, the resemblance of words is higher between words without diacritics than between words with diacritics. For example, the orthographic distance is higher for the Romanian word amiciti̧e (friendship) and its French cognate pair amitié than for their corresponding forms without diacritics, amicitie and amitie. For this reason, in this step of our procedure we create two versions of each dataset, with and without diacritics, in order to further investigate the influence of the diacritics on the cross-language orthographic similarity. In Romanian, 5 diacritics are used today: ă, ı̂, â, s,̧ t.̧ 2.2.2 Relationships Identification Step 1. Etymology Detection. For most words, etymological dictionaries offer a unique etymology, but when more options are possible for explaining a word’s etymology (there are words whose etymology was and remains difficult to ascertain), dictionaries may provide multiple alternatives. For example, the Romanian word parlament (parliament) has a double etymology: French (with the etymon parlement) and Italian (with the etymon parlamento). We account for all the given etymological hypotheses, enabling our method to provide more accurate results.","For determining words’ etymologies we use the Dexonline machine-readable dictionary, which is an aggregation of over 30 Romanian dictionaries. By parsing its definitions, we are able to automatically extract information regarding words’ etymologies and etymons. The most frequently used pattern is shown below.","<abbr class=\"abbrev\"","title=\"limba language_name\">","language_abbreviation </abbr>","<b> origin_word </b> As an example, we provide below an excerpt","from a Dexonline entry which uses this pattern to 3 http://dexonline.ro specify the etymology of the Romanian word capitol (chapter), which has double etymology: Latin (with the etymon capitulum) and Italian (with the etymon capitolo). <b> CAPÍTOL </b> <abbr class=\"abbrev\"","title=\"limba italiana\"> it. </abbr> <b> capitolo </b> <abbr class=\"abbrev\"","title=\"limba latina\"> lat. </abbr> <b> capitulum </b> Step 2. Cognate Identification. Cognates are words in different languages having the same etymology and a common ancestor. The methods for cognate detection proposed so far are mostly based on orthographic/phonetic and semantic similarities (Kondrak, 2001; Frunza et al., 2005), but the term “cognates” is often used with a somewhat different meaning, denoting words with high orthographic/phonetic and cross-lingual meaning similarity, the condition of common etymology being left aside.

Then we translate in L’ all words without L’ etymology. We consider cognate candidates pairs formed of input words and their translations. Using electronic dictionaries, we extract etymology-related information for the translated words. To identify cognates, we compare, for each pair of candidates, the etymologies and the etymons. If they match, we identify the words as being cognates.","In our previous work (Ciobanu and Dinu, 2014a) we applied this method on a Romanian dictionary, while here we extract cognates from Romanian corpora. We identify cognate pairs between Romanian and six other languages: Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Turkish and English. We use electronic dictionaries4","to extract etymology-related information and Google Translate5","to translate Romanian words. We are restricted in our investigation by the available resources, but we plan to extend our method to other related languages as well. We selected these six languages for the following reason: the first four in our list are Romance languages, and our intuition is that there are numerous words in these languages which share a common ancestor with Romanian words. We investigate the cognate pairs for Turkish because many French words were imported in both Romanian and Turkish in the 19th","century, and we believe that accounting for Romanian-Turkish cognates would provide a more accurate result for the similarity of these lan-4 Italian: http://www.sapere.it/sapere/dizionari French: http://www.cnrtl.fr Spanish: http://lema.rae.es/drae Portuguese: http://www.infopedia.pt/lingua-portuguesa Turkish: http://www.nisanyansozluk.com English: http://www.collinsdictionary.com 5 http://translate.google.com guages. As for English, we decided to investigate the cognate pairs for this language in order to analyze to what extent the influence of English on Romanian increases across time. In Table 2 we report the number of Romanian words having an etymon or a cognate pair in the six related languages. Step 3. Evaluation. In order to evaluate our automatic method for extracting etymology-related information and for detecting related words, we excerpt a sample of 500 words for each of the considered languages (Romanian, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Turkish and English). The samples are drawn using a proportionate stratification sampling method with regard to the length of the lemmas in our datasets. We manually determine the etymologies of the words in the samples, and we compare these results with the automati-cally obtained etymologies. We compute the accuracy for etymology extraction for each language, and we obtain the following results: 95.8% accuracy for Romanian, 97.8% for Italian, 96.8% for French, 96.6% for Spanish, 97.0% for Portuguese, 96.0% for Turkish and, finally, 97.2% for English.

Their performance has been investigated and compared (Frunza et al., 2005; Rama and Borin, 2014), but a clear conclusion cannot be drawn with respect to which method is the most appropriate for a given task. We employ three metrics to determine the orthographic similarity between related words. In Subsection 3.1.2 we investigate to what extent the similarity scores computed with each of these metrics differ, and whether the differences are statistically significant. We use the following metrics: 1051","• LCSR: The longest common subsequence ratio (Melamed, 1995) is the longest common subsequence of two strings u and v divided by the length of the longer string. We subtract this value from 1, in order to obtain the distance between two words.","• EDIT: The edit distance (Levenshtein, 1965) counts the minimum number of operations (insertion, deletion and substitution) required to transform one string into another. We use a normalized version of the edit distance, dividing it by the length of the longer string. • RD:","The rank distance (Dinu and Dinu, 2005) is used to measure the similarity between two ranked lists. A ranking of a set of n objects can be represented as a permuta-tion of the integers 1, 2, ..., n. Let S be a set of ranking results, σ S. σ i represents the rank of object i in the ranking result σ. The rank distance is computed as: RD σ, τ n","i 1 σ i τ i . The ranks of the elements are assigned from bottom up, i.e. from n to 1, using the Borda count method (de Borda, 1781). The elements which do not occur in any of the rankings receive the rank 0. To extend the rank distance to strings, we index each occurrence of a given letter a with ak, where k is the number of its previous occurrences, and then apply the rank distance on the new indexed strings, which become rankings in this situation. In order to normalize it, we divide the rank distance by the maximum possible distance between two strings u and v (Dinu and Sgarro, 2006): ∆max u, v u u 1 2 v v 1 2."]},{"title":"3 Experiments and Results","paragraphs":["In this section we present the results obtained by applying our method for determining orthographic similarity on Romanian datasets.","To our knowledge, only basic lexicostatistical methods (generally based on different dictionaries or versions of the representative vocabulary of Romanian) which compute the percentage of words with a given etymology have been applied for determining the relationships between Romanian and related languages. Because of the difficulty of setting the bounds between the basic lexicon and the remaining words, Graur (1968) uses in his experiments three concentric versions of the basic Romanian lexicon. Dinu (1996) reevaluates the etymology detection for the three versions of the basic Romanian lexicon and reclassifies the lexical material. He argues against grouping to-gether all the words with Slavic origins, without differentiation between Old Slavic and languages such as Bulgarian, Russian, Ukrainian and Polish. Sala (1988) builds a version of the representative vocabulary of Romanian comprising 2588 words, which we use in our experiments as well. 3.1 Romanian Evolution We apply our similarity method on high-volume Romanian corpora from three distinct historical periods of time, with different cultural, economical, political and social contexts. In Table 1 we report statistics for these corpora and for the basic Romanian lexicon. 3.1.1 Data The first corpus consists of the transcription of the parliamentary debates held in the Romanian Parliament from 1996 to 2007 (Grozea, 2012). The second corpus consists of the publishing works of Mihai Eminescu (Eminescu, 1980 1985), the lead-ing Romanian poet. His works provide an insight-ful description of the period between 1870 and 1889, with respect to its cultural, economical, social and political aspects, including some major events in the Romanian history. Many researchers consider that Eminescu had a crucial influence on Romanian, his contribution to modern language development being highly appreciated. The third corpus dates back to the period approximately between 1642 and 1743, the beginning period of the Romanian writing. Miron Costin, Grigore Ureche and Ion Neculce are Romanian chroniclers whose main works follow one another in creat-ing one of the most detailed and valuable descriptions of Moldavia in that period, “Letopisetu̧l Ţării Moldovei”. Along with them, Dimitrie Cantermir contributed to the early development of the Romanian writing, having written what is considered to be the first attempt at a socio-political novel (“Istoria Ieroglifică”, 1703-1705). Their chronicles account for social, cultural, economical and political events with the purpose of recreating historical periods of time. We also use the basic Romanian lexicon (Sala, 1988), abbreviated RVR, for our experiments.

In Table 3 we list the output of our method for each corpus, with and without diacritics6",". We report the similarity between Romanian and related languages, provid-ing the average value of the three metrics used. In the %words column we provide, for each corpus, the percentage of words having an etymon or a cognate pair in a given language (the typical measure used in lexicostatistical comparison, i.e., the 0 distance function). The results for the Romanian datasets are plotted in Figure 4 and Figure 5. Cognate Influence. Table 3 and Figure 4 present the gain obtained by cognate analysis. Accounting for cognates leads to an increase of similarity between Romanian and Spanish and Portuguese with almost 300%, and between Romanian and Italian with almost 20%. Another spectacular increase of closeness is for Turkish, which draws closer to Romanian with more than 500% 6 The complete ranking of similarity is available online at","http://nlp.unibuc.ro/resources/rosim.pdf. by using the cognate gain. The degree of similarity is not given by the contribution of words inherited in Romanian from Turkish (about 1%), but by the pairs of shared cognates. Both Romanian and Turkish borrowed words from French massively towards the end of the 19th","century. Thus, most pairs of Romanian-Turkish cognates have common French ancestors, and words in Romanian and Turkish which resemble are actually loans from the same French words. We also notice a significant increase in similarity between Romanian and English in the modern period. This increase is natural and probably arises for the similarity between English and most of the other languages as well. We notice that this increase is due preponderantly to the cognate pairs. Most of the Romanian-English cognates have a Romance common ancestor (78.4% Latin, 4.2% French, 3.4% Italian), and 11.8% have a Greek common ancestor, counted at lemma level on the corpus comprising the parliamentary debates. Romanian Evolution. Some significant results can be observed in the evolution of Romanian: the degrees of similarity between Romanian and all the Romance languages has increased significantly from the Chronicles period until today. Besides them, German is the only language to which Romanian drew closer (a possible explanation might be the fact that, after the establishment of Germans 1053 French Latin Italian Spanish Portuguese English Provencal German Turkish Russian Catalan Greek Albanian Bulgarian Slavic Old Slavic Hungarian Ruthenian Serbian Sardinian language 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 similarity Parliament Eminescu Chronicles RVR Figure 4: Degrees of similarity for the Romanian datasets. For French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Turkish and English, the values obtained after the cognate identification phase are also plotted. in Banat and Transylvania, many German words entered the basic Romanian lexicon). On the contrary, the similarity between Romanian and almost all the Slavic languages decreased in the same period. Russian is the only Slavic language which preserved its degree of similarity with Romanian (being, in the 2000s, the only Slavic language among the top 10 most closely related languages with Romanian, on the ninth position, with a degree of similarity of less than 4%). In the 18th","and 19th","centuries, the transition to the Latin alphabet and the desire to restore Romanian’s Latin ap-Romance Germanic Slavic","Altaic Finno-Ugric language family 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 similarity Parliament Eminescu Chronicles RVR Figure 5: Degrees of similarity for the language families. Iranian and Baltic have a degree of similarity of less than 0.5. pearance contributed to the decrease of the Slavic influence (Gheti̧e, 1978). In fact, all Slavic in-fluences in the 2000s sum up to 8.9%, in contrast with Latin influences, reaching 61.8%. Greek is the only language which reaches its peak regarding the similarity with Romanian in the 19th century (due to the brief Phanariot dominance in the 19th","century). Therefore, Romanian preserved its Latin character all along, and the influence of the non-Latin languages on Romanian (overestimated in some works) was in fact not so significant. This fact supports Darwin’s theory (Darwin, 1859), which states that the genealogy of languages is consistent with the genealogy of the na-tions (analyzed based on DNA similarity). Orthographic Metrics. In order to compare the similarity scores computed with the three metrics used, we conduct hypothesis tests (Sheskin, 2003) to determine whether the differences between the results obtained with each metric are statistically significant. We extract a sample of 5,000 words and we compute the pairwise differences between the similarity scores. Using the R v3.1.0 software environment for statistical computing (R Core Team, 2014), we perform the one-way ANOVA F-test, with the null hypothesis H0: μEDIT μLCSR μRD (where μ∆ is the mean of the val-1054 ues computed with the ∆ metric) and the alternative hypothesis Ha : not all μEDIT , μLCSR, μRD are equal. Since the p-value of 2.88e-05 is much smaller than the 0.05 significance level, we have very strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the mean computed values for the three metrics are all equal. Further, we perform post-hoc comparisons applying pairwise t-tests with Bonferonni correction for the p-value, in order to analyze the differences between the metrics. For each pair of metrics, p 0.05. The differences are statistically significant, but we notice that they are small. Applying a two-sampled t-test, we obtain a [0.012, 0.015] confidence interval for the mean difference between EDIT and LCSR, [0.015, 0.018] for EDIT and RD, and [0.001, 0.003] for RD and LCSR, at 95% confidence level. More-over, computing Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient for the rankings obtained by each metric for each dataset, we observe a very high correlation between them (ρ 0.98 for each pair of variables). Thus, we conclude that reporting the average of the three metrics is relevant for our experiments, as differences are small and do not influence the ranking. 3.2 Europarl Experiments We continue our investigation regarding the similarity of natural languages with two additional experiments. First, we want to see if degrees of similarity between Romanian and other languages in the present period are consistent across two different corpora. In the second experiment we are interested to see if there are differences between the overall degrees of similarity obtained for the entire corpus (the bag-of-words model) and those obtained in various experiments at sentence level. Our main corpus is Europarl (Koehn, 2005). More specifically, we use the por-tions larger than 2KB collected between 2007 and 2011 from the Romanian subcorpus of Europarl. The corpus is tokenized and sentence-aligned in 21 languages. For preprocessing this corpus, we discard all the transcribers’ descriptions of the parliamentary sessions (such as “The President in-terrupted the speaker” or “The session was suspended at 19:30 and resumed at 21:00”). Exp. #1. In a first step, we apply the methodology described in Section 2 on the entire Europarl corpus for Romanian, using a bag-of-words model for the entire corpus, in which we account for the overall frequencies of the words. In this experiment, as in the previous ones, we cannot detect outliers, i.e., sentences which are unbalanced regarding the etymologies of the comprised words. For this reason, we conduct a second experiment which addresses this potential issue. Exp. #2. We determine sentence-level orthographic similarity and we aggregate the results to compute the average values for the related languages. In this second experiment, we apply the methodology described in Section 2 for each sentence in the Europarl corpus for Romanian. For each sentence we obtain a ranking of related languages and, in order to obtain a ranking of similarity for the entire corpus, we compute the average degrees of similarity: for each related language, we sum up the degrees of similarity for all the sentences and divide this value by the number of sentences in the corpus. Exp. #3. Because the interpretation of statistics derived from datasets that include outliers may be misleading, we compute the standard quartiles Q1, Q2 and Q3 (Sheskin, 2003) with regard to the length of the sentences. We use the interquartile range IQR Q3 Q1 to find outliers in the data. We consider outliers the observations that fall below the lower fence LF = Q1 1.5 IQR or above the upper fence U F = Q3 1.5 IQR . We apply our methodology again only for the sentences having the length in the LF, U F range.

As a last experiment, for each language L we consider as observations the degrees of similarity between Romanian and L, we discard outliers and we compute the average value of the observations inside the LF, U F range. For each language, we determine the distribution of the sentences according to their similarity with the given language (the histograms for the top 5 languages are presented in Figure 6).","In Figure 7 we report the top 20 languages in the ranking of similarity for Europarl, emphasiz-ing the gain obtained by identifying cognates. In Table 4 we report the similarity scores for the top 20 languages in the rankings of similarity for all the 4 experiments: overall similarity for the entire Europarl corpus (Exp. #1), sentence-level similarity (Exp. #2), similarity for the sentences having the length in the LF, U F range (Exp. #3), and similarity for the sentences having the similarity between Romanian and each related language in the LF, U F range (Exp. #4).","Some remarks are immediate.

The only significant difference is for Portuguese, which is closer to Romanian as measured on Europarl than on the Parliament corpus."]},{"title":"4 Conclusions and Future Work","paragraphs":["In this paper we proposed a computational method for determining cross-language orthographic similarity, with application on Romanian. We investigated etymons and cognates and we conducted a fine-grained analysis of the orthographic similarity between Romanian and related languages. Our results provide a new insight into the classification and evolution of Romanian. We plan to apply our similarity method on a corpus of spoken language, and to extend our analysis to other languages as well, as we gain access to available resources. We further intend to combine our orthographic approach with syntactic and semantic evidence for a wider perspective on language similarity."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["We thank the anonymous reviewers for their help-ful and constructive comments.
