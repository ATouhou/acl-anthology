Our method to include syntactic information is simple in implementation and requires minimal changes in the decoding algorithm. The approach is evaluated in a series of Arabic-English and Chinese-English translation experiments. The best models demonstrate significant improvements in BLEU and TER over the phrase-based baseline, as well as over the lexicalized BiLM by Niehues et al. (2011). Further improvements of up to 0.45 BLEU for Arabic-English and up to 0.59 BLEU for Chinese-English are obtained by combining our dependency BiLM with a lexicalized BiLM. An improvement of 0.98 BLEU is obtained for Chinese-English in the setting of an increased distortion limit."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["In statistical machine translation (SMT) reordering (also called distortion) refers to the order in which source words are translated to generate the translation in the target language. Word orders can differ significantly across languages. For in-stance, Arabic declarative sentences can be verbinitial, while the corresponding English translation should realize the verb after the subject, hence requiring a reordering. Determining the correct reordering during decoding is a major challenge for SMT. This problem has received a lot of attention in the literature (see, e.g., Tillmann (2004), Zens and Ney (2003), Al-Onaizan and Papineni (2006)), as choosing the correct reordering improves readability of the translation and can have a substantial impact on translation quality (Birch, 2011). In this paper, we only consider those approaches that include a reordering feature function into the log-linear interpolation used during decoding.","The simplest reordering model is linear distortion (Koehn et al., 2003) which scores the distance between phrases translated at steps t and t + 1 of the derivation. This model ignores any contextual information, as the distance between translated phrases is its only parameter. Lexical distortion modeling (Tillmann, 2004) conditions reordering probabilities on the phrase pairs translated at the current and previous steps. Unlike linear distortion, it characterizes reordering not in terms of distance but type: monotone, swap, or discontinuous.","In this paper, we base our approach to reordering on bilingual language models (Marino et al., 2006; Niehues et al., 2011). Instead of directly characterizing reordering, they model sequences of elementary translation events as a Markov process.1","Originally, Marino et al. (2006) used this kind of model as the translation model, while more recently it has been used as an additional model in PBSMT systems (Niehues et al., 2011). We adopt and generalize the approach of Niehues et al. (2011) to investigate several variations of bilingual language models. Our method consists of labeling elementary translation events (tokens of bilingual LMs) with their different contextual properties.","What kind of contextual information should be incorporated in a reordering model? Lexical information has been used by Tillmann (2004) but is known to suffer from data sparsity (Galley and Manning, 2008). Also previous contributions to bilingual language modeling (Marino et al., 2006; Niehues et al., 2011) have mostly used lexical information, although Crego and Yvon (2010a) and Crego and Yvon (2010b) label bilingual to-1","Note that the standard PBSMT translation model as-sumes that events of translating separate phrases in a sentence are independent. 1689 kens with a rich set of POS tags. But in general, reordering is considered to be a syntactic phenomenon and thus the relevant features are syntactic (Fox, 2002; Cherry, 2008). Syntactic information is incorporated in tree-based approaches in SMT, allowing one to provide a more detailed definition of translation events and to redefine decoding as parsing of a source string (Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006; Marton and Resnik, 2008), of a target string (Shen et al., 2008), or both (Chiang, 2007; Chiang, 2010). Reordering is a result of a given derivation, and CYK-based decoding used in tree-based approaches is more syntax-aware than the simple PBSMT decoding algorithm. Although tree-based approaches potentially offer a more accurate model of translation, they are also a lot more complex and requiring more intricate optimization and estimation techniques (Huang and Mi, 2010).","Our idea is to keep the simplicity of PBSMT but move towards the expressiveness typical of tree-based models. We incrementally build up the syntactic representation of a translation during decoding by adding precomputed fragments from the source parse tree. The idea to combine the mer-its of the two SMT paradigms has been proposed before, where Huang and Mi (2010) introduce in-cremental decoding for a tree-based model. On a very general level, our approach is similar to theirs in that it keeps track of a sequence of source syntactic subtrees that are being translated at consecutive decoding steps. An important difference is that they keep track of whether the visited subtrees have been fully translated, while in our approach, once a syntactic structural unit has been added to the history, it is not updated anymore.","In this paper, we focus on source syntactic information. During decoding we have full access to the source sentence, which allows us to obtain a better syntactic analysis (than for a partial sentence) and to precompute the units that the model operates with. We investigate the following research questions: How well can we capture reordering regularities of a language pair by incorporating source syntactic parameters into the units of a bilingual language model? What kind of source syntactic parameters are necessary and sufficient?","Our contributions can be summarized as follows: We argue that the contextual information used in the original bilingual models (Niehues et al., 2011) is insufficient and introduce a simple model that exploits source-side syntax to improve reordering (Sections 2 and 3). We perform a thorough comparison between different variants of our general model and compare them to the original approach. We carry out translation experiments on multiple test sets, two language pairs (Arabic-English and Chinese-English), and with respect to two metrics (BLEU and TER). Finally, we present a preliminary analysis of the reorderings resulting from the proposed models (Section 4)."]},{"title":"2 Motivation","paragraphs":["In this section, we elaborate on our research questions and provide background for our approach. We also discuss existing bilingual n-gram models and argue that they are often not expressive enough to differentiate between alternative reorderings. We should first note that the most commonly used n-gram model to distinguish between reorderings is a target language model, which does not take translation correspondence into account and just models target-side fluency. Al-Onaizan and Papineni (2006) show that target language models by themselves are not sufficient to correctly characterize reordering. In what follows we only discuss bilingual models.","The word-aligned sentence pair in Figure 1.a2 demonstrates a common Arabic-English reordering. As stated in the introduction, bilingual language models capture reordering regularities as a sequence of elementary translation events3",". In the given example, one could decompose the sequential process of translation as follows: First translate the first wordAlwzyr as the minister, then ArjE as attributed, then ArtfAE as the increase and so on. The sequence of elementary translation events is modeled as an n-gram model (Equation 1, where ti is a translation event). There are numerous ways in which ti can be defined. Below we first discuss how they have been defined within previous approaches, and then introduce our definition. p(t1, . . . , tm) = m ∏ i=1 p(ti|ti−n+1 . . . ti−1) (1) 2.1 Lexicalized bilingual LMs","By including both source and target information","into the representation of translation events we ob-2 We used Buckwalter transliteration for Arabic words. 3 By an elementary translation event we mean a translation","of some substructure of a sentence. 1690 the minister attributed the increase of oil prices w ArjE Alwzyr ArtfAE AsEAr Albtrwl (a) The original word alignment. the Alwzyr minister Alwzyr attributed ArjE the ArtfAE increase ArtfAE of empty oil Albtrwl prices AsEAr (b) BiLM tokens extracted from sentence (a). empty w of oil Albtrwl prices AsEAr the minister Alwzyr ArjE the the increase ArtfAE (c) MTU tokens extracted from sentence (a).

The richer representation allows for a finer distinction between reorderings. For example, Arabic has a morphological marker of definiteness on both nouns and adjectives. If we first translate a definite adjective and then an indefinite noun, it will probably not be a likely sequence according to the translation model. This kind of intuition underlies the model of Niehues et al. (2011), a bilingual LM (BiLM), which defines elementary translation events t1, ..., tn as follows: ti = ⟨ei, {f |f ∈ A(ei)}⟩, (2) where ei is the i-th target word and A : E → P(F ) is an alignment function, E and F refer-ring to target and source sentences, and P(·) is the powerset function. In other words, the i-th translation event consists of the i-th target word and all source words aligned to it. Niehues et al. (2011) refer to the defined translation events ti as bilingual tokens and we adopt this terminology.","There are alternative definitions of bilingual language models. Our choice of the above definition is supported by the fact that it produces an unambiguous segmentation of a parallel sentence into tokens. Ambiguous segmentation is undesirable because it increases the token vocabulary, and thus the model sparsity. Another disadvantage comes from the fact that we want to compare permutations of the same set of elements. For example, the two different segmentations of ba into [ba] and [b][a] still represent the same permuta-tion of the sequence ab. In Figure 1 one can produce a segmentation of (AsEAr Albtrwl, oil prices) into (Albtrwl, oil) and (AsEAr, prices) or leave it as is. If we allow for both segmentations, the learnt probability parameters may be different for the sum of (Albtrwl, oil) and (AsEAr, prices) and for the unsegmented phrase.","Durrani et al. (2011) introduce an alternative method for unambiguous bilingual segmentation where tokens are defined as minimal phrases, called minimal translation units (MTUs). Figure 1 compares the BiLM and MTU tokenization for a specific example. Since Niehues et al. (2011) have shown their model to work successfully as an additional feature in combination with commonly used standard phrase-based features, we use their approach as the main point of reference and base our approach on their segmentation method. In the rest of the text we refer to Niehues et al. (2011) as the original BiLM.4","At the same time, we do not see any specific obstacles for combining our work with MTUs. 2.2 Suitability of lexicalized BiLM to model reordering As mentioned in the introduction, lexical information is not very well-suited to capture reordering regularities. Consider Figure 2.a. The extracted sequence of bilingual tokens is produced by align-ing source words with respect to target words (so that they are in the same order), as demonstrated by the shaded part of the picture. If we substituted the Arabic translation of Egyptian for the Arabic translation of Israeli, the reordering should remain the same. What matters for reordering is the syntactic role or context of a word. By using unnecessarily fine-grained categories we risk running into sparsity issues.","Niehues et al. (2011) also described an alternative variant of the original BiLM, where words are substituted by their POS tags (Figure 2.a, shaded part). Also, however, POS information by itself may be insufficiently expressive to separate cor-4 Although, strictly speaking, it is not the original ap-","proach (see the references in Section 1). 1691 Egyptian exports to trAjEt SAdrAt mSr l Aldwl AlErbyp VBD NNS NNP IN DTNN DTJJ JJ NNS TO Arabic countries declined ... ...

Although the corresponding sequence of POS-tag-substituted bilingual tokens is different from the correct sequence (Figure 2.b, shaded part), it still is a likely sequence. Indeed, the log-probabilities of the two sequences with respect to a 4-gram BiLM model5","result in a higher probability of −10.25 for the incorrect reordering than for the correct one (−10.39).","Since fully lexicalized bilingual tokens suffer from data sparsity and POS-based bilingual tokens are insufficiently expressive, the question is which level of syntactic information strikes the right balance between expressiveness and generality. 5 Section 4 contains details about data and software setup. 2.3 BiLM with dependency information Dependency grammar is commonly used in NLP to formalize role-based relations between words. The intuitive notion of syntactic modification is captured by the primitive binary relation of dependence. Dependency relations do not change with the linear order of words (Figure 2) and therefore can provide a characterization of a word’s syntactic class that invariant under reordering.","If we incorporate dependency relations into the representation of bilingual tokens, the incorrect reordering in Figure 2.b will produce a highly un-likely sequence. For example, we can substitute each source word with its POS tag and its parent’s POS tag (Figure 3). Again, we computed 4-gram log-probabilities for the corresponding sequences: the correct reordering results in a substantially higher probability of −10.58 than the incorrect one (−13.48). We may consider situations where more fine-grained distinctions are required. In the next section, we explore different representations based on source dependency trees."]},{"title":"3 Dependency-based BiLM","paragraphs":["In this section, we introduce our model which combines the BiLM from Niehues et al. (2011) with source dependency information. We further give details on how the proposed models are trained and integrated into a phrase-based decoder. 1692 3.1 The general framework In the previous section we outlined our framework as composed of two steps: First, a parallel sentence is tokenized according to the BiLM model (Niehues et al., 2011). Next, words in the bilingual tokens are substituted with their contextual properties. It is thus convenient to use the following generalized definition for a token sequencet1...tn in our framework: ti = ⟨ContE (ei), {ContF (f )|f ∈ A(ei)}⟩, (3) where ei is the i-th target word, A : E → P(F ) is an alignment function, F and E are source and target sentences, and ContE and ContF are target and source contextual functions, respectively. A contextual function returns a word’s contextual property, based on its sentential context (source or target). See Figure 4 for an example of a sequence of BiLM tokens with a ContF defined as returning the POS tag of the source word combined with the POS tags of its parent, grandparent and siblings, and ContE defined as an identity function (see Section 3.2 for a detailed explanation of the functions and notation).","In this work we focus on source contextual functions (ContF ). We also exploit some very simple target contextual functions, but do not go into an in-depth exploration. 3.2 Dependency-based contextual functions In NLP approaches exploiting dependency structure, two kinds of relations are of special importance: the parent-child relation and the sibling relation. Shen et al. (2008) work with two well-formed dependency structures, both of which are defined in such a way that there is one common parent and a set of siblings. Li et al. (2012) characterize rules in hierarchical SMT by labeling them with the POS tags of the parents of the words in-side the rule. Lerner and Petrov (2013) model reordering as a sequence of classification steps based on a dependency parse of a sentence. Their model first decides how a word is reordered with respect to its parent and then how it is reordered with respect to its siblings.","Based on these previous approaches, we propose to characterize contextual syntactic roles of a word in terms of POS tags of the words themselves and their relatives in a dependency tree. It is straightforward to incorporate parent information since each node has a unique parent. As for siblings information, we incorporate POS tags of the closest sibling to the left and the closest to the right. We do not include all of the siblings to avoid overfitting. In addition to these basic syntactic relations, we consider the grandparent relation.","The following list is a summary of the source contextual functions that we use. We describe a function with respect to the kind of contextual property of a word it returns: (i) the word itself (Lex); (ii) POS label of the word (Pos); (iii) POS label of the word’s parent; (iv) POS of the word’s closest sibling to the left, concatenated with the POS tag of the closest sibling to the right; (v) the POS label of the word’s grandparent. We use target-side contextual functions returning: (i) an empty string, (ii) POS of the word, (iii) the word itself.","Notation. We do not use the above functions separately to define individual BiLM models, but use combinations of these functions. We use the following notation for function combinations: “ •” horizontally connects source (on the left) and target (on the right) contextual functions for a given model. For example, Lex•Lex refers to the original (lexicalized) BiLM. We use arrows (→) to designate parental information (the arrow goes from parent to child). Pos→Pos refers to a combination of a function returning the POS of a word and the POS of its parent (as in Figure 3). Pos→Pos→Pos is a combination of the previous with the function returning the grandparent’s POS. Finally, we use +sibl to indicate the use of the sibling function described above: For example, Pos→Pos+sibl is a source function that returns the word’s POS, its parent’s POS and the POS labels of the closest siblings to left and right.6","Pos+sibl→Pos is a source function returning the word’s own POS, the POS of a word’s parent, and the POS tags of the parent’s siblings (left- and right-adjacent).","Figure 4 represents the sentence from Figure 2 during decoding in a system with an integrated Pos→Pos→Pos+sibl•Lex feature. It shows the sequence of produced bilingual tokens and corresponding labels in the introduced notation. 3.3 Training Training of dependency-based BiLMs consists of a sequence of extraction steps: After having produced word-alignments for a bitext (Section 4), 6 In case there is no sibling on one of the sides, ε (empty","word) is returned. 1693 Egyptian exports trAjEt SAdrAt mSr l Aldwl AlErbyp VBD NNS NNP IN DTNN DTJJ JJ NNS TO to Egyptian VBD NNS NNP IN to VBD NNS NNP IN exports VBD NNS ...

We produce a dependency parse of a source sentence and a POS-tag labeling of a target sentence. For Chinese, we use the Stanford dependency parser (Chang et al., 2009). For Arabic a dependency parser is not available for public use, so we produce a constituency parse with the Stanford parser (Green and Manning, 2010) and extract dependencies based on the rules in Collins (1999). For English POS-tagging, we use the Stanford POS-tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003). After having produced a labeled sequence of tokens, we learn a 5-gram model using SRILM (Stolcke et al., 2011). Kneyser-Ney smoothing is used for all model variations except for Pos•Pos where Witten-Bell smoothing is used due to zero count-of-counts. 3.4 Decoder integration Dependency-based BiLMs are integrated into our phrase-based SMT decoder as follows: Before translating a sentence, we produce its dependency parse. Phrase-internal word-alignments, needed to segment the translation hypothesis into tokens, are stored in the phrase table, based on the most frequent internal alignment observed during training. Likewise, we store the most likely target-side POS-labeling for each phrase pair.","The decoding algorithm is augmented with one additional feature function and one additional, corresponding feature weight.

The new syntactified bilingual tokens are added to the stack of preced-ing n−1 tokens, and the feature function computes the weighted updated model probability. During decoding, the probabilities of the BiLMs are computed in a stream-based fashion, with bilingual tokens as string tokens, and not in a class-based fashion, with syntactic source-side representations emitting the corresponding target words (Bisazza and Monz, 2014)."]},{"title":"4 Experiments4.1 Setup","paragraphs":["We conduct translation experiments with a baseline PBSMT system with additionally one of the dependency-based BiLM feature functions specified in Section 3.

Up to now, we have only used syntactic information and obtained considerable improvements over Pos•Pos, surpass-ing the improvement provided by Lex•Lex. Can we gain further improvements by also adding lexical information? To this end, we conduct experiments combining the best performing dependency-based BiLM (Pos→Pos→Pos•Pos) and the lexicalized BiLM (Lex•Lex). We hypothesize that the two models improve different aspects of translation: Lex•Lex is biased towards improving lexical choice and Pos→Pos→Pos•Pos towards improving reordering. Combining these two models, we may improve both aspects. The metric results for the combined set indeed support this hypothesis (Table 2.f). 4.3 Chinese-English translation experiments The results of the Chinese-English experiments are shown in Table 4. In the discussion below we mostly focus on the experimental results for the large, combined test set MT06+MT08. We observe the same general pattern for the Pos→Pos source function (Table 4.c) as for Arabic-English: the system with the •Pos target function has the highest scores (Table 5). All of the Pos→Pos• configurations show statistically significant improvements over the PBSMT baseline. For TER, two of the three Pos→Pos• variants significantly outperform Lex•Lex. The system with sibling information (Table 4.d) obtains quite low BLEU results, just as in the Arabic experiments. On the other hand, its TER results are the highest overall. The system with the Pos→Pos→Pos•Pos function (Table 4.e) achieves the best results among dependency-based BiLMs for BLEU. Finally, combining Pos→Pos→Pos•Pos and Lex•Lex results in the largest and significant improvements over all competing systems for BLEU. 4.4 Preliminary analysis of reordering in translation experiments In general, the experimental results show that using source dependency information yields consistent improvements for translating from Arabic and Chinese into English. On the other hand, we have pointed out some discrepancies between the two metrics employed, suggesting that different system configurations may improve different aspects 1696 Configuration Ar-En Ch-En MT08 MT09 MT08+MT09 MT06 MT08 MT06+MT08 a PBSMT baseline 26.14 29.81 27.88 14.48 10.96 12.89 b Lex•Lex 26.33 30.55 28.32 15.43 11.45 13.65 Pos•Pos 25.95 30.06 27.89 14.76 11.01 13.07 c Pos→Pos•Pos 26.91 31.08 28.87 15.29 11.52 13.60 e Pos→Pos−sibl•Pos 26.71 30.73 28.60 15.27 11.67 13.66 d Pos→Pos→Pos•Pos 26.78 31.09 28.80 15.42 11.70 13.77 f Lex•Lex + Pos→Pos→Pos•Pos 26.80 31.27 28.90 15.87 11.85 14.07 Table 6: 4-gram precision scores for Arabic-English and Chinese-English baseline and BiLM systems.

To this end, we conducted some additional evaluations to understand how reordering is affected by the proposed features.","We use 4-gram precision as a metric of how much of the reference set word order is preserved. Table 6 shows the corresponding results for both languages. Just as in the previous two sections, configurations with parental information produce the best results. For Arabic, all of the dependency configurations outperformLex•Lex. But the system with two feature functions, one of which is Lex•Lex, still obtains the best results, which may suggest that the lexicalized BiLM also helps to differentiate between word orders. For Chinese, Pos→Pos→Pos•Pos and the system combining the latter and Lex•Lex also obtain the best results. However, other dependency-based configurations do not outperform Lex•Lex.","All the experiments so far were run with a distortion limit of 5. But both of the languages, especially Chinese, often require reorderings over a longer distance. We performed additional experiments with a distortion limit of 10 for the Lex•Lex and Pos→Pos→Pos•Pos systems (Tables 7 and 8). It is more difficult to translate with a higher distortion limit (Green et al., 2010) as the set of permutations grows larger thereby making it more difficult to differentiate between correct and incorrect continuations of the current hypothesis. It has also been noted that higher distortion limits are more likely to result in improvements for Chinese rather than Arabic to English translation (Chiang, 2007; Green et al., 2010).","We compared performance of fixed BiLM models at distortion lengths of 5 and 10. Arabic-English results did not reveal statistically significant differences between the two distortion limits for Pos→Pos→Pos•Pos. On the other hand, for Lex•Lex BLEU decreases when using a distortion limit of 10 compared to a limit of 5. This implies that the dependency BiLM is more robust in the more challenging reordering setting than the lexicalized BiLM. Chinese-English results for Pos→Pos→Pos•Pos do show significant improvements over the distortion limit of 5 (up to 0.49 BLEU higher than the best result in Table 4). This indicates that the dependency-based BiLM is better capable to take advantage of the increased distortion limit and discriminate between correct and incorrect reordering choices.","Comparing the results for Pos→Pos→Pos•Pos and Lex•Lex at a distortion limit of 10, we obtain strongly significant improvements for all metrics. For Chinese, a larger distortion limit helps for both configurations, but more so for our dependency BiLM, yielding an improvement of 0.98 BLEU 1697 over the original, lexicalized BiLM (Table 8)."]},{"title":"5 Conclusions","paragraphs":["In this paper, we have introduced a simple, yet effective way to include syntactic information into phrase-based SMT. Our method consists of enriching the representation of units of a bilingual language model (BiLM). We argued that the very limited contextual information used in the original bilingual models (Niehues et al., 2011) can capture reorderings only to a limited degree and proposed a method to incorporate information from a source dependency tree in bilingual units. In a series of translation experiments we performed a thorough comparison between various syntacticallyenriched BiLMs and competing models. The results demonstrated that adding syntactic information from a source dependency tree to the representations of bilingual tokens in an n-gram model can yield statistically significant improvements over the competing systems.","A number of additional evaluations provided an indication for better modeling of reordering phenomena. The proposed dependency-based BiLMs resulted in an increase in 4-gram precision and provided further significant improvements over all considered metrics in experiments with an increased distortion limit.","In this paper, we have focused on rather elementary dependency relations, which we are planning to expand on in future work. Our current approach is still strictly tied to the number of target tokens. In particular, we are interested in exploring ways to better capture the notion of syntactic cohesion in translation (Fox, 2002; Cherry, 2008) within our framework."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["We thank Arianna Bisazza and the reviewers for their useful comments.
