With the introduction of any new metric comes the question of just how well that metric mimics human assessment of translation quality. This is often measured by correlation with human judgment. Significance tests are generally not used to establish whether improvements over existing methods such as BLEU are statistically significant or have occurred simply by chance, however. In this paper, we introduce a significance test for comparing correlations of two metrics, along with an open-source implementation of the test. When applied to a range of metrics across seven language pairs, tests show that for a high proportion of metrics, there is insufficient evidence to conclude significant improvement over BLEU."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Within machine translation (MT), efforts are on-going to improve evaluation metrics and find better ways to automatically assess translation quality. The process of validating a new metric in-volves demonstration that it correlates better with human judgment than a standard metric such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2001). However, although it is standard practice in MT evaluation to measure increases in automatic metric scores with significance tests (Germann, 2003; Och, 2003; Kumar and Byrne, 2004; Koehn, 2004; Riezler and Maxwell, 2005; Graham et al., 2014), this has not been the case in papers proposing new metrics. Thus it is possible that some reported improvements in correlation with human judgment are attributable to chance rather than a systematic improvement.","In this paper, we motivate and introduce a novel significance test to assess the statistical significance of differences in correlation with human judgment for pairs of automatic metrics. We apply tests to the WMT-12 shared metrics task to compare each of the participating methods, and find that for a high proportion of metrics, there is not enough evidence to conclude that they significantly outperform BLEU."]},{"title":"2 Correlation with Human Judgment","paragraphs":["A common means of assessing automatic MT evaluation metrics is Spearman’s rank correlation with human judgments (Melamed et al., 2003), which measures the relative degree of monotonicity between the metric and human scores in the range [−1, 1]. The standard justification for cal-culating correlations over ranks rather than raw scores is to: (a) reduce anomalies due to absolute score differences; and (b) focus evaluation on what is generally the primary area of interest, namely the ranking of systems/translations.","An alternative means of evaluation is Pearson’s correlation, which measures the linear correlation between a metric and human scores (Leusch et al., 2003). Debate on the relative merits of Spear-man’s and Pearson’s correlation for the evaluation of automatic metrics is ongoing, but there is an in-creasing trend towards Pearson’s correlation, e.g. in the recent WMT-14 shared metrics task.","Figure 1 presents the system-level results for two evaluation metrics – AMBER (Chen et al., 2012) and TERRORCAT (Fishel et al., 2012) – over the WMT-12 Spanish-to-English metrics task. These two metrics achieved the joint-highest rank correlation (ρ = 0.965) for the task, but differ greatly in terms of Pearson’s correlation (r = 0.881 vs. 0.971, resp.). The largest contributor to this artifact is the system with the lowest human score, represented by the leftmost point in both plots. 172","l l ll l l l l l l l l −3 −2 −1 0 1 2 3 −3 −2 −1 0 1 2 3 Human AMBER Spearman: 0.965 Pearson: 0.881 (a) AMBER","l l l l l l l l l l l l −3 −2 −1 0 1 2 3 −3 −2 −1 0 1 2 3 Human T errorCat Spearman: 0.965 Pearson: 0.971 (b) TERRORCAT Figure 1: Scatter plot of human and automatic scores of WMT-12 Spanish-to-English systems for two MT evaluation metrics (AMBER and TERRORCAT)","Consistent with the WMT-14 metrics shared task, we argue that Pearson’s correlation is more sensitive than Spearman’s correlation. There is still the question, however, of whether an observed difference in Pearson’s r is statistically significant, which we address in the next section."]},{"title":"3 Significance Testing","paragraphs":["Evaluation of a new automatic metric, Mnew, commonly takes the form of quantifying the correlation between the new metric and human judgment, r(Mnew, H), and contrasting it with the correlation for some baseline metric, r(Mbase, H). It is very rare in the MT literature for significance testing to be performed in such cases, however. We introduce a statistical test which can be used for this purpose, and apply the test to the evaluation of metrics participating in the WMT-12 metric evaluation task.","At first gloss, it might seem reasonable to per-form significance testing in the following man-ner when an increase in correlation with human assessment is observed: apply a significance test separately to the correlation of each metric with human judgment, with the hope that the newly proposed metric will achieve a significant correlation where the baseline metric does not. However, besides the fact that the correlation between almost any document-level metric and human judgment will generally be significantly greater than zero, the logic here is flawed: the fact that one correlation is significantly higher than zero (r(Mnew, H)) and that of another is not, does not necessarily mean that the difference between the two correlations is significant. Instead, a specific test should be applied to the difference in correlations on the data. For this same reason, confidence intervals for individual correlations with human judgment are also not particularly meaningful.","In psychological studies, it is often the case that samples that data are drawn from are independent, and differences in correlations are computed on independent data sets. In such cases, the Fisher r to z transformation is applied to test for significant differences in correlations. In the case of automatic metric evaluation, however, the data sets used are almost never independent. This means that if r(Mbase, H) and r(Mnew, H) are both > 0, the correlation between the metric scores themselves, r(Mbase, Mnew), must also be > 0. The strength of this correlation, directly between pairs of metrics, should be taken into account using a significance test of the difference in correlation between r(Mbase, H) and r(Mnew, H). 3.1 Correlated Correlations Correlations computed for two separate automatic metrics on the same data set are not independent, and for this reason in order to test the difference in correlation between them, the degree to which the pair of metrics correlate with each other should be taken into account.

In addition, for the","1","Also sometimes referred to as the Hotelling–Williams test. purposes of significance testing, we take the absolute value of all correlations, in order to compare error-based metrics with non-error based ones.","In general, the correlation is high amongst all pairs of metrics, with a high proportion of paired metrics achieving a correlation in excess of r = 0.9. Two exceptions to this are TERRORCAT (Fishel et al., 2012) and SAGAN (Castillo and Estrella, 2012), as seen in the regions of yellow and white.","Figure 2b shows the results of Williams significance tests for all pairs of metrics. Since we are interested in not only identifying significant differences in correlations, but ultimately ranking competing metrics, we use a one-sided test. Here again, the metrics are ordered from highest to lowest (absolute) correlation with human judgment.","For the Spanish-to-English systems, approximately 60% of WMT-12 metric pairs show a significant difference in correlation with human judgment at p < 0.05 (for one of the two metric directions).2","As expected, the higher the correlation with human judgment, the more metrics a given method is superior to at a level of statistical significance. Although TERRORCAT (Fishel et al., 2012) achieves the highest absolute correlation with human judgment, it is not significantly better (p ≥ 0.05) than the four next-best metrics (METEOR (Denkowski and Lavie, 2011), SAGAN (Castillo and Estrella, 2012), SEMPOS (Macháček and Bo-2","Correlation matrices (red) are maximally filled, in contrast to one-sided significance test matrices (green), where, at a maximum, fewer than half of the cells can be filled. 174","BLEU.4cc SimpBLEU Sempos","Amber TER Sagan","METEOR T errorCat","BErrCats XEnErrCats P osF WBErrCats WBErrCatsPosFXEnErrCatsBErrCatsTerrorCatMETEORSaganTERAmberSemposSimpBLEUBLEU−4cc (a) Czech-to-English","T","errorCat","Sempos","METEOR SimpBLEU BLEU.4cc Amber","P","osF","XEnErrCats BErrCats","WBErrCats TER TERWBErrCatsBErrCatsXEnErrCatsPosFAmberBLEU−4ccSimpBLEUMETEORSemposTerrorCat (b) French-to-English","Sempos","METEOR","T","errorCat","Amber BErrCats P","osF","WBErrCats","XEnErrCats","SimpBLEU TER","BLEU.4cc BLEU−4ccTERSimpBLEUXEnErrCatsWBErrCatsPosFBErrCatsAmberTerrorCatMETEORSempos (c) German-to-English T errorCat EnXErrCats Amber BErrCats","WBErrCats BLEU.4cc P osF SimpBLEU TER METEOR METEORTERSimpBLEUPosFBLEU−4ccWBErrCatsBErrCatsAmberEnXErrCatsTerrorCat (d) English-to-Spanish EnXErrCats BErrCats","SimpBLEU METEOR","WBErrCats Amber","BLEU.4cc T errorCat P osF","TER TERPosFTerrorCatBLEU−4ccAmberWBErrCatsMETEORSimpBLEUBErrCatsEnXErrCats (e) English-to-French T errorCat","SimpBLEU P osF BErrCats EnXErrCats Amber TER","WBErrCats BLEU.4cc","METEOR METEORBLEU−4ccWBErrCatsTERAmberEnXErrCatsBErrCatsPosFSimpBLEUTerrorCat (f) English-to-German Figure 3: Significance results for pairs of automatic metrics for each WMT-12 language pair. jar, 2011) and POSF (Popovic, 2012)). There is not enough evidence to conclude, therefore, that this metric is any better at evaluating Spanish-to-English MT system quality than the next four metrics.","Figure 3 shows the results of significance tests for the six other language pairs used in the WMT-12 metrics shared task.3","For no language pair is there an outright winner amongst the metrics, with proportions of significant differences between metrics for a given language pair ranging from 3% for Czech-to-English to 82% for English-to-French (p < 0.05). The number of metrics that significantly outperform BLEU for a given language pair is only 34% (p < 0.05), and no method significantly outperforms BLEU over all language pairs – indeed, even the best methods achieve statistical significance over BLEU for only a small minority of language pairs. This underlines the dangers of assessing metrics based solely on correlation numbers, and emphasizes the importance of statistical testing.","It is important to note that the number of com-3 We omit English-to-Czech due to some metric scores be-","ing omitted from the WMT-12 data set. peting metrics a metric significantly outperforms should not be used as the criterion for ranking competing metrics. This is due to the fact that the power of the Williams test to identify significant differences between correlations changes depending on the degree to which the pair of metrics correlate with each other. Therefore, a metric that happens to correlate strongly with many other metrics would be at an unfair advantage, were numbers of significant wins to be used to rank metrics. For this reason, it is best to interpret pairwise metric tests in isolation.","As part of this research, we have made available an open-source implementation of statistical tests tailored to the assessment of MT metrics available at https://github.com/ ygraham/significance-williams."]},{"title":"5 Conclusions","paragraphs":["We have provided an analysis of current method-ologies for evaluating automatic metrics in machine translation, and identified an issue with respect to the lack of significance testing.
