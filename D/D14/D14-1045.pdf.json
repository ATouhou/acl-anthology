Unfortunately, such corpora are expensive to produce and often do not generalize well across do-mains. Even in domain, errors are often made where syntactic information does not provide sufficient cues. In this paper, we mitigate both of these problems by employing distributional word representations gathered from unlabelled data. While straight-forward word representations of predicates and arguments improve performance, we show that further gains are achieved by composing representations that model the interaction between predicate and argument, and capture full argument spans."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["The goal of semantic role labelling (SRL) is to discover the relations that hold between a predicate and its arguments in a given input sentence (e.g., “who” did “what” to “whom”, “when”, “where”, and “how”). This semantic knowledge at the predicate-argument level is required by inference-based NLP tasks in order to identify meaning-preserving transformations, such as active/passive, verb alternations and nominaliza-tions. Several manually-build semantic resources, including FrameNet (Ruppenhofer et al., 2010) and PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005), have been developed with the goal of documenting and providing examples of such transformations and how they preserve semantic role information. Given that labelled corpora are inevitably restricted in size and coverage, and that syntactic cues are not by themselves unambiguous or sufficient, the success of systems that automatically provide corresponding analyses has been limited in practice.","Recent work on SRL has explored approaches that can leverage unlabelled data, following a semi-supervised (Fürstenau and Lapata, 2012; Titov and Klementiev, 2012) or unsupervised learning paradigm (Abend et al., 2009; Titov and Klementiev, 2011). Unlabelled data provides additional statistical strength and can lead to more consistent models. For instance, latent representations of words can be computed, based on distributional similarity or language modelling, which can be used as additional features during tradi-tional supervised learning. Although we would expect that extra features would improve classifier performance, this seems in part counter-intuitive. Just because one word has a specific representation does not mean that it should be assigned a specific argument label. Instead, one would expect a more complex interplay between predicate, argument and the context they appear in.","In this paper, we investigate the impact of distributional word representations for SRL. Initially, we augment the feature space with word representations for a predicate and its argument head. Furthermore, we use a compositional approach to model a representation of the full argument, by composing a joint representation of all words in the argument span, and we also investigate the interaction between predicate and argument, using a compositional representation of the dependency path. We demonstrate the benefits of these compositional features using a state-of-the-art semantic role labeller, which we evaluate on the English part of the CoNLL-2009 data set."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Research into using distributional information in SRL dates back to Gildea and Jurafsky (2002), who used distributions over verb-object co-occurrence clusters to improve coverage in argument classification. The distribution of a word over these soft clusters assignments was added as 407 features to their classifier. The SRL system by Croce et al. (2010) combines argument clustering based on co-occurrence frequencies with a language model. Collobert et al. (2011) used distributional word representations in a neural network model that can update representations during training. Zapirain et al. (2013) suggested distributional information as a basis for a selectional preference model that can be used as a single additional feature for classifying potential arguments. Most recently, Hermann et al. (2014) used distributional word representations within pre-defined syntactic contexts as input to a classifier which learns to distinguish different predicate senses.","A complementary line of research explores the representation of sequence information. Prominent examples are the works by Deschacht and Moens (2009) and Huang and Yates (2010) who learned and applied Hidden Markov Models to assign state variables to words and word spans, which serve as supplementary features for classification. One drawback of this approach is that state variables are discrete and the number of states (i.e., their granularity) has to be chosen in advance.","The popularity of distributional methods for word representation has been a motivation for developing representations of larger constructions such as phrases and sentences, and there have been several proposals for computing the meaning of word combinations in vector spaces. Mitchell and Lapata (2010) introduced a general framework where composition is formulated as a func-tion f of two vectors u and v. Depending on how f is chosen, different composition models arise, the simplest being an additive model where f (u, v) = u + v. To capture relational functions, Baroni and Zamparelli (2010) expanded on this approach by representing verbs, adjectives and adverbs by matrices which can modify the properties of nouns (represented by vectors). Socher et al. (2012) combined word representations with syntactic structure information, through a recursive neural network that learns vector space representations for multi-word phrases and sentences. An empirical comparison of these composition methods was provided in (Blacoe and Lapata, 2012).","In this work, we use type-based continuous representations of words to compose representations of multiple word sequences and spans, which can then be incorporated directly as features into SRL systems.

Vector ⃗w denotes the representation of word w."]},{"title":"3 Method","paragraphs":["Following the set-up of the CoNLL shared task in 2009, we consider predicate-argument structures that consist of a verbal or nominal predicate p and PropBank-labelled arguments ai ∈ {a1 . . . an}, where each ai corresponds to the head word of the phrase that constitutes the respective argument. Traditional semantic role labelling approaches compute a set of applicable features on each pair ⟨p, ai⟩, such as the observed lemma type of a word and the grammatical relation to its head, that serve as indicators for a particular role label.","The disadvantage of this approach lies in the fact that indicator features such as word and lemma type are often sparse in training data and hence do not generalize well across domains. In contrast, features based on distributional representations (e.g., raw co-occurrence frequencies) can be computed for every word, given that it occurs in some unlabelled corpus. In addition to this obvious advantage for out-of-domain settings, distributional representations can provide a more robust input signal to the classifier, for instance by projecting a matrix of co-occurrence frequencies to a lower-dimensional space. We hence hypothesize that such features enable the model to be-come more robust out-of-domain, while providing higher precision in-domain.","Although simply including the components of a word representation as features to a classifier can lead to immediate improvements in SRL performance, this observation seems in part counterintuitive. Just because one word has a specific representation does not mean that it should be assigned a specific argument label. In fact, one would expect a more complex interplay between the representation of an argument ai and the context it appears in. To model aspects of this interplay, we define an extended set of features that 408 further includes representations for the combination of p and ai, the set of words in the dependency path between p and ai, and the set of words in the full span of ai. We compute additive compositional representations of multiple words, using the simplest method of Mitchell and Lapata (2010) where the composed representation is the uniformly weighted sum of each single representation. Our full set of feature types based on distributional word representations is listed in Table 1."]},{"title":"4 Experimental Setup","paragraphs":["We evaluate the impact of different types of features by performing experiments on a benchmark dataset for semantic role labelling. To assess the gains of distributional representations realistically, we incorporate the features described in Section 3 into a state-of-the-art SRL system. The following paragraphs summarize the details of our experimental setup. Semantic Role Labeller. In all our experiments, we use the publicly available system by Björkelund et al. (2010).1","This system combines the first-ranked SRL system and the first-ranked syntactic parser in the CoNLL 2009 shared task for English (Björkelund et al., 2009; Bohnet, 2010). To the best of our knowledge, this combination represents the current state-of-the-art for semantic role labelling following the PropBank/NomBank paradigm (Palmer et al., 2005; Meyers et al., 2004). To re-train and evaluate models with different feature sets, we use the same training, development and test sets as provided in the CoNLL shared task (Hajič et al., 2009). Although the employed system features a full syntactic-semantic parsing pipeline, we only modify the feature sets of the two components directly related to the actual role labelling task, namely argument identification and argument classification.

We conjecture that this is due to the high volume of existing in-domain training data, which renders our full feature set redundant. To test this conjecture, we further assess performance on the out-of-domain test set of the CoNLL-2009 shared task.","The results for the out-of-domain experiment are summarized in the lower part of Table 3. We again observe that each single feature type improves classification, with absolute gains being slightly higher than in the in-domain setting. More interestingly though, we find that the complete feature set boosts performance even further, achieving an overall gain in precision and recall of 0.6 and 1.3 percentage points, respectively. The resulting F1-score of 75.2 lies even higher than the top score for this particular data set reported in the CoNLL shared task (Zhao et al., 2009; 74.6 F1).","We next investigate the benefits of compositional representations over features for single words by assessing their impact on the overall result in an ablation study.

In the next section, we discuss this result in more detail and provide examples of improved classification decisions."]},{"title":"6 Discussion","paragraphs":["As a more detailed qualitative analysis, we examined the impact of word representations on SRL performance with respect to different argument labels and predicate types. Results on the in-domain data set, shown in the upper part of Table 5, suggest that most improvements in terms of precision are gained for verbal predicates, while nominal predicates primarily benefit from higher recall. One reason for the latter observation might be that arguments of nominal predicates are generally much harder to identify for the Original model, as the cues provided by indicator features on words and syntax are often inconclusive. For verbal predicates, the word representations mainly provide reinforcing signals to the classifier, improving its precision at a slight cost of recall.","The results on the out-of-domain data set provide more insights regarding the suitability of word representations for generalization. As shown in the lower half of Table 5, the additional features on average have a positive impact on precision and recall. For verbal predicates, we observe only one case, namely A0, in which improvements in recall came with a decline in precision. Regarding nominal predicates, the trend is similar to what we have seen in the in-domain setting, with most gains being achieved in terms of recall.","Apart from assessing quantitative effects, we further examined cases that directly show the qualitative gains of the compositional features defined 410 Sentence with predicate and [gold argumentlabel] Original Features required for correction (1) He did not resent [theirA0] supervision A1 Interaction (2) [HeA1] is getting plenty of rest no label Interaction, Path (3) [HeA0] rose late and went down to have breakfast. no label Path (4) He was able to sit [for hoursAM-TMP].

As illustrated by Examples (1) and (2), the Interaction feature seems to help recall by guiding classification decisions towards more meaningful and complete structures.","Improvements using the Path feature can be observed in cases where nested syntactic structures need to be processed, as required in Example (2).

Our results indicate that combining such features with standard syntactic cues leads to more precise and more robust models, with significant improvements both in-domain and out-of-domain. Ablation tests on an out-of-domain data set have shown that gains in recall are mostly due to features based on composed representations. Given the novelty of these features for SRL, we believe that this insight is remarkable and deserves further investigation. In future work, we plan to apply more sophisticated models of composition-ality to better represent predicate-argument structures and to guide classification decisions towards outcomes that are semantically more plausible. We anticipate that this line of research will also be of interest for a range of related tasks beyond traditional SRL, including predicate-argument structure alignment (Roth and Frank, 2012) and implicit argument linking (Gerber and Chai, 2012)."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["This work has been supported by the FP7 Collaborative Project S-CASE (Grant Agreement No 610717) funded by the European Commission (Michael Roth), and by EPSRC (EP/K017845/1) in the framework of the CHIST-ERA READERS project (Kristian Woodsend). 411"]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Omri Abend, Roi Reichart, and Ari Rappoport. 2009.
