The inferred topics often correspond with the underlying themes of the analyzed collection, and the topic modeling algorithm organizes the documents according to those themes.","Most topic models are evaluated by their predictive performance on held out data. The idea is that topic models are fit to maximize the likelihood (or posterior probability) of a collection of documents, and so a good model is one that assigns high likelihood to a held out set (Blei et al., 2003; Wallach et al., 2009).","But this evaluation is not in line with how topic models are frequently used. Topic models seem to capture the underlying themes of a collection—indeed the monicker “topic model” is retrospective—and so we expect that these themes are useful for exploring, summarizing, and learning about its documents (Mimno and McCallum, 2007; Chang et al., 2009). In such exploratory data analysis, however, we are not concerned with the fit to held out data.","In this paper, we develop and study new methods for evaluating topic models. Our methods are based on posterior predictive checking, which is a model diagnosis technique from Bayesian statistics (Rubin, 1984; Gelman et al., 1996). The goal of a posterior predictive check (PPC) is to assess the validity of a Bayesian model without requiring a specific alternative model. Given data, we first compute a posterior distribution over the latent variables. Then, we estimate the probability of the observed data under the data-generating distribution that is induced by the posterior (the “posterior predictive distribution”). A data set that is unlikely calls the model into ques-tion, and consequently the posterior. PPCs can show where the model fits and doesn’t fit the observations. They can help identify the parts of the posterior that are worth exploring.","The key to a posterior predictive check is the discrepancy function. This is a function of the data that measures a property of the model which is important to capture. While the model is often chosen for computational reasons, the discrepancy function might capture aspects of the data that are desirable but difficult to model. In this work, we will design a discrepancy function to measure an independence assumption that is implicit in the modeling assumptions but is not enforced in the posterior. We will embed this function in a posterior predictive check and use it to evaluate and visualize topic models in new ways.","227","Specifically, we develop discrepancy functions for latent Dirichlet allocation (the simplest topic model) that measure how well its statistical assumptions about the topics are matched in the observed corpus and inferred topics. LDA assumes that each observed word in a corpus is assigned to a topic, and that the words assigned to the same topic are drawn independently from the same multinomial distribution (Blei et al., 2003). For each topic, we measure the whether this assumption holds by computing the mutual information between the words assigned to that topic and which document each word appeared in. If the assumptions hold, these two variables should be independent: low mutual information indicates that the assumptions hold; high mutual information indicates a mismatch to the modeling assumptions.","We embed this discrepancy in a PPC and study it in several ways. First, we focus on topics that model their observations well; this helps separate interpretable topics from noisy topics (and “boilerplate” topics, which exhibit too little noise). Second, we focus on individual terms within topics; this helps display a model applied to a corpus, and under-stand which terms are modeled well. Third, we replace the document identity with an external variable that might plausibly be incorporated into the model (such as time stamp or author). This helps point the modeler towards the most promising among more complicated models, or save the effort in fitting one. Finally, we validate this strategy by simulating data from a topic model, and assessing whether the PPC “accepts” the resulting data."]},{"title":"2 Probabilistic Topic Modeling","paragraphs":["Probabilistic topic models are statistical models of text that assume that a small number of distributions over words, called “topics,” are used to generate the observed documents. One of the simplest topic models is latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003). In LDA, a set of K topics describes a corpus; each document exhibits the topics with different proportions. The words are assumed exchangeable within each document; the documents are assumed exchangeable within the corpus.","More formally, let φ1, . . . , φK be K topics, each of which is a distribution over a fixed vocabulary. For each document, LDA assumes the following generative process 1. Choose topic proportions θd ∼ Dirichlet(α). 2. For each word (a) Choose topic assignment zd,n ∼ θ. (b) Choose word wd,n ∼ φzd,n. This process articulates the statistical assumptions behind LDA: Each document is endowed with its own set of topic proportions θd, but the same set of topics φ1:K governs the whole collection.","Notice that the probability of a word is independent of its document θd given its topic assignment zd,n (i.e., wd,n ⊥⊥ θd | zd,n). Two documents might have different overall probabilities of containing a word from the “vegetables” topic; however, all the words in the collection (regardless of their documents) drawn from that topic will be drawn from the same multinomial distribution.","The central computational problem for LDA is posterior inference. Given a collection of documents, the problem is to compute the conditional distribution of the hidden variables—the topics φk, topic proportions θd, and topic assignments zd,n. Researchers have developed many algorithms for approximating this posterior, including sampling methods (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004) (used in this paper), variational methods (Blei et al., 2003), distributed variants (Asuncion et al., 2008), and online algorithms (Hoffman et al., 2010)."]},{"title":"3 Checking Topic Models","paragraphs":["Once approximated, the posterior distribution is used for the task at hand. Topic models have been applied to many tasks, such as classification, predic-tion, collaborative filtering, and others. We focus on using them as an exploratory tool, where we assume that the topic model posterior provides a good decomposition of the corpus and that the topics provide good summaries of the corpus contents.","But what is meant by “good”? To answer this question, we turn to Bayesian model checking (Rubin, 1981; Gelman et al., 1996).

Nine randomly selected topics from the New York Times with low (top row), medium (middle row) and high (bottom row) mutual information between words and documents. The y-axis shows term rank within the topic, with size proportional to log probability. The x-axis represents divergence from the multinomial assumption for each word: terms that are uniformly distributed across documents are towards the left, while more specialized terms are to the right. Triangles represent real values, circles represent 20 replications of this same plot from the posterior of the model. 229 intuition is that only when satisfied with the model should the modeler use the posterior to learn about her data. In complicated Bayesian models, such as topic models, Bayesian model checking can point to the parts of the posterior that better fit the observed data set and are more likely to suggest something meaningful about it.","In particular, we will develop posterior predictive checks (PPC) for topic models. In a PPC, we specify a discrepancy function, which is a function of the data that measures an important property that we want the model to capture. We then assess whether the observed value of the function is similar to values of the function drawn from the posterior, through the distribution of the data that it induces. (This distribution of the data is called the “posterior predictive distribution.”)","An innovation in PPCs is the realized discrepancy function (Gelman et al., 1996), which is a function of the data and any hidden variables that are in the model. Realized discrepancies induce a traditional discrepancy by marginalizing out the hidden variables. But they can also be used to evaluate assumptions about latent variables in the posterior, especially when combined with techniques like MCMC sampling that provide realizations of them. In topic models, as we will see below, we use a realized discrepancy to factor the observations and to check specific components of the model that are discovered by the posterior. 3.1 A realized discrepancy for LDA Returning to LDA, we design a discrepancy function that checks the independence assumption of words given their topic assignments. As we mentioned above, given the topic assignment z the word w should be independent of its document θ. Consider a decomposition of a corpus from LDA, which assigns every observed word wd,n to a topic zd,n. Now restrict attention to all the words assigned to the kth topic and form two random variables: W are the words assigned to the topic and D are the document indices of the words assigned to that topic. If the LDA assumptions hold then knowing W gives no information about D because the words are drawn independently from the topic.","We measure this independence with the mutual information between W and D:1 M I(W, D | k)","= ∑","w ∑","d P (w, d | k) log P (w | d, k)P (d | k)","P (w | k)P (d | k)","= ∑","w ∑ d N (w, d, k)","N (k) log N (w, d, k)N (k)","N (d, k)N (w, k) .

This function measures the divergence between the joint distribution over word and document index and the product of the marginal distributions. In the limit of infinite samples, independent random variables have mutual information of zero, but we expect finite samples to have non-zero values even for truly independent variables. Notice that this is a realized discrepancy; it depends on the latent assignments of observed words to topics.","Eq. 1 is defined as a sum over a set of documents and a set of words. We can rearrange this summa-tion as a weighted sum of the instantaneous mutual information between words and documents: IM I(w, D | k) = H(D|k) − H(D | W = w, k).","(2) This quantity can be understood by considering the per-topic distribution of document labels, p(d|k). This distribution is formed by normalizing the counts of how many words assigned to topic k appeared in each document. The first term of Eq. 2 is the entropy—some topics are evenly distributed across many documents (high entropy); others are concentrated in fewer documents (low entropy).","The second term conditions this distribution on a particular word type w by normalizing the per-document number of times w appeared in each document (in topic k). If this distribution is close to p(d|k) then H(D|W = w, k) will be close to H(D|k) and IM I(w, D|k) will be low. If, on the other hand, word w occurs many times in only a few documents, it will have lower entropy over docu-1","There are other choices of discrepancies, such as word-word point-wise mutual information scores (Newman et al., 2010). 230 ments than the overall distribution over documents for the topic and IM I(w, D|k) will be high.","We illustrate this discrepancy in Figure 1, which shows nine topics trained from the New York Times.2 Each row contains randomly selected topics from low, middle, and high ranges of MI, respectively. Each triangle represents a word. Its place on the y-axis is its rank in the topic. Its place on the x-axis is its IM I(w|k), with more uniformly distributed words (low IMI) to the left and more specific words (high IMI) to the right. (For now, ignore the other points in this figure.) IMI varies between topics, but tends to increase with rank as less frequent words appear in fewer documents.","The discrepancy captures different kinds of structure in the topics. The top left topic represents formulaic language, language that occurs verbatim in many documents. In particular, it models the boilerplate text “Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy...” Identifying repeated phrases is a common phenomenon in topic models. Most words show lower than expected IMI, indicating that word use in this topic is less variable than data drawn from a multinomial distribution. The middle-left topic is an example of a good topic, according to this discrepancy, which is related to Iraqi politics. The bottom-left topic is an example of the opposite extreme from the top-left. It shows a loosely connected series of proper names with no overall theme. 3.2 Posterior Predictive Checks for LDA Intuitively, the middle row of topics in Figure 1 are the sort of topics we look for in a model, while the top and bottom rows contain topics that are less useful. Using a PPC, we can formally measure the difference between these topics. For each of the real topics in Figure 1 we regenerated the same figure 20 times. We sampled new words for every token from the posterior distribution of the topic, and recalculated the rank and IMI for each word. These “shadow” figures are shown as gray circles. The density of those circles creates a reference distribution indicating the expected IMI values at each rank under the multinomial assumption. 2 Details about the corpus and model fitting are in Section","4.2. Similar figures for two other corpora are in the supplement.","By themselves, IMI scores give an indication of the distribution of a word between documents within a topic: small numbers are better, large numbers indicate greater discrepancy. These scores, however, are based on the specific allocation of words to topics. For example, lower-ranked, less frequent words within a topic tend to have higher IMI scores than higher-ranked, more frequent words. This difference may be due to greater violation of multinomial assumptions, but may also simply be due to smaller sample sizes, as the entropy H(D|W = w, k) is estimated from fewer tokens. The reference distributions help distinguish between these two cases.","In more detail, we generate replications of the data by considering a Gibbs sampling state. This state assigns each observed word to a topic. We first record the number of instances of each term assigned to each topic, N (w|k). Then for each word wd,n in the corpus, we sample a new observed word wrep d,n where P (w) ∝ N (w|zd,n). (We did not use smoothing parameters.) Finally, we recalculate the mutual information and instantenous mutual information for each topic.","In the top-left topic, most of the words have much lower IMI than the word at the same rank in replications, indicating lower than expected variability. The exception is the word Broadway, which is more variable than expected. In the middle-left topic, IMI for the words Iraqi and Baghdad occur within the expected range. These words fit the multinomial assumption: any word assigned to this topic is equally likely to be Iraqi. Values for the words Shiite, Sunni, and Kurdish are more specific to particular documents than we expect under the model. In the bottom-left topic, almost all words occur with greater variability than expected. This topic combines many terms with only coincidental similarity, such as Mets pitcher Grant Roberts and the firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.","Turning to an analysis of the full mutual information, Figure 2 shows the three left-hand topics from Figure 1: Weekend, Iraq, and Roberts. The histogram represents MI scores for 100 replications of the topic, rescaled to have mean zero and unit variance. The observed value, also rescaled, and the mean replicated value (set to zero) are shown with vertical lines. The formulaic Weekend topic has significantly lower than expected MI.

The Weekend topic (top) has lower than expected MI. The Iraq (middle) and Roberts (bottom) topics both have MI greater than expected. and Roberts topics have significantly greater than expected MI.","For most topics the actual discrepancy is outside the range of any replicated discrepancies. In their original formulation, PPCs prescribe computing a tail probability of a replicated discrepancy being greater than (or less than) the observed discrepancy under the posterior predictive distribution. For example if an observed value is greater than 70 of 100 replicated values, we report a PPC p-value of 0.7.","When the observed value is far outside the range of any replicated values, as in Figure 2, that tail probability will be degenerate at 0 or 1. So, we report instead a deviance value, an alternative way of comparing an observed value to a reference distribution. We compute the distribution of the replicated discrepancies and compute its standard deviation. We then compute how many standard deviations the observed discrepancy is from the mean of the replicated discrepancies.","This score allows us to compare topics. The observed value for the Weekend topic is 31.8 standard deviations below the mean replicated value, and thus has deviance of -31.8, which is lower than expected. The Iraq topic has deviance of 16.8 and the Roberts topic has deviance of 47.7. This matches our intuition that the former topic is more useful than the latter."]},{"title":"4 Searching for Systematic Deviations","paragraphs":["We demonstrated that the mutual information discrepancy function can detect violations of multinomial assumptions, in which instances of a term in a given topic are not independently distributed among documents. One way to address this lack of fit is to encode document-level extra-multinomial variance (“burstiness”) into the model using Dirichlet compound multinomial distributions (Doyle and Elkan, 2009). If there is no pattern to the deviations from multinomial word use across documents, this method is the best we can do.","In many corpora, however, there are systematic deviations that can be explained by additional variables. LDA is the simplest generative topic model, and researchers have developed many variants of LDA that account for a variety of variables that can be found or measured with a corpus. Examples in-clude models that account for time (Blei and Lafferty, 2006), books (Mimno and McCallum, 2007), and aspect or perspective (Mei and Zhai, 2006; Lin et al., 2008; Paul et al., 2010). In this section, we show how we can use the mutual information discrepancy function of Equation 1 and PPCs to guide our choice in which topic model to fit.","Greater deviance implies that a particular grouping better explains the variation in word use within a topic. The discrepancy functions are large when words appear more than expected in some groups and less than expected in others. We know that the individual documents show significantly more variation than we expect from replications from the model’s posterior distribution. If we combine documents randomly in a meaningless grouping, such deviance should decrease, as differences between documents are “smoothed out.” If a grouping of documents shows equal or greater deviation, we can assume that that grouping is maintaining the underlying structure of the systematic deviation from the multinomial assumption, and that further modeling or visualization using that grouping might be useful. 4.1 PPCs for systematic discrepancy The idea is that the words assigned to a topic should be independent of both document and any other variable that might be associated with the document.

For example, the New York Times articles are each associated with a particular news desk and also associated with a time stamp. If the topic modeling assumptions hold, the words are independent of both these variables. If we see a significant discrepancy relative to a grouping defined by a metadata feature, this systematic variability suggests that we might want to take that feature into account in the model.","Let G be a set of groups and let γ ∈ GD","be a grouping of D documents.

We can now substitute these group-specific counts for the document-specific counts in the discrepancy function in Eq. 1. Note that the previous discrepancy functions are equivalent to a trivial grouping, in which each document is the only member of its own group. In the following experiments we explore groupings by published volume, blog, preferred political candidate, and newspaper desk, and evaluate the effect of those groupings on the deviation between mean replicated values and observed values of those functions. 4.2 Case studies We analyze three corpora, each with its own metadata: the New York Times Annotated Corpus (1987– 2007)3",", the CMU 2008 political blog corpus (Eisenstein and Xing, 2010), and speeches from the British 3 http://www.ldc.upenn.edu House of Commons from 1830–1891.4","Descriptive statistics are presented in Table 1.

We are interested in measuring the degree to which word usage varies within topics as a function of both time and the perspective of the article.

Political blogs. The CMU 2008 political blog corpus consists of six blogs, three of which supported Barack Obama and three of which supported John McCain. This corpus has previously been considered in the context of aspect-based topic models (Ahmed and Xing, 2010) that assign distinct word distributions to liberal and conservative bloggers. It is reasonable to expect that blogs with different political leanings will use measurably different language to describe the same themes, suggesting that there will be systematic deviations from a multinomial hypothesis of exchangeability of words within topics. Indeed, Ahmed and Xing obtained improved results with such a model. Figure 6 shows the distribution of standard deviations from the mean replicated value for a set of 150 topics grouped by document, blog, and preferred candidate.

To determine whether this particular assignment of documents to blogs is responsible for the difference in discrepancy functions or whether any such split would have greater deviance, we compared random groupings to the real groupings and recalculate the PPC. We generated 10 such groupings by permuting document blog labels and another 10 by permuting document candidate labels, each time holding the topics fixed.

We now consider the opposite direction. When documents are generated from a multinomial topic model, PPCs should not detect systematic deviation.","We must also distinguish between lack of fit due to model misspecification and lack of fit due to approximate inference.

We then trained a topic model with the same hyperparameters and number of topics on each corpus, sav-ing a Gibbs sampling state.","We can measure the fit of a PPC by examining the distribution of empirical p-values, that is, the propor-tion of replications wrep","that result in discrepancies less than the observed value. p-values should be uniformly distributed on (0, 1). Non-uniform p-values indicate a lack of calibration. Unlike real collections, in synthetic corpora the range of discrepancies from these replicated collections often includes the real values, so p-values are meaningful. A histogram of p-values for 200 synthetic topics after 100 replications is shown in the left panel of Figure 9.","PPCs have been criticized for reusing training data for model checking. For some models, the posterior distribution is too close to the data, so all replicated values are close to the real value, leading to p-values clustered around 0.5 (Draper and Krnjajic, 2006; Bayarri and Castellanos, 2007). We test divergence from a uniform distribution with a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Our results indicate that LDA is not overfitting, but that the distribution is not uniform (KS p < 0.00001).","The PPC framework allows us to choose discrepancy functions that reflect the relative importance of subsets of words and documents. The second panel in Figure 9 sums only over the 20 documents with the largest probability of the topic, the third sums over all documents but only over the top 10 most probable words, and the fourth sums over only the top words and documents. This test indicates that the distribution of p-values for the subset TopWords is not uniform (KS p < 0.00001), but that a uniform distribution is a good fit for TopDocs (KS p = 0.358) and TopWordsDocs (KS p = 0.069)."]},{"title":"6 Conclusions","paragraphs":["We have developed a Bayesian model checking method for probabilistic topic models. Conditioned on their topic assignment, the words of the documents are independently and identically distributed by a multinomial distribution. We developed a realized discrepancy function—the mutual information between words and document indices, conditioned on a topic—that checks this assumption. We embedded this function in a posterior predictive check.","We demonstrated that we can use this posterior predictive check to identify particular topics that fit the data, and particular topics that misfit the data in different ways. Moreover, our method provides a new way to visualize topic models.","We adapted the method to corpora with external variables. In this setting, the PPC provides a way to guide the modeler in searching through more complicated models that involve more variables.","Finally, on simulated data, we demonstrated that PPCs with the mutual information discrepancy function can identify model fit and model misfit."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["David M.
