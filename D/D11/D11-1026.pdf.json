It is an adaptation of Affinity Propagation, a state-of-the-art clustering algorithm in the framework of factor graphs. Affinity Propagation for Segmentation, or APS, receives a set of pairwise similarities between data points and produces segment boundaries and segment centres – data points which best describe all other data points within the segment. APS iteratively passes messages in a cyclic factor graph, until convergence. Each iteration works with information on all available similarities, resulting in highquality results. APS scales linearly for realistic segmentation tasks. We derive the algorithm from the original Affinity Propagation formulation, and evaluate its performance on topical text segmentation in comparison with two state-of-the art segmenters. The results suggest that APS performs on par with or outperforms these two very competitive baselines."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["In complex narratives, it is typical for the topic to shift continually. Some shifts are gradual, others – more abrupt. Topical text segmentation identifies the more noticeable topic shifts. A topical segmenter’s output is a very simple picture of the document’s structure. Segmentation is a useful intermediate step in such applications as subjectivity analysis (Stoyanov and Cardie, 2008), automatic summarization (Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009), question an-swering (Oh, Myaeng, and Jang, 2007) and others. That is why improved quality of text segmentation can benefit other language-processing tasks.","We present Affinity Propagation for Segmentation (APS), an adaptation of a state-of-the-art clustering algorithm, Affinity Propagation (Frey and Dueck, 2007; Givoni and Frey, 2009).1","The original AP algorithm considerably improved exemplar-based clustering both in terms of speed and the quality of solutions. That is why we chose to adapt it to segmentation. At its core, APS is suitable for segmenting any sequences of data, but we present it in the context of segmenting documents. APS takes as input a matrix of pairwise similarities between sentences and, for each sentence, a preference value which indicates an a priori belief in how likely a sentence is to be chosen as a segment centre. APS outputs segment assignments and segment centres – data points which best explain all other points in a segment. The algorithm attempts to maximize net similarity – the sum of similarities between all data points and their respective segment centres.","APS operates by iteratively passing messages in a factor graph (Kschischang, Frey, and Loeliger, 2001) until a good set of segments emerges. Each iteration considers all similarities – takes into account all available information. An iteration in-cludes sending at most O(N 2",") messages. For the majority of realistic segmentation tasks, however, the upper bound is O(M N ) messages, where M is a constant. This is more computationally expensive than the requirements of locally informed segmentation algorithms such as those based on HMM or CRF (see Section 2), but for a globally-informed algorithm the requirements are very reasonable. APS is an instance of loopy-belief propagation (belief propagation on cyclic graphs) which has 1 An implementation of APS in Java, and the data sets, can be","downloaded at ⟨www.site.uottawa.ca/∼ankazant⟩. 284 been used to achieved state-of-the-art performance in error-correcting decoding, image processing and data compression. Theoretically, such algorithms are not guaranteed to converge or to maximize the objective function. Yet in practice they often achieve competitive results.","APS works on an already pre-compiled similaritiy matrix, so it offers flexibility in the choice of similarity metrics. The desired number of segments can be set by adjusting preferences.","We evaluate the performance of APS on three tasks: finding topical boundaries in transcripts of course lectures (Malioutov and Barzilay, 2006), identifying sections in medical textbooks (Eisenstein and Barzilay, 2008) and identifying chapter breaks in novels. We compare APS with two recent systems: the Minimum Cut segmenter (Malioutov and Barzilay, 2006) and the Bayesian segmenter (Eisenstein and Barzilay, 2008). The comparison is based on the WindowDiff metric (Pevzner and Hearst, 2002). APS matches or outperforms these very competitive baselines.","Section 2 of the paper outlines relevant research on topical text segmentation. Section 3 briefly covers the framework of factor graphs and outlines the original Affinity Propagation algorithm for clustering. Section 4 contains the derivation of the new update messages for APSeg. Section 5 describes the experimental setting, Section 6 reports the results, Section 7 discusses conclusions and future work."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["This sections discusses selected text segmentation methods and positions the proposed APS algorithm in that context.","Most research on automatic text segmentation revolves around a simple idea: when the topic shifts, so does the vocabulary (Youmans, 1991). We can roughly subdivide existing approaches into two categories: locally informed and globally informed.","Locally informed segmenters attempt to identify topic shifts by considering only a small portion of complete document. A classical approach is Text-Tiling (Hearst, 1997). It consists of sliding two adjacent windows through text and measuring lexical similarity between them. Drops in similarity correspond to topic shifts. Other examples include text segmentation using Hidden Markov Models (Blei and Moreno, 2001) or Conditional Random Fields (Lafferty, McCallum, and Pereira, 2001). Locally informed methods are often very efficient because of lean memory and CPU time requirements. Due to a limited view of the document, however, they can easily be thrown off by short inconsequential digressions in narration.","Globally informed methods consider “the big picture” when determining the most likely location of segment boundaries. Choi (2000) applies divisive clustering to segmentation. Malioutov and Barzilay (2006) show that the knowledge about long-range similarities between sentences improves segmentation quality. They cast segmentation as a graph-cutting problem. The document is represented as a graph: nodes are sentences and edges are weighted using a measure of lexical similarity. The graph is cut in a way which maximizes the net edge weight within each segment and minimizes the net weight of severed edges. Such Minimum Cut segmentation resembles APS the most among others mentioned in this paper. The main difference between the two is in different objective functions.","Another notable direction in text segmentation uses generative models to find segment boundaries. Eisenstein and Barzilay (2008) treat words in a sentence as draws from a multinomial language model. Segment boundaries are assigned so as to maximize the likelihood of observing the complete sequence. Misra et al. (2009) use a Latent Dirichlet alloca-tion topic model (Blei, Ng, and Jordan, 2003) to find coherent segment boundaries. Such methods output segment boundaries and suggest lexical distribution associated with each segment. Generative models tend to perform well, but are less flexible than the similarity-based models when it comes to incorporating new kinds of information.","Globally informed models generally perform better, especially on more challenging datasets such as speech recordings, but they have – unsurprisingly – higher memory and CPU time requirements.","The APS algorithm described in this paper combines several desirable properties. It is unsupervised and, unlike most other segmenters, does not require specifying the desired number of segments as an input parameter. On each iteration it takes into account the information about a large portion of the docu-","285 ment (or all of it). Because APS operates on a pre-compiled matrix of pair-wise sentence similarities, it is easy to incorporate new kinds of information, such as synonymy or adjacency. It also provides some information as to what the segment is about, because each segment is associated with a segment centre."]},{"title":"3 Factor graphs and affinity propagationfor clustering3.1 Factor graphs and the max-sum algorithm","paragraphs":["The APS algorithm is an instance of belief propagation on a cyclic factor graph. In order to explain the derivation of the algorithm, we will first briefly introduce factor graphs as a framework.","Many computational problems can be reduced to maximizing the value of a multi-variate function F (x1, . . . , xn) which can be approximated by a sum of simpler functions. In Equation 1, H is a set of discrete indices and fh is a local function with arguments Xh ⊂ {x1, . . . , xn}:","F (x1, . . . , xn) = ∑ h∈H fh(Xh) (1)","Factor graphs offer a concise graphical representation for such problems. A global function F which can be decomposed into a sum of M local function fh can be represented as a bi-partite graph with M function nodes and N variable nodes (M = |H|). Figure 1 shows an example of a factor graph for F (x1, x2, x3, x4) = f1(x1, x2, x3) + f2(x2, x3, x4). The factor (or function) nodes are dark squares, the variable nodes are light circles.","The well-known max-sum algorithm (Bishop, 2006) seeks a configuration of variables which maximizes the objective function. It finds the maximum in acyclic factor graphs, but in graphs with cycles neither convergence nor optimality are guaranteed (Pearl, 1982). Yet in practice good approximations can be achieved. The max-sum algorithm amounts to propagating messages from function nodes to variable nodes and from variable nodes to function nodes. A message sent from a variable node x to a function node f is computed as a sum of the incoming messages from all neighbours of x other than f (the sum is computed for each possible value of x): μx→f = ∑ f′ ∈N(x)\\f μf′","→x (2) Figure 1: Factor graph for F (x1, x2, x3, x4) = f1(x1, x2, x3) + f2(x2, x3, x4). f1 f2 x1 x2 x3 x4 N (x) is the set of all function nodes which are x’s neighbours.

The message reflects the evidence about the distribution of x from function f and its neighbours other than x.","A common message-passing schedule on cyclic factor graphs is flooding: iteratively passing all variable-to-function messages, then all function-to-variable messages. Upon convergence, the summary message reflecting final beliefs about the maximizing configuration of variables is computed as a sum of all incoming function-to-variable messages. 3.2 Affinity Propagation The APS algorithm described in this paper is a modification of the original Affinity Propagation algorithm intended for exemplar-based clustering (Frey and Dueck, 2007; Givoni and Frey, 2009). This section describes the binary variable formulation proposed by Givoni and Frey, and lays the groundwork for deriving the new update messages (Section 4).","Affinity Propagation for exemplar-based clustering is formulated as follows: to cluster N data points, one must specify a matrix of pairwise similarities {SIM(i, j)}i,j∈{1,...,N},i̸=j and a set of self-similarities (so-called preferences) SIM(j, j) which reflect a priori beliefs in how likely each data point is to be selected as an exemplar.

E and I, however, are binary constraints and evaluate to −∞ for most configurations. This drastically reduces the number of configurations which can maximize the message values. Given this simple fact, Givoni and Frey (2009) show how to reduce the necessary update messages to only two types of scalar ones: availabilities (α) and responsibilities (ρ).2","A responsibility message ρij, sent from a variable node cij to function node Ej, reflects the evidence of how likely j is to be an exemplar for i given all other potential exemplars:","ρij = SIM(i, j) − max k̸=j (SIM(i, k) + αik) (8) An availability message αij, sent from a function node Ej to a variable node cij, reflects how likely point j is to be an exemplar for i given the evidence from all other data points: αij =    ∑ k̸=j max[ρkj, 0] if i = j","min[0, ρjj + ∑ k /∈{i,j} max[ρkj, 0]] if i ̸= j (9) Let γij(l) be the message value corresponding to setting variable cij to l, l ∈ {0, 1}.

Fortunately, the messages sent to and from E factors to the variable nodes subsume the three other message types and it is not necessary to compute them explicitly. See (Givoni and Frey, 2009, p.195) for details. 287 Figure 3: Examples of valid configuration of hidden variables {cij} for clustering and segmentation.

When clustering is the objective, a cluster may consist of points coming from anywhere in the data sequence. When segmentation is the objective, a segment must consist of a solid block of points around the segment centre.

M usually needs to be at least twice the maximum segment length or thrice the average segment length. Each iteration, then, involves sending 2M N messages and the storage requirements are also O(M N ).","As is common in loopy belief propagation algorithms, both availability and responsibility messages are dampened to avoid overshooting and oscillating.

The first, compiled by Malioutov and Barzilay (2006), consists of manually transcribed and segmented lectures on Artificial Intelligence, 3 development files and 19 test files. The second dataset consists of 227 chapters from medical textbooks (Eisenstein and Barzilay, 2008), 5 of which we use for development. In this dataset the gold standard segment boundaries correspond to section breaks specified by the authors. The third dataset consists of 85 works of fiction downloaded from Project Gutenberg, 3 of which are used for development. The segment boundaries correspond to chapter breaks or to breaks between individual stories. They were inserted automatically using HTML markup in the downloaded files.","The datasets exhibit different characteristics. The lecture dataset and the fiction dataset are challenging because they are less cohesive than medical textbooks. The textbooks are cognitively more difficult to process and the authors rely on repetition of terminology to facilitate comprehension. Since lexical repetition is the main source of information for text segmentation, we expect a higher performance on this dataset. Transcribed speech, on the other hand, is considerably less cohesive. The lecturer makes an effort to speak in “plain language” and to be comprehensible, relying less on terminology. The use of pronouns is very common, as is the use of examples.","Repeated use of the same words is also uncommon in fiction. In addition, the dataset was compiled automatically using HTML markup. The markup is not always reliable and occasionally the e-book proofreaders skip it altogether, which potentially adds noise to the dataset.","Baselines. We compare the performance of APS with that of two state-of-the-art segmenters: the Minimum Cut segmenter (Malioutov and Barzilay, 2006) and the Bayesian segmenter (Eisenstein and Barzilay, 2008). The authors have made Java implementations publicly available. For the Minimum Cut segmenter, we select the best parameters using the script included with that distribution. The Bayesian segmenter automatically estimates all necessary parameters from the data.","Preprocessing and the choice of similarity metric. As described in Section 4, the APS algorithm takes as inputs a matrix of pairwise similarities between sentences in the document and also, for each sentence, a preference value.","This paper focuses on comparing globally informed segmentation algorithms, and leaves for future work the exploration of best similarity metrics. To allow fair comparison, then, we use the same metric as the Minimum Cut segmenter, cosine similarity. Each sentence is represented as a vector of token-type frequencies. Following (Malioutov and Barzilay, 2006), the frequency vectors are smoothed by adding counts of words from the adjacent sentences and then weighted using a tf.idf metric (for details, see ibid.) The similarity between sentence vectors s1 and s2 is computed as follows: cos(s1, s2) =","s1 • s2 ||s1|| × ||s2|| (20) The representation used by the Bayesian segmenter is too different to be incorporated into our model directly, but ultimately it is based on the distribution of unigrams in documents. This is close enough to our representation to allow fair comparison.","The fiction dataset consists of books: novels or collections of short stories. Fiction is known to exhibit less lexical cohesion. That is why – when working on this dataset – we work at the paragraph level: the similarity is measured not between sentences but between paragraphs. We use this representation with all three segmenters.","All parameters have been fine-tuned on the development portions of the datasets.

According to a one-tailed paired t-test with 95% confidence cut-off, the improvement is statistically significant only on the fiction dataset. All datasets are challenging and the baselines are very competitive, so drawing definitive conclusions is difficult. Still, we can be fairly confident that APS performs at least as well as the other two segmenters. It also has certain advantages.","One important difference between APS and the other segmenters is that APS does not require the number of segments as an input parameter. This is very helpful, because such information is generally unavailable in any realistic deployment setting. The parameters are fine-tuned to maximize WindowDiff values, so this results in high-precision, low-recall segment assignments; that is because WindowDiff favours missing boundaries over near-hits.","APS also outputs segment centres, thus providing some information about a segment’s topic. We have not evaluated how descriptive the segment centres are; this is left for future work.","APS performs slightly better than the other segmenters but not by much. We hypothesize that one of the reasons is that APS relies on the presence of descriptive segment centres which are not necessarily present for large, coarse-grained segments such as chapters in novels. It is possible for APS to have an advantage performing fine-grained segmentation."]},{"title":"7 Conclusions and Future Work","paragraphs":["In this paper we have presented APS – a new algorithm for linear text segmentation. APS takes into account the global structure of the document and outputs segment boundaries and segment centres. It scales linearly in the number of input sentences, performs competitively with the state-of-the-art and is easy to implement. We also provide a Java implementation of the APS segmenter.","We consider two main directions for future work: using more informative similarity metrics and mak-ing the process of segmentation hierarchical. We chose to use cosine similarity primarily to allow fair comparison and to judge the algorithm itself, in isolation from the information it uses. Cosine similarity is a very simple metric which cannot provide an adequate picture of topic fluctuations in documents. It is likely that dictionary-based or corpus-based similarity measures would yield a major improvement in performance.","Reliance on descriptive segment centres may handicap APS’s performance when looking for coarse-grained segments. One possible remedy is to look for shorter segments first and then merge them. One can also modify the algorithm to perform hierarchical segmentation: consider net similarity with low-level segment centres as well as with high-level ones. We plan to explore both possibilities.","292"]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["We thank Inmar Givoni for explaining the details of binary Affinity Propagation and for comment-ing on our early ideas in this project.
