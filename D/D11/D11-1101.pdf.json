Connotation lexicons differ from sentiment lexicons that are studied in much of previous research (e.g., Esuli and Sebastiani (2006), Wilson et al. (2005a)): the latter concerns words that express sentiment either explicitly or implicitly, while the former concerns words that evoke or even simply associate with a specific polarity of sentiment. To our knowledge, there has been no previous research that investigates polarized connotation lexicons.","Understanding the connotation of words would seem to require common sense and world knowledge at first glance, which in turn might seem to require human encoding of knowledge base. However, we demonstrate that much of the connotative polarity of words can be inferred from natural language text in a nearly unsupervised manner.","The key linguistic insight behind our approach is selectional preference of connotative predicates. We define a connotative predicate as a predicate that has selectional preference on the connotative polarity of some of its semantic arguments. For instance, in the case of the connotative predicate “prevent”, there is strong selectional preference on negative connotation with respect to the thematic role (semantic role) “THEME”. That is, statistically speak-ing, people tend to associate negative connotation with the THEME of “prevent”, e.g., “prevent can-cer” or “prevent war”, rather than positive connotation, e.g., “prevent promotion”. In other words, even though it is perfectly valid to use words with positive connotation in the THEME role of “prevent”, statistically more dominant connotative polarity is negative. Similarly, the THEME of “congratulate” or “praise” has strong selectional preference on positive connotation.","The theoretical concept supporting the selective","1092 accomplish, achieve, advance, advocate, admire, applaud, appreciate, compliment, congratulate, develop, desire, enhance, enjoy, improve, praise, promote, respect, save, support, win Table 1: Positively Connotative Predicates w.r.t.

THEME preference of connotative predicates is that of semantic prosody in corpus linguistics. Semantic prosody describes how some of the seemingly neutral words (e.g., “cause”) can be perceived with positive or negative polarity because they tend to collocate with words with corresponding polarity (e.g., Sinclair (1991), Louw et al. (1993), Stubbs (1995), Stefanowitsch and Gries (2003)). In this work, we demonstrate that statistical approaches that exploit this very concept of semantic prosody can successfully infer connotative polarity of words.","Having described the key linguistic insight, we now illustrate our graph-based algorithms. Figure 1 depicts the mutually reinforcing relation between connotative predicates (nodes on the left-hand side) and words with connotative polarity (node on the right-hand side). The thickness of edges represents the strength of the association between predicates and arguments. For brevity, we only consider connotation of words that appear in the THEME thematic role.","We expect that words that appear often in the THEME role of various positively (or negatively) connotative predicates are likely to be words with positive (or negative) connotation. Likewise, predicates whose THEME contains words with mostly positive (or negative) connotation are likely to be positively (or negatively) connotative predicates. In short, we can induce the connotative polarity of words using connotative predicates, and inversely, we can learn new connotative predicates based on words with connotative polarity.","We hypothesize that this mutually reinforcing re-Prevent Avoid Alleviate Cancer Incident Promotion Overcome Tragedy Figure 1: Bipartite graph of connotative predicates and arguments. Edge weights are proportionate to the association strength. lation between connotative predicates and their arguments can be captured via graph centrality in graph-based algorithms. Given a small set of seed words for connotative predicates, our algorithms collectively learn connotation lexicon together with connotative predicates in a nearly unsupervised manner. A number of different graph representa-tions are explored using both PageRank (Page et al., 1999) and HITS (Kleinberg, 1999) algorithms. Empirical study demonstrates that our graph based algorithms are highly effective in learning both connotation lexicon and connotative predicates.","Finally, we quantify the practical value of our connotation lexicon in concrete sentiment analysis applications, and demonstrate that the connotation lexicon is of great value for sentiment classification tasks complementing conventional sentiment lexicons."]},{"title":"2 Connotation Lexicon & ConnotativePredicate","paragraphs":["In this section, we define connotation lexicon and connotative predicates more formally, and contrast them against words in conventional sentiment lexicons. 2.1 Connotation Lexicon This lexicon lists words with positive and negative connotation, as defined below. • Words with positive connotation: In this work, we define words with positive connotation as those that describe physical objects or abstract concepts that people generally value, cherish or care about. For instance, we regard words such as “freedom”, “life”, or “health” as 1093 words with positive connotation. Some of these words may express subjectivity either explicitly or implicitly, e.g., “joy” or “satisfaction”. However, a substantial number of words with positive connotation are purely objective, such as “life”, “health”, “tenure”, or “scientific”.","• Words with negative connotation: We define words with negative connotation as those that describe physical objects or abstract concepts that people generally disvalue or avoid. Similarly as before, some of these words may express subjectivity (e.g., “disappointment”, “humiliation”), while many other are purely objective (e.g., “bedbug”, “arthritis, “funeral”). Note that this explicit and intentional inclusion of objective terms makes connotation lexicons differ from sentiment lexicons: most conventional sentiment lexicons have focused on subjective words by definition (e.g., Wilson et al. (2005b)), as many researchers use the term sentiment and subjectivity in-terchangeably (e.g., Wiebe et al. (2005)). 2.2 Connotative Predicate In this work, connotative predicates are those that exhibit selectional preference on the connotative polarity of some of their arguments. We emphasize that the polarity of connotative predicates does not coincide with the polarity of sentiment in conventional sentiment lexicons, as will be elaborated below. • Positively connotative predicate: In this work, we define positively connotative predicates as those that expect positive connotation in some arguments. For example, “congratulate” or “save” are positively connotative predicates that expect words with positive connotation in the THEME argument: people typically congratulate something positive, and save something people care about. More examples are shown in Table 1. • Negatively connotative predicate: In this work, we define negatively connotative predicates as those that expect negative connotation in some arguments. For instance, predicates such as “prevent” or “suffer” tend to project negative connotation in the THEME argument. More examples are shown in Table 2. Note that positively connotative predicates are not necessarily positive sentiment words. For instance “save” is not a positive sentiment word in the lexicon published by Wilson et al. (2005b). In-versely, (strongly) positive sentiment words are not necessarily (strongly) positively connotative predicates, e.g., “illuminate”, “agree”. Likewise, negatively connotative predicates are not necessarily negative sentiment words. For instance, predicates such as “prevent”, “detect”, or “cause” are not negative sentiment words, but they tend to correlate with negative connotation in the THEME argument. Inversely, (strongly) negative sentiment words are not necessarily (strongly) negatively connotative predicates, e.g., “abandon” (“abandoned [something valuable]”)."]},{"title":"3 Graph Representation","paragraphs":["In this section, we explore the graphical representation of our task. Figure 1 depicts the key intuition as a bipartite graph, where the nodes on the left-hand side correspond to connotative predicates, and the nodes on the right-hand side correspond to words in the THEME argument. There is an edge between a predicate p and an argument a, if the argument a appears in the THEME role of the predicate p. For brevity, we explore only verbs as the predicates, and words in the THEME role of the predicates as arguments. Our work can be readily extended to exploit other predicate-argument relations however.","Note that there are many sources of noise in the construction of graph. For instance, some of the predicates might be negated, changing the semantic dynamics between the predicate and the argument. In addition, there might be many unusual combinations of predicates and arguments, either due to data processing errors or due to idiosyncratic use of language. Some of such combinations can be valid ones (e.g., “prevent promotion”), challenging the learning algorithm with confusing evidence.","We hypothesize that by focusing on the important part of the graph via centrality analysis , it is possible to infer connotative polarity of words despite various noise introduced in the graph structure. This implies that it is important to construct the graph structure so as to capture important linguistic relations between predicates and arguments. With this goal in mind,","1094 we next explore the directionality of the edges and different strategies to assign weights to them. 3.1 Undirected (Symmetric) Graph First we explore undirected edges. In this case, we assign weight for each undirected edge between a predicate p and an argument a. Intuitively, the weight should correspond to the strength of relatedness or association between the predicate p and the argument a. We use Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI), as it has been used by many previous research to quantify the association between two words (e.g., Turney (2001), Church and Hanks (1990)). The PMI score between p and a is defined as follows:","w(p − a) := P M I(p, a) = log P (p, a) P (p)P (a) The log of the ratio is positive when the pair of words tends to co-occur and negative when the presence of one word correlates with the absence of the other word. 3.2 Directed (Asymmetric) Graph Next we explore directed edges. That is, for each connected pair of a predicate p and an argument a, there are two edges in opposite directions: e(p → a) and e(a → p). In this case, we explore the use of asymmetric weights using conditional probabil-ity. In particular, we define weights as follows:","w(p → a) := P (a|p) = P (p, a) P (p)","w(a → p) := P (p|a) = P (p, a) P (a) Having defined the graph structure, next we explore algorithms that analyze graph centrality via random walks. In particular, we investigate the use of HITS algorithm (Section 4), and PageRank (Section 5)."]},{"title":"4 Lexicon Induction using HITS","paragraphs":["The graph representation described thus far (Section 3) captures general semantic relations between predicates and arguments, rather than those specific to connotative predicates and arguments. Therefore in this section, we explore techniques to augment the graph representation so as to bias the centrality of the graph toward connotative predicates and arguments.","In order to establish a learning bias, we start with a small set of seed words for just connotative predicates. We use 20 words for each polarity, as listed in Table 1 and Table 2. These seed words act as prior knowledge in our learning. We explore two different techniques to incorporate prior knowledge into random walk, as will be elaborated in Section 4.2 & 4.3, followed by brief description of HITS in Section 4.1. 4.1 Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS) HITS (Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search) algorithm (Kleinberg, 1999), also known as Hubs and authorities, is a link analysis algorithm that is particularly suitable to model mutual reinforcement between two different types of nodes: hubs and authorities. The definitions of hubs and authorities are given recursively. A (good) hub is a node that points to many (good) authorities, and a (good) authority is a node pointed by many (good) hubs.","Notice that the mutually reinforcing relation-ship is precisely what we intend to model between connotative predicates and arguments. Let G = (P, A, E) be the bipartite graph, where P is the set of nodes corresponding to connotative predicates, A is the set of nodes corresponding to arguments, and E is the set of edges among nodes. (Pi, Aj) ∈ E if and only if the predicate Pi and the argument Ai occur together as a predicate – argument pair in the corpus. The co-occurrence matrix derived from our corpus is denoted as L, where Lij =","{ w(i, j) if (Pi, Aj) ∈ E 0 otherwise The value of w(i, j) is set to w(i − j) as defined in Section 3.1 for undirected graphs, and w(i → j) defined in Section 3.2 for directed graphs.","Let a(Ai) and h(Ai) be the authority and hub score respectively, for a given node Ai ∈ A. Then we compute the authority and hub score recursively as follows: a(Ai) = ∑ Pi,Aj∈E w(i, j)h(Aj) + ∑ Pj,Ai∈E h(Pj)w(j, i) h(Ai) = ∑ Pi,Aj∈E w(i, j)a(Aj) + ∑ Pj,Ai∈E a(Pj)w(j, i) 1095 The scores a(Pi) and h(Pi) for Pi ∈ P are defined similarly as above.","In what follows, we describe two different techniques to incorporate prior knowledge. Note that it is possible to apply each of the following techniques to both directed and undirected graph representa-tions introduced in Section 3. Also note that for each technique, we construct two separate graphs G+","and G−","corresponding to positive and negative polarity respectively. That is, G+","learns positively connotative predicates and arguments, while G−","learns negatively connotative predicates and arguments. 4.2 Prior Knowledge via Truncated Graph First we introduce a method based on graph truncation. In this method, when constructing the bipartite graph, we limit the set of predicates P to only those words in the seed set, instead of including all words that can be predicates. In a way, the truncated graph representation can be viewed as the query induced graph on which the original HITS algorithm was invented (Kleinberg, 1999).","The truncated graph is very effective in reducing the level of noise that can be introduced by predicates of the opposite polarity. It may seem like we cannot discover new connotative predicates in the truncated graph however, as the graph structure is limited only to the seed predicates. We address this issue by alternating truncation to different side of the graph, i.e., left (predicates) or right (arguments), as illustrated in Figure 1, through multiple rounds of HITS.","For instance, we start with the graph G = (P o",", A, E(P o",")) that is truncated only on the left-hand side, with the seed predicates P o",". Here, E(P o",") denotes the reduced set of edges discarding those edges that connect to predicates not in P o",". Then, we apply HITS algorithm until convergence to discover new words with connotation, and this completes the first round of HITS.","Next we begin the second round. Let Ao","be the new words with connotation that are found in the first round. We now set Ao","as seed words for the second phase of HITS, where we construct a new graph G = (P, Ao",", E(Ao",")) that is truncated only on the right-hand side, with full candidate words for predicates included on the left-hand side. This alternation can be repeated multiple times to discover many new connotative predicates and arguments. 4.3 Prior Knowledge via Focussed Graph In the truncated graph described above, one potential concern is that the discovery of new words with connotation is limited to those that happen to correlate well with the seed predicates. To mitigate this problem, we explore an alternative technique based on the full graph, which we will name as focussed graph.","In this method, instead of truncating the graph, we simply emphasize the important portion of the graph via edge weights. That is, we assign high weights to those edges that connect a seed predicate with an argument, while assigning low weights for those edges that connect to a predicate outside the seed set. This way, we allow predicates not in the seed set to participate in hubs and authority scores, but in a much suppressed way. This method can be interpreted as a smoothed version of the truncated graph described in Section 4.2.","More formally, if the node Ai is connected to the seed predicate Pj, the value of co-occurrence matrix Lij is defined by prior knowledge(e.g. P M I(Ai, Pj) or P (Ai|Pj) ), otherwise a small constant ε is assigned to the edge. Lij =","{ w(i, j) if Pj ∈ Eo ε otherwise","Similarly to the truncated graph, we proceed with multiple rounds of HITS, focusing different part of the bipartite graph alternately."]},{"title":"5 Lexicon Induction using PageRank","paragraphs":["In this section, we explore the use of another popular approach for link analysis: PageRank (Page et al., 1999). We first describe PageRank algorithm briefly in Section 5.1, then introduce two different techniques to incorporate prior knowledge in Section 5.2 and 5.3. 5.1 PageRank Let G = (V, E) be the graph, where vi ∈ V = P ∪ A are nodes (words) for the disjunctive set of predicates (P ) and arguments (A), and e(i,j) ∈ E are edges. Let In(i) be the set of nodes with an edge leading to ni and similarly, Out(i) be the set","1096 of nodes that ni has an edge leading to. At a given iteration of the algorithm, we update the score of ni as follows:","S(i) = α ∑ j∈In(i) S(j) × w(i, j)","|Out(i)| + (1 − α) (1) where the value α is constant damping factor. The value of α is typically set to 0.85. The value of w(i, j) is set to w(i − j) as defined in Section 3.1 for undirected graphs, and w(i → j) as defined in Section 3.2 for directed graphs. As before, we will consider two different techniques to incorporate prior knowledge into the graph analysis as follows. 5.2 Prior Knowledge via Truncated Graph Unlike HITS, which was originally invented for a query-induced graph, PageRank is typically applied to the full graph. However, we can still apply the truncation technique introduced in Section 4.2 to PageRank as well. To do so, when constructing the bipartite graph, we limit the set of predicates P to only those words in the seed set, instead of including all words that can be predicates. Graph truncation eliminates the noise that can be introduced by predicates of the opposite polarity. However, in order to learn new predicates, we need to perform multiple rounds of PageRank, truncating different side of the bipartite graph alternately. Refer to Section 4.2 for futher details. 5.3 Prior Knowledge via Teleportation We next explore what is known as teleportation technique for topic sensitive PageRank (Haveliwala, 2002). For this, we use the following equation that is slightly augmented from Equation 1.","S(i) = α ∑ j∈In(i) S(j) × w(i, j)","|Out(i)| + (1 − α) εi (2) Here, the new term εi is a smoothing factor that prevents cliques in the graph from garnering reputation through feedback (Bianchini et al. (2005)). In order to emphasize important portion of the graph, i.e., subgraphs connected to the seed set, we assign nonzero ε scores to only those important nodes, i.e., the seed set. Intuitively, this will cause the random walk to restart from the seed set with (1 − α) = 0.15 probability for each step."]},{"title":"6 The Use of Google Web 1T Data","paragraphs":["In order to implement the network of connotative predicates and arguments, we need a substantially large amount of documents. The quality of the co-occurrence statistics is expected to be proportionate to the size of corpus, but collecting and processing such a large amount of data is not trivial. We therefore resort to the Google Web 1T data (Brants and Franz., 2006), which consists of Google n-gram counts (frequency of occurrence of each n-gram) for 1 ≤ n ≤ 5. The use of Web 1T data will lessen the challenge with respect to data acquisition, while still allowing us to enjoy the co-occurrence statistics of web-scale data. Because Web 1T data is just n-gram statistics, rather than a collection of normal documents, it does not provide co-occurrence statistics of any random word pairs. However, it provides a nice approximation to the particular co-occurrence statistics we are interested in, which are, predicate – argument pairs. This is because the THEME argument of a verb predicate is typically on the right hand side of the predicate, and the argument is within the close range of the predicate.","We now describe how to derive co-occurrence statistics of each predicate – argument pair using the Web 1T data. For a given predicate p and an argument a, we add up the count (frequency) of all n-grams (2 ≤ n ≤ 5) that match the following pattern:","[p] [⋆]n−2 [a] where p must be the first word (head), a must be the last word (tail), and [⋆]n−2","matches any n − 2 number of words between p and a. Note that this rule enforces the argument a to be on the right hand side of the predicate p. To reduce the level of noise, we do not allow the wildcard [⋆] to match any punctuation mark, as such n-grams are likely to cross sentence boundaries representing invalid predicate – argument relations. We consider a word as a predicate if it is tagged as a verb by a Part-of-Speech tagger (Toutanova and Manning, 2000). For argument [a], we only consider content-words.","The use of web n-gram statistics necessarily in-vites certain kinds of noise. For instance, some of the [p] [⋆]n−2","[a] patterns might not correspond to a valid predicate – argument relation.

Using the pattern [p] [⋆]n−2","[a] (see Section 6), we collect two sets of n-gram records: one set using the positive connotative predicates, and the other using the negative connotative predicates. With respect to each set, we calculate the following for each word a, • Given [a], the number of unique [p] as f 1 • Given [a], the number of unique phrases [⋆]n−2","as f 2 • The number of occurrences of [a] as f 3 We then obtain the score σa+ for positive connotation and σa− for negative connotation using the following equations that take a linear combination of f 1, f 2, and f 3 that we computed above with respect to each polarity. σa+ = α × σf1+ + β × σf2+ + γ × σf3+ (3) σa− = α × σf1− + β × σf2− + γ × σf3− (4) Note that the coefficients α, β and γ are determined experimentally. We assign positive polarity to the word a, if σa+ >> σa− and vice versa. 7.1 Comparison against Sentiment Lexicon The polarity defined in the connotation lexicon differs from that of conventional sentiment lexicons in which we aim to recognize more subtle sentiment that correlates with words. Nevertheless, we provide agreement statistics between our connotation lexicon and conventional sentiment lexicons for comparison purposes. We collect statistics with respect to the following two resources: General Inquirer (Stone and Hunt, 1963) and Opinion Finder (Wilson et al., 2005b). For polarity λ ∈ {+, −}, let countsentlex(λ) denote the total number of words labeled as λ in a given sentiment lexicon, and let countagreement(λ) denote the total number of words labeled as λ by both the given sentiment lexicon and our connotation lexicon. In addition, let countoverlap(λ) denote the total number of words that are labeled as λ by our connotation lexicon that are also included in the reference lexicon with or without the same polarity. Then we compute precλ as follows:","precλ % = countagreement(λ) countoverlap(λ) × 100 We compare precλ % for three different segments of our lexicon: the top 100, top 1000, and the entire lexicon. We compare the lexicons provided by the seven variations of our algorithm. Results are shown in Table 3 & 4.","The acronym of each different method is defined as follows: HITS-sT & HITS-aT correspond to the Symmetric (undirected) and Asymmetric (directed) version of the Truncated method respectively.

Finally, Page-aT & Page-aF correspond to the Truncation and teleportation (Focused) respectively.","Asymmetric HITS on a directed truncated graph (HITS-aT) and topic-sensitive PageRank (Page-aF) achieve the best performance in most cases, especially for top ranked words which have a higher average frequency. The difference between these two top performers is not large, but statistically significant using wilcoxon test with p < 0.03. Standard PageRank (Page-aT) achieves the third best performance overall. All these top performing ones (HITS-aT, Page-aF, Page-aT) outperform the baseline approach (FREQ) statistically significantly with p < 0.001. For brevity, we omit the PageRank results based on the undirected graphs, as the performance of those was not as good as that of directed ones. 7.2 Extrinsic Evaluation via Sentiment Analysis Next we perform extrinsic evaluation to quantify the practical value of our connotation lexicon in concrete sentiment analysis applications. In particular, we make use of our connotation lexicon for binary sentiment classification tasks in two different ways:","• Unsupervised classification by voting. We define r as the ratio of positive polarity words to negative polarity words in the lexicon. In our experiment, penalty is 0 for positive and −0.5 for negative. score(x+) = 1 + penalty+(r, #positive) score(x−) = −1 + penalty−(r, #negative)","• Supervised classification using SVM. We use bag-of-words features for baseline. In order to quantify the effect of different lexicons, we add additional features based on the following scores as defined below:","scoreraw(x) = ∑ wεx s(w) scorepurity(x) = scoreraw(x)","∑ wεx abs(s(w)) The two corpora we use are SemEval2007 (Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2007) and Sentiment Twitter.1 The Twitter dataset consists of tweets containing either a smiley emoticon (representing positive sentiment) or a frowny emoticon (representing negative sentiment), we randomly select 50000 smiley tweets and 50000 frowny tweets.2","We perform a 5-fold cross validation.","In Table 8, we find very promising results, particularly for Twitter dataset, which is known to be very noisy. Notice that the use of Top 6k words from our connotation lexicon along with OpinionFinder lexicon boost the performance up to 78.0%, which is significantly better than than 71.4% using only the conventional OpinionFinder lexicon. This result shows that our connotation lexicon nicely complements existing sentiment lexicon, improving practical sentiment analysis tasks. 1 http://www.stanford.edu/̃alecmgo/cs224n/twitterdata.","2009.05.25.c.zip 2 We filter out stop-words and words appearing less than 3","times.

Human judges are asked to quantify the degree of connotative polarity of each given word using an integer value between 1 and 5, where 1 and 5 correspond to the most negative and positive connotation respectively. When computing the annotator agreement score or evaluating our connotation lexicon against human judgment, we consolidate 1 and 2 into a single negative class and 4 and 5 into a single positive class. The Kappa score between two human annotators is 0.78.","As a control set, we also include 100 words taken from the General Inquirer lexicon: 50 words with positive sentiment, and 50 words with negative sentiment. These words are included so as to measure the quality of human judgment against a wellestablished sentiment lexicon. The words were presented in a random order so that the human judges will not know which words are from the General Inquirer lexicon and which are from our connotative lexicon. For the words in the control set, the annotators achieved 94% (97% lenient) accuracy on the positive set and 97% on the negative set.","Note that some words appear in both positive and negative connotation graphs, while others appear in only one of them. For instance, if a given word x appears as an argument for only positive connotative predicates, but never for negative ones, then x would appear only in the positive connotation graph. This means that for such word, we can assume the connotative polarity even without applying the algorithms for graph centrality. Therefore, we first evaluate the accuracy of the polarity of such words that appear only in one of the connotation graphs. We discard words with low frequency (300 in terms of Google n-gram frequency), and randomly select 50 words from each polarity. The accuracy of such words is 88% by strict evaluation and 94.5% by lenient evaluation, where lenient evaluation counts words in our polarized connotation lexicon to be correct if the human judges assign non-conflicting polarities, i.e., either neutral or identical polarity.","For words that appear in both positive and negative connotation graphs, we determine the final polarity of such words as one with higher scores given by HITS or PageRank. We randomly select words that rank at 5% of top 100, top 1000, top 2000, and top 5000 by each algorithm for human judgment. We only evaluate the top performing algorithms – HITS-aT and Page-aF – and FREQ baseline. The stratified performance for each of these methods is given in Table 9."]},{"title":"8 Related Work","paragraphs":["Graph based approaches have been used in many previous research for lexicon induction.

We are not aware of any previous research that made use of HITS algorithm for connotation or sentiment lexicon induction.","Much of previous research investigated the use of dictionary network (e.g., WordNet) for lexicon in-duction (e.g., Kamps et al. (2004), Takamura et al. (2005), Adreevskaia and Bergler (2006), Esuli and Sebastiani (2006), Su and Markert (2009), Mohammad et al. (2009)), while relatively less research investigated the use of web documents (e.g., Kaji and Kitsuregawa (2007), Velikovich et al. (2010))).","Wilson et al. (2005b) first introduced the sentiment lexicon, spawning a great deal of research thereafter. At the beginning, sentiment lexicons were designed to include only those words that express sentiment, that is, subjective words. However in recent years, sentiment lexicons started expand-ing to include some of those words that simply associate with sentiment, even if those words are purely objective (e.g., Velikovich et al. (2010), Baccianella et al. (2010)). This trend applies even to the most recent version of the lexicon of Wilson et al. (2005b). We conjecture that this trend of broader coverage suggests that such lexicons are practically more use-ful than sentiment lexicons that include only those words that are strictly subjective. In this work, we make this transition more explicit and intentional, by introducing a novel connotation lexicon.","Mohammad and Turney (2010) focussed on emotion evoked by common words and phrases. The spirit of their work shares some similarity with ours in that it aims to find the emotion evoked by words, as opposed to expressed. Two main differences are: (1) our work aims to discover even more subtle association of words with sentiment, and (2) we present a nearly unsupervised approach, while Mohammad and Turney (2010) explored the use of Mechanical Turk to build the lexicon based on human judgment.","In the work of Osgood et al. (1957), it has been discussed that connotative meaning of words can be measured in multiple scales of semantic differential, for example, the degree of “goodness” and “badness”. Our work presents statistical approaches that measure one such semantic differential automatically. Our graph construction to capture word-to-word relation is analogous to that of Collins-Thompson and Callan (2007), where the graph representation was used to model more general definitions of words."]},{"title":"9 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We introduced the connotation lexicon, a novel lexicon that list words with connotative polarity, which will be made publically available. We also presented graph-based algorithms for learning connotation lexicon together with connotative predicates in a nearly unsupervised manner. Our approaches are grounded on the linguistic insight with respect to the selectional preference of connotative predicates. Empirical study demonstrates the practical value of the connotation lexicon for sentiment analysis encouraging further research in this direction."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["We wholeheartedly thank the reviewers for very helpful and insightful comments."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Alina Adreevskaia and Sabine Bergler. 2006.
