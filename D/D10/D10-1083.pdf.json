Simply assigning to each word its most frequent associated tag in a corpus achieves 94.6% accuracy on the WSJ portion of the Penn Treebank. This distributional sparsity of syntactic tags is not unique to English","1","The source code for the work presented in this paper is available at http://groups.csail.mit.edu/rbg/code/typetagging/. — similar results have been observed across multiple languages. Clearly, explicitly modeling such a powerful constraint on tagging assignment has a potential to significantly improve the accuracy of an unsupervised part-of-speech tagger learned without a tagging dictionary.","In practice, this sparsity constraint is difficult to incorporate in a traditional POS induction system (Mérialdo, 1994; Johnson, 2007; Gao and Johnson, 2008; Graca̧ et al., 2009; Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2010). These sequence models-based approaches commonly treat token-level tag assignment as the primary latent variable. By design, they readily capture regularities at the token-level. However, these approaches are ill-equipped to directly represent type-based constraints such as sparsity. Previous work has attempted to incorporate such constraints into token-level models via heavy-handed modifications to inference procedure and objective function (e.g., posterior regularization and ILP decoding) (Graca̧ et al., 2009; Ravi and Knight, 2009). In most cases, however, these expansions come with a steep increase in model complexity, with respect to training procedure and inference time.","In this work, we take a more direct approach and treat a word type and its allowed POS tags as a primary element of the model. The model starts by generating a tag assignment for each word type in a vocabulary, assuming one tag per word. Then, token-level HMM emission parameters are drawn conditioned on these assignments such that each word is only allowed probability mass on a single assigned tag. In this way we restrict the parameterization of a 853 Language Original case English 94.6 Danish 96.3 Dutch 96.6 German 95.5 Spanish 95.4 Swedish 93.3 Portuguese 95.6 Table 1: Upper bound on tagging accuracy assuming each word type is assigned to majority POS tag. Across all languages, high performance can be attained by selecting a single tag per word type. token-level HMM to reflect lexicon sparsity. This model admits a simple Gibbs sampling algorithm where the number of latent variables is proportional to the number of word types, rather than the size of a corpus as for a standard HMM sampler (Johnson, 2007).","There are two key benefits of this model architecture. First, it directly encodes linguistic intuitions about POS tag assignments: the model structure reflects the one-tag-per-word property, and a type-level tag prior captures the skew on tag assignments (e.g., there are fewer unique determiners than unique nouns). Second, the reduced number of hidden variables and parameters dramatically speeds up learning and inference.","We evaluate our model on seven languages exhibiting substantial syntactic variation. On several languages, we report performance exceeding that of state-of-the art systems. Our analysis identifies three key factors driving our performance gain: 1) selecting a model structure which directly encodes tag sparsity, 2) a type-level prior on tag assignments, and 3) a straightforward naı̈ve-Bayes approach to incorporate features. The observed performance gains, coupled with the simplicity of model implementation, makes it a compelling alternative to existing more complex counterparts."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Recent work has made significant progress on unsupervised POS tagging (Mérialdo, 1994; Smith and Eisner, 2005; Haghighi and Klein, 2006; Johnson, 2007; Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007; Gao and Johnson, 2008; Ravi and Knight, 2009). Our work is closely related to recent approaches that incorporate the sparsity constraint into the POS induction process. This line of work has been motivated by empirical findings that the standard EM-learned unsupervised HMM does not exhibit sufficient word tag sparsity.","The extent to which this constraint is enforced varies greatly across existing methods. On one end of the spectrum are clustering approaches that assign a single POS tag to each word type (Schutze, 1995; Lamar et al., 2010). These clusters are computed using an SVD variant without relying on transitional structure. While our method also enforces a singe tag per word constraint, it leverages the transition distribution encoded in an HMM, thereby benefiting from a richer representation of context.","Other approaches encode sparsity as a soft constraint. For instance, by altering the emission distribution parameters, Johnson (2007) encourages the model to put most of the probability mass on few tags. This design does not guarantee “structural zeros,” but biases towards sparsity. A more forceful approach for encoding sparsity is posterior regularization, which constrains the posterior to have a small number of expected tag assignments (Graca̧ et al., 2009). This approach makes the training objective more complex by adding linear constraints proportional to the number of word types, which is rather prohibitive. A more rigid mechanism for modeling sparsity is proposed by Ravi and Knight (2009), who minimize the size of tagging grammar as measured by the number of transition types. The use of ILP in learning the desired grammar significantly increases the computational complexity of this method.","In contrast to these approaches, our method directly incorporates these constraints into the structure of the model. This design leads to a significant reduction in the computational complexity of training and inference.","Another thread of relevant research has explored the use of features in unsupervised POS induction (Smith and Eisner, 2005; Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2010; Hasan and Ng, 2009). These methods demonstrated the benefits of incorporating linguistic features using a log-linear parameterization, but requires elaborate machinery for training. In our 854 work, we demonstrate that using a simple naı̈ve-Bayes approach also yields substantial performance gains, without the associated training complexity."]},{"title":"3 Generative Story","paragraphs":["We consider the unsupervised POS induction problem without the use of a tagging dictionary. A graphical depiction of our model as well as a summary of random variables and parameters can be found in Figure 1. As is standard, we use a fixed constantK for the number of tagging states. Model Overview The model starts by generating a tag assignment T for each word type in a vocabulary, assuming one tag per word. Conditioned on T , features of word types W are drawn. We refer to (T , W ) as the lexicon of a language and ψ for the parameters for their generation; ψ depends on a single hyperparameter β.","Once the lexicon has been drawn, the model proceeds similarly to the standard token-level HMM: Emission parameters θ are generated conditioned on tag assignments T . We also draw transition parameters φ. Both parameters depend on a single hyperparameter α. Once HMM parameters (θ, φ) are drawn, a token-level tag and word sequence, (t, w), is generated in the standard HMM fashion: a tag sequence t is generated from φ. The corresponding token words w are drawn conditioned on t and θ.2 Our full generative model is given by: P (T , W , θ, ψ, φ, t, w|α, β) = P (T , W , ψ|β) [Lexicon] P (φ, θ|T , α, β) [Parameter] P (w, t|φ, θ) [Token] We refer to the components on the right hand side as the lexicon, parameter, and token component respectively. Since the parameter and token components will remain fixed throughout experiments, we briefly describe each. Parameter Component As in the standard Bayesian HMM (Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007), all distributions are independently drawn from symmetric Dirichlet distributions:","2","Note that t and w denote tag and word sequences respectively, rather than individual tokens or tags. P (φ, θ|T , α, β) = K ∏ t=1 (P (φt|α)P (θt|T , α)) The transition distribution φt for each tag t is drawn according to DIRICHLET(α, K), where α is the shared transition and emission distribution hyperparameter. In total there are O(K2",") parameters associated with the transition parameters.","In contrast to the Bayesian HMM, θt is not drawn from a distribution which has support for each of the n word types. Instead, we condition on the type-level tag assignments T . Specifically, let St = {i|Ti = t} denote the indices of the word types which have been assigned tag t according to the tag assignments T . Then θt is drawn from DIRICHLET(α, St), a symmetric Dirichlet which only places mass on word types indicated by St. This ensures that each word will only be assigned a single tag at inference time (see Section 4).","Note that while the standard HMM, has O(Kn) emission parameters, our model has O(n) effective parameters.3 Token Component Once HMM parameters (φ, θ) have been drawn, the HMM generates a token-level corpus w in the standard way: P (w, t|φ, θ) = ∏ (w,t)∈(w,t) ","∏ j P (tj|φtj−1)P (wj|tj, θtj )"," Note that in our model, conditioned on T , there is precisely one t which has non-zero probability for the token component, since for each word, exactly one θt has support. 3.1 Lexicon Component We present several variations for the lexical component P (T , W |ψ), each adding more complex parameterizations.

Learned Tag Prior (PRIOR) We next assume there exists a single prior distribution ψ over tag assignments drawn from DIRICHLET(β, K). This alters generation of T as follows: P (T |ψ) = n ∏ i=1 P (Ti|ψ) Note that this distribution captures the frequency of a tag across word types, as opposed to tokens. The P (T |ψ) distribution, in English for instance, should have very low mass for the DT (determiner) tag, since determiners are a very small portion of the vocabulary. In contrast, NNP (proper nouns) form a large portion of vocabulary. Note that these observations are not modeled by the standard HMM, which instead can model token-level frequency. Word Type Features (FEATS): Past unsupervised POS work have derived benefits from features on word types, such as suffix and capitalization features (Hasan and Ng, 2009; Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2010). Past work however, has typically associated these features with token occurrences, typically in an HMM. In our model, we associate these features at the type-level in the lexicon. Here, we consider suffix features, capitalization features, punctuation, and digit features. While possible to utilize the feature-based log-linear approach described in Berg-Kirkpatrick et al. (2010), we adopt a simpler naı̈ve Bayes strategy, where all features are emitted independently. Specifically, we assume each word type W consists of feature-value pairs (f, v). For each feature type f and tag t, a multinomial ψtf is drawn from a symmetric Dirichlet distribution with concentration parameter β. The P (W |T , ψ) term in the lexicon component now decomposes as: P (W |T , ψ) = n ∏ i=1 P (Wi|Ti, ψ) = n ∏ i=1   ∏ (f,v)∈Wi P (v|ψTif )   856"]},{"title":"4 Learning and Inference","paragraphs":["For inference, we are interested in the posterior probability over the latent variables in our model.

See Section 5. The English data comes from the WSJ portion of the Penn Treebank and the other languages from the training set of the CoNLL-X multilingual dependency parsing shared task. 5.1 Data Sets Following the set-up of Johnson (2007), we use the whole of the Penn Treebank corpus for training and evaluation on English. For other languages, we use the CoNLL-X multilingual dependency parsing shared task corpora (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006) which include gold POS tags (used for evaluation). We train and test on the CoNLL-X training set. Statistics for all data sets are shown in Table 2. 5.2 Setup Models To assess the marginal utility of each component of the model (see Section 3), we incrementally increase its sophistication. Specifically, we evaluate three variants: The first model (1TW) only encodes the one tag per word constraint and is uniform over type-level tag assignments. The second model (+PRIOR) utilizes the independent prior over type-level tag assignments P (T |ψ). The final model (+FEATS) utilizes the tag prior as well as features (e.g., suffixes and orthographic features), discussed in Section 3, for the P (W |T , ψ) component. Hyperparameters Our model has two Dirichlet concentration hyperparameters: α is the shared hyperparameter for the token-level HMM emission and transition distributions. β is the shared hyperparameter for the tag assignment prior and word feature multinomials. We experiment with four values for each hyperparameter resulting in 16 (α, β) combinations:","α β","0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10 Iterations In each run, we performed 30 iterations of Gibbs sampling for the type assignment variables W .4","We use the final sample for evaluation.

As is standard, we report the greedy one-to-one (Haghighi and Klein, 2006) and the many-to-one token-level accuracy obtained from mapping model states to gold POS tags. We also report word type level accuracy, the fraction of word types assigned their majority tag (where the mapping between model state and tag is determined by greedy one-to-one mapping discussed above).5","For each language, we aggregate results in the following way: First, for each hyperparameter setting, 4 Typically, the performance stabilizes after only 10 itera-","tions. 5 We choose these two metrics over the Variation Informa-","tion measure due to the deficiencies discussed in Gao and John-","son (2008). 858 we perform five runs with different random initial-ization of sampling state. Hyperparameter settings are sorted according to the median one-to-one metric over runs. We report results for the best and median hyperparameter settings obtained in this way. Specifically, for both settings we report results on the median run for each setting. Tag set As is standard, for all experiments, we set the number of latent model tag states to the size of the annotated tag set. The original tag set for the CoNLL-X Dutch data set consists of compounded tags that are used to tag multi-word units (MWUs) resulting in a tag set of over 300 tags. We tokenize MWUs and their POS tags; this reduces the tag set size to 12. See Table 2 for the tag set size of other languages. With the exception of the Dutch data set, no other processing is performed on the annotated tags."]},{"title":"6 Results and Analysis","paragraphs":["We report token- and type-level accuracy in Table 3 and 6 for all languages and system settings.

Their best model yields 44.5% one-to-one accuracy, compared to our best median 56.5% result. However, our full model takes advantage of word features not present in Graca̧ et al. (2009). Even without features, but still using the tag prior, our median result is 52.0%, still significantly outperforming Graca̧ et al. (2009). Ablation Analysis We evaluate the impact of incorporating various linguistic features into our model in Table 3. A novel element of our model is the ability to capture type-level tag frequencies. For this experiment, we compare our model with the uniform tag assignment prior (1TW) with the learned prior (+PRIOR). Across all languages, +PRIOR consistently outperforms 1TW, reducing error on average by 9.1% and 5.9% on best and median settings respectively. Similar behavior is observed when adding features. The difference between the feature-less model (+PRIOR) and our full model (+FEATS) is 13.6% and 7.7% average error reduction on best and median settings respectively. Overall, the difference between our most basic model (1TW) and our full model (+FEATS) is 21.2% and 13.1% for the best and median settings respectively. One striking example is the error reduction for Spanish, which reduces error by 36.5% and 24.7% for the best and median settings respectively.

This departure from the traditional token-based tagging approach allows us to explicitly capture type-level distributional properties of valid POS tag assignments as part of the model. The resulting model is compact, efficiently learnable and linguistically expressive. Our empirical results demonstrate that the type-based tagger rivals state-of-the-art tag-level taggers which employ more sophisticated learning mechanisms to exploit similar constraints.","In this paper, we make a simplifying assump-tion of one-tag-per-word. This assumption, however, is not inherent to type-based tagging models. A promising direction for future work is to explicitly model a distribution over tags for each word type.
