Approaches to syntax-based translation models can be largely categorized into two classes based on their dependency on annotated corpus (Chiang, 2007). Linguistically syntax-based models (e.g., (Yamada and Knight, 2001; Galley et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2006)) utilize structures defined over linguistic theory and annotations (e.g., Penn Treebank) and guide the derivation of SCFG rules with explicit parsing on at least one side of the parallel corpus. Formally syntax-based models (e.g., (Wu, 1997; Chiang, 2007)) extract synchronous grammars from parallel corpora based on the hierarchical structure of natural language pairs without any explicit linguistic knowledge or annotations. In this work, we focus on the hierarchical phrase-based models of Chiang (2007), which is formally syntax-based, and always refer the term SCFG, from now on, to the grammars of this model class.","On the one hand, hierarchical phrase-based models do not suffer from errors in syntactic constraints that are unavoidable in linguistically syntax-based models. Despite the complete lack of linguistic guidance, the performance of hierarchical phrase-based models is competitive when compared to linguistically syntax-based models. As shown in (Mi and Huang, 2008), hierarchical phrase-based models significantly outperform tree-to-string models (Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006), even when at-tempts are made to alleviate parsing errors using either forest-based decoding (Mi et al., 2008) or forest-based rule extraction (Mi and Huang, 2008).","On the other hand, when properly used, syntactic constraints can provide invaluable benefits to improve translation quality. The tree-to-string models of Mi and Huang (2008) can actually signif-138 icantly outperform hierarchical phrase-based models when using forest-based rule extraction together with forest-based decoding. Chiang (2010) also obtained significant improvement over his hierarchical baseline by using syntactic parse trees on both source and target sides to induce fuzzy (not exact) tree-to-tree rules and by also allowing syntactically mismatched substitutions.","In this paper, we augment rules in hierarchical phrase-based translation systems with novel syntactic features. Unlike previous studies (e.g., (Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006)) that directly use explicit treebank categories such as NP, NP/PP (NP missing PP from the right) to annotate phrase pairs, we induce a set of latent categories to capture the syntactic dependencies inherent in the hierarchical structure of phrase pairs, and derive a real-valued feature vector for each X nonterminal of a SCFG rule based on the distribution of the latent categories. Moreover, we convert the equality test of two sequences of syntactic categories, which are either identical or different, into the computation of a similarity score between their corresponding feature vectors. In our model, two symbolically different sequences of syntactic categories could have a high similarity score in the feature vector representation if they are syntactically similar, and a low score otherwise. In decoding, these feature vectors are utilized to measure the similarity between the syntactic analysis of the source side and the syntax of the SCFG rules that are applied to derive translations. Our approach maintains the advantages of hierarchical phrase-based translation systems while at the same time naturally incorporates soft syntactic constraints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that applies real-valued syntactic feature vectors to machine translation.","The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews hierarchical phrase-based translation models. Section 3 presents an overview of our approach, followed by Section 4 describing the hierarchical structure of aligned phrase pairs and Section 5 describing how to induce latent syntactic categories. Experimental results are reported in Section 6, followed by discussions in Section 7. Section 8 concludes this paper."]},{"title":"2 Hierarchical Phrase-Based Translation","paragraphs":["An SCFG is a synchronous rewriting system generating source and target side string pairs simultaneously based on a context-free grammar. Each synchronous production (i.e., rule) rewrites a nonterminal into a pair of strings, γ and α, where γ (or α) contains terminal and nonterminal symbols from the source (or target) language and there is a one-to-one correspondence between the nonterminal symbols on both sides. In particular, the hierarchical model (Chiang, 2007) studied in this paper explores hierarchical structures of natural language and utilize only a unified nonterminal symbol X in the grammar, X → ⟨γ, α, ∼⟩ where ∼ is the one-to-one correspondence between X’s in γ and α, and it can be indicated by underscripted co-indexes. Two example English-to-Chinese translation rules are represented as follows: X → ⟨give the pen to me, 钢笔 给 我⟩ (1) X → ⟨give X1 to me, X1 给 我⟩ (2)","The SCFG rules of hierarchical phrase-based models are extracted automatically from corpora of word-aligned parallel sentence pairs (Brown et al., 1993; Och and Ney, 2000). An aligned sentence pair is a tuple (E, F, A), where E = e1 · · · en can be in-terpreted as an English sentence of length n, F = f1 · · · fm its translation of length m in a foreign language, and A a set of links between words of the two sentences. Figure 1 (a) shows an example of aligned English-to-Chinese sentence pair. Widely adopted in phrase-based models (Och and Ney, 2004), a pair of consecutive sequences of words from E and F is a phrase pair if all words are aligned only within the sequences and not to any word outside. We call a sequence of words a phrase if it corresponds to either side of a phrase pair, and a non-phrase otherwise. Note that the boundary words of a phrase pair may not be aligned to any other word. We call the phrase pairs with all boundary words aligned tight phrase pairs (Zhang et al., 2008). A tight phrase pair is the minimal phrase pair among all that share the same set of alignment links. Figure 1 (b) highlights the tight phrase pairs in the example sentence pair. 139 6 5 4 3 2 1","1 2 3 4 5 (a) (b) Figure 1: An example of word-aligned sentence pair (a) with tight phrase pairs marked in a matrix representation (b).","The extraction of SCFG rules proceeds as follows. In the first step, all phrase pairs below a maximum length are extracted as phrasal rules. In the second step, abstract rules are extracted from tight phrase pairs that contain other tight phrase pairs by replacing the sub phrase pairs with co-indexed X-nonterminals. Chiang (2007) also introduced several requirements (e.g., there are at most two nonterminals at the right hand side of a rule) to safeguard the quality of the abstract rules as well as keeping decoding efficient. In our example above, rule (2) can be extracted from rule (1) with the following sub phrase pair: X → ⟨the pen, 钢笔⟩","The use of a unified X nonterminal makes hierarchical phrase-based models flexible at capturing non-local reordering of phrases. However, such flexibility also comes at the cost that it is not able to differentiate between different syntactic usages of phrases. Suppose rule X → ⟨I am reading X1, · · · ⟩ is extracted from a phrase pair with I am reading a book on the source side where X1 is abstracted from the noun phrase pair . If this rule is used to translate I am reading the brochure of a book fair, it would be better to apply it over the entire string than over sub-strings such as I ... the brochure of. This is because the nonterminal X1 in the rule was abstracted from a noun phrase on the source side of the training data and would thus be better (more informative) to be applied to phrases of the same type. Hierarchical phrase-based models are not able to distinguish syntactic differences like this.","Zollmann and Venugopal (2006) attempted to address this problem by annotating phrase pairs with treebank categories based on automatic parse trees. They introduced an extended set of categories (e.g., NP+V for she went and DT\\NP for great wall, an noun phrase with a missing determiner on the left) to annotate phrase pairs that do not align with syntactic constituents. Their hard syntactic constraint requires that the nonterminals should match exactly to rewrite with a rule, which could rule out potentially correct derivations due to errors in the syntactic parses as well as to data sparsity. For example, NP cannot be instantiated with phrase pairs of type DT+NN, in spite of their syntactic similarity. Venugopal et al. (2009) addressed this problem by directly introducing soft syntactic preferences into SCFG rules using preference grammars, but they had to face the computational challenges of large preference vectors. Chiang (2010) also avoided hard constraints and took a soft alternative that directly models the cost of mismatched rule substitutions. This, however, would require a large number of parameters to be tuned on a generally small-sized held-out set, and it could thus suffer from over-tuning."]},{"title":"3 Approach Overview","paragraphs":["In this work, we take a different approach to introduce linguistic syntax to hierarchical phrase-based translation systems and impose soft syntactic constraints between derivation rules and the syntactic parse of the sentence to be translated.

Figure 3 (b) shows the source-side parse tree of a sentence pair. The tag sequence for “the pen” is simply “NP” because it is a noun phrase, while phrase “give the pen” is dominated by a verb followed by a noun phrase, and thus its tag sequence is “VBP NP”.","Let T S = {ts1, · · · , tsm} be the set of all tag sequences extracted from a parallel corpus.

Suppose we have a collection of n latent syntactic categories C = {c1, · · · , cn}. For each tag sequence ts, we compute its distribution of latent syntactic categories ⃗Pts(C) = (pts(c1), · · · , pts(cn)). For example, ⃗P“NP VP”(C) = {0.5, 0.2, 0.3} means that the latent syntactic categories c1, c2, and c3 are distributed as p(c1) = 0.5, p(c2) = 0.2, and p(c3) = 0.3 for tag sequence “NP VP”. We further convert the distribution to a normalized feature vector ⃗F (ts) to represent tag sequence ts: ⃗F (ts) = (f1(ts), · · · , fn(ts)) = (pts(c1), · · · , pts(cn)) ∥(pts(c1), · · · , pts(cn))∥","The advantage of using real-valued feature vectors is that the degree of similarity between two tag sequences ts and ts′","in the space of the latent syntactic categories C can be simply computed as a dotproduct3","of their feature vectors:","⃗F (ts) · ⃗F (ts′",") = ∑","1≤i≤n fi(ts)fi(ts′",") which computes a syntactic similarity score in the range of 0 (totally syntactically different) to 1 (completely syntactically identical).","Similarly, we can represent the syntax of each X nonterminal in a rule with a feature vector ⃗F (X), computed as the sum of the feature vectors of tag","3","Other measures such as KL-divergence in the probability space are also feasible. sequences weighted by the distribution of tag sequences of the nonterminal X:","⃗F (X) = ∑ ts∈T S pX (ts) ⃗F (ts)","Now we can impose soft syntactic constraints using these feature vectors when a SCFG rule is used to translate a parsed source sentence.

Given two non-disjoint tight phrase pairs that share at least one common alignment link, there are only two relationships: either one completely includes another or they do not include one another but have a non-empty overlap, which we call a non-trivial overlap.

(2008) exploited this property to construct a hierarchical decomposition tree (Bui-Xuan et al., 2005) of phrase pairs from a sentence pair to extract all phrase pairs in linear time. In this paper, we focus on learning the syntactic dependencies along the hierarchy of phrase pairs. Our hierarchy construction follows Heber and Stoye (2001).","Let P be the set of tight phrase pairs extracted from a sentence pair. We call a sequentially-ordered list5","L = (p1, · · · , pk) of unique phrase pairs pi ∈ P a chain if every two successive phrase pairs in L have a non-trivial overlap. A chain is maximal if it can not be extended to its left or right with other phrase pairs. Note that any sub-sequence of phrase pairs in a chain generates a tight phrase pair. In particular, chain L generates a tight phrase pair τ (L) that corresponds exactly to the union of the alignment links in p ∈ L. We call the phrase pairs generated by maximal chains maximal phrase pairs and call the other phrase pairs non-maximal. Non-maximal phrase pairs always overlap non-trivially with some other phrase pairs while maximal phrase pairs do not, and it can be shown that any non-maximal phrase pair can be generated by a sequence of maximal phrase pairs. Note that the largest tight phrase pair that includes all alignment links in A is also a maximal phrase pair. 5","The phrase pairs can be sequentially ordered first by the boundary positions of the source-side phrase and then by the boundary positions of the target-side phrase. give the pen to me .

However, the coarse abstraction of phrases with X and non-phrases with B provides little information on the constraints of the hierarchy. In order to bring in syntactic constraints, we annotate the nodes in the decomposition forest with syntactic observations based on the automatic syntactic parse tree of the source side. If a node aligns with a constituent in the parse tree, we add the syntactic category (e.g., NP) of the constituent as an emitted observation of the node, otherwise, it crosses constituent boundaries and we add a designated crossing category CR as its observation. We call the resulting forest a syntactic decomposition forest. Figure 3 (d) shows two syntactic decomposition trees of the forest based on the parse tree in Figure 3 (b). We will next describe how to learn finer-grained X and B categories based on the hierarchical syntactic constraints."]},{"title":"5 Inducing Latent Syntactic Categories","paragraphs":["If we designate a unique symbol S as the new root of the syntactic decomposition forests introduced in the previous section, it can be shown that these forests can be generated by a probabilistic context-free grammar G = (V, Σ, S, R, φ), where • V = {S, X, B} is the set of nonterminals,","• Σ is the set of terminals comprising treebank categories plus the CR tag (the crossing category), 7","The intermediate binarization nodes are also labeled as either X or B based on whether they exactly cover a phrase or not. • S ∈ V is the unique start symbol,","• R is the union of the set of production rules each rewriting a nonterminal to a sequence of nonterminals and the set of emission rules each generating a terminal from a nonterminal,","• and φ assigns a probability score to each rule r ∈ R.

The hypothesis space of translating a longer sentence is much larger than that of a shorter sentence.

First, while the current approach imposes soft syntactic constraints between the parse structure of the source sentence and the SCFG rules used to derive the translation, the real-valued syntactic feature vectors can also be used to impose soft constraints between SCFG rules when rule rewrite occurs. In this case, target side parse trees could also be used alone or together with the source side parse trees to induce the latent syntactic categories. Second, instead of using single parse trees during both training and decoding, our approach is likely to benefit from exploring parse forests as in (Mi and Huang, 2008). Third, in addition to the treebank categories obtained by syntactic parsing, lexical cues directly available in sentence pairs could also to explored to guide the learning of latent categories. Last but not the least, it would be interesting to investigate discriminative training approaches to learn latent categories that directly optimize on translation quality."]},{"title":"8 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We have presented a novel approach to enhance hierarchical phrase-based machine translation systems with real-valued linguistically motivated feature vectors. Our approach maintains the advantages of hierarchical phrase-based translation systems while at the same time naturally incorporates soft syntactic constraints. Experimental results showed that this approach improves the baseline hierarchical phrase-based translation models on both English-to-German and English-to-Chinese tasks. We will continue this line of research and exploit better ways to learn syntax and apply syntactic constraints to machine translation."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["This work was done when the first author was visit-ing IBM T.
