Existing efforts can be categorized into (a) a transliteration-based approach leveraging phonetic similarity and (b) a corpus-based approach exploiting bilingual co-occurrences, each of which suffers from inaccuracy and scarcity respectively. In clear contrast, we use unleveraged resources of monolingual entity co-occurrences, crawled from entity search engines, represented as two entity-relationship graphs extracted from two language corpora respectively. Our problem is then abstracted as finding correct mappings across two graphs. To achieve this goal, we propose a holistic approach, of exploiting both transliteration similarity and monolingual co-occurrences. This approach, building upon monolingual corpora, complements existing corpus-based work, requiring scarce resources of parallel or comparable corpus, while significantly boosting the accuracy of transliteration-based work. We validate our proposed system using real-life datasets."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Entity translation aims at mapping the entity names (e.g., people, locations, and organizations) in source language into their corresponding names in target language.

Existing efforts to address these challenges can be categorized into transliteration- and corpus-based approaches. Transliteration-based approaches (Wan and Verspoor, 1998; Knight and Graehl, 1998) identify translations based on pronunciation similarity, while corpus-based approaches mine bilingual co-occurrences of translation pairs obtained from parallel (Kupiec, 1993; Feng et al., 2004) or comparable (Fung and Yee, 1998) corpora, or alternatively mined from bilingual sentences (Lin et al., 2008; Jiang et al., 2009). These two approaches have complementary strength– transliteration-based similarity can be computed for any name pair but cannot mine translations of little (or none) phonetic similarity. Corpus-based similarity can support arbitrary translations, but require highly scarce resources of bilingual co-occurrences, obtained from parallel or comparable bilingual corpora.","In this paper, we propose a holistic approach, leveraging both transliteration- and corpus-based similarity. Our key contribution is to replace the use of scarce resources of bilingual co-occurrences with the use of untapped and significantly larger resources of monolingual co-occurrences for translation. In particular, we extract monolingual co-occurrences of entities from English and Chinese Web corpora, which are readily available from entity search engines such as PeopleEntityCube1",", deployed by Microsoft Research Asia. Such engine","1","http://people.entitycube.com 430 automatically extracts people names from text and their co-occurrences to retrieve related entities based on co-occurrences. To illustrate, Figure 1(a) demonstrates the query result for “Bill Gates,” retrieving and visualizing the “entity-relationship graph” of related people names that frequently co-occur with Bill in English corpus. Similarly, entity-relationship graphs can be built over other language corpora, as Figure 1(b) demonstrates the corresponding results for the same query, from Renlifang2","on Chinese Web corpus. From this point on, for the sake of simplicity, we refer to English and Chinese graphs, simply as Ge and Gc respectively. Though we illustrate with English-Chinese pairs in the paper, our method can be easily adapted to other language pairs.","In particular, we propose a novel approach of abstracting entity translation as a graph matching problem of two graphs Ge and Gc in Figures 1(a) and (b). Specifically, the similarity between two nodes ve and vc in Ge and Gc is initialized as their transliteration similarity, which is iteratively refined based on relational similarity obtained from monolingual co-occurrences. To illustrate this, an English news article mentioning “Bill Gates” and “Melinda Gates” evidences a relationship between the two entities, which can be quantified from their co-occurrences in the entire English Web corpus. Similarly, we can mine Chinese news articles to obtain the relationships between “ · ” and “H· ”. Once these two bilingual graphs of people and their relationships are harvested, entity translation can leverage these parallel relationships to further evidence the mapping between translation pairs, as Figure 1(c) illustrates.","To highlight the advantage of our proposed approach, we compare our results with commercial machine translators (1) Engkoo3","developed in Microsoft Research Asia and (2) Google Translator4",". In particular, Figure 2 reports the precision for two groups– “heads” that belong to top-100 popular people (determined by the number of hits), among randomly sampled 304 people names5","from six graph pairs of size 1,000 each, and the remaining “tails”.

Our approach leveraging both is complementary to these efforts. 2.1 Transliteration-based Approaches Many name translations are loosely based on phonetic similarity, which naturally inspires transliteration-based translation of finding the translation with the closest pronunciation similarity, using either rule-based (Wan and Verspoor, 1998) or statistical (Knight and Graehl, 1998; Li et al., 2004) approaches. However, people are free to designate arbitrary bilingual names of little (or none) phonetic similarity, for which the transliteration-based approach is not effective. 2.2 Corpus-based Approaches Corpus-based approach can mine arbitrary translation pairs, by mining bilingual co-occurrences from parallel and comparable bilingual corpora. Using parallel corpora (Kupiec, 1993; Feng et al., 2004), e.g., bilingual Wikipedia entries on the same person, renders high accuracy but suffers from high scarcity. To alleviate such scarcity, (Fung and Yee, 432 1998; Shao and Ng, 2004) explore a more vast resource of comparable corpora, which share no parallel document- or sentence-alignments as in parallel corpora but describe similar contents in two languages, e.g., news articles on the same event. Alternatively, (Lin et al., 2008) extracts bilingual co-occurrences from bilingual sentences, such as an-notating terms with their corresponding translations in English inside parentheses. Similarly, (Jiang et al., 2009) identifies potential translation pairs from bilingual sentences using lexical pattern analysis. 2.3 Holistic Approaches The complementary strength of the above two approaches naturally calls for a holistic approach, such as recent work combining transliteration-and corpus-based similarity mining bilingual co-occurrences using general search engines. Specifically, (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002) uses transliteration to generate candidates and then web corpora to identify translations. Later, (Jiang et al., 2007) enhances to use transliteration to guide web mining.","Our work is also a holistic approach, but leveraging significantly larger corpora, specifically by exploiting monolingual co-occurrences. Such expansion enables to translate “long-tail” people entities with non-trivial Web occurrences in each monolingual corpus, but not much bilingual co-occurrences. Specifically, we initialize name pair similarity using transliteration-based approach, and iteratively reinforces base similarity using relational similarity."]},{"title":"3 Our Framework","paragraphs":["Given two graphs Ge = (Ve, Ee) and Gc = (Vc, Ec) harvested from English and Chinese corpora respectively, our goal is to find translation pairs, or a set S of matching node pairs such that S ⊆ Ve × Vc. Let R be a |Ve|-by-|Vc| matrix where each Rij denotes the similarity between two nodes i ∈ Ve and j ∈ Vc.","Overall, with the matrix R, our approach consists of the following three steps, as we will discuss in the following three sections respectively:","1. Initialization: computing base translation similarities Rij between two entity nodes using transliteration similarity 2. Reinforcement model: reinforcing the translation similarities Rij by exploiting the monolingual co-occurrences","3. Matching extraction: extracting the matching pairs from the final translation similarities Rij 3.1 Initialization with Transliteration We initialize the translation similarity Rij as the transliteration similarity. This section explains how to get the transliteration similarity between English and Chinese names using an unsupervised approach.","Formally, let an English name Ne = (e1, e2, · · · , en) and a Chinese name Nc = (c1, c2, · · · , cm) be given, where ei is an English word and Ne is a sequence of the words, and ci is a Chinese character and Nc is a sequence of the characters. Our goal is to compute a score indicating the similarity between the pronunciations of the two names.","We first convert Nc into its Pinyin representation P Yc = (s1, s2, · · · , sm), where si is the Pinyin representation of ci. Pinyin is the romanization representation of pronunciation of Chinese character. For example, the Pinyin representation of Ne = (“Barack”, “Obama”) is P Yc =(“ba”, “la”, “ke”, “ao”, “ba”, “ma”). The Pinyin representations of Chinese characters can be easily obtained from Chinese character pronunciation dictionary. In our experiments, we use an in-house dictionary, which contains pronunciations of 20, 774 Chinese characters. For the Chinese characters having multiple pronunciations, we only use the most popular one.","Calculation of transliteration similarity between Ne and Nc is now transformed to calculation of pronunciation similarity between Ne and P Yc. Because letters in Chinese Pinyins and English strings are pronounced similarly, we can further approximate pronunciation similarity between Ne and P Yc using their spelling similarity. In this paper, we use Edit Distance (ED) to measure the spelling similarity. Moreover, since words in Ne are transliterated into characters in P Yc independently, it is more accurate to compute the ED between Ne and P Yc, i.e., EDname(Ne, P Yc), as the sum of the EDs of all component transliteration pairs, i.e., every ei in Ne and its corresponding transliteration (si) in P Yc. In other words, we need to first align all sj’s in P Yc with corresponding ei in Ne based on whether they 433 are translations of each other. Then based on the alignment, we can calculate EDname(Ne, P Yc) using the following formula.","EDname(Ne, P Yc) = ∑ i ED(ei, esi) (1) where esi is a string generated by concatenating all si’s that are aligned to ei and ED(ei, esi) is the Edit Distance between ei and esi, i.e., the minimum number of edit operations (including inser-tion, deletion and substitution) needed to transform ei into esi. Because an English word usually consists of multiple syllables but every Chinese character consists of only one syllable, when aligning ei’s with sj’s, we add the constraint that each ei is allowed to be aligned with 0 to 4 si’s but each si can only be aligned with 0 to 1 ei. To get the alignment between P Yc and Ne which has the minimal EDname(Ne, P Yc), we use a Dynamic Programming based algorithm as defined in the following formula:","EDname(N1,i","e , P Y 1,j c ) = min(","EDname(N1,i−1 e , P Y 1,j","c ) + Len(ei),","EDname(N1,i e , P Y 1,j−1","c ) + Len(sj),","EDname(N1,i−1 e , P Y 1,j−1","c ) + ED(ei, sj),","EDname(N1,i−1 e , P Y 1,j−2","c ) + ED(ei, P Y j−1,j","c ),","EDname(N1,i−1 e , P Y 1,j−3","c ) + ED(ei, P Y j−2,j","c ),","EDname(N1,i−1 e , P Y 1,j−4","c ) + ED(ei, P Y j−3,j","c )) where, given a sequence X = (x1, x2, · · ·) such that xi is a word, Xi,j","is the subsequence (xi, xi+1, · · · , xj) of X and Len(X) is the number of letters except spaces in the sequence X. For in-stance, the minimal Edit Distance between the English name “Barack Obama” and the Chinese Pinyin representation “ba la ke ao ba ma” is 4, as the best alignment is: “Barack” ↔ “ba la ke” (ED: 3), “Obama” ↔ “ao ba ma” (ED: 1). Finally the transliteration similarity between Nc and Ne is calculated using the following formula. Simtl(Nc, Ne) = 1 − EDname(Ne, P Yc) Len(P Yc) + Len(Ne) (2) For example, Simtl(“Barack Obama”, “fi n",".·£fij”) is 1 − 4","11+12 = 0.826. 3.2 Reinforcement Model From the initial similarity, we model our problem as an iterative approach that iteratively reinforces the similarity Rij of the nodes i and j from the matching similarities of their neighbor nodes u and v.","The basic intuition is built on exploiting the similarity between monolingual co-occurrences of two different languages. In particular, we assume two entities with strong relationship co-occur frequently in both corpora. In order to express this intuition, we formally define an iterative reinforcement model as follows. Let Rt","ij denote the similarity of nodes i and j at t-th iteration:","Rt+1 ij = λ ∑","(u,v)k∈Bt (i,j,θ) Rt uv 2k + (1 − λ)R0","ij (3) The model is expressed as a linear combination of (a) the relational similarity ∑","Rt","uv/2k","and (b) transliteration similarity R0","ij. (λ is the coefficient for interpolating two similarities.)","In the relational similarity, Bt","(i, j, θ) is an ordered set of the best matching pairs between neighbor nodes of i and ones of j such that ∀(u, v)k ∈ Bt","(i, j, θ), Rt","uv ≥ θ, where (u, v)k is the matching pair with k-th highest similarity score. We consider (u, v) with similarity over some threshold θ, or Rt","uv ≥ θ, as a matching pair. In this neighbor matching process, if many-to-many matches exist, we select only one with the greatest matching score. Figure 3 describes such matching process more formally. N (i) and N (j) are the sets of neighbor nodes of i and j, respectively, and H is a priority queue sorting pairs in the decreasing order of similarity scores.","Meanwhile, note that, in order to express that the confidence for matching (i, j) progressively converges as the number of matched neighbors increases, we empirically use decaying coefficient 1/2k","for Rt","uv, because ∑∞","k=1 1/2k","= 1. 3.3 Matching Extraction After the convergence of the above model, we get the |Ve|-by-|Vc| similarity matrix R∞",". From this matrix, we extract one-to-one matches maximizing the overall similarity.","More formally, this problem can be stated as the maximum weighted bipartite matching (West, 434 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12.","Bt (i, j, θ) ← {}","∀u ∈ N (i), ∀v ∈ N (j) : H.push(u, v; Rt","uv)","while H is not empty do (u, v; s) ← H.pop() if s < θ then","break end if if neither u nor v are matched yet then","Bt","(i, j, θ) ← Bt","(i, j, θ) ∪ {(u, v)} end if","end while","return Bt","(i, j, θ)","Figure 3: How to get the ordered set Bt (i, j, θ) 2000)– Given two groups of entities Ve and Vc from the two graphs Ge and Gc, we can build a weighted bipartite graph is G = (V, E), where V = Ve ∪ Vc and E is a set of edges (u, v) with weight R∞","uv.

From this bipartite graph, the maximum weighted bipartite matching problem finds a set of pairwise non-adjacent edges S ⊆ E such that ∑","(u,v)∈S R∞","uv is the maximum. Wellknown algorithms include Hungarian algorithm with time complexity of O(|V |2","log |V | + |V ||E|) (West, 2000).","In this paper, to speed up processing, we consider a greedy alternative with the following steps– (1) choose the pair with the highest similarity score, (2) remove the corresponding row and column from the matrix, and (3) repeat (1) and (2) until their matching scores are over a specific threshold δ."]},{"title":"4 Experiments","paragraphs":["This section reports our experimental results to evaluate our proposed approach.

Specifically, we built a graph pairs (Ge, Gc) expanding from a “seed pair” of nodes se ∈ Ve and sc ∈ Vc until the number of nodes for each graph becomes 1,0006",". More specifically, when we build a graph Ge by expanding from se, we use a queue Q. We first initialize Q by pushing the seed node se. We then iteratively pop a node ve from Q, save ve into Ve, and push its neighbor nodes in decreasing order of co-occurrence scores with ve. Similarly, we can get Gc from a counterpart seed node vc. By using this procedure, we built six graph pairs from six different seed pairs. In particular, the six seed nodes are English names and its corresponding Chinese names representing a wide range of occupation domains (e.g., ‘Barack Obama,’ ‘Bill Gates,’ ‘Britney Spears,’ ‘Bruno Senna,’ ‘Chris Paul,’ and ‘Eminem’) as Table 1 depicts. Meanwhile, though we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for mining name translations in Chinese and English languages, the method can be easily adapted to other language pairs.

In order to pick the nodes that well represent the actual","6","Note, this is just a default setting, which we later increase for scalability evaluation in Figure 6.","7","Note that the numbers of nodes within two hops in Ge and Gc are 327 and 399 on average respectively. 435 neighbors, we built test datasets among those within two hops. However, this crawling is used for the evaluation sake only, and thus does not suggest the bias in our proposed framework. Table 1 describes the size of such test dataset for each graph pair.","Lastly, we set up the three parameters λ, θ, and δ using 6-fold cross validation with 6 test datasets Ti’s of the graphs. More specifically, for each dataset Ti, we decide λi and θi such that average MRR for the other 5 test datasets is maximized. (About MRR, see more details of Equation (4) in Section 4.2.) We then decide δi such that average F1-score is maximized. Figure 4 shows the average MRR for λi and θi with default values θ = 0.66 and λ = 0.2. Based on these results, we set λi with values {0.2, 0.15, 0.2, 0.15, 0.2, 0.15} that optimize MRR in datasets T1, . . . T6, and similarly θi with {0.67, 0.65, 0.67, 0.67, 0.65, 0.67}. We also set δi with values {0.63, 0.63, 0.61, 0.61, 0.61, 0.61} optimizing F1-score with the same default values λ = 0.2 and θ = 0.66. We can observe the variances of optimal parameter setting values are low, which suggests the robustness of our framework. 4.2 Experimental Results This section reports our experimental results using the evaluation datasets explained in previous section. For each graph pair, we evaluated the effectiveness of (1) reinforcement model using MRR measure in Section 4.2.1 and (2) overall framework using precision, recall, and F1 measures in Section 4.2.2. We also validated (3) scalability of our framework over larger scale of graphs (with up to five thousand nodes) in Section 4.2.3.
