In previous work, it was established that performance drastically decreases when the coverage of a seed lexicon is small. We resolve this problem by utilizing indirect relations with the bilingual seeds together with direct relations, in which each word is represented by a distribution of translated seeds. The seed distributions are propagated over a graph representing relations among words, and translation pairs are extracted by identifying word pairs with a high similarity in the seed distributions. We propose two types of the graphs: a co-occurrence graph, representing co-occurrence relations between words, and a similarity graph, representing context similarities between words. Evaluations using English and Japanese patent comparable corpora show that our proposed graph propagation method outperforms conventional methods. Further, the similarity graph achieved improved performance by clustering synonyms into the same translation."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Bilingual lexicons are important resources for bilingual tasks such as machine translation (MT) and cross-language information retrieval (CLIR). There-fore, the automatic building of bilingual lexicons from corpora is one of the issues that have attracted many researchers. As a solution, a number of previous works proposed extracting bilingual lexicons from comparable corpora, in which documents were not direct translations but shared a topic or domain1",". The use of comparable corpora is motivated by the fact that large parallel corpora are only available for a few language pairs and for limited domains.","Most of the previous methods are based on assumption (I), that a word and its translation tend to appear in similar contexts across languages (Rapp, 1999). Based on this assumption, many methods calculate word similarity using context and then extract word translation pairs with a high-context similarity. We call these methods context-similarity-based methods. The context similarities are usually computed using a seed bilingual lexicon (e.g. a general bilingual dictionary) by mapping contexts expressed in two different languages into the same space. In the mapping, information not represented by the seed lexicon is discarded. Therefore, the context-similarity-based methods could not find accurate translation pairs if using a small seed lexicon.","Some of the previous methods tried to alleviate the problem of the limited seed lexicon size (Koehn and Knight, 2002; Morin and Prochasson, 2011; Hazem et al., 2011), while others did not require any seed lexicon (Rapp, 1995; Fung, 1995; Haghighi et al., 2008; Ismail and Manandhar, 2010; Daumé III and Jagarlamudi, 2011). However, they suffer the problems of high computational cost (Rapp, 1995), sensitivity to parameters (Hazem et al., 2011), low accuracy (Fung, 1995; Ismail and Manandhar, 2010), and ineffectiveness for language pairs with 1","Although Vulić et al. (2011) regarded document-aligned texts such as texts on Wikipedia as comparable corpora, we do not limit comparable corpora to these kinds of texts. 24 different types of characters (Koehn and Knight, 2002; Haghighi et al., 2008; Daumé III and Jagarlamudi, 2011).","In face of the above problems, we propose a novel method that uses a graph-based label propagation technique (Zhu and Ghahramani, 2002). The proposed method is based on assumption (II), which is derived by recursively applying assumption (I) to the “contexts”: a word and its translation tend to have similar co-occurrence (direct and indirect) relations with all bilingual seeds across languages.","Based on assumption (II), we propose a three-step approach: (1) constructing a graph for each language with each edge indicating a direct co-occurrence relation, (2) representing every word as a seed translation distribution by iteratively propagating translated seeds in each graph, (3) finding two words in different languages with a high similarity with respect to the seed distributions. By propagating all the seeds on the graph, indirect co-occurrence relations are also considered when computing bilingual relations, which have been neglected in previous methods. In addition to the co-occurrence-based graph construction, we propose a similarity graph, which also takes into account context similarities between words.","The main contributions of this paper are as follows:","• We propose a bilingual lexicon extraction method that captures co-occurrence relations with all the seeds, including indirect relations, using graph-based label propagation. In our experiments, we confirm that the proposed method outperforms conventional context-similarity-based methods (Rapp, 1999; Andrade et al., 2010), and works well even if the coverage of a seed lexicon is low.","• We propose a similarity graph which represents context similarities between words. In our experiments, we confirm that a similarity graph is more effective than a co-occurrence-based graph."]},{"title":"2 Context-Similarity-based ExtractionMethod","paragraphs":["The bilingual lexicon extraction from comparable corpora was pioneered in (Rapp, 1995; Fung, 1995). The popular similarity-based methods consist of the following steps: modeling contexts, calculating context similarities, and finding translation pairs. Step 1. Modeling contexts: The context of each word is generally modeled by a vector where each dimension corresponds to a context word and each dimension has a value indicating occurrence correlation. Various definitions for the context have been used: distance-based context (e.g. in a sentence (Laroche and Langlais, 2010), in a para-graph (Fung and McKeown, 1997), in a predefined window (Rapp, 1999; Andrade et al., 2010)), and syntactic-based context (e.g. predecessors and successors in dependency trees (Garera et al., 2009), certain dependency position (Otero and Campos, 2008)). Some treated context words equally regardless of their positions (Fung and Yee, 1998), while others treated the words separately for each position (Rapp, 1999). Various correlation measures have been used: log-likelihood ratio (Rapp, 1999; Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002), tf-idf (Fung and Yee, 1998), pointwise mutual information (PMI) (Andrade et al., 2010), context heterogeneity (Fung, 1995), etc.","Shao and Ng (2004) represented contexts using language models. Andrade et al. (2010) used a set of words with a positive association as a context. Andrade et al. (2011a) used dependency relations instead of context words. Ismail and Manandhar (2010) used only in-domain words in contexts. Pekar et al. (2006) constructed smoothed context vectors for rare words. Laws et al. (2010) used graphs in which vertices correspond to words and edges indicate three types of syntactic relations such as adjectival modification. Step 2. Calculating context similarities: The contexts which are expressed in two different languages are mapped into the same space. Previous methods generally use a seed bilingual lexicon for this mapping. After that, similarities are calculated based on the mapped context vectors using various measures: city-block metric (Rapp, 1999), cosine similarity (Fung and Yee, 1998), weighted jaccard in-dex (Hazem et al., 2011), Jensen-Shannon divergence (Pekar et al., 2006), the number of overlapping context words (Andrade et al., 2010), Sim-Rank (Laws et al., 2010), euclidean distance (Fung, 1995), etc. 25 Japanese English 0.8 0.6 0.5 0.8 ピラニア – アマゾン (piranha) (Amazon) ピラニア – ジャングル (piranha) (jungle) ピラニア – 淡水 (piranha) (freshwater)","淡水 – 魚 (freshwater) (fish) AssociationQuery – Context Word 0.8 0.6 0.5 0.8 0.6 0.8 piranha – Amazon piranha – jungle piranha – freshwater anaconda – Amazon anaconda – jungle freshwater – fish Association Query – Context Word Seed Lexicon (Japanese – English) : アマゾン – Amazon, ジャングル – jungle, 魚 – fish","Amazon jungle ピラニア ( 0.8 , 0.6 ) Amazon jungle piranha ( 0.8 , 0.6 ) anaconda ( 0.8 , 0.6 ) similarity ピラニア – piranha 1.0 ピラニア – anaconda 1.0 Japanese English 0.5 0.8 0.6 0.8 0.8 0.6 0.8 0.6 0.5 0.8 魚 (fish) ジャングル (jungle) アマゾン (Amazon) jungle fish アマゾン ジャングル 魚 0.5 , 0.3 , 0.2 Amazon jungle fish 0.55 , 0.4 , 0.05 Amazon jungle fish 0.5 , 0.3 , 0.2 Proposed Method Context-similarity-based Method ピラニア (piranha)","淡水 (freshwater) freshwater piranha anaconda Amazon Figure 1: An Example of a Previous Method and our Proposed Method","Andrade et al. (2011b) performed a linear transformation of context vectors in accordance with the notion that importance varies by context positions. Gaussier et al. (2004) mapped context vectors via latent classes to capture synonymy and polysemy in a seed lexicon. Fišer et al. (2011) and Kaji (2005) calculated 2-way similarities. Step 3. Finding translation pairs: A pair of words is treated as a translation pair when their context similarity is high. Various clues have been considered when computing the similarities: concept class information obtained from a multilingual the-saurus (Déjean et al., 2002), co-occurrence models generated from aligned documents (Prochasson and Fung, 2011), and transliteration information (Shao and Ng, 2004). 2.1 Problems from Previous Works Most of previous methods used a seed bilingual lexicon for mapping modeled contexts in two different languages into the same space. The mapping heavily relies on the entries in a given bilingual lexicon. Therefore, if the coverage of the seed lexicon is low, the context vectors become sparser and its discriminative capability becomes lower, leading to extraction of incorrect translation equivalents.","Consider the example in Figure 1, where a context-similarity-based method and our proposed method find translation equivalents of the Japanese word “ (piranha)”. There are three context words for the query. However, the information on co-occurrence with “ (freshwater)” disappears after the context vector is mapped, because the seed lexicon does not include “ (freshwater)”. The same thing happens with the English word “piranha”. As a result, the pair of “ (piranha)” and “anaconda” could be wrongly identified as a translation pair.","Some previous work focused on the problem of seed lexicon limitation. Morin and Prochasson (2011) complemented the seed lexicon with bilingual lexicon extracted from parallel sentences. Koehn and Knight (2002) used identically-spelled words in two languages as a seed lexicon. However, the method is not applicable for language pairs with different types of characters such as English and Japanese. Hazem et al. (2011) exploited k-nearest words for a query, which is very sensitive to the parameter k.","Some previous work did not require any seed lexicon. Rapp (1995) proposed a computationally demanding matrix permutation method which maximizes a similarity between co-occurrence matrices in two languages. Ismail and Manandhar (2010) in-troduced a similarity measure between two words in different languages without requiring any seed lexicon. Fung (1995) used context heterogeneity vectors where each dimension is independent on language types. However, their performances are worse than those of conventional methods using a small seed lexicon. Haghighi et al. (2008) and Daumé III and Jagarlamudi (2011) proposed a generative model based on probabilistic canonical correlation analysis, where words are represented by context features and orthographic features2",". However, their experiments showed that orthographic features to be important for effectiveness, which means low per-","2","In Haghighi et al.

This problem could be resolved by incorporating indirect relations with all the seeds when identifying translation pairs. For example, in Figure 1, “ (piranha)” has some degree of association with the seed “ - fish” through “ (freshwater)” in both the Japanese side and the English side, although “ (piranha)” and “ (fish)” do not co-occur in the same contexts. More-over, “anaconda” has very little association with the seed “ - fish” in the English side. Therefore, the indirect relation with the seed “ - fish” helps to discriminate from between “piranha” and “anaconda” and could be an important clue for identifying a correct translation pair.","To utilize indirect relations, we introduce assumption (II): a word and its translation tend to have similar co-occurrence (direct and indirect) relations with all bilingual seeds across languages3",". Based on assumption (II), we propose to identify a word pair as a translation pair when its co-occurrence (direct and indirect) relations with all the seeds are similar.","To obtain co-occurrence relations with all the seeds, including indirect relations, we focus on a graph-based label propagation (LP) technique (Zhu and Ghahramani, 2002). LP transfers labels from labeled data points to unlabeled data points. In the process, all vertices have soft labels that can be interpreted as label distributions. We apply LP to bilingual lexicon extraction by representing each word as a vertex in a graph with each edge encoding a direct co-occurrence relation. Translated seeds are propagated as labels, and seed distributions are obtained for each word. From the seed distributions, we identify translation pairs.","In summary, our proposed method consists of three steps (see Algorithm 1): (1) graph construc-","3","Assumption (I) indicates direct co-occurrence relations between a word and its context words are preserved across different languages.

Each graph is an undirected graph because the association does not have direction. The graphs are constructed as follows: Step 1. Vertex assignment extracts words from each corpus, and assigns a vertex to each of the extracted words. Let V = {v1, · · · , vn} be a set of vertices. Step 2. Edge weight calculation calculates association strength between two words as the weights of edges. Let E and W be a set of edges and that of the weights respectively, and eij ∈ E links vi and vj, and wij ∈ W is the weight of eij. Note that |E| = |W |. Step 3. Edge pruning excludes edges whose weights are lower than threshold, in order to reduce the computational cost during seed propagations.","We propose two types of graphs that differ in the association measure used in Step 2: a co-occurrence graph and a similarity graph4",". 3.1.1 Co-occurrence Graph","A co-occurrence graph directly encodes assumption (II). Each edge in the graph indicates correlation strength between occurrences of two linked words. An example is shown in Figure 1.","In edge weight calculation, the co-occurrence frequencies are first computed for each word pair in the same context, and then the correlation strength is estimated. There are various definitions of a context or correlation measures that can be used (e.g. the","4","We can combine the association measures used in a co-occurrence graph and a similarity graph. We will leave this combination approach for future work. 27 approaches used for modeling contexts in context-similarity-based methods). In this paper, we use words in a predefined window (window size is 10 in our experiments) as the context and PMI as the correlation measure: wij = P M I(vi, vj) = log","p(vi, vj) p(vi) · p(vj) , where p(vi) (or p(vj)) is the probability that vi (or vj) occurs in a context, and p(vi, vj) is the probability that vi and vj co-occur within the same context. We estimate P M I(vi, vj) by the Bayesian method proposed by Andrade et al.(2010). Then, edges with a negative association, P M I(vi, vj) ≤ 0, are pruned in edge pruning. 3.1.2 Similarity Graph","Co-occurrence graphs are very sensitive to accidental relation caused by lower frequent co-occurrence. Thus, we propose a similarity graph where context similarities are employed as weights of edges instead of simple co-occurrence-based cor-relations. Since the context similarities are computed by the global correlation among words which co-occur, a similarity graph is less subject to accidental co-occurrence. The use of a similarity graph is inspired by assumption (III): a word and its translation tend to have similar context similarities with all bilingual seeds across languages5",".","In edge weight calculation, we first construct a correlation vector representing co-occurrence relations for each word. The correlation vectors are constructed in the same way as the context vectors used in context-similarity-based methods (see Section 2), where context words are words in a predefined window (window size is 4 in our experiment), the association measure is PMI, and context words are treated separately for each position. A correlation vector for each position is computed separately, then concatenated into a single vector within the window. Secondly, we calculate similarities between correlation vectors. There are various similarity measures that can be used, and cosine similarity is used in this 5","This assumption is justified because context similarities are based on co-occurrence relations that are preserved across different languages. paper: wij = Cos(⃗fi, ⃗fj) = ⃗fi · ⃗fj ∥⃗fi∥∥ ⃗fj∥ , where ⃗fi (or ⃗fj) is the correlation vector of vi (or vj). Then, in edge pruning, we preserve the edges with top 100 weight for each vertex. 3.2 Seed Propagation LP is a graph-based technique which transfers the labels from labeled data to unlabeled data in order to infer labels for unlabeled data. This is primarily used when there is scarce labeled data but abundant unlabeled data. LP has been successfully applied in common natural language process-ing tasks such as word sense disambiguation (Niu et al., 2005; Alexandrescu and Kirchhoff, 2007), multi-class lexicon acquisition (Alexandrescu and Kirchhoff, 2007), and part-of-speech tagging (Das and Petrov, 2011). LP iteratively propagates label information from any vertex to nearby vertices through weighted edges, and then a label distribution for each vertex is generated where the weights of all labels add up to 1.","We adopt LP to obtain relations with all bilingual seeds including indirect relations by treating each seed as a label. First, each translated seed is assigned to a label, and then the labels are propagated in the graph described in Section 3.1.","The seed distribution for each word is initialized as follows: q0 i (z) =    1 if vi ∈ Vs and z = vi 0 if vi ∈ Vs and z ̸= vi u(z) otherwise , where Vs is the set of vertices corresponding to translated seeds, u is a uniform distribution, qk","i (i = 1 · · · |V |) is the seed distribution for vi after k propagation, and qk","i (z) is the weight of a label (i.e., a translated seed) z in qk","i .","After initialization, we iteratively propagate the seeds through weighted edges. In each propagation, seeds are probabilistically propagated from linked vertices under the condition that larger edge weights allow seeds to travel through easier. Thus, the closer vertices are, the more likely they have similar seed distributions. In Figure 1, the balloons attached to 28 vertices in the graphs show examples of the seed distributions generated by propagations. For example, the English word “piranha” has the seed distribution where the weights of the seeds “Amazon”, “jungle”, and “fish” are 0.5, 0.3, and 0.2, respectively. Specifically, each of seed distributions is updated as follows: qm i (z) =    q0 i (z) if vi ∈ Vs","∑","vj∈N(vi) wij · qm−1","j (z) ∑","vj∈N(vi) wij otherwise , where N (vi) is the set of vertices linking to vi. We ran this procedure for 10 iterations in our experiments. 3.3 Translation Pair Extraction After label propagations, we treat a pair of words in different languages with similar seed distributions as a translation pair. Seed distribution can be regarded as a vector where each dimension corresponds to each translated seed and each dimension has updated weight through label propagations. A similarity between seed distributions can therefore be calculated in the same way as a context-similarity-based method. In this paper, we use the cosine similarity defined by the following:","Cos(qf x , qe","y) =","∑","si∈S qf x (vf i ) · qe","y(ve","i )","√∑","si∈S(qf","x (vf i ))2√∑","si∈S(qe","y(ve","i ))2 , where qf","x (or qe","y) is the seed distribution for a word x (or y) in the source language (or target language), S is the seed lexicon whose i-th entry si is a pairing of a translated seed in the source language vf","i and one in the target language ve","i ."]},{"title":"4 Experiment4.1 Experiment Data","paragraphs":["We used English and Japanese patent documents published between 1993 and 2005 by the US Patent & Trademark Office and the Japanese Patent Office respectively, which were a part of the data used in the NTCIR-8 patent translation task (Fujii et al., 2010). Note that these documents are not aligned.","There are over three million English-Japanese parallel sentences (e.g. training data, test data, and Pair Japanese Word English Word LexS 2,742 2,566 2,326 LexL 28,053 18,587 12,893 Table 1: Size of Seed Lexicons development data used in the NTCIR-8 patent translation task, which is called NTCIR parallel data hereafter) in the patent data. However, a preliminary examination showed that the NTCIR parallel data covers less than 3% of all words because there are a number of technical terms and neologisms. There-fore, the patent translation task is a task that requires bilingual lexicon extraction from non-parallel data.","We selected documents belonging to the physics domain from each monolingual corpus based on International Patent Classification (IPC) code6",", and then used them as a comparable corpus in our experiments. As a result, we used 1,479,831 Japanese documents and 438,227 English documents.

Table 1 shows the size of each seed lexicon.

This is because the purpose of our method is to complement existing bilingual dictionaries or parallel data. Note that the Japanese words in our test data may not have translation equivalents in the English side. 4.2 Competing Methods We evaluated two types of our label propagation based methods against two baselines. Cooc employs co-occurrence graphs and Sim uses similarity graphs when constructing graphs for label propagation as described in Section 3.","Rapp is a typical context-similarity-based method described in Section 2 (Rapp, 1999). Context words are words in a window (window size is 10) and are treated separately for each position. Associations with context words are computed using the log-likelihood ratio (Dunning, 1993). The similarity measure between context vectors is the city-block metric.","Andrade is a sophisticated method in context-similarity-based methods (Andrade et al., 2010). Context is a set of words with a positive association in a window (window size is 10). The association is calculated using the PMI estimated by a Bayesian method, and a similarity between contexts is estimated based on the number of overlapping words (see the original paper for details). 4.3 Experiment Results Table 2 shows the performance of each method using LexS or LexL.

We measure the performance on bilingual lexicon extraction as Top N accuracy (AccN ), which is the number of test words whose top N translation candidates contain a correct translation equivalent over the total number of test words (=1,000). Table 2 shows Top 1 and Top 20 accuracy. We manually9 evaluated whether translation candidates contained a correct translation equivalent. We did not use recall because we do not know if the translation equivalents of a test word appear in the corpus.","Table 2 shows that the proposed methods outperform the baselines both when using LexS and using LexL. The improvements are statistically significant in the sign-test with 1% significance-level. The results show that capturing the relations with all the seeds including indirect relations is effective.","The accuracies of the baselines in Table 2 are worse than the previous reports: 14% Acc1 and 46% Acc10 (Andrade et al., 2010), and 72% Acc1 (Rapp, 1999). This is because previous works evaluated only the queries whose translation equivalents existed in the experiment data, which is not always true in our experiments. Moreover, previous works evaluated only high-frequency words: common nouns (Rapp, 1999) and words with a document frequency of at least 50 (Andrade et al., 2010). Our test data, on the other hand, includes many low-frequency words. It is generally true that translation of high-frequency words is much easier than that of low frequency words.

The result shows that indirectly-related seeds are also important clues, and our proposed method can utilize these. 5.2 Impact of Seed Lexicon Size Table 2 shows that a reduction of seed lexicon size degrades performance. This is natural for the baseline methods because LexS cannot translate most of context words, which are necessary for word characterization. Consider Andrade(L) and Andrade(S) in the example in Section 5.1. Table 4 shows that Andrade(S) uses less relevant seeds with the query, and has to express the query by seeds with less association. For example, “ (psychosis)” cannot be used in Andrade(S) because LexS does not have the seed. Therefore, it is more difficult for Andrade(S) to find correct translation pairs.","The proposed methods also share the same tendency, although each word is expressed by all the seeds in the seed lexicon. Consider Cooc(L) and Cooc(S) in the above example. Table 4 shows that Cooc(S) expresses the query by a smooth seed distribution, which is difficult to discriminate from others. This is because LexS does not have relevant seeds for the query. This is why Cooc(S) cannot find the correct translation equivalent. On the other hand, Cooc(L) characterizes “” and “manic-depression” by strongly relevant seeds (e.g. “ (psychosis)”,“ (neurosis)”), and then finds the correct translation equivalent.","To examine the robustness-to-seed lexicon size, we calculated the reduction rate of Acc20 with the following expression: (Acc20 with LexL − Acc20 with LexS) / Acc20 with LexL. The reduction rates of Rapp, Andrade, Cooc, and Sim are 78.4%, 76.1%, 69.6%, and 62.4% respectively. Moreover, the difference between degradation in Cooc and that in Andrade is statistically significant in the sign-test with 1% significance-level. These results indicate that the proposed methods are more robust to seed lexicon size than the baselines. This is because the proposed methods can utilize seeds with indirect relations while the baselines utilize only seeds in the context.","To verify our claim, we examined the number of test words which occurred with no seeds in the context. There were 570 such words in Rapp(S), 387 in Rapp(L), 572 in Andrade(S), and 388 in Andrade(L). The baselines cannot find their trans-31 Low Freq. High Freq. Acc1 Acc20 Acc1 Acc20 Rapp(L) 0.5% 2.4% 7.2% 25.6% Andrade(L) 0.3% 1.8% 8.6% 26.3% Cooc(L) 0.8% 4.3% 13.9% 40.7% Sim(L) 2.2% 6.7% 15.0% 42.0% Table 5: Comparison between Performance for High and Low Frequency Words lation equivalents. Words such as this occur even if using LexL, and that number increases when LexS is used. On the other hand, the proposed methods are able to utilize all the seeds in order to find equivalents for words such as these. Therefore, the proposed methods work well even if the coverage of a seed lexicon is low. 5.3 Impact of Word Frequencies Our test data includes many low-frequency words which are not covered by the EDR bilingual dictionary or the NTCIR parallel data. 624 words appear in the corpus less than 50 times. Table 5 shows AccN using LexL for 624 low-frequency words and 376 high-frequency words. Table 5 shows that performance for low-frequency words is much worse than that for high-frequency words. This is because translation of high-frequency words utilizes abundant and reliable context information, while the context information for low-frequency words is statistically unreliable. In the proposed methods, edges linking rare words are sometimes generated based on accidental co-occurrences, and then unrelated seed information is transferred through the edges. Therefore, even our label propagation based methods, especially for Cooc, could not identify the correct translation equivalents for rare words. Sim alleviated the problem by using a similarity graph in which edges are generated based on global correlation among words, as indicated by Table 5. Table 5 also suggests that top 20 translation candidates for high-frequency words have potential to contribute to bilingual tasks such as MT and CLIR although the overall performance is still low. 5.4 Effect of Similarity Graphs We examined AccN for synonyms of translated seeds in Japanese. The Acc1 and Acc20 of Sim(L) are 15.6% and 56.3%, respectively, and those of Cooc(L) are 9.4% and 37.5%, respectively. The results show that similarity graphs are effective for clustering synonyms into the same translation equivalents. For example, Sim(L) extracted the correct translation pair of the English word “iodine” and the Japanese word “”, a synonym of the translated seed “ (iodine)” in Japanese. This is because synonyms tend to be linked in the similarity graph and have similar seed distributions. On the other hand, in the co-occurrence graph, synonyms tend to be indirectly linked through mutual context words, so the seed distributions of the two could be far away from each other.","There are in particular many loanwords in patent documents, which are spelled in different ways from person to person. For example, the loan word for the English word “user” is often written as “”, but it is sometimes written as “”, with an additional prolonged sound mark. Therefore, Sim is particularly effective for the experiment data. 5.5 Error Analysis We discuss errors of the proposed methods except the errors for low-frequency words (see Section 5.3). Our test data includes words whose translation equivalents inherently cannot be found. The first of these types are words whose equivalent does not exist in the English corpus. This is an unavoidable problem for methods based on comparable corpora. The second one are words whose English equivalents are compound words. The Japanese morphological analyzer tends to group a compound word into a single word, while the English text analyzer does not perform a collocation of words divided by the delimiter space. For example, the single Japanese word “” is equivalent to “palm pattern” or “palm print”, which is composed of two words. This case was counted as an error even though the proposed methods found the word “palm” as a equivalent of “”.","A main reason of errors other than those above is word sense ambiguity, which is different in every language. For example, the Japanese word “” 32 means “right” and “conservatism” in English. The proposed methods merge different senses by propagating seeds through these polysemous words in only one language side. This is why translation pairs could have wrong seed distributions and then the proposed methods could not identify correct translation pairs. We will leave this word sense disambiguation problem for future work."]},{"title":"6 Related Work","paragraphs":["Besides the comparable corpora approach discussed in Section 2, many alternatives have been proposed for bilingual lexicon extraction. The first is a method that finds translation pairs in parallel corpora (Wu and Xia, 1994; Fung and Church, 1994; Och and Ney, 2003). However, large parallel corpora are only available for a few language pairs and for limited domains. Moreover, even the large parallel corpora are relatively smaller than comparable corpora.","The second is a method that exploits the Web. Lu et al. (2004) extracted translation pairs by mining web anchor texts and link structures. As an alternative, mixed-language web pages are exploited by first retrieving texts including both source and target languages from the web by using a search engine or simple rules, and then extracting translation pairs from the mixed-language texts utilizing various clues: Zhang and Vines (2004) used co-occurrence statistics, Cheng et al. (2004) used cooccurrences and context similarity information, and Huang et al. (2005) used phonetic, semantic and frequency-distance features. Lin et al. (2008) proposed a method for extracting parenthetically translated terms, where a word alignment algorithm is used for establishing the correspondences between in-parenthesis and pre-parenthesis words. However, those methods cannot find translation pairs when they are not connected with each other through link structures, or when they do not co-occur in the same text.","Transliteration is a completely different way for bilingual lexicon acquisition, in which a word in one language is converted into another language using phonetic equivalence (Knight and Graehl, 1998; Karimi et al., 2011). Although machine transliteration works particularly well for proper names and loan words, it cannot be employed for phonetically dissimilar translations.","All the methods mentioned above may potentially extract translation pairs more precisely than our comparable corpora approach when their underlying assumptions are satisfied. We might improve the performance of our method by augmenting a seed lexicon with translation pairs extracted using the above methods, as experimented with in Section 4, in which additional lexical entries are included from parallel data."]},{"title":"7 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We proposed a novel bilingual lexicon extraction method using label propagation for alleviating the limited seed lexicon size problem. The proposed method captures relations with all the seeds including indirect relations by propagating seed information. Moreover, we proposed using similarity graphs in propagation process in addition to co-occurrence graphs. Our experiments showed that the proposed method outperforms conventional context-similarity-based methods (Rapp, 1999; Andrade et al., 2010), and the similarity graphs improve the performance by clustering synonyms into the same translation.","We are planning to investigate the following open problems in future work: word sense disambiguation and translation of compound words as described in (Daille and Morin, 2005; Morin et al., 2007). In addition, indirect relations have also been used in other tasks, such as paraphrase acquisition from bilingual parallel corpora (Kok and Brockett, 2010). We will utilize their random walk approach or other graph-based techniques such as modified adsorp-tion (Talukdar and Crammer, 2009) for generating seed distributions. We are also planning an end-to-end evaluation, for instance, by employing the extracted bilingual lexicon into an MT system."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["We thank anonymous reviewers of EMNLP-CoNLL 2012 for helpful suggestions and comments on a first version of this paper.
