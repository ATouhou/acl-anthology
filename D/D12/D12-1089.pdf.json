This is not only due to improved modeling, but also due to a significant increase in the availability of monolingual and bilingual data. Here are just two examples of very large data resources that are publicly available:","• The Google Web 1T 5-gram corpus available from the Linguistic Data Consortium consist-ing of the 5-gram counts of about one trillion words of web data.1","• The 109","-French-English bilingual corpus with about one billion tokens from the Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation (WMT).2","These enormous data sets yield translation models that are expensive to store and process. Even with 1 LDC catalog No. LDC2006T13 2 http://www.statmt.org/wmt11/translation-task.html modern computers, these large models lead to a long experiment cycle that hinders progress. The situa-tion is even more severe if computational resources are limited, for instance when translating on handheld devices. Then, reducing the model size is of the utmost importance.","The most resource-intensive components of a statistical machine translation system are the language model and the phrase table. Recently, compact representations of the language model have attracted the attention of the research community, for instance in Talbot and Osborne (2007), Brants et al. (2007), Pauls and Klein (2011) or Heafield (2011), to name a few. In this paper, we address the other problem of any statistical machine translation system: large phrase tables.","Johnson et al. (2007) has shown that large por-tions of the phrase table can be removed without loss in translation quality. This motivated us to perform a systematic comparison of different pruning methods. However, we found that many existing methods employ ad-hoc heuristics without theoretical foundation.","The pruning criterion introduced in this work is inspired by the very successful and still state-of-the-art language model pruning criterion based on entropy measures (Stolcke, 1998). We motivate its derivation by stating the desiderata for a good phrase table pruning criterion: • Soundness: The criterion should optimize some well-understood information-theoretic measure of translation model quality. 972","• Efficiency: Pruning should be fast, i. e., run linearly in the size of the phrase table.","• Self-containedness: As a practical considera-tion, we want to prune phrases from an existing phrase table. This means pruning should use only information contained in the model itself.","• Good empirical behavior: We would like to be able to prune large parts of the phrase table without significant loss in translation quality.","Analyzing existing pruning techniques based on these objectives, we found that they are commonly deficient in at least one of them. We thus designed a novel pruning criterion that not only meets these objectives, it also performs very well in empirical evaluations.","The novel contributions of this paper are:","1. a systematic description of existing phrase table pruning methods.","2. a new, theoretically sound phrase table pruning criterion.","3. an experimental comparison of several pruning methods for several language pairs."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["The most basic pruning methods rely on probability and count cutoffs. We will cover the techniques that are implemented in the Moses toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007) and the Pharaoh decoder (Koehn, 2004) in Section 3. We are not aware of any work that analyzes their efficacy in a systematic way. It is thus not surprising that some of them perform poorly, as our experimental results will show.","The work of Johnson et al. (2007) is promis-ing as it shows that large parts of the phrase table can be removed without affecting translation quality. Their pruning criterion relies on statistical significance tests. However, it is unclear how this significance-based pruning criterion is related to translation model quality. Furthermore, a comparison to other methods is missing. Here we close this gap and perform a systematic comparison. The same idea of significance-based pruning was exploited in (Yang and Zheng, 2009; Tomeh et al., 2009) for hierarchical statistical machine translation.","A different approach to phrase table pruning was undertaken by Eck et al. (2007a; 2007b). They rely on usage statistics from translating sample data, so it is not self-contained. However, it could be combined with the methods proposed here.","Another approach to phrase table pruning is triangulation (Chen et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2009). This requires additional bilingual corpora, namely from the source language as well as from the target language to a third bridge language. In many situations this does not exist or would be costly to generate.","Duan et al. (2011), Sanchis-Trilles et al. (2011) and Tomeh et al. (2011) modify the phrase extraction methods in order to reduce the phrase table size. The work in this paper is independent of the way the phrase extraction is done, so those approaches are complementary to our work."]},{"title":"3 Pruning Using Simple Statistics","paragraphs":["In this section, we will review existing pruning methods based on simple phrase table statistics. There are two common classes of these methods: absolute phrase table pruning and relative phrase table pruning. 3.1 Absolute pruning Absolute pruning methods rely only on the statistics of a single phrase pair ( f̃ , ẽ). Hence, they are independent of other phrases in the phrase table. As opposed to relative pruning methods (Section 3.2), they may prune all translations of a source phrase. Their application is easy and efficient.","• Count-based pruning. This method prunes a phrase pair ( f̃ , ẽ) if its observation count N ( f̃ , ẽ) is below a threshold τc: N ( f̃ , ẽ) < τc (1) • Probability-based pruning. This method prunes a phrase pair ( f̃ , ẽ) if its probability is below a threshold τp: p(ẽ| f̃ ) < τp (2) Here the probability p(ẽ| f̃ ) is estimated via relative frequencies. 973 3.2 Relative pruning A potential problem with the absolute pruning methods is that it can prune all occurrences of a source phrase f̃ .3","Relative pruning methods avoid this by considering the full set of target phrases for a specific source phrase f̃ . • Threshold pruning. This method discards those phrases that are far worse than the best target phrase for a given source phrase f̃ . Given a pruning threshold τt, a phrase pair ( f̃ , ẽ) is discarded if:","p(ẽ| f̃ ) < τt · max ẽ {","p(ẽ| f̃ )} (3)","• Histogram pruning. An alternative to threshold pruning is histogram pruning. For each source phrase f̃ , this method preserves the K target phrases with highest probability p(ẽ| f̃ ) or, equivalently, their count N ( f̃ , ẽ).","Note that, except for count-based pruning, none of the methods take the frequency of the source phrase into account. As we will confirm in the empirical evaluation, this will likely cause drops in translation quality, since frequent source phrases are more use-ful than the infrequent ones."]},{"title":"4 Significance Pruning","paragraphs":["In this section, we briefly review significance pruning following Johnson et al. (2007). The idea of significance pruning is to test whether a source phrase f̃ and a target phrase ẽ co-occur more frequently in a bilingual corpus than they should just by chance. Using some simple statistics derived from the bilingual corpus, namely • N ( f̃ ) the count of the source phrase f̃ • N (ẽ) the count of the target phrase ẽ","• N ( f̃ , ẽ) the co-occurence count of the source phrase f̃ and the target phrase ẽ","• N the number of sentences in the bilingual corpus 3 Note that it has never been systematically investigated","whether this is a real problem or just speculation. we can compute the two-by-two contingency table in Table 1.","Following Fisher’s exact test, we can calculate the probability of the contingency table via the hypergeometric distribution: ph(N ( f̃ , ẽ)) =","(","N( f̃)","N( f̃,ẽ) ) · (","N−N( f̃)","N(ẽ)−N( f̃,ẽ) ) (","N N(ẽ) ) (4)","The p-value is then calculated as the sum of all probabilities that are at least as extreme. The lower the p-value, the less likely this phrase pair occurred with the observed frequency by chance; we thus prune a phrase pair ( f̃ , ẽ) if:","  ∞ ∑ k=N( f̃,ẽ) ph(k)   > τF (5) for some pruning threshold τF . More details of this approach can be found in Johnson et al. (2007). The idea of using Fisher’s exact test was first explored by Moore (2004) in the context of word alignment."]},{"title":"5 Entropy-based Pruning","paragraphs":["In this section, we will derive a novel entropy-based pruning criterion. 5.1 Motivational Example In general, pruning the phrase table can be considered as selecting a subset of the original phrase table. When doing so, we would like to alter the original translation model distribution as little as possible. This is a key difference to previous approaches: Our goal is to remove redundant phrases, whereas previous approaches usually try to remove low-quality or unreliable phrases. We believe this to be an advantage of our method as it is certainly easier to measure the redundancy of phrases than it is to estimate their quality.","In Table 2, we show some example phrases from the learned French-English WMT phrase table, along with their counts and probabilities. For the French phrase le gouvernement franca̧is, we have, among others, two translations: the French government and the government of France. If we have to prune one of those translations, we can ask our-selves: how would the translation cost change if the 974 N ( f̃ , ẽ) N ( f̃ ) − N ( f̃ , ẽ) N ( f̃ ) N (ẽ) − N ( f̃ , ẽ) N − N ( f̃ ) − N (ẽ) + N ( f̃ , ẽ) N − N ( f̃ ) N (ẽ) N − N (ẽ) N Table 1: Two-by-two contingency table for a phrase pair ( f̃ , ẽ).

Removing the phrase the government of France would increase this cost dramatically. Given the shorter phrases from the table, the probability would be 0.7189 · 0.4106 · 0.0046 = 0.0014∗",", which is about an order of a magnitude smaller than the original probability of 0.0128.","On the other hand, composing the phrase the French government out of shorter phrases has probability 0.7189 · 0.4106 · 0.6440 = 0.1901, which is very close to the original probability of 0.1686. This means it is safe to discard the phrase the French government, since the translation cost remains essentially unchanged. By contrast, discarding the phrase the government of France does not have this effect: it leads to a large change in translation cost.","Note that here the pruning criterion only considers redundancy of the phrases, not the quality. Thus, we are not saying that the government of France is a better translation than the French government, only that it is less redundant. ∗ We use the assumption that we can simply multiply the","probabilities of the shorter phrases. 5.2 Entropy Criterion Now, we are going to formalize the notion of redundancy. We would like the pruned model p′","(ẽ| f̃ ) to be as similar as possible to the original model p(ẽ| f̃ ). We use conditional Kullback-Leibler divergence, also called conditional relative entropy (Cover and Thomas, 2006), to measure the model similarity:","D(p(ẽ| f̃ )||p′ (ẽ| f̃ ))","= ∑","f̃ p( f̃ ) ∑","ẽ p(ẽ| f̃ ) log [","p(ẽ| f̃ )","p′","(ẽ| f̃ ) ] (6)","= ∑","f̃,ẽ p(ẽ, f̃ ) [ log p(ẽ| f̃ ) − log p′","(ẽ| f̃ )]","(7)","Computing the best pruned model of a given size would require optimizing over all subsets with that size. Since that is computationally infeasible, we in-stead apply the equivalent approximation that Stolcke (1998) uses for language modeling. This as-sumes that phrase pairs affect the relative entropy roughly independently.","We can then choose a pruning threshold τE and prune those phrase pairs with a contribution to the relative entropy below that threshold. Thus, we 975 prune a phrase pair ( f̃ , ẽ), if","p(ẽ, f̃ ) [","log p(ẽ| f̃ ) − log p′","(ẽ| f̃ )]","< τE (8)","We now address how to assign the probability p′","(ẽ| f̃ ) under the pruned model. A phrase-based system selects among different segmentations of the source language sentence into phrases. If a segmentation into longer phrases does not exist, the system has to compose a translation out of shorter phrases. Thus, if a phrase pair ( f̃ , ẽ) is no longer available, the decoder has to use shorter phrases to produce the same translation. We can therefore decompose the pruned model score p′","(ẽ| f̃ ) by summing over all segmentations sK","1 and all reorderings πK","1 :","p′","(ẽ| f̃ ) = ∑","sK","1 ,πK 1 p(sK","1 , πK","1 | f̃ ) · p(ẽ|sK","1 , πK","1 , f̃ ) (9) Here the segmentation sK","1 divides both the source and target phrases into K sub-phrases: f̃ = f̄π1... f̄πK and ẽ = ē1...ēK (10) The permutation πK","1 describes the alignment of those sub-phrases, such that the sub-phrase ēk is aligned to f̄πk . Using the normal phrase translation model, we obtain:","p′","(ẽ| f̃ ) = ∑","sK","1 ,πK 1 p(sK","1 , πK","1 | f̃ ) K","∏","k=1 p(ēk| f̄πk ) (11)","Virtually all phrase-based decoders use the so-called maximum-approximation, i. e. the sum is replaced with the maximum. As we would like the pruning criterion to be similar to the search criterion used during decoding, we do the same and obtain:","p′","(ẽ| f̃ ) ≈ max sK 1 ,πK","1 K","∏","k=1 p(ēk| f̄πk ) (12) Note that we also drop the segmentation probability, as this is not used at decoding time. This leaves the pruning criterion a function only of the model p(ẽ| f̃ ) as stored in the phrase table. There is no need for a special development or adaptation set. We can determine the best segmentation using dynamic programming, similar to decoding with a phrase-based model. However, here the target side is constrained to the given phrase ẽ.","It can happen that a phrase is not compositional, i. e., we cannot find a segmentation into shorter phrases. In these cases, we assign a small, constant probability:","p′","(ẽ| f̃ ) = pc (13) We found that the value pc = e−10","works well for many language pairs. 5.3 Computation In our experiments, it was more efficient to vary the pruning threshold τE without having to re-compute the entire phrase table. Therefore, we computed the entropy criterion in Equation (8) once for the whole phrase table. This introduces an approximation for the pruned model score p′","(ẽ| f̃ ). It might happen that we prune short phrases that were used as part of the best segmentation of longer phrases. As these shorter phrases should not be available, the pruned model score might be inaccurate. Although we believe this effect is minor, we leave a detailed experimental analysis for future work.","One way to avoid this approximation would be to perform entropy pruning with increasing phrase length. Starting with one-word phrases, which are trivially non-compositional, the entropy criterion would be straightforward to compute. Proceed-ing to two-word phrases, one would decompose the phrases into sub-phrases by looking up the probabilities of some of the unpruned one-word phrases. Once the set of unpruned two-word phrases was obtained, one would continue with three-word phrases, etc."]},{"title":"6 Experimental Evaluation6.1 Data Sets","paragraphs":["In this section, we describe the data sets used for the experiments.

We used a phrase-based statistical machine translation system similar to (Zens et al., 2002; Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004; Zens and Ney, 2008). We trained a 4-gram language model on the target side of the bilingual corpora and a second 4-gram language model on the provided monolingual news data. All language models used Kneser-Ney smoothing.","The baseline system uses the common phrase translation models, such as p(ẽ| f̃ ) and p( f̃ |ẽ), lexical models, word and phrase penalty, distortion penalty as well as a lexicalized reordering model (Zens and Ney, 2006).","The word alignment was trained with six itera-tions of IBM model 1 (Brown et al., 1993) and 6 it-erations of the HMM alignment model (Vogel et al., 1996) using a symmetric lexicon (Zens et al., 2004).","The feature weights were tuned on a development set by applying minimum error rate training (MERT) under the Bleu criterion (Och, 2003; Macherey et al., 2008). We ran MERT once with the full phrase table and then kept the feature weights fixed, i. e., we did not rerun MERT after pruning to avoid adding unnecessary noise.

Thus, they reach a point where they cannot prune the phrase table any further. The results shown are for German-English; the results for the other languages are very similar. The results that follow use only the absolute pruning method as a representative for probability-based pruning.","In Figures 2 through 5, we show the translation quality as a function of the phrase table size. We vary the pruning thresholds to obtain different phrase table sizes. We compare four pruning methods:","• Count. Pruning based on the frequency of a phrase pair, c.f. Equation (1).","• Prob. Pruning based on the absolute probability of a phrase pair, c.f. Equation (2).","• Fisher. Pruning using significance tests, c.f. Equation (5).","• Entropy. Pruning using the novel entropy criterion, c.f. Equation (8). Note that the x-axis of these figures is on a logarithmic scale, so the differences between the methods can be quite dramatic. For instance, entropy pruning requires less than a quarter of the number of phrases needed by count- or significance-based pruning to achieve a Spanish-English Bleu score of 34 (0.4 million phrases compared to 1.7 million phrases).","These results clearly show how the pruning methods compare:","1. Probability-based pruning performs poorly. It should be used only to prune small fractions of the phrase table.","2. Count-based pruning and significance-based pruning perform equally well. They are much better than probability-based pruning.","3. Entropy pruning consistently outperforms the other methods across translation directions and language pairs.","Figures 6 and 7 show compositionality statistics for the pruned Spanish-English phrase table (we observed similar results for the other language pairs).

Each figure shows the composition of the phrase table for a type of pruning for different phrase tables sizes. Along the x-axis, we plotted the phrase table size. These are the same phrase tables used to obtain the Bleu scores in Figure 2 (left). The different shades of grey correspond to different phrase lengths. For instance, in case of the smallest phrase table for count-based pruning, the 1-word phrases account for about 30% of all phrases, the 2-word phrases account for about 35% of all phrases, etc.","With the exception of the probability-based pruning, the plots look comparable. The more aggressive the pruning, the larger the percentage of short phrases. We observe that entropy-based pruning removes many more long phrases than any of the other methods. The plot for probability-based pruning is different in that the percentage of long phrases actually increases with more aggressive pruning (i. e. smaller phrase tables). A possible explanation is that probability-based pruning does not take the frequency of the source phrase into account. This difference might explain the poor performance of probability-based pruning.","To analyze how many phrases are compositional, we collect statistics during the computation of the entropy criterion. These are shown in Table 4, accumulated across all language pairs and all phrases, i. e., including singleton phrases. We see that 96% of all phrases are compositional (3 970 million out of 4 137 million phrases). Furthermore, out of the 167 million non-compositional phrases, more than half (85 million phrases), are trivially non-compositional: they consist only of a single source or target language word.
