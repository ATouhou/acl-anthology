Recently, tense has drawn attention in many natural language processing applications. However, most of current Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems mainly depend on translation model and language model. They never consider and make full use of tense information. In this paper, we propose n-gram-based tense models for SMT and successfully integrate them into a state-of-the-art phrase-based SMT system via two additional features. Experimental results on the NIST Chinese-English translation task show that our proposed tense models are very effective, contributing performance improvement by 0.62 BLUE points over a strong baseline."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["For many NLP applications, such as event extraction and summarization, tense has been regarded as a key factor in providing temporal order. However, tense information has been largely overlooked by current SMT research. Consider the following example: SRC: ø B$ · e (J , U N y3 ‡ , N ¥I m ” ’X \" REF:The embargo is a result of the Cold War and does not reflect the present situation nor the partnership between China and the EU. MOSES: the embargo is the result of the cold war, not reflect the present situation, it did not reflect the partnership with the european union.","∗","*Corresponding author.","Although the translated text produced by Moses1 is understandable, it has very odd tense combination from the grammatical aspect, i.e. with tense inconsistency (is/does in REF vs. is/did in Moses). Obviously, slight modification, such as changing “is” into “was”, can much improve the readability of the translated text. It is also interesting to note that such modification can much affect the evaluation. If we change “did” to “does”, the BLEU-4 score increases from 22.65 to 27.86 (as matching the 4-gram “does not reflect the” in REF). However, if we change “is” to “was”, the BLEU score decreases from 22.65 to 21.44.","The above example seems special. To testify its impact on SMT in wider range, we design a special experiment based on the 2005 NIST MT data (see section 6.1). This data has 4 references. We choose one reference and modify its sentences with error tense2",". After that, we use other 3 references to measure this reference. The modified reference leads to a sharp drop in BLEU-4 score, from 52.46 to 50.27 in all. So it is not a random phenomenon that tense can affect translation results.","The key is how to detect tense errors and choose correct tenses during the translation procedure. By carefully comparing the references with Moses output, we obtain the following useful observations,","Observation(1): to most simple sentences, coordinate verbs should be translated with the same tense while they have different tense in Moses output;","Observation(2): to some compound sentences, 1 http://www.statmt.org/moses/ 2 Such changes are small by mainly modifying one auxiliary","verb for a sentence, such as “is → was”, “has → had”. 276 the subordinate clause should have the consistent tense with its main clause while Moses fails;","Observation(3): the diversity of tense usage in a document is common. However, in most cases, the neighbored sentences tends to share the same main tense. In some extreme examples, one tense (past or present), even dominates the whole document.","One possible solution to model above observations is using rules. Dorr (2002) refers to six basic English tense structures and defines the possible paired combinations of “present, past, future”. But the practical cases are very complicated, especial-ly in news domain. There are a lot of complicat-ed sentences in news articles. Our preliminary investigation shows that such six paired combinations can only cover limited real cases in Chinese-English SMT.","This paper proposes a simple yet effective method to model above observations. For each target sentence in the training corpus, we first parse it and extract its tense sequence. Then, a target-side tense n-gram model is constructed. Such model can be used to estimate the rationality of tense combination in a sentence and thus supervise SMT to reduce tense inconsistency errors against Observations (1) and (2) in the sentence-level. In comparison, Observation (3) actually reflects the tense distributions among one document. After extracting each main tense for each sentence, we build another tense n-gram model in the document-level. For clarity, this paper denotes document-level tense as “inter-tense” and sentence-level tense as “intra-tense”.","After that, we propose to integrate such tense models into SMT systems in a dynamic way. It is well known there are many errors in the current MT output (David et al., 2006). Unlike previously making trouble with reference texts, the BLEU-4 score cannot be influenced obviously by modifying a small part of abnormal sentences in a static way. In our system, both inter-tense and intra-tense model are integrated into a SMT system via additional features and thus can supervise the decoding procedure. During decoding, once some words with correct tense can be determined, with the help of language model and other related features, the small component–“tense”–can affect surrounding words and improve the performance of the whole sentence. Our experimental results (see the examples in Section 6.4) show the effectiveness of this way.","Rather than the rule-based model, our models are fully statistical-based. So they can be easily scaled up and integrated into either phrase-based or syntax-based SMT systems. In this paper, we employ a strong phrase-based SMT baseline system, as proposed in Gong et al. (2011), which uses document as translation unit, for better incorporating document-level information.","The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the related work. Section 3 and 4 are related to tense models. Section 3 describes the preprocessing work for building tense models. Section 4 presents how to build target-side tense models and discuss their characteristics. Section 5 shows our way of integrating such tense models into a SMT system. Session 6 gives the experimental results. Finally, we conclude this paper in Section 7."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["In this section, we focus on related work on integrating the tense information into SMT. Since both inter-and intra-tense models need to analyze and extract tense information, we also give a brief overview on tense prediction (or tagging). 2.1 Tense Prediction The tense prediction task often needs to build a model based on a large corpus annotated with temporal relations and thus its focus is on how to recognize, interpret and normalize time expressions. As a representative, Lapata and Lascarides (2006) proposed a simple yet effective data-intensive approach. In particular, they trained models on main and subordinate clauses connected with some special temporal marker words, such as “after” and “before”, and employed them in temporal inference.","Another typical task is cross-lingual tense predication. Some languages, such as English, are inflectional, whose verbs can express tense via certain stems or suffix, while others, such as Chinese often lack inflectional forms. Take Chinese to English translation as example, if Chinese text contains particle word “(Le)”, the nearest Chinese verb prefers to be translated into English verb with the past tense. Ye and Zhang (2005), Ye et al. (2007) and Liu et al. (2011) focus on labeling the tenses for keywords in 277 source-side language.","Ye and Zhang (2005) first built a small amoun-t of manually-labeled data, which provide the tense mapping from Chinese text to English text. Then, they trained a CRF-based tense classifier to label tense on Chinese documents. Ye et al. (2007) further reported that syntactic features contribute most to the marking of aspectual information. Liu et al. (2011) proposed a parallel mapping method to automatically generate annotated data. In particular, they used English verbs to label tense information for Chinese verbs via a parallel Chinese-English corpus.","It is reasonable to label such source-side verb to supervise the translation process since the tense of English sentence is often determined by verbs. The problem is that due to the diversity of English verb inflection, it is difficult to map such Chinese tense information into the English text. To our best knowledge, although above works attempt to serve for SMT, all of them fail to address how to integrate them into a SMT system. 2.2 Machine Translation with Tense Dorr (1992) described a two-level knowledge representation model based on Lexical Conceptual Structures (LCS) for machine translation which integrates the aspectual information and the lexical-semantic information. Her system is based on an inter-lingual model and does not belong to a SMT system.","Olsen et al. (2001) relied on LCS to generate appropriately-tensed English translations for Chinese. In particular, they addressed tense reconstruc-tion on a binary taxonomy (present and past) for Chinese text and reported that incorporating lexical aspect features of telicity can obtain a 20% to 35% boost in accuracy on tense realization.","Ye et al. (2006) showed that incorporating latent features into tense classifiers can boost the performance. They reported the tense resolution results based on the best-ranked translation text produced by a SMT system. However, they did not report the variation of translation performance after introduc-ing tense information."]},{"title":"3 Preprocessing for Tense Modeling","paragraphs":["In this paper, tense modeling is done on the target-side language. Since our experiments are done on Chinese to English SMT, our tense models are learned only from the English text. In the literature, the taxonomy of English tenses typically includes three basic tenses (i.e. present, past and future) plus their combination with the progressive and perfective aspects. Here, we consider four basic tenses: present, past, future and UNK (unknown) and ignore the aspectual information. Furthermore, we assume that one sentence has only one main tense but maybe has many subordinate tenses.","This section describes the preprocessing work of building tense models, which mainly involves how to extract tense sequence via tense verbs. 3.1 Tense Verbs Lapata et al.(2006) used syntactic parse trees to find clauses connected with special aspect markers and collected them to train some special classifiers for temporal inference. Inspired by their work, we use the Stanford parser3","to parse tense sequence for each sentence.","Take the following three typical sentences as examples, (a) is a simple sentence which contains two coordinate verbs, while (b) and (c) are compound sentences and (b) contains a quoted text. (a) Japan’s constitution renounces the right to go to war and prohibits the nation from having military forces except for selfdefense. (b) “We also hope Hong Kong will not be affected by diseases like the severe acute respiratory syndrome again!” , added Ms. Yang. (c) Cheng said he felt at home in Hong Kong and he sincerely wished Hong Kong more peaceful and more prosperous.","Figure 1 shows the parse tree with Penn Treebank style for each sentence, which has strict level structures and POS tags for all the terminal words. Here, the level structures mainly contribute to extract main tense for each sentence (to be described in Section 3.2) and POS tags are utilized to detect tense verbs, i.e. verbs with tense information.","Normally, POS tags in the parse tree can distinguish five different forms of verbs: the base form (tagged as VB), and forms with overt endings D for","3","http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.shtml 278 Figure 1: The Stanford parse trees with Penn Treebank style past tense, G for present participle, N for past participle, and Z for third person singular present. It is worth noting that VB, VBG and VBN cannot determine the specific tenses by themselves. In addition, the verbs with POS tag “MD” need to be special-ly considered to distinguish future tense from other tenses.","Algorithm 1 illustrates how to determine what tense a node has. If the return value is not “UNK”, the node belongs to a tense verb. Algorithm 1 Determine the tense of a node. Input:","The TreeNode of one parse tree, leaf node; Output:","The tense, tense; 1: tense = “U N K′′ 2: Obtaining the POS tag lpostag from leaf node; 3: Obtaining the word lword from leaf node; 4: if (lpostag in [“V BP ′′",", “V BZ′′","]) then 5: tense = “present′′ 6: else if (lpostag == “V BD′′","]) then 7: tense = “past′′ 8: else if (lpostag == “M D′′","]) then 9: if (lword in [“will′′",", “ll′′",", “shall′′","]) then 10: tense = “f uture′′ 11: else if (lword in [“would′′",", “could′′","]) then 12: tense = “past′′ 13: else 14: tense = “present′′ 15: end if 16: end if 17: return tense; 3.2 Tense Extraction Based on Tense Verbs As described in Section 1, the inter-tense (document-level) refers to the main tense of one sentence and the intra-tense (sentence-level) corresponds to all tense sequence of one sentence. This section introduces how to recognize the main tense and extract all useful tense sequence for each sentence.","The idea of determining the main tense is to find the tense verb located in the top level of a parse tree. According to the Penn Treebank style, the method to determine the main tense can be described as follows: (1) Traverse the parse tree top-down until a tree node","containing more than one child is identified, denot-","ed as Sm . (2) Consider each child of Sm with tag “VP”, recursive-","ly traverse such “VP” node to find a tense verb. If","found, use it as the main tense and return the tense;","if not, go to step (3). (3) Consider each child of Sm with tag “S”, which ac-","tually corresponds to subordinate clause of this sen-","tence. Starting from the first subordinate clause, ap-","ply the similar policy of step (2) to find the tense","verb. If not found, search remaining subordinate","clauses. (4) If no tense verb found, return “UNK” as the main","tense.","Here, “VP” nodes dominated by Sm directly are preferred over those located in subordinate clauses. This is to ensure that the main tense is decided by the top-level tense verb. 279","Take Figure 1 as an example, the main tense of sentence (a) and (b) can be determined only by step (2). The tense verb of “(VBZ renounces)” dominated in the “VP” tag determines that (a) is in present tense. Similarly the node “(VBD added)” indicates that (b) is in past tense. Sentence (c) needs to be further treated by step (3) since there is no “VP” nodes dominated by Sm directly. The node “(VBD said)” located in the first subordinate clause shows its main tense is “past”.","The next task is to extract the tense sequence for each sentence. They are determined by all tense verbs in this sentence according to the strict top-down order. For example, the tense sequence of sentence (a), (b) and (c) are {present, present}, {present, future, past} and {past, past, past}. In order to explore whether the main tense of intra-tense model has an impact on SMT or not, we introduce a special marker “*” to denote the main tense. So the tense sequence marked with main tense of (a), (b) and (c) are {present*, present},{present, future, past*} and {past*, past, past}. It is worth noting, the intra-tense model (see Section 4) based on the latter tense sequence is different to the former."]},{"title":"4 N-gram-based Tense Models4.1 Tense N-gram Estimation","paragraphs":["After applying the previous method to extract tense for an English text corpus, we can obtain a big tense corpus.","Given the current tense is indexed as ti, we call the previous n − 1 tenses plus the current tense as tense n-gram.","Based on the tense corpus, tense n-gram statistics can be done according to the Formula 1. P (ti|t(i−(n−1)), ..., t(i−1)) =","count(t(i−(n−1)), . . . , t(i−1), ti) count(t(i−(n−1)), ..., t(i−1)) (1) Here, the function of “count” return the tense n-gram frequency. In order to avoid doing specific smooth-ing work, we estimate tense n-gram probability using SRI language modeling (SRILM) tool (Stolcke, 2002).","To compute the probability of intra-tense n-gram, we first extract all tense sequence for each sentence and put them into a new file. Based on this new file, we can get the intra-tense n-gram model via SRILM tool.","To compute the probability of inter-tense n-gram, we need to extract the main tense for each sentence at first. Then, for each document, we re-organized the main tenses of all sentences into a special line. After putting all these special lines into a new file, we can use SRILM to obtain the inter-tense n-gram model. 4.2 Characteristic of Tense N-gram Models We construct n-gram-based tense models on English Gigaword corpus (LDC2003T05). This corpus is used to build language model for most SMT systems. It includes 30221 documents (we remove such files: file size is less than 1K or the number of continuous “UNK” tenses is greater than 5).","Figure 2 shows the unigram and bigram probabilities (Log10-style) for intra-tense and inter-tense.","The part (a) and (c) in Figure 2 refer to unigram. The horizontal axis indicts tense type, and the vertical axis shows its probabilities. The parts (a) and (c) also indicate “present” and “past” are two main tense types in news domain.","The part (b) and (d) refer to bigram. The horizontal axis indicts history tense. Each different colorful bar indicts one current tense. The vertical axis shows the transfer possibilities from a history tense to a current tense.","The part (b)4","reflects transfer possibilities of tense types in one sentence. It also slightly reflects some linguistic information. For example, in one sentence, the probability of co-occurrence of “present → present”, “past → past” and “future → present” is more than other combinations, which can be against tense inconsistency errors described in Observation (1) and (2) (see Section 1). However, it seems strange that “present → past” exceeds “present → future”. We checked our corpus and found a lot of sentences like this–“the bill has been . . . , he said. ”.","The part (d) shows tense type can be switched between two neighbored sentences. However, it shows the strong tendency to use the same tense type for 4","The co-occurrence of the “UNK” tense and other tense types in one sentence cannot happen, so the “UNK” tense is omitted. 280 Figure 2: statistics of intra-tense and inter-tense N-gram neighbored sentences. This statistics conform to the previous observation (3) very much."]},{"title":"5 Integrating N-gram-based Tense Modelsinto SMT","paragraphs":["In this section, we discuss how to integrate the previous tense models into a SMT system. 5.1 Basic phrase-based SMT system It is well known that the translation process of SMT can be modeled as obtaining the best translation e of the source sentence f by maximizing following posterior probability(Brown et al., 1993):","ebest = arg max e P (e|f )","= arg max e P (f |e)Plm(e) (2) where P (e|f ) is a translation model and Plm is a language model.","Our baseline is a modified Moses, which follows Koehn et al. (2003) and adopts similar six groups of features. Besides, the log-linear model ( Och and Ney, 2000) is employed to linearly interpolate these features for obtaining the best translation according to the formula 3:","ebest = arg max e M ∑ m=1 λmhm(e, f ) (3) where hm(e, f ) is a feature function, and λm is the weight of hm(e, f ) optimized by a discriminative training method on a held-out development data(Och, 2003). 5.2 The Workflow of Our System Our system works as follows:","When a hypothesis has covered all source-side words during the decoding procedure, the decoder first obtains tense sequence for such hypothesis and computes intra-tense feature Fs(see Section 5.3). At the same time, it recognizes the main tense of this hypothesis and associate the main tense of previous sentence to compute inter-tense feature Fm (see Section 5.3).","Next, the decoder uses such two additional feature values to re-score this hypothesis automatically and choose one hypothesis with highest score as the final translation.","After translating one sentence, the decoder caches its main tense and pass it to the next sentence. When one document has been processed, the decoder cleans this cache.","In order to successfully implement above work-flow, we should firstly design some related features, then resolve another key problem of determining tense (especially main tense) for SMT output. They are described in Section 5.3 and 5.4 respectively. 5.3 Two Additional Features Although the previous tense models show strong tendency to use the consistent tenses for one sentence or one document, other tense combinations also can be permitted. So we should use such models in a soft and dynamic way. We design two features: inter-tense feature and intra-tense feature. And the weight of each feature is tuned by the MERT script in Moses packages.","Given main tense sequence of one document t1, . . . , tm, the inter-tense feature Fm is calculated according to the following formula: Fm = m ∏ i=2 P (ti|ti−(n−1), . . . , t(i−1)) (4) The P (·) of formula 4 can be estimated by the formula 1. It is worth noting the first sentence of one 281 document often scares tense information since it corresponds to the title at most cases. To the first sentence, the P (·) value is set to 1","4 (4 tense types).","Given tense sequence of one sentence s1, . . . , se (e > 1), the intra-tense feature Fs is calculated as follows: Fs = e−1 √ √ √ √ e","∏ i=2 P (si|si−(n−1), . . . , s(i−1)) (5) Here the square-root operator is used to avoid punishing translations with long tense sequence. It is worth noting if the sentence only contains one tense, the P (·) value of formula 5 is also set to 1","4 .","Since the average length of intra-tense sequence is about 2.5, we mainly consider intra-tense bigram model and thus n equals to 2. 5 5.4 Determining Tense For SMT Output The current SMT systems often produce odd translations partly because of abnormal word ordering and uncompleted text etc. For these abnormal translated texts, the syntactic parser cannot work well in our initial experiments, so the previous method to parse main tense and tense sequence of regular texts cannot be applied here too.","Fortunately, the solely utilization of Stanford POS tagger for our SMT output is not bad although it has the same issues described in Och et al. (2002). The reason may be that phrase-based SMT contains short contexts that POS tagger can utilize while the syntax parser fails.","Once obtaining a completed hypothesis, the decoder will pass it to the Stanford POS tagger and according to tense verbs to get all tense sequence for this hypothesis. However, since the POS tagger can not return the information about level structures, the decoder cannot recognize the main tense from such tense sequence.","Liu et al. (2011) once used target-side verbs to label tense of source-side verbs. It is natural to consider whether Chinese verbs can provide similar clues in an opposite direction.","Since Chinese verbs have good correlation with English verbs (described in section 6.2), we obtain","5","In our experiment, the intra-tense bigram model can obtain the comparable performance to the trigram model. And the inter-tense trigram model can not exceed the bigram one. Figure 3: trees for parallel sentences main tense for SMT output according to such tense verb, which corresponds to the “VV”(Chinese POS labels are different to English ones, “VV” refers to Chinese verb) node in the top level of the source-side parse tree. Take Figure 3 as an example, the English node “(VBD announced)” is a tense verb which can tell the main tense for this English sentence. The Chinese verb “(VVœ )” in the top-level of the Chinese parse tree is just the corresponding part for this English verb.","So, before translating one sentence, the decoder first parses it and records the location of one Chinese “VV” node which located in the top-level, denotes this location as Sarea.","Once a completed hypothesis is generated, according to the phrase alignment information, the decoder can map Sarea into the English location Tarea and obtain the main tense according to the POS tags in Tarea .","If Tarea does not contain tense verb, such as the verb POS tags in the list of {VB, VBN, VBG}, which cannot tell tense type by themselves, our system permits to find main tense in the left/right 3 words neighbored to Tarea. And the proportion that the top-level verb of Chinese has a verb correspondence in English can reach to 83% in this way."]},{"title":"6 Experimentation6.1 Experimental Setting for SMT","paragraphs":["In our experiment, SRI language modeling toolk-it was used to train a 5-Gram general language model on the Xinhua portion of the Gigaword corpus.

For evaluation, the NIST 282 BLEU script (version 13) with the default setting is used to calculate the BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002), which measures case-insensitive matching of 4-grams.

Ours: 1)israel has imposed a main road to protest against the mortars attack . 2)leader of the palestinian liberation organization have also been allowed to go to the west bank towns , bethlehem in the past four years . this is the first time the israeli authorities allow palestinian leading figures attended the ceremony . Table 5: the joint impact of inter- tense and intra-tense models on SMT tence 1) and 2) are two neighbored sentences in one document. Both the reference and our output tend to use the same main tense type, but the former is in “past” tense and the latter is in “present” tense. The baseline cannot show such tendency. Although our main tense is different to the reference one, the consistent tenses in document level bring better translation results than the baseline. And the tenses in sentence level also show better consistency than the baseline."]},{"title":"7 Conclusion","paragraphs":["This paper explores document-level SMT from the tense perspective. In particular, we focus on how to build document-level and sentence-level tense models and how to integrate such models into a popular SMT system.","Compared with the inter-tense model which great-ly improves the performance of SMT, the intra-tense model needs to be further explored. The reasons are many folds, e.g. the failure to exclude quoted texts when modeling intra-tense, since tenses in quoted texts behave much diversely from normal texts. In the future work, we will focus on modeling intra-tense variation according to specific sentence types and using more features to improve it. 284 Figure 4: the comparison of the inter-tense distributions for reference, baseline and our proposed system"]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This research is supported by part by NUS FRC Grant R252-000-452-112, the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant No.90920004 and 61003155, the National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863 Program) under grant No.2012AA011102."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["P.F.
