This year’s CoNLL will be held in Boston, Massachusetts, USA on May 6 and 7, in conjunction with the HLT-NAACL 2004 Conference. This is the firsttime that CoNLL will be held in the USA.","The annual CoNLL meeting is intended to address all aspects of computational natural language learning. We have an exciting program this year, thanks to the many good submissions that we received. In all, 23 papers were submitted to the main session, of which 11 were selected by the program committee to be presented at the conference. They represent cutting-edge research on computational natural language learning.","In keeping with the unique tradition of CoNLL, we also have a shared task session this year, on semantic role labeling, which is a topic of growing interest in the field. The shared task was coordinated by Xavier Carreras and Lluı́s Màrquez. Common training and test data were made available to all participants, who had to build their learning system and test it on this task. We received enthusiastic responses from many research groups, and the shared task papers contain descriptions of the ten participating systems and their results.","This year’s CoNLL also features two invited presentations, one by Christopher Manning on what the future holds for computational language learning, and one by Martha Palmer on semantic role labeling, the topic of this year’s shared task.","Our program committee and additional reviewers have spent much time carefully reviewing the submitted papers, for which we are most grateful. We would also like to thank the HLT-NAACL 2004 conference organizers for helping us with the local organization. And a special thanks for the enthusiastic and capable work of Xavier Carreras and Lluı́sMàrquez in organizing and running the semantic role labeling shared task.","We wish you an enjoyable time attending CoNLL-2004!
