In addition to these regular papers, CoNLL99 has as a special theme the task of recovering Noun Phrases from free text. On this topic, we are pleased to have Lance Ranlshaw as our guest speaker..","In addition to the papers in the proceedings dealing with Noun Phrase identification, the meeting will include short reports by other groups. The CoNLL99 web site will contain updated information.","We would like to thank all the people who helped contribute to this workshop: our guest speaker, the programme committee, SiGNLL, LCG (funded by the TMR programme of the European Union), our EACL hosts at Bergen, and finally, and most importantly, all the authors for their contributions.
