Thompson","California Inatitnce of Technology Pasadena, California 91125 ABSTRACT","ASK, ~ ~imple Knowledgeable System, is a total system for the structuring, manipulation and communication of information. It is a simple system in the sense thaC its development concentrated on clean engineering solutions to what could be done now with good response times. The user interface is a limited dialect of English. In contrast to expert systems, in which experts build the knowledge base and users make use of this expert knowledge, ASK is aimed at the user who wishes to create, test, modify, extend and make use of his own knowledge base. It is a system for a research team, a management or military staff, or a business office.","This paper is designed to give you a feel for the general performance of the ASK System and overview of its operational capabilities. To Chin end, the movie you see will continue throughout the talk. Indeed, the talk itself is a commentary on this background movie. The movie is bona fide and in real time, it is of the ASK System in action. (Many of the illustrations from the movie are reproduced in the written paper.) I. ASK AS A DATABASE SYSTEM A. Examples of ASK English","To introduce you to ASK, we will start out with a few examples of queries of a simple data base concerning ships. The uninitiated user may wish simply to ask:",">How many ships are there?","7",">What is known about ships?","some are in the following classes: Navy freighter old tanker","all have the following attributes: destination home port","some have the following attributes: cargo","all have the following number attributes: age 17 some have the following number attributes:","speed","length","beam >List the destinations and home port of each ship, ship destination home port Ubu New York Naples","Tokyo --- Morn 0slo Tokyo Kittyhawk Naples Boston","Boston --","London --- Alamo London London","New York --- North Scar London New York gimitz London Norfolk Saratoga unknown Norfolk >What cities are the home ports of ships whose destination is London? Boston London New York Norfolk >Are there ships that do not have a cargo? yes >What is the number of New York ships? There are 2 answers: (1) New York (destination) ships 2 (2) New York (home port) ships 1 >How many ships are there with lnegth greater than 600 feet? Spelling correction: \"lnegth\" to \"length\" 4 >What ships that carry wheat go to London or Oslo?","ships that carry wheat London Maru Oslo Alamo >Does the Maru carry wheat and go co London? yes S. The ASK Data Structures","Although in the terminology of data base theory, ASK can be considered as an \"entity-relation\" system, ASK retains its information in records which are interlinked in a semantic net. One reason we refer to ALE as simple is because ic uses only a few kinds of nodes in its semantic net, namely: o"]},{"title":"~lasses o ~bjects","paragraphs":["o Attributes o Relations and the ctbvious corresponding arcs.

Extendin K and Hodifyin~ the Dat~ I. Definitions","To make such a system more knowledgeable, one needs to be able co add definitions that embody interrelationships among the basic classes, objects, attributes and relations of the data. The simplest form of definition is synonym: >definition:tub:old ship Defined.","Although this form of definition allows one to introduce abbreviations and many forms of jargon, more extensive forms of definition are desirable. Here are three illustrations using the same \"ship\" file as above. In the third definition, note the use of quotes to create local '~ariables\". >definition:area:length * beam Defined >List the length, beam and area of each tub. tub length beam area","foot foot foot**2 Ubu 231.667 48 11120.016 Alamo 564.5 84 47418. >definition:meter:39.37 * (foot / 12) Defined. >beam of the Alamo squared in square meters? 655.526472343 square meters >definition:longest \"ship\":\"ship\" whose length is the maximum length of \"ship\"s Defined. >What is the length in meters of the longest ship whose home port is Naples? 121.920243840 meters","The notion of what is long may be quite different in another context, say in the context of bibliography of artificial intelligence literature. >definition:long:paper whose number of pages exceeds 49 Defined. >definition:long:book whose number of pages exceeds 800 Defined. >What AI bibliography items are long?

Billy Smith's cousins father mother Baby Boyd Robert Boyd Jill Boy 2. Verbs","Most verbs embody knowledge specific to the application in which they are used, the exceptions being the copula verbs. Therefore the only verbs initially known to the ASK System are \"to be\" and \"to have\". The user can add new verbs by paraphrase. >verb:ships \"go\" to New York:destination of ships is New York Defined. >verb:ships \"carry\" coal from London to Boston:ships have coal as cargo, have London as home port and go to Boston Defined. >Each old ship carries what cargo to each port? old ship port cargo Ubu New York oil","Tokyo oil Alamo London wheat","coal 18 >What is carried by the Alamo? wheat coal >Wheat is carried to London from what ports? New York >What cities does the Alamo carry wheat to? London 3. Anaohora: Pronouns and Ellinses","In practical systems for experts, abbreviated forms of addressing the computer are common. Thus the ability to handle pronominal and elliptical constructions are of considerable importance. Although there has been progress in the last few years in the linguistic understanding of these constructions, many difficulties remain. However, building on the work that ham been accomplished, many of these constructions can be handled by the ASK System. In order to avoid misleading the user when the computational algorithm does not make the correct interpretation, echo is used to inform the user of the interpretation that has been taken. >Is there a ship whose destination is unknown? yes >What is it? What is it [ship whose destination is ..knov.] ? Saratoga >Is its cargo wheat or coal?

Extension of COAR ~o Multiple Object Types","So far we have illustrated ASK capabilities using only two types of objects: individuals, e.g., \"John Jones\", \"Maru\" numbers, e.g., \"34.6 feet\", \"length of Maru\", \"number of ships\". ASK has been designed, however, to facilitate many kinds of objects. This is a capability orthogonal to the simple COAR structure in that for any types of objects there may be corresponding classes, attributes and relations. B. An Examvle: Texts and T~xt Fi~es","We will illustrate this multiple object type capability with the additional object type: text. Once this new object type was added (together with procedures to manipulate texts, i.e., a \"word processor\") then text classes, individual/text and text/individual attributes and relations were immediately available. It was a small task to add an electronic mail system to ASK; all that was required was an addition to the authorization procedure that assigned to each newly authorized person a new text class as his/her mail box. >Create the text/text relation:comment The text/text relation co-~.ent has been added. >Create a file: budget correspondence The text class budget correspondence has been added. >File the Budget Proposal in budget correspondence. Budget Proposal has been added to the text class budget correspondence. >Who have I received mail from? John Smith Peter Jackson 20 >Display my mail from John Smith. Fred, Your Budget Proposal looks good to me. Suggest you submit it as is.","John >File it in my budget correspondence file. File it [my mail from John Smith] in my budget correspondence file. my mail from John Smith has been added co the text class budget correspondence. >amm-va it from my mail box. Bemove ic [my mail from John Smith] from my mail box. my mail from John Smith has been removed from your mail. >Create a budget correspondence named Budget Plans Please enter text: Staff level budget meeting on Wed. at 3 in Tom's office. Please send me your comments before the meeting; file them as \"commenCe on Budget Plane\".\\ Budget Plane has been added Co the text class budget correspondence. >Mail Budget Plans to each section manager. Budget plane has been sent to each section manager. >Display the commence on Budget Plans by each section manager. Displaying commence on Budget Plans by each section manager: John Dobbs: D(isplay), S(kip), or Q(uit): ...o. C. Addinz New Obiect Ty~es","Although the ASK System has been designed to allow the addition of new object types, this can be done only by an application programmer. The major obstacle is the necessity to provide a procedure to initialize instances of the new object type and procedures that carry out their intrinsic manipulation. However, we expect the addition of new object types to be a common occurrence in the applications of the ASK System. In any potential applicaion areas, using groups have accumulations of data already structured in specific ways and families of procedures that they have developed to manipulate these structures. In ASK, they can identify these data structures as a new object type, design simple syucax for them to invoke their procedures, and thus embed their familar objects and manipulations within the ASK English dialect and within the same context as other associated aspects of their tasks. The class, attributed and relation constructions become immediately available. 21 Ill. MORE GENERAL ASPECTS OF THE ASK SYSTEM A. Resvonse Times","The movie, which accompanied the oral presentation of this paper, demonstrated that the response rime, i.e., the time between completion of the typing of the input by the user Co the appearance of the response on the terminal, is very good. But the data bases used in the illustrations have been small, Coy data bases. The following table gives average response times for a few cases using larger data bases. The query used for this illustration is: >What arm the destinations of tankers?","The respouse time is rather insenstitive to the Coral number of individuals, classes, attributes and relations in the data base, depending primarily on the size of the relation (destination) and its argument (Cankers). Suppose that there are m tankers in the data base and that n individuals have destinations, i.e., the size of the destination relation is n. The table gives time in seconds. no. of tankers"]},{"title":"n\\m I 1 10 100 1000 2500 I0 I 2 2 2 3 4","paragraphs":["no. of 100 I 2 2 2 3 6 dastin- 1000 I 3 3 a 7 20 scions 2500 I 5 6 9 22 38","Besponee Time in Seconds for: >What are the destinations of tankers?","B. The Cqncevt of A Use ~ Context an_...dd the Basing Ooeration","In the terminology of ASK, a user \"Context\" is a knowledge base together with the vocabulary and definitions that S o with it. A given user will usually have several Contexts for various purposes, some of which may be the small \"Ships\" Context, a (truncated) bibliography of Artificial Intelligence literature and an administrative Context concerning budget matters.","When one initiates a session with the ASK System, one is initially in the Command Context: >Welcome to ASK Please identify yourself. >Fred >Pass word: You have mail. Fred is in COMMAND, proceed. At this point, you can list the Directory of Contexts available to you, create or delete Contexts, authorize others to use Contexts which you have created, and enter any of the Contexts in >Directory context creator enter b~s~ BASE MASTER no yes Ships Fred yes yes AI Bibliography Fred yes yes Family Fred yes yes Management Matters Fred yes yes >enter Management Matters You are in Management Matters, proceed. >Who have I received mail from? Peter Jackson John Dobbs","A new Context is created by basing it on an already existing one. Consider a user who has been authorized for basing on the AI Bibliography Context illustrated above and who wants to build a wider bibliography Context (adding new information --vocabulary, data and definitions), however, without disturbing the old one. To do so, all s/he needs to do is select a new name, say CS Bibliography, and type: >exit You are in COMMAND, proceed. >Base CS Bibliography on AI Bibliography The new context CS Bibliography has been created based on AI Bibliography","The result of this basing action is a new Context. Upon entering this new Context: >Enter CS Bibliography You are in CS Bibliography, proceed. one can make additions: >individuals :An Introduction to Database Systems, C. J. Date The following individuals have been added: An Introduction to Database Systems C. J. Date >The author of An Introduction to Database Systems is C. J. Date. C. J. Date has been added as author of An Introduction to Database Systems. >Keyword of An Introduction to Database Systems is database. database has been added as keyword of An Introduction to Database Systems. >Who wrote what about databases? author D. L. Waltz Natural Language Access to a Large Data Base C. J. Date An Introduction to Database Systems","These additions to the CS Bibliography would not, of course, effect She AI Bibliography Context. However, additions and modifications that are subsequently made in the AI Bibliography Context would automatically be reflected in the CS Bibliography. >exit You are in COMMAND, proceed. >Enter AI Bibliography You are in AI Bibliography, proceed. >individual: Experience with ROBOT, L. Harris The following individuals have been added: Experience with ROBOT L. Harris >The author of Experience with ROBOT is L. Harris. L.

Waltz Natural Language Access to a Large Data Base C. J. Date An Introduction to Database Systems L. Harris Experience with ROBOT","Several Contexts can be based on a given one, and one Context can be based on several, thus a hierarchical structure of Contexts can be realized. All Contexts are directly or indirectly based upon the BASE Context, which contains the function words and grammar of the ASK dialect of English, the mathematical and statistical capabilities, and the word processor. C. T~anspo~tabilitv","It is easy and fast to apply ASK to a new domain, given that a data base for this new domain is available in machine readable form. The vehicle is the ASK dialogue-driven Bulk Data Input capability, which can be called upon to build an existing database into one's Context. The result not only integrates this new data with that already in the Context and under the ASK dialect of English, but in many circumstances will make the use of this data more responsive to users\" needs.","The Bulk Data Input Dialogue prompts the user for necessary information to (i) establish the physical structure of the data base to be included, (2) add necessary classes and attributes as needed for the new data entries. The user also indicates, using English constructions, the informational relationships among the fields in the physical records of the database file that s/he wishes carried over to the ASK Context. IV. DIALOGUES IN ASK","Some have raised the question whether natural language is always the most desirable medium for a user to communicate with the computer. Expert systems, for example, have tended to use computer guided dialogues. One simple form such a dialogue 22 might take is illustrated by the followins in which a new entry is added to the AI Bibliography: >New bibliography item >Add to what bibliography? AI Bibliography >Title: Natural Language Processing >Author: Harry Tennant >Keyword: natural language >Keyword: syntax processing >Keyword: speech acts >Keyword: Natural Language Processing has been added to AI Bibliography. >Title: The \"new bibliography item\" dialogue i8 completed. >What AI Bibliography items were written by Harry Tennant? Experience with the Evaluation of Natural Language Question Answerers Natural Language Processing","Other alternative media for user/system communication are menu boards, selection arrays and query by example. Many other cryptic ways to communicate user needs to a knowledgeable system can be thought of; often the most useful means will be highly specific to the particular application. For example, in positioning cargo in the hold of a ship, one would like to be able to display the particular cargo space, showing its current cargo, and call for and move into place other items that are to be included.","In the past, enabling the system to respond more intelligently to the user's needs required the provision of elaborate programs since the user's tasks may be quite involved, with complex decision structures. The introduction of terse, effective communication has incurred lout delays and thus the changing needs of a user had little chance of being met. In the ASK System, the users themselves can provide this knowledge. They can instruct the system on how to elicit the necessary information and how to complete the required task. This ASK capability is quite facile, opening the way for its ubiquitous use in extending the knowledgeable responsiveness of the computer to user's immediate needs. ASK includes two system-guided dialogues, similar to the Bulk Data Input dialogue by which users can instruct the System on how to be more responsive to their needs. A. Forms Desi~nin2 Dialogue","The Form is an efficient means of communication with which we are all familiar. A number of computer systems include a Forms package. For most of these, however, filling in a Form results only in a document; the Form does not constitute a medium for interacting with the knowledge base or controllin K the actions of the system. The ASK Forms capability enlarges the roles and ways in which Forms can be used as a medium for user interaction. As the user fills in the fields of a Form, the System can make use of the information being supplied to (1) check its consistency with the data already in the knowledge base and, if necessary, respond with a diagnostic, (2) fill in other fields with data developed from the knowledge base, (3) extend the knowledge base, adding to the vocabulary and adding or changing the data itself, (4) file the completed form in prescribed files or in those indicated by the user and also mail it to a specified distribution list through the electronic mail subsystem. Since the Form processing can check consistency and modify the knowledge base, Forms can be used to facilitate data input. Since Form processing can fill fields in the Form, the forms capability includes the functions of a report generator. Letters and memos can be written as special cases of Form filling, automatically adding dates, addresses, etc. and filing and dispatching the result.","It must be easy and natural to add new Forms, if they are to be a convenient tool. That is the function of the Forms Designing Dialogue. Much like the Bulk Data Input Dialogue, the Forms Designing Dialogue holds a dialogue with the the user through which s/he can specify the fields of the Form itself and the processing of the above kinds to be automatically accomplished at the time the Form is filled in. Here is a simple example of a from that was designed using the Forms Designing Dialogue. >What is the bona port and co~ander of each old ship?

Note that the home port of the Alamo is London and that it does not have a commander, further that John Smith is not known to the System. >Fill shipping (For the purposes of the published paper, in contrast to the film shown at the presentation of the paper, only the initial and final copies of the form are given, under~ines indicate fields filled in by the \"user\", the other fields automatically being filled by the System.)

Shipping List for Alamo B. DialoKue Desi~nin~ Dialogue","In the day-by-day use of an interactive system, users are very often involved in repetitive tasks. They could be relieved of much of the drudgery of such tasks if the system were more knowledgeable. Such a knowledgeable system, as it goes about a task for the user, may need additional information from the user. What information it needs aCa particular point may depend on earlier user inputs and the current state of the database. natural language programming capabiltty. We hasten to add that it is not a general purpose program environment. It is for \"ultra-high\" level programming, gaining its programming efficiency through the assumption of an extensive vocabulary and knowledge base on which it can draw. The illustrative dialogue above, which adds'a new item to a bibliography, is an example of a simple dialogue designed using DDD. V. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS AND CURRENT STATUS","The three System guided dialogues, Bulk Data Input, Dialogue Designing Dialogue and Forms Designing Dialogue, are from the doctoral dissertation of Tai-Ping Ho. The aspects of ASK concerning basing one Context on another are from the doctoral dissertation of Kwan8-I Yu. The methods for handling anaphora, fragments and correction of inputs are from the doctoral dissertation of David Trawick.","ASK is implemented on the Hewlett Packard HP9836 desktop computer. To handle Contexts of reasonable size, one needs a bard disk. An HP9836 with an HP9725 disk was used in the illustrations in this paper. Our work is supported by the Hewlett Packard Corporation, Desktop Computer Division.","The user must provide the system with knowledge of a particular cask; more precisely s/he must program this knowledge into the system. The result of this programming will be a system guided dialogue which the user can subsequently initiate and which will then elicit the necessary inputs. Using these inputs in conjunction with the knowledge already available, particularly the data base, the system completes the task. It is this system-guided dialogue chat the user needs to be able to design.","In the ASK System, there is a special dialogue which can be used co design system guided dialogues Co accomplish particular casks. We call this the Dialogue Designing Dialogue (DDD). Using DDD, the user becomes a computer-aided designer. Since DDD, in conducting its dialogue with the user, only requires simple responses or responses phrased in ASK English, the user need have little programming skill or experience. Using DDD, the user alone can replace a tedious, repetitive cask with an efficient system guided dialogue, all in a natural language environment. The ASK Dialogue Designing Dialogue constitutes a high level, 24"]}]}
