Joshi","Department of Computer and Information Science","R. 258 Moore School University of Pennsylvanla Philadelphia, PA 19104","In By co~ments,l will try to summarize briefly the six papers in thls session, pointing out sow key aspects of each contrtbutlon, listing some common themes,and raising some questions, not for the purpose of criticizing one or another contribution, but rather for the purpose of prodding the authors to discuss these questions in their presentations.","The six papers in the session are(alphabetically)","I. [GJN] J.M. flnsparg, A robust and portable natural language data base interface.","2. [GHF] R. Crishman, L. Rirschaan, and C.Friedmtn, Isolating domain dependencies in natural language interfaces.","3. [GRO] B.J. Orosz, Team: A transportable natural language interface system.","4. [TB] M. Templetoo and J. Burger, Problems in natural language interfaces to DBMS:a retrospective view of the EUFID system.","5; [TT] B.H. Thompson and F.B. Thompson, [ncroduclng ASK, a simple knowledgeable system.","6. [GT] G. Guide and C. Tasso, IR-NLI: an expert natural language interface to online data bases. I. BRIEF SUMMARIES","[CIN]:A robust ~ data base interface has been described. The system consists of two parts:a natural Language processor for building a formal representation and an application program for building a query in an augmented relational algebra. Portability is achieved by providing (i) definitions of new concepts for the NL processor and (il) the connection between the relations in the data base and ~ processor concepts.","[GHF]:A robust portable NL interface is daecribad, the portability evaluced with respect to two application domains. The Inlttal processing is based on the Linguistic String Parser. The domain dependent information is characterized by domain information scheaa which specify the correspondences between information structures in the texts and the various internal representations. Hodularity of design is emphasized for achieving portability and managing complexity.","[GRO]:The major them is the construction of transportable NL interfaces. A unique feature of the TEA}{ system is the interactive facllty for acquiring information for adapting gL interfaces to data bases for which they were not handtailored. The DIALOGIC system constructs a logical form for the query and the data base access system translates the logical form Into a data base query. Transportability is achieved by factoring the domain dependant and domain independent information. Soma acquisitional and control stracegles are also discussed.","[TB]: This is a retrospective view of the SUFID system, traclng its develpoment from the initlal design specifications, tncludln g various stages of intermediate implementations and exparlence with different applications, and finally,endlng with a list of problems to be solved. TB conclude that robust ~ systems do not exist and provide some guidelines for the design of such systems.","[TT]:The NL interface(ASK) is meant for a user who wants to create, test change, augment, and, of course, use her/his knowledge base. The user interface is a limited subset of English. Fast response time is a major goal. Transportability is achieved via a dialogue in ASK which drives the Bulk Data Input Capability. Dialogues In ASK can also he used to design dialogues. A unique feature of the system is that It has been already implemented on a desktr computer,RP 9846.","[GT]:An ~ interface, IR-NLI, is described, which is meant for nonprofessional users for accessing on-Line data bases. The basic components of the system are described in general terms. An illustrative exampte is presented in which , in addition to the user-system dialogue, the Internal representaclons and the search sCrategles are reported in the Euronet DIANE EUROLANGUAGE. Several future directions are suggesced,includlng the system taking more InlCiaCive and providing Justification of Its mode of operaclon. If. SOME QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION","[. All authors have dealt with the issue of domain independence, an important aspect of portability and robustness. The main strategy for achieving this behavtour is to factor the system into two parts, one based on domain independent knowledge and the ocher on the domain dependent knowledge. At least two systems[GRO and I'T] talk about Interactively acquiring the [nformaCion needed for adaptation. GRO and TT should discuss the similarities and differences in their approaches to acquisition.","2. GIN uses the preference information in the data base connection part of his system to induce coercions(e.g., \"a doctor within 200 miles\" meaning \"a ship wlth a doctor on it within 200 miles). GRO in TEAM achieves the ~ame effect by inference rules. ~t is noc clear Just what the difference is between GRO's approach and GEN\"s approach, i.e., between inducing coercions and making the inferences. GRO nad GiN should discuss the realtive merits of their approaches.","3. The domain information schema of GHF specify the correspondence between information structures as chef appear in the text and the various internal representaclons of information in the system. The system described by GHF is the only one in this session which derives ice domain dependent knowledge from the texts Instead of domain expects. GHJ should discuss how successful ~he 7 are with thls approach. Also perhaps the 7 should discuss how their repreeenCatlons compare with those In TEAM[GROI.","4. T~ have reviewed the hlecory of EUFZD and ended up on a negative note. They feel robust systems do not really exlsC yet. Since a[l the other authors have described \"robust\" systems, perhaps TB should discuss their conclusions in some de,all and comment on ChL claims of these authors.","5. TT have empahsized the speed of response as a major feature of their system. What are the trade-oils between speed and the modularity of the design ? TT should comment on this aspect as wall as ocher related aspects due co their concern for bringing up the system on a desktop computer.","6. Most of the issues discussed by GT in the first four sections of their paper pertain co making formal query language(FL)iucerfaces also portable. ~n fact, many of the issues about portability chat the other authors have addressed co are also related co FL interfaces. It would be very useful if soma(or all) of the authors discuss some specific problems about portability chat are special to NL interfaces in contrast to PL interfaces.","Does the need for having flexible and 9ortable interfaces for data bases necessarily force us towards NL interfaces ? Ne hope so ! Perhaps, some of the authors will comment on Chls issue. Their specific experience with chelr own systems would be very relevant here.","7. A quesClon chaC is worth discussing by all the authors is whether portability and robustness can be helped if the design of the data base itself is decemined by the consideration chat an NL Interface will be hooked to IC ?"]}]}
