These include basic parsing techniques, semantic interpretation and the representation of sentence meaning, as well as knowledge representation and techniques for understanding natural language in context. In particular, the topics to be addressed in detail will include augmented transition networks (ATNs), augmented context-free grammars, the representation of lexical meaning, especially looking at case-grammar based representations, and the interpretation of pronouns and ellipsis. In addition, there will be an overview of knowledge representation, including semantic networks, frame-based systems, and logic, and the use of general world knowledge in language understanding, including scripts and plans.","Given the large range of issues and techniques, an emphasis will be placed on those aspects relevant to existing practical natural language systems, such as interfaces to database systems. The remaining issues will be more quickly surveyed to give the attendee an idea of what techniques will become important in the next generation of natural language systems. The lecture notes will include an extensive bibliography of work in each area. Machine-Readable Dictionaries: A Computational Linguistics Perspective Branimir Boguraev,"]},{"title":"Cambridge University","paragraphs":["and Beth Levin,"]},{"title":"Northwestern University","paragraphs":["The lexical information contained explicitly and implicitly in machine-readable dictionaries (MRDs) can support a wide range of activities in computational linguistics, both of theoretical in-terest and of practical importance. This tutorial falls into two parts. The first part will focus on some characteristics of raw lexical data in electronic sources, which make MRDs particularly relevant to natural language processing applications. The second part will discuss how theoretical linguistic research into the lexicon can enhance the contribution of MRDs to applied computational linguistics.","The first half will discuss issues concerning the placement of rich lexical resources on-line; raise questions related to the suitability, and ultimately the utility, of MRDs for automatic natural language processing; outline a methodology aimed at extracting maximally usable subsets of the dictionary with minimal introduction of errors; and present ways in which specific use can be made of the lexical data for the construction of practical language processing systems with substantial coverage.","The second half of the tutorial will review current theoretical linguistic research on the lexicon, emphasizing proposals concerning the nature of lexical representation and lexical organization. This overview will provide the context for an examination of how the results of this research can be brought to bear on the problem of extracting syntactic and semantic information encoded in dictionary entries, but not overtly signaled to the dictionary user. Spoken Language Systems: Past, Present, and Future Salim Roucos,"]},{"title":"BBN Laboratories, Inc.","paragraphs":["This tutorial will present the issues in develop-ing spoken language systems for natural speech communication between a person and a machine. In particular, the performance of complex tasks using large vocabularies and unrestricted sentence structures will be examined. The first Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) Speech Understanding Research project during the seventies will be reviewed, and then the current state-of-the-art in continuous speech recognition and natural language processing will be described. Finally, the types of spoken language systems' capabilities expected to be developed during the next two to three years will be presented.","The technical issues that will be covered include acoustic-phonetic modeling, syntax, semantics, plan recognition and discourse, and the issues for integrating these knowledge sources for speech understanding. In addition, computational requirements for real-time understanding, and performance evaluation methodology will be described. Some of the human factors of speech understanding in the context of performing interactive tasks using an integrated interface will also be discussed. viii The Technology of Natural Language Interfaces Carole D. Hafner,"]},{"title":"Northeastern University","paragraphs":["This tutorial will describe the development of natural language processing from a research to-pic into a commercial technology. This will include a description of some key research projects of the 1970's and early 1980's which developed methods for building natural language query interfaces, initially restricted to just one database, and later made \"transportable\" to many different applications. The further development of this technology into commercial software products will be discussed and illustrated by a survey of several current products, including both microcomputer NL systems and those offered on higher-performance machines. The qualities a user should look for in a NL interface will be considered, both in terms of linguistic capabilities and general ease of use. Finally, some of the remaining \"hard problems\" that current technology has not yet solved in a satisfactory way will be discussed. The Role of Logic in Representing Meaning and Knowledge Robert C. Moore,"]},{"title":"SRI International","paragraphs":["This tutorial will survey the use of logic to represent the meaning of utterances and the extra-linguistic knowledge needed to produce and interpret utterances in natural-language processing systems. Problems to be discussed in meaning representation include quantification, propositional attitudes, comparatives, mass terms and plurals, tense and aspect, and event sentences and adverbials. Logic-based methods (unifica-tion) for systematic specification of the correspondence between syntax and semantics in natural language processing systems will also be touched on. In the discussion of the representation of extra-linguistic knowledge, special atten-tion will be devoted to the role played by knowledge of speakers' and hearers' mental states (particularly their knowledge and beliefs) in the generation and interpretation of utterances and logical formalisms for representing and reasoning about knowledge of those states. Machine Translation Sergei Nirenburg,"]},{"title":"Carnegie Mellon University","paragraphs":["The central problems faced by a Machine Translation (MT) research project are 1) the design and implementation of automatic natural language analyzers and generators that manipulate morphological, syntactic, semantic and pragmatic knowledge; and 2) the design, acquisition and maintenance of dictionaries and grammars. Since a short-term goal (or even medium term goal) of building a system that performs fully automated machine translation of unconstrained text is not feasible, an MT project must carefully constrain its objectives.","This tutorial will describe the knowledge and processing requirements for an MT system. It will present and analyze the set of design choices for MT projects including distinguishing features such as long-term/short-term, academic/commercial, fully/partially automated, direct/ transfer/interlingua, pre-/post-/interactive editrag. The knowledge acquisition needs of an MT system, with an emphasis on interactive knowledge acquisition tools that facilitate the task of compiling the various dictionaries for an MT system will be discussed. In addition, expectations, possibilities and prospects for immediate application of machine translation technology will be considered. Finally, a brief survey of MT research and development work around the world will be presented. ix"]},{"title":"TABLE OF CONTENTS","paragraphs":["SESSION 1: SYSTEMS","The Multimedia Articulation of Answers in a Natural Language Database Query System Susan E.
