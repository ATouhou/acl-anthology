Introduction","paragraphs":["1  As the importance of lexical semantic research has grown with the need to represent human knowledge, various lexically-based information networks have been proposed. This includes the comprehensive work on differentiating word senses and sense relations in WordNet [Miller et al. 1990], the ontological hierarchy in SUMO [Niles and Pease 2003], and the more linguistically-motivated model of FrameNet [Baker et al. 2003].

FrameNet, on the other hand, is based on the theory of Frame Semantics [Fillmore and Atkins 1992] and attempts to define meaning within a set of shared knowledge or background information, that is, a frame. However, as pointed out by Liu and Wu [2003], if meaning is anchored in the notion of a ‘frame’, then we need independent motivations for postulating different frames. What seems to be lacking in the current framework is a cognitive linguistic explanation as to how individual ‘frames’ are distinguished and interrelated. To answer this question, we will show that within a frame, a more elaborate classification system is needed to account for the variety of verb behaviors. The notion of a ‘subframe’ is introduced and utilized to capture the syntactic-semantic interdependencies observed in corpus data2","."]},{"title":"2. Defining the Conversation Frame","paragraphs":["Compared with the other communication frames3",", the conversation frame is unique in that it profiles the property of reciprocality or two-way communication. Mandarin verbs in the conversation frame encode reciprocal communicative events, where participants are involved as Interlocutors, such as tan 談 ‘talk’, taolun 討論 ‘discuss’, xietiao 協調 ‘negotiate’, chaojia 吵架 ‘quarrel’, xianliao 閒聊 ‘chat’, etc4",". These conversation events highlight a particular subpart of the communication schema with its core being frame elements, as proposed in Liu and Wu’s conceptual schema for the conversation frame [2003]. We can further characterize the conversation frame as follows:  (1) The conversation frame: a) Cognitive Schema (grayed and bolded area): b) Domain: communication;","c) Definition: a two-way communicative process between Interlocutors (Intl1, Intl2, or Intls) via a certain Medium, on a given Topic; d) Semantic profile: reciprocality between Interlocuters; e) Core frame elements (FEs): Intl1/Intl2 or Intls, Medium, Topic;  2 A preliminary model of the Mandarin VerbNet (http://140.114.75.18/verbnet/webform1.aspx/) has been constructed by researchers from National Chiao Tung University and National Tsing Hua University. 3 For details, please see [Liu et al. 2004], where the communication domain is divided into 14 frames and provides conceptual motivations for the cognitive bases of individual frames. 4 The lemmas discussed in this paper are high-frequency words of the conversation frame used in Taiwan.

However, given the diverse range of lemmas included in the frame, there is a fundamental question to be answered: within the conversation frame, are there semantic subtypes that need to be captured? This paper aims to show that corpus-based analyses of verb behavior render clear evidence for further distinguishing ‘subframes’5","."]},{"title":"3. Motivations for Distinguishing Subframes","paragraphs":["As mentioned above, verbs of conversation share a set of core frame elements: Interlocutor 1, Interlocutor 2 (or combined as Interlocutors), Topic, and Medium. However, a wide range of verbs are found in the conversation frame, such as tan/tanlun 談/談論 ‘converse, talk’, 討論/ 商量 ‘discuss’, xietiao/goutong 協調/溝通 ‘negotiate’, chao/chaojia 吵/吵架 ‘quarrel’, and lia/liaotian 聊/聊天 ‘chat’. One inevitably wonders how these verbs differ from each other. Although sharing the same basic pattern, these lemmas differ obviously in terms of manner, register, and purpose. Consider (2):   5 Although Fillmore et al. [2005] put the label ‘subframe’ under the description of frames in the new version of FrameNet (http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/~framenet), they did not explicitly discuss how to distinguish subframes, that is, what the linguistic motivations for distinguishing and defining subframes are.

We would like to know: what exactly are the distinctions in their lexical meanings and what grammatical correlations can be found to such lexical semantic distinctions? In the following, a detailed discussion regarding the coding of their core frame elements (FEs) and the various collocational associations will be given to capture the grammatical motivations for distinguishing subframes."]},{"title":"3.1 Realization and Profiling of Core Frame Elements","paragraphs":["As mentioned before, a frame is distinguished according to syntactically expressed core frame elements (FEs). Subgroups of a frame may be further distinguished based on frequent foregrounding or backgrounding of certain frame elements observed in the corpus data. Among the core frame elements of the conversation frame, Intl1/Intl2, Intls, Medium, and Topic, the first two are commonly shared by all conversation verbs, but Medium is most frequently found with the ‘converse’ verbs, tan/tanlun 談/談論 (4.3%) but not common with other verbs (less than 1.2%): ","(3) 大家[Interlocutors]面對面[Medium_Means]談[Conversation-Converse],可直接 爭取訂單。 ","Although Topic is a default FE for conversation events, only the ‘discuss’ verbs occur most frequently with a topic (73%) and allow a Topic to be preposed, as in (4):  (4) 宣傳的事[Topic]你們[Interlocutors]再討論[Conversation-Discuss]。 ","In addition, Topic tends to be absent in a chatting event. In the Sinica Corpus, Topic is simply not found with the verbs liaotian 聊天 and xianliao 閒聊 ‘chat’ (0%). The suppression of Topic indicates that Topic may not be important in ‘chat’ events and, thus, tends to be backgrounded:  (5) 旅行回來...毛空去看望他,兩人[Interlocutors]就閒聊[Conversation-Chat]起來。     From Frame to Subframe: 435 Collocational Asymmetry in Mandarin Verbs of Conversation ","Another interesting observation regarding the coding of Topic is that it may overlap with the marking of Cause; the ‘quarrel’ verbs tend to take a Topic-Cause as one important role:  (6) 他們 為/因為 錢/感情[Topic_Cause]吵架[Conversation-Quarrel]。 ","The overt marking of Topic-Cause with the marker wei/yinwei ‘because of’ (6% with chaojia/zhenglun 吵架/爭論) seems to indicate that the ‘quarrel’ events, coding a highly marked manner of communication, require an explanation for their occurrence. The overt Cause in the above examples also fulfills the role of Topic, since what is being argued about has to do with the cause of the argument.","Finally, a unique pattern is observed regarding the coding of interlocutors: with the ‘negotiate’ verbs, xietiao/goutong 協調/溝通, there may be a third participant, Interlocutor 3, since a negotiating event is often conducted between Interlocutor 2 and Interlocutor 3 with a Mediator, Interlocutor 1. Syntactically, Intl2 and Intl3 may be foregrounded as the Direct Object, as exemplified below: ","(7) 中東戰爭爆發,省府[Interlocutor_1]已協調[Conversation-Negotiate]台汽 [Interlocutor_2]和台鐵[Interlocutor_3],完成預期中東供油減少時的各項 因應措施。  The additional participant, Interlocutor 3, is only found in the ‘negotiate’ events (3.1%) but completely absent with other verbs. Although most verbs only take the Topic as the direct object, the ‘negotiate’ verbs may encode Interlocutor 2 (or with Interlocutor 3) as the direct object without adding the associative marker han/yu/gen 和 / 與 / 跟 ‘and’, as further exemplified below:  (8) a. [執行秘書]Intl1 已協調 [相關單位]Intl2 , b. 由[他] Intl1 負責溝通 [校方] Intl2。 ","This observation suggests that with the ‘negotiate’ verbs, the co-participant, i.e., Interlocutor2 (or/and Interlocutor 3) may be viewed as the undergoer or the affected target of the event, which is a unique pattern that sets the ‘negotiate’ verbs apart from other conversation verbs.","The distribution of core frame elements across different conversation verb types is summarized in the following table:   436 Mei-Chun Liu and Chun Edison Chang  (9) Distribution of Core Frame Elements among Conversation Verbs:","FEs Verbs Intls Intl1/Intl2 Intl3 Intl2/Int l3 as DO Topic Topic as Cause Medium Converse 談/談論","40% (441/1103)","14 % (156/1103)","0% (0/1103)","0% (0/1103)","17.3% (191/1103)","0% (0/1103)","4.3% (47/1103) Discuss 討論/商量","62% (129/208) 29% (60/208) 0% (0/208) 0% (0/208)","73% (152/208) 0% (0/208) 0% (0/208) Negotiate 協調/溝通 15 % (74/485) 29.5% (143/485) 3.1% (15/485)","7% (33/485) 16.7% (81/485) 0% (0/485) 0.9% (4/485) Quarrel 吵架/爭論","48% (101/211) 11.4% (24/211) 0% (0/211) 0% (0/211) 10.4% (22/211)","6% (13/211) 0% (0/211)","Chat 聊天/閒聊 38% (66/174) 46 % (81/174) 0% (0/174) 0% (0/174) 0% (0/174) 0% (0/174) 1.1% (2/174)","It is clear from the table that each verb type displays a distinct pattern in coding the core frame elements through either the foregrounding or backgrounding of certain participant roles."]},{"title":"3.2 Lexical Collocations and Grammatical Functions","paragraphs":["Besides the realization of core frame elements, conversation verbs also differ in terms of lexical collocation and grammatical function. Looking closely at their collocational associations in the Sinica Corpus, we found that there are asymmetrical distributions in four respects: 1) V+V pattern: some verbs may occur with a preceding light verb, such as jinxing 進行 ‘proceed’ or dacheng 達成 ‘achieve’; 2) metonymic subject: the subject of some, but not all, verbs of conversation may be inanimate entities taking the role of Interlocutor based on the principle of metonymy; 3) V+ Complement pattern: some verbs take a postverbal complement or adverbial adjunct denoting ‘result evaluation’, such as chenggong 成功 ‘successful’ or shibai 失敗 ‘failing’; 4) in terms of the distribution of grammatical functions, conversation verbs exhibit different frequencies of nominalization. Based on the above four criteria, verbs of conversation can be further divided into 5 subgroups with a corresponding set of unique behaviors. We will address the syntactic-semantic interdependencies manifested by each association pattern in the following sections."]},{"title":"3.2.1 V+V Pattern: with Light Verbs Jinxing 進行 or Dacheng 達成","paragraphs":["The use of the light verb jinxing 進行 ‘proceed’ entails a formal register and encodes a procedural process or atelic event, according to Huang et al.

[1995] claimed that jinxing ‘to proceed’ takes a processed type argument, which denotes the process of an event. In other words, the verb jinxing implies a non-punctual and non-telic event.

At the subframe level, multiple inheritances may happen; i.e., a given subframe may inherit features from two or more different frames. For example, as mentioned above, verbs belonging to the ‘Quarrel’-subframe highlight Topic-Cause for the marked Manner. This is a result of multiple inheritance. The ‘quarrel’ verbs inherit the element Topic from the Conversation frame, and the element Cause from the Hostile_encounter Frame, where a Cause is normally specified."]},{"title":"5. Conclusion: Frame-based Hierarchy of Verbal Information","paragraphs":["To fully represent the semantic relations among verbs, a multi-layered classificational structure is needed, which helps to manifest different levels of semantic generalization. In this paper, the syntactically well-motivated level of subframes is proposed, rendering a 5-layered hierarchical structure of lexical semantic representation: Domain > Frame > Subframe > Near-synonym sets > Lemma. This model is also adopted in building the lexical network of Mandarin VerbNet [Liu et al. 2004]. With the proposal of subframes within the theoretical constructs of frame semantics, verb meanings may be defined with finer semantic distinctions that are syntactically motivated. The next task is to show that further fine-grained lexical distinctions are needed to differentiate near-synonyms within each subframe. The postulation of subframes is a necessary refinement of the frame-based approach to lexical semantics. With its detailed lexical information, subframes provide the most relevant semantic anchor for further disambiguating near-synonyms as well as individual lemmas."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Baker, C.
