However, most lexical resources, such as WordNet or online dictionaries, at this point do not usually indicate figurative meanings, such as conceptual metaphors, as part of a lexical entry. Studies that attempt to establish the relationships between literal and figurative language by detecting the connectivity between WordNet relations usually do not deal with linguistic data directly. However, the present study demonstrates that SUMO definitions can be used to identify the source domains used in conceptual metaphors. This is achieved by identifying the relationships between metaphorical expressions and their corresponding ontological nodes. Such links are important because they show which lexical items are mapped under which concepts. This, in turn, helps specify which lexical items in electronic resources involve conceptual mappings. Looking specifically at the concept of PERSON, this work also establishes connectivity between lexical items which are related to “Organism.” Therefore, the methodology reported herein not only aids the categorizing of lexical items according to their conceptual domains but also can establish links between these items. Such bottom-up and top-down analyses of lexical items may provide a means of representing metaphorical entries in lexical resources.

Introduction","paragraphs":["Many studies have found that metaphors are not represented separately in lexical resources [Alonge and Castelli 2002ab, 2003; Peter and Wilks 2003; Lönneker 2003]. When metaphors are found in lexical resources, they are most often represented using meaning entries in addition to non-metaphorical ones. WordNet [http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/; Fellbaum 1998] is one of the lexical resources that sometimes lists metaphorical meanings as different senses along with other non-metaphorical ones.","However, where conceptual metaphors [Lakoff 1993; Lakoff and Johnson 1980] are concerned, there is no uniform representation of source (concrete) and target (abstract) domains in WordNet. Due to this fact, studies have been carried out which have attempted to represent figurative meanings by indicating the source-target domain pairing in addition to the literal meaning [Lönneker 2003; Alonge and Lönneker 2004; Peters and Wilks 2003]. In order to do so, these studies first established the relationship between the literal and figurative entry in the lexical resource. As a result, the mapping between the source and target domains could then be extracted.","Researchers who have attempted to incorporate metaphors into WordNet include Eilts and Lönneker [2002], who created the Hamburg Metaphor Database, a database which provides French and German metaphors by creating links between metaphorical expressions and their related synsets in WordNet. Another possible way to establish the relationships between literal and figurative entries is to determine the semantic relations between lexical entries. For instance, Lönneker [2003] and Peters and Wilks [2003] suggested that the meronymic relations in WordNet can be used to identify the links between lexical items by establishing a connection between the event and its participants or the action carried out by the participants. However, neither of these studies used ontologies to link the concepts in the source or target domain. Alonge and Castelli [2003] were the first to suggest that the EuroWordNet Top Ontology needs to be extended with more concepts in order to deal with figurative language. The advantages of ontologies have been outlined by Navigli and Velardi [2004]; they include the fact that a) an ontology has a wide “coverage” of domain concepts; b) that it is a result of “consensus” reached by a group of people and c) that most importantly, it is easily accessible through electronic resources.","Most of the above mentioned works, which tried to generate the underlying connectivity between synsets, have based their mechanisms on distributed models of processing [Rumelhart and McClelland 1986] or the coarse-coding of lexicons [Harris 1994]. Harris stated that the “representational units” in a coarse-coding mechanism “do not match the information represented...in a one-to-one fashion” [Harris 1994]. Rather, they are connected to one another, and when one unit is activated, the others will also be activated. It is through   Source Domains as Concept Domains in Metaphorical Expressions 555  these units that clusters of information (which contain one or more concepts) are built. This activation of concepts governs the generation of underlying relations between WordNet relations.","Working within this framework, our aim in this work is to establish links between metaphorical items by identifying the shared concept carried by a cluster of lexical items. For instance, when one active concept (from a lexical item) such as “Growth” is activated, the related concept, such as “Organism” is also activated. This link between lexical items in the same domain is necessary to show which lexical items are mapped under which concepts; i.e., lexical items with the same shared concepts will be sorted into the same source domain of a metaphor. In this paper, the building of a “concept” involves the use of knowledge nodes from an ontology, which is a shared understanding of some domain of interest [Uschold and Gruninger 1996]. Keil [1979] stated that the knowledge representation in an ontology “has unique properties and is highly structured. Moreover, it constrains the nature of semantic and conceptual knowledge.” The particular ontology we use in this paper, SUMO, was developed by the IEEE Standard Upper Ontology Working Group. Huang, Chung and Ahrens (In press) applied SUMO to explore how an ontology can be used to predict metaphorical mappings. Our work herein extends that of Huang et al. (In press) by focusing on how the source domain of a metaphor can be determined via SUMO definitions.","All metaphorical instances in this work are identified using the Conceptual Mapping (CM) model [Ahrens 2002], and data in this study come from both English and Chinese corpora. Searching for ontology nodes is facilitated by the Academia Sinica Bilingual Ontological Wordnet [Sinica BOW, Huang, Chang and Lee (2004) http://BOW.sinica.edu.tw], a system that integrates WordNet, the English-Chinese Translation Equivalents Database (ECTED), and SUMO."]},{"title":"2. Conceptual Metaphor, Concept Domain and Ontology","paragraphs":["Ahrens [2002] suggested that the metaphorical expressions can be analyzed in terms of the entities, qualities and functions that can map between a source and a target domain. When these conventionalized metaphorical expressions have been examined, an underlying reason for these mappings can then be postulated. This particular study collected data from native speaker intuitions to determine the mappings from the source to the target domain. For example, in the three examples from the metaphor LOVE IS PLANT, given below, the Mapping Principle (MP) of “Love is understood as plant because plants involve physical growth and love involves emotional growth” was extracted based on the fact that all the examples in some way had to do with growth.    556 Siaw-Fong Chung et al. 1. (a) 兩 人 的 愛 苗 最近 才 剛 萌芽 liang ren de ai miao zuijin cai gang mengya two people MOD love seedling lately just recently sprout ‘Their love just begins to sprout lately.’  (b) 我 對 他的 愛意 漸漸 滋長 wo dui tade ai-yi jianjian zizhang I for his love gradually grow ‘My love for him has grown gradually.’  (c) 愛情 需要 辛勤 的 灌溉 aiqing xuyao xinqin de quanqai love need industriously water ‘Love needs to be watered industriously.’ [Ahrens 2002] ","Ahrens, Chung and Huang [2003] extended this study by proposing a corpus-based approach to establish the systematicity between source and target domain pairings (i.e. Mapping Principles (MPs)). They suggest that each source-target domain pairing will have a prototypical instance of mapping determined by the most frequent mapping, as compared with other mappings. In a later paper, Ahrens 2004, they use Suggested-Upper-Merged-Ontology (SUMO) in combination with WordNet to determine Mapping Principles when there is no highly frequent mapping. SUMO can be used to infer knowledge through automatic reasoning as well as to constrain the falsifiability of the MP.","This study extends the previous works of Ahrens, Chung and Huang [2003, 2004] by using SUMO to define the concepts involved in source domains through the use of two major databases -- WordNet (1.6), and SUMO nodes along with their definitions. The integration of WordNet and SUMO by Niles and Pease [2003] enables us to examine the ontological nodes in SUMO that have hyperlinks to WordNet semantic definitions."]},{"title":"3. Metaphor Analysis: CAREER IS A PERSON as a Sample","paragraphs":["In order to find conceptual metaphors in corpora, a single target word was used for the target domain. Four target domains were chosen, namely, CAREER, CULTURE, STOCK MARKET and ECONOMY, of which the latter two are composed Chinese-English data (see Table 1).   Source Domains as Concept Domains in Metaphorical Expressions 557  The target domains of STOCK MARKET and ECONOMY have been discussed by Ahrens et al. [2003] and Chung, Ahrens and Sung [2003], and in this paper, we further refine the previous findings.

After all instances were extracted, they were analyzed manually for the instances of metaphors. A metaphor was identified when there was a source-target domain mapping. The following sentence shows a metaphorical instance for the target domain CAREER: 他事業的生命力日 趨旺盛 “the life-force of his career is becoming exuberant day-by-day,” the concrete meaning of “life force” is mapped onto CAREER. In another example,事業創傷 “the wound of career,” the more concrete source “wound” is mapped onto the abstract target CAREER. Through similar analysis, all metaphorical instances were marked and extracted. Once all the metaphorical instances had been identified, the next step was to define the source domains of these instances. In order to do so, the corresponding WordNet and SUMO nodes for each lexical item were searched for in Sinica Bow. Through this system, each metaphorical instance was keyed in at the WordNet page. This was done to extract the WordNet explanations which were linked to the corresponding SUMO nodes in the system. In order to obtain the WordNet explanation, a prior step was performed, i.e., the most appropriate meaning was selected from the list of senses available. This selection was done manually, but most often, the most appropriate meaning was found to be the most concrete meaning in the list. For example, when the Chinese keyword chuangshang 創傷 “wound” from the target domain CAREER was searched for in Sinica Bow, the senses listed in Table 2 were extracted.   558 Siaw-Fong Chung et al."]},{"title":"Table 2.

In this case, sense 2 was selected and then the corresponding node (the rightmost column in Table 2) was found. In this case, it is “Injuring.” The SUMO definition for “Injuring” is “The process of creating a traumatic wound or injury. Since injuring is not possible without some biologic function of the organism being injured, it is a subclass of biological process.” The keywords in the SUMO definition (shaded in the previous sentence) are the terms that helped us categorize the metaphorical instances. Through the collection of SUMO definitions for all the metaphorical instances, all the similar metaphorical expressions with the same related nodes are grouped into categories. For instance, all the metaphorical expressions related to “Organism” were grouped together. Then, from these instances, the source domains were decided. The expressions that were grouped under the same source domain formed a cluster of lexical items under a domain. In the following discussion, we will provide a detailed example using the CAREER domain.","For the target domain CAREER, all 84 metaphorical instances are listed in Table 3.

For conceptual metaphors, preference is given to source domains that are in contact with human conceptualization, i.e., more concrete concepts which human can easily recall when describing an abstract idea. Furthermore, as indicated in Table 5, the type of organism should not only have the abilities to grow and to walk, but should also to have an emotional state. Based on these criteria, PLANT and ANIMAL are ruled out as possibilities, and HUMAN or PERSON is suggested.","Table 5 also lists the keywords in SUMO that are related to “Organism” (shaded).

The overlapping area between CULTURE and CAREER (concepts such as “Growth” and “Walking”) are linked to lexical items that are more lexicalized, as these items can apply to more target domains than the other items can.

(6) Physical Psychological DiseaseOr Syndrome Growth Physiologic Process OrganismProcess Walking Living BiologicalAttribute Blood Death Injuring PathologicProcess TraitAttribute Awake BiologicalProcess BodyMotion BodyPart Damaging Human Subjective Assessment Attribute Emotional State Psychological Attribute IntentionalPsychological Process Proposition    The distribution in (6) shows that many aspects of the physical concept of human are mapped when constructing metaphors. Comparing Figures 1, 2 and 3, one finds that the node “DiseaseOrSyndrome” comes from both Chinese and English ECONOMY and STOCK MARKET only (where more lexical items in ECONOMY have this node). A similar situation is found with the ontological node of “Growth,” where more types of lexical items come from the target domain ECONOMY (rather than the other three target domains). The preference for (both English and Chinese) ECONOMY for the physical aspect of PERSON shows that these two languages do not differ greatly in terms of the types of lexical items found.","On the other hand, most of the lexical items that denote the psychological aspect of a person come from STOCK MARKET (refer to “Subjective Assessment Attribute” and “Emotional State” in Figure 2). Compared with English ECONOMY, which maps onto the physical aspect of a person, STOCK MARKET seems to be described more in terms of a psychological change of a person. This finding is interesting because as Ahrens [2002] noted in her discussion of the Mapping Principle Constraint, that “a single target domain must use different source domains for different reasons.” In this case, the selection of the single source domain by two different target domains in the same language occurs for different reasons. With this in mind, one can see the underlying motivation for the formulation of different   Source Domains as Concept Domains in Metaphorical Expressions 567  conceptual metaphors. That is, the motivation governing the selection of a source domain by a target domain is not ad hoc; rather, it is governed by principles. This is only reflected when the ontological nodes involved in the source domain concepts are extracted."]},{"title":"5. Conclusion","paragraphs":["The results obtained from the WordNet lexical representation and SUMO searches prove two major points: First, the manual analysis performed using the CM Model in previous studies can be further automatized. Second, there is conceptual connectivity between the metaphorical expressions found within a source domain. As the philosopher Kamppinen pointed out, “representations do not operate in isolation,” they are “clustered into systems of representations, cognitive schemata” [1993]. In this case, this cluster of representations is connected through the overlapping concept or “Organism” in the lexical items found. This connectivity between lexical items can be established by using computational tools such as SUMO definitions, along with a linguistic model (i.e., the CM Model) to identify conceptual metaphors in corpora.","Despite the usefulness of WordNet and SUMO for determining source domains, there are two limitations to this study. First is the process of selecting senses from WordNet, which has to be carried out manually. Second is the missing entries that are found in the Sinica Bow look-up (especially Chinese adjectives). Even though the few missing items do not affect the results of categorization as a whole, their inclusion would have made this study more complete.","Nevertheless, the incorporation of an ontology helps pinpoint at which level of knowledge conceptual metaphors occur. The discovery concerning the motivation for using conceptual metaphors contributes to identifying cognitive differences across speech communities. From the perspective of anthropology and language processing, this study has provided linguistic evidence about how humans represent concepts mentally when using metaphors. It is hoped that the line of research discussed herein will stimulate more research on how computational approaches can help set parameters for determining metaphorical senses and point the way to creating a systematic relationship between literal and figurative synsets in WordNet. In addition, it may also be possible to conduct psycholinguistic experiments to verify the metaphorical expressions that have been extracted from corpora."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["We would like to thank the CLSW-5 reviewers for their comments on this paper and National Science Council, Taiwan, for support under grant #NSC91-2411-H-002-082-ME, #NSC92-2411-H-002-076- ME, #NCS92-2411-H-001-010-ME and #NCS 93-2411-H-001-004-ME.
