These two knowledge bases are automatically aligned to construct a bilingual ontology based on the co-occurrence of words in a bilingual parallel corpus. The bilingual ontology achieves greater structural and semantic information coverage from these two complementary knowledge bases. For domain-specific applications, a domain-specific ontology is further extracted from the bilingual ontology using the island-driven algorithm and domain-specific corpus. Finally, domain-dependent terminology and axioms between domain terminology defined in a medical encyclopedia are integrated into the domain-specific ontology. In addition, a metric based on a similarity measure for ontology evaluation is also proposed. For evaluation purposes, experiments were conducted comparing an automatically constructed ontology with a benchmark ontology constructed by ontology engineers or experts. The experimental results show that the constructed bilingual domain-specific ontology mostly coincided with the benchmark ontology. As for application of this approach to the medical domain, the experimental results show that the proposed approach outperformed the synonym expansion approach to web search.

INTRODUCTION","paragraphs":["In the past few decades, a considerable number of studies been invested focused on developing concept bases for building technology that allows knowledge reuse and sharing. As information exchangeability and communication becomes increasingly global, multilingual lexical resources that provide transnational services are becoming increasingly important. On the other hand, multi-lingual ontologies are very important for natural language processing, such as machine translation (MT), web mining [Oyama et al. 2004], and cross-language information retrieval (CLIR). Generally, a multi-lingual ontology maps the keywords of one language to another language, or computes the co-occurrence of the words among languages. A key merit of a multilingual ontology is that it can achieve greater relation and structural information coverage by aligning or merging two or more language-dependent ontologies with different semantic features.","In recent years, significant effort has focused on constructing ontologies manually according to domain experts’ knowledge. Manual ontology merging using conventional editing tools without intelligent support is difficult, labor intensive, and error prone. Therefore, several systems and frameworks to help knowledge engineers perform ontology merging have recently been proposed [Noy and Musen 2000]. To avoid reiteration in ontology construction, algorithms for ontology merging [UMLS http://umlsks.nlm.nih.gov] [Langkilde and Knight 1998] and ontology alignment [Vossen and Peters 1997] [Weigard and Hoppenbrouwers 1998] [Asanoma 2001] have been investigated. In these approaches, the final ontology is a merged version of the original ontologies with aligned links between them [Daudé et al. 2003]. Alignment is usually performed when ontologies cover domains that are complementary to each other. In the past, a domain ontology was usually constructed manually based on the knowledge or experience of experts or ontology engineers. Recently, automatic and semi-automatic methods have been developed. OntoExtract [Fensel et al. 2002] [Missikoff et al. 2002] provides an ontology engineering chain for constructing a domain ontology from WordNet and SemCor. Some recent approaches have been discussed in [Euzenat et al. 2004]. In [Euzenat et al. 2004], the alignment approaches were classified as local or global methods. Four main local methods, that is, the terminological, extensional, semantics, and structure methods, were introduced to measure the correspondence between two ontologies at the local level. Nowadays, much work is being invested in ontology construction for domain applications. Performing authoritative evaluation of ontologies is becoming a critical issue. Some evaluation methods are integrated into ontology tools to detect and prevent mistakes, which might be made in the course of developing taxonomies with frames as described in [Gómez-Pérez 2001]. They defined three main types of mistakes: inconsistency, incompleteness, and redundancy mistakes. Although the previous research on ontology alignment has achieved much, some   Automated Alignment and Extraction of a Bilingual Ontology for 37 Cross-Language Domain-Specific Applications  important issues still require further investigation: (1) How can we to construct or extract domain concepts from a corpus? (2) Should the alignment of a cross-language or multilingual ontology be performed automatically or semi-automatically? (3) Authoritative assessment of ontology construction is desirable. In this study, the WordNet and HowNet knowledge bases were aligned to construct a bilingual universal ontology based on the co-occurrence of words in a bilingual parallel corpus. For domain-specific applications, the medical domain ontology was further extracted from the universal ontology using the island-driven algorithm and two corpora, one for the medical domain and another for the contrastive domain. Finally, axioms between medical terminology were derived based on a medical encyclopedia. A benchmark ontology based on the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and constructed by ontology engineers and experts was used to evaluate the constructed bilingual ontology. This paper also defines two measures, the taxonomic relation and non-taxonomic relation, as quantitative metrics for evaluating ontologies.","The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the ontology construction process. Section 3 presents experimental results for the evaluation of our approach. Section 4 gives some concluding remarks."]},{"title":"2. Ontology Construction","paragraphs":["Figure 1 shows a block diagram of the ontology construction process. There are two major stages in the proposed approach: bilingual ontology alignment and domain ontology extraction."]},{"title":"2.1 Bilingual Ontology Alignment","paragraphs":["In this approach, a bilingual ontology is constructed by aligning Chinese words in HowNet with their corresponding synsets defined in WordNet according to the co-occurrence of the words in a bilingual parallel corpus. The hierarchical structure of the ontology is actually a conversion of HowNet. One of the important parts of HowNet consists of definitions of lexical entries. In HowNet, each lexical entry is defined as a combination of one or more primary features and a sequence of secondary features. The primary features indicate the entry’s category, for example, the relation “is-a” in a hierarchical structure. Based on the entry’s category, the secondary features make the entry’s sense more explicit, but they are non-taxonomic. Totally, 1,521 primary features are divided into 6 upper categories: Event, Entity, Attribute Value, Quantity, and Quantity Value. These primary features are organized into a hierarchical structure.      38 Jui-Feng Yeh et al.   "]},{"title":"Figure 1. Ontology construction framework","paragraphs":["In the alignment process, the Sinorama [Sinorama 2001] database, containing over 6,500 documents with 48,000,000 words from 1976 to 2000 in Chinese and English, is adopted as the bilingual parallel corpus. This corpus is then used to compute the conditional probability of the words in WordNet, given the words in HowNet. Then, a bottom up algorithm is used to perform relation mapping. In WordNet, a word may be associated with many synsets, each corresponding to a different sense of the word. To find a relation between two different words, all the synsets associated with each word are considered [Fellbaum 1998]. In HowNet, each word is composed of primary features and secondary features. The primary features indicate the word’s category. The goal of this approach is to increase the amount of relation and structural information coverage by aligning their semantic features in WordNet and HowNet.

Even in domain-specific applications, the number of words can be expected to be huge. Synonym pruning is an effective way to perform word sense disambiguation. This paper proposes a corpus-based statistical approach to extracting a domain ontology. The steps are listed as follows: Step 1. Linearization: In this step, the tree structure in the general purpose ontology shown in Figure 2(a) is decomposed into a vertex list that is an ordered node sequence starting at the root node and ending at the leaf nodes.

The nodes shown in bold circles in Figure 2(a) represent operative nodes. Step 3. Relation expansion using the island-driven algorithm: Some domain concepts are no longer operative after the previous steps have been performed due to the problem of data sparseness. According to the analysis performed during ontology construction, most of the inoperative concept nodes have operative hypernym nodes and hyponym nodes. Therefore, the island-driven algorithm is adopted to activate these inoperative concept nodes if their ancestors and descendants are all operative. The nodes shown on gray background in Figure 2(a) are activated operative nodes. Step 4. Domain ontology extraction: In the final step, the linear vertex list sequence is merged into a hierarchical tree. However, some noisy concepts defined as nodes not belonging to this domain are operative according to Equation (5). For example, the node with the concept “solid” shown in Figure 2(b) is an operative noisy concept. Accordingly, the second goal is to filter out the nodes with operative noisy concepts. In this step, noisy concepts without ancestors or descendants belonging to the domain are removed. Finally, the domain ontology is extracted, and the final result is shown in Figure 2(b)."]},{"title":"2.2.2 Axiom and terminology integration","paragraphs":["In practice, specific domain terminology and axioms should be derived and introduced into an ontology for domain-specific applications.

Figure 3 shows an example of an axiom. In this example, the disease “diabetes” is tagged as level “A,” which means that this disease occurs frequently. The degrees for the corresponding syndromes indicate the causality between the disease and the syndromes.

CONCLUSIONS","paragraphs":["A novel approach to automated ontology alignment and domain ontology extraction from two knowledge bases has been presented in this paper. In this study, a bilingual ontology has been developed from two well established knowledge bases, WordNet and HowNet, based on the co-occurrence of words in a parallel bilingual corpus. A domain-dependent ontology has been further extracted from the universal ontology using the island-driven algorithm and a domain corpus as well as a contrastive corpus. In addition, domain-specific terms and axioms have also been added to the domain ontology. A metric based on the similarity measure for ontology evaluation has also been proposed. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can extract an aligned bilingual domain-specific ontology which mostly coincides with a corresponding manually designed ontology. We have also applied the obtained domain-specific ontology to web page search in a medical domain. The experimental results show that the proposed approach outperformed the synonym expansion approach."]},{"title":"REFERENCES","paragraphs":["Asanoma, N., “Alignment of Ontologies: WordNet and Goi-Taikei,” Proc. of WordNet and Other Lexical Resources Workshop Program, NAACL2001, 2001, pp. 89-94","Daudé, J., L.
