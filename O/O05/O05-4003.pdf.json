For speech emotion recognition, we combined 16 LPC coefficients, 12 LPCC components, 16 LFPC components, 16 PLP coefficients, 20 MFCC components and jitter as the basic features to form the feature vector. Two corpora were employed. The recognizer presented in this paper is based on three classification techniques: LDA, K-NN and HMMs. Results show that the selected features are robust and effective for the emotion recognition in the valence and arousal dimensions of the two corpora.

Introduction","paragraphs":["Research on understanding and modeling human emotions, a topic that has been predominantly dealt with in the fields of psychology and linguistics, is attracting increasing attention within the engineering community. A major motivation comes from the need to improve both the naturalness and efficiency of spoken language human-machine interfaces. Researching emotions, however, is extremely challenging for several reasons. One of the main difficulties results from the fact that it is difficult to define what emotion means in a precise way. Various explanations of emotions given by scholars are summarized in [Kleinginna et al. 1981]. Research on the cognitive component focuses on understanding the environmental and attended situations that give rise to emotions; research on the physical components emphasizes the physiological response that co-occurs with an emotion or rapidly follows it. In short,  ∗ Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Tatung University, 40 ChungShan N. Rd., 3rd Sec, Taipei 104, Taiwan, R.O.C, Tel: +886-2-2592-5252 Ext. 2212, Fax: +886-2-2592-5252 Ext. 2288 E-mail: tlpao@ttu.edu.tw; {d8906005, d9306002, d8906004}@ms2.ttu.edu.tw   348 Tsang-Long Pao et al. emotions can be considered as communication with oneself and others [Kleinginna et al. 1981].","Traditionally, emotions are classified into two main categories: primary (basic) and secondary (derived) emotions [Murray et al. 1993]. Primary or basic emotions generally can be experienced by all social mammals (e.g., humans, monkeys, dogs and whales) and have particular manifestations associated with them (e.g., vocal/facial expressions, behavioral tendencies and physiological patterns). Secondary or derived emotions are combinations of or derivations from primary emotions.","Emotional dimensionality is a simplified description of the basic properties of emotional states. According to the theory developed by Osgood, Suci and Tannenbaum [Osgood et al. 1957] and in subsequent psychological research [Mehrabian et al. 1974], the computing of emotions is conceptualized as three major dimensions of connotative meaning: arousal, valence and power. In general, the arousal and valence dimensions can be used to distinguish most basic emotions. The locations of emotions in the arousal-valence space are shown in Figure 1, which provides a representation that is both simple and capable of conforming to a wide range of emotional applications. "]},{"title":"Figure 1. Graphic representation of the arousal-valence dimension of emotions[Osgood et al. 1957] ","paragraphs":["Numerous previous reports indicated that emotions could be detected by psychological cues [Cowie et al. 2000; Ekman 1999; Holzapfel et al. 2002; Inanoglu et al. 2005; Kleinginna et al. 1981; Kwon et al. 2003; Murray et al. 1993; Nwe et al. 2003; Park et al. 2002; Park et al. 2003; Pasechke et al. 2000; Picard 1997; Ververidis et al.2004]. Vocal cues are among the fundamental expressions of emotions, on a par with facial expressions [Cowie et al. 2000; Ekman 1999; Holzapfel et al. 2002; Kleinginna et al. 1981; Murray et al. 1993; Nwe et al.

All mammals can convey emotions by means of vocal cues. Humans are especially capable of expressing their feelings by crying, laughing, shouting and more subtle characteristics of speech.","In this paper, instead of modifying classifiers, we present an effective and robust set of vocal features for recognizing categories of emotions in Mandarin speech. The vocal characteristics of emotions are extracted from a Mandarin corpus. In order to surmount the inefficiency of conventional vocal features, such as pitch contour, loudness, speech rate and duration, for recognizing anger/happiness and boredom/sadness, we also adopt arousal and valence correlated characteristics to categorize emotions in emotional discrete categories. Several systematic experiments are presented. The characteristics of the extracted features are not only facile, but also discriminative.","The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, two testing corpora are addressed. In Section 3, the details of the proposed system are presented. Experiments conducted to assess the performance of the proposed system are presented in Section 4 together with analysis of the results of the experiments. Concluding remarks are given in Section 5."]},{"title":"2. The Testing Corpora","paragraphs":["An emotional speech database, Corpus I, was specifically designed and set up for emotion classification studies. The database includes short utterances portraying the five primary emotions, namely, anger, boredom, happiness, neutral and sadness. In the course of selecting emotional sentences, two aspects were taken into account. First, the sentences did not have any emotional tendency. Second, the sentences could involve all kinds of emotions. Non-professional speakers were selected to avoid exaggerated expression. Twelve native Mandarin language speakers (7 females and 5 males) were asked to generate the emotional utterances. The recording was done in a quiet environment using a mouthpiece microphone at a sampling rate of 8 kHz.","All of the native speakers were asked to speak each sentence with the five chosen emotions, resulting in 1,200 sentences. We first eliminated sentences that suffered from excessive noise. Then a subjective assessment of the emotion speech corpus by human audiences was carried out. The purpose of the subjective classification was to eliminate ambiguous emotion utterances. Finally, 558 utterances with over 80% human judgment accuracy were selected and are summarized in Table 1. In this study, utterances in Mandarin were used due to the immediate availability of native speakers of the language. It is easier for speakers to express emotions in their native language than in a foreign language. In order to accommodate the computing time requirement and bandwidth limitation of the practical   350 Tsang-Long Pao et al. recognition application, e.g., the call center system [ Yacoub et al. 2003 ], a sampling rate of 8 kHz was used. Another corpus, Corpus II, was recorded by Cheng [Cheng 2002]. Two professional Mandarin speakers were employed to generate 503 utterances with five emotions as shown in Table 2. The sampling rate was down-sampled to 8 kHz."]},{"title":"Table 1.

In this way, several different models, all trained with the training set, can be compared based on the test set. This is the basic form of cross-validation. A better method, which is intended to avoid possible bias introduced by relying on any one particular division into test and train components, is to partition the original set in several different ways and then compute an average score over the different partitions. An extreme variant of this is to split the p patterns into a training set of size p-1 and a test of size 1, and average the squared error on the left-out pattern over the p possible ways of obtaining such a partition. This is called leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation. The advantage here is that all the data can be used for training; none have to be held back in a separate test set."]},{"title":"3. Emotion Recognition Method","paragraphs":["The proposed emotion recognition method has three main stages: feature extraction, feature vector quantization and classification. Base features and their statistics are computed in the feature extraction stage. Feature components are quantized into a feature vector in the feature Sex Sex   Detecting Emotions in Mandarin Speech 351 quantization stage. Classification is done by using various classifiers based on dynamic models or discriminative models."]},{"title":"3.1 Emotion Feature Selection","paragraphs":["Determining emotion features is a crucial issue in emotion recognizer design. All selected features have to carry sufficient information about transmitted emotions. However, they also need to fit the chosen model by means of classification algorithms. Important research was done by Murray and Arnott [Murray et al. 1993], whose results particularized several notable acoustic attributes for detecting primary emotions. Table 3 summarizes the vocal effects most commonly associated with the five primary emotions [Murray et al. 1993]. Classification of emotional states based on prosody and voice quality requires classifying the connections between acoustic features in speech and emotions. Specifically, we need to find suitable features that can be extracted and modeled for use in recognition. This also implies that the human voice carries abundant information about the emotional state of a speaker."]},{"title":"Table 3.

For example, Schuller et al. chose 20 pitch and energy related features [Schuller et al. 2003]. A speech corpus consisting of acted and spontaneous emotion utterances in German and English was described in detail. The accuracy in recognizing 7 discrete emotions (anger, disgust, fear, surprise, joy, neutral and sad) exceeded 77.8%. Park et al. used pitch, formant, intensity, speech rate and energy related features to classify neutral, anger, laugh and surprise [Park et al.2002]. The recognition rate was about 40% for a 40-sentence corpus. Yacoub et al. extracted 37 fundamental frequency, energy and audible duration features for recognizing sadness, boredom, happiness and anger in a corpus recorded by eight professional actors [Yacoub et al.2003]. The overall accuracy   352 Tsang-Long Pao et al. was only about 50%, but these features successfully separated hot anger from other basic emotions. Tato et al. extracted prosodic features, derived from pitch, loudness, duration and quality features [Tato et al.2002], from a 400-utterance database. The significant results of emotion recognition were the speaker-independent case and three clusters (high = anger/happy, neutral, low = sad/bored). However, the accuracy in recognizing five emotions was only 42.6%. Kwon et al. selected pitch, log energy, formant, band energies and Mel frequency spectral coefficients (MFCC) as base features, and added velocity/acceleration of pitch to form feature streams [Kwon et al.2003]. The average classification accuracy achieved was 40.8% in a SONY AIBO database. Nwe et al. adopted the short time log frequency power coefficients (LFPC) along with MFCC as emotion speech features to recognize 6 emotions in a 60-utterance corpus produced by 12 speakers [Nwe et al.2003]. Results showed that the proposed system yielded an average accuracy of 78%. In [Le et al. 2004], the authors proposed a method using MFCC coefficients and a simple but efficient classifying method, Vector Quantization, for performing speaker-dependent emotion recognition. Various speech features, namely, energy, pitch, zero crossing, phonetic rate, LPC and their derivatives, were also tested and combined with MFCC coefficients. The average recognition accuracy achieved was about 70%. In [Chuang et al. 2004], Chuang and Wu presented an approach to emotion recognition from speech signals and textual content using PCA and SVM, and achieved 81.49% average accuracy using an extra corpus collected from the same broadcast drama.","According to the experimental results stated above, some simple prosodic features, such as duration, loudness, can not consistently distinguish all primary emotions. Furthermore, the prosodic features of females and males are obviously intrinsic in speech. The simple speech energy feature calculation method is also unconformable to human auricular perception.","Figure 2 shows a block diagram of the feature extraction process. In the pre-processing procedure, locating the endpoints of the input speech signal is done first. The speech signal is high-pass filtered to emphasize the important high frequency components. Then the speech frame is partitioned into frames consisting of 256 samples each. Each frame overlaps with the adjacent frames by 128 samples. The next step is to apply the Hamming window to each individual frame to minimize the signal discontinuities at the beginning and end of each frame. Each windowed speech frame is then converted into several types of parametric representations for further analysis and recognition.","In order to find a suitable combination of extracted features, we used the regression selection method to determine beneficial features from among more than 200 speech features. Ten candidates were selected: LPC, LPCC, MFCC, Delta-MFCC, Delta-Delta-MFCC, PLP, RastaPLP, LFPC, jitter and shimmer. Then the feature vector of each frame of a sentence from corpus I was calculated. The recognition rate in each step was calculated using the LOO cross-validation method with the K-NN (K=3) classifier.   Detecting Emotions in Mandarin Speech 353 "]},{"title":"Figure 2.

This added up to a feature vector consisting of 81 parameters. LPC provides an accurate and economical representation of the envelope of the short-time power spectrum of speech [Kaiser 2002]. For speech emotion recognition, LPCC and MFCC are popular choices as they represent the phonetic content of speech and convey information about short time energy migration in the frequency domain [Ata 1997; Davis et al. 1980]. LFPC is calculated using a log frequency filter bank, which can be regarded as a model that shows the varying auditory resolving power of the human ear for various frequencies [Nwe et al.2003]. The combination of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and LPC technique is called PLP [Hermansky 1990]. PLP analysis is computationally efficient and permits a compact representation. Perturbations in the pitch period are called jitter. Such perturbations occur naturally during continuous speech.

Whereas the research on automated recognition of emotions in facial expressions has been quite extensive, that focusing on speech modality, both for automated production and recognition by machines, has been active only in recent years and has mostly focused on English. Possible applications include intelligent speech-based customer information systems, human oriented human-computer interaction GUIs, interactive movies, intelligent toys and games, situated computer-assisted speech training systems and supported medical instruments.","The selection of a feature set is a critical issue for all recognition systems. In the conventional approach to emotion classification of speech signals, the features typically employed are the fundamental frequency, energy contour, duration of silence and voice quality. However, previous proposed recognition methods employing these features perform poorly in recognizing valence emotions. In addition, these features, when applied to different corpora, obtain different recognition results with the same recognizer.","In this study, we combined 16 LPC coefficients, 12 LPCC components, 16 LFPC components, 16 PLP coefficients, 20 MFCC components and jitter as features, and used LDA, K-NN and HMMs as the classifiers. The emotions were classified into five human primary categories: anger, boredom, happiness, neutral and sadness. Two Mandarin corpora, one consisting of 558 emotional utterances made by 12 native speakers and the other consisting of 503 emotional utterances made by 2 professional speakers, were used to train and test the proposed recognition system. Results obtained show that the proposed system yielded top recognition rates of 88.3% for Corpus I and 88.7% for Corpus II.","According to the experimental outcomes, we attained high recognition rates in distinguishing anger/happy and bored/sad emotions, which have similar prosody and amplitude. The proposed method can solve the problem of recognizing valence emotions using a set of extracted features. Moreover, the recognition accuracy results for Corpus I and Corpus II show that the selected speech features are suitable and effective for the speech emotion recognition with different corpora.","Further improvement and expansion may be achieved according to the following suggestions: The set of the most efficient features for emotion recognition is still vague. A possible approach to extracting non-textual information to identify emotional states in speech is to apply all known feature extraction methods. Thus, we may try to incorporate the information of different features into our system to improve the accuracy of emotion recognition. Recognizing emotion translation in real human communication is also a challenge. Thus, it will be worth while to determine the points where emotion transitions occur.   360 Tsang-Long Pao et al."]},{"title":"Acknowledgement","paragraphs":["The authors are thankful to the National Science Council of Taiwan, R.O.C., for financial supports of this work (grant no. 93-2213-E-036-023 and 92-2213-E-036-021)."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Ata, B.S., “Effectiveness of Linear Prediction Characteristics of the Speech Wave for Automatic Speaker Identification and Verification,” Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 1(55), 1974, pp.1304-1312.","Cheng, P.Y., “Automated Recognition of Emotion in Mandarin,” MD thesis, National Cheng Kung University, 2002.","Chuang, Z.J. and C.H.
