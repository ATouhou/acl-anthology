Given a certain document in the source language, it will be translated into the target language of the statistical machine translation model. The query generation model then selects the most relevant words in the translated version of the document as a query. Instead of retrieving all the target documents with the query, the length-based model can help to filter out a large amount of irrelevant candidates according to their length information. Finally, the left documents in the target language are scored by the document searching model, which mainly computes the similarities between query and document. Different from the traditional parallel corpora-based model which relies on IBM algorithm, we divided our CLIR model into four independent parts but all work together to deal with the term disambiguation, query generation and document retrieval. Besides, the TQDL method can efficiently solve the problem of translation ambiguity and query expansion for disambiguation, which are the big issues in Cross-Language Information Retrieval. Another contribution is the length filter, which are trained from a parallel corpus according to the ratio of length between two languages. This can not only improve the recall value due to filtering out lots of useless documents dynamically, but also increase the efficiency in a smaller search space. Therefore, the precision can be improved but not at the cost of recall.  ∗ Natural Language Processing & Portuguese-Chinese Machine Translation Laboratory, Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Macau, Macau S. A. R., China E-mail: vincentwang0229@hotmail.com The author for correspondence is Long-Yue Wang.   16 Long-Yue WANG et al. In order to evaluate the retrieval performance of the proposed model on cross-languages document retrieval, a number of experiments have been conducted on different settings. Firstly, the Europarl corpus which is the collection of parallel texts in 11 languages from the proceedings of the European Parliament was used for evaluation. And we tested the models extensively to the case that: the lengths of texts are uneven and some of them may have similar contents under the same topic, because it is hard to be distinguished and make full use of the resources. After comparing different strategies, the experimental results show a significant performance of the method. The precision is normally above 90% by using a larger query size. The length-based filter plays a very important role in improving the F-measure and optimizing efficiency. This fully illustrates the discrimination power of the proposed method. It is of a great significance to both cross-language searching on the Internet and the parallel corpus producing for statistical machine translation systems. In the future work, the TQDL system will be evaluated for Chinese language, which is a big changing and more meaningful to CLIR.

Introduction","paragraphs":["With the flourishing development of the Internet, the amount of information from a variety of domains is rising dramatically. Especially after the advent of the World Wide Web (WWW) in the 1900s, the amount of online information from the government, scientific and business communities has risen dramatically. Although much word has been done to develop effective and efficient retrieval systems for monolingual resources, the diversity and the explosive growth of information in different languages drove a great need for information retrieval that could cross language boundaries (Ballesteros et al., 1988).","The issues of CLIR have been discussed for several decades. Its task addresses a situation in which a user tries to search a set of documents written in one language using a query in a different language (Kishida, 2005). It is of great significance, allowing people access information resources written in non-native languages and aligning documents for statistical machine translation (SMT) systems, of which quality is heavily dependent upon the amount of parallel sentences used in constructing the system.","In this paper, we focus on the problems of translation ambiguity, query generation and searching score which are keys to the retrieval performance. First of all, in order to increase the probability that the best translation can be selected from multiple ones, which occurs in the   TQDL: Integrated Models for Cross-Language Document Retrieval 17 target documents, the context and the most likely probability of the whole sentence should be considered. So we apply document translation approach using SMT model instead of query translation, although the latter one may require fewer computational resources. After the source documents are translated into the target language, the problem is transformed from bilingual environment to monolingual one, where conventional IR techniques can be used for document retrieval. Secondly, some terms in a certain document will be selected as query, which can distinguish the document from others. However, some of the words occur too frequently to be useful, which cannot distinguish target documents. This mostly includes two cases: one is that the word frequency is high in all the documents of a set, which is usually classified as stop word; the other one is that the frequency is moderate in several documents of a set. These words are poor in the ability of distinguishing documents. Thus, the query generation model should pick the words that occur more frequently in a certain document while less frequently in other documents. Finally, the document searching model evaluates the similarity between the query and each document. This model should give a higher score to the target document which covers the most relevant words in the given query. However, another problem is that word overlap between a query and a wrong document is more probable when the document and the query are expressed in the same language. For example, Document A is larger and contains another smaller document B. So the retrieval system would be confused with a query including the information of B. In order to solve this problem, the length ratio of a language pair is considered. As the search space is reduced, both the speed efficiency and the recall value will be improved clearly.","There are two cases to be considered when we investigated the method. In one case, the lengths of documents are uneven, which are hard to balance the scores between large and small documents. In the other case, the contents of the documents are very similar, which are not easy to distinguish for retrieval. The results of experiments reveal that the proposed model shows a very good performance in dealing with both cases.","The paper is organized as follows. The related works are reviewed and discussed in Section 2. The proposed CLIR approach based on statistical models is described in Section 3. The resources and configurations of experiments for evaluating the system are detailed in Section 4. Results, discussion and comparison between different strategies are given in Section 5 followed by a conclusion and future improvements to end the paper."]},{"title":"2. Related Work","paragraphs":["The issues of CLIR have been discussed from different perspectives for several decades. In this section, we briefly describe some related methods.","From a statistical perspective, the CLIR problem can be treated as document alignment. Given a set of parallel documents, the alignment that maximizes the probability over all   18 Long-Yue WANG et al. possible alignments is retrieved (Gale & Church, 1991) as follows:"]},{"title":"∏","paragraphs":["∈⇔"]},{"title":"↔≈","paragraphs":["ALL tsts","Ats t s"]},{"title":"LLLLDDA","paragraphs":[")("]},{"title":")|Pr(maxarg),|Pr(maxarg","paragraphs":["(1) where A is an alignment, Ds and Dt are the source and target documents, respectively L1 and L2 are the documents of two languages, Ls↔Lt is an individual aligned pairs, an alignment A is a set consisting of Ls↔Lt pairs.","On the matching strategies for CLIR, query translation is most widely used method due to its tractability (Gao et al., 2001). However, it is relatively difficult to resolve the problem of term ambiguity because “queries are often short and short queries provide little context for disambiguation” (Oard & Diekema, 1998). Hence, some researchers have used document translation method as the opposite strategies to improve translation quality, since more varied context within each document is available for translation (Braschler & Schauble, 2001; Franz et al., 1999).","However, another problem introduced based on this approach is word (term) disambiguation, because a word may have multiple possible translations (Oard & Diekema, 1998). Significant efforts have been devoted to this problem. Davis and Ogden (1997) applied a part-of-speech (POS) method which requires POS tagging software for both languages. Marcello et al. presented a novel statistical method to score and rank the target documents by integrating probabilities computed by query-translation model and query-document model (Federico & Bertoldi, 2002). However, this approach cannot aim at describing how users actually create queries which have a key effect on the retrieval performance. Due to the availability of parallel corpora in multiple languages, some authors have tried to extract beneficial information for CLIR by using SMT techniques. Sánchez-Martínez et al. (Sánchez-Martínez & Carrasco, 2011) applied SMT technology to generate and translate queries in order to retrieve long documents.","Some researchers like Marcello, Sánchez-Martínez et al. have attempted to estimate translation probability from a parallel corpus according to a well-known algorithm developed by IBM (Brown et al., 1993). The algorithm can automatically generate a bilingual term list with a set of probabilities that a term is translated into equivalents in another language from a set of sentence alignments included in a parallel corpus. The IBM Model 1 is the simplest among the five models and often used for CLIR. The fundamental idea of the Model 1 is to estimate each translation probability so that the probability represented is maximized"]},{"title":"∑∏","paragraphs":["==+ = l i ij m jm stP l stP 01 )|( )1( )|( ε (2) where t is a sequence of terms t1, ..., tm in the target language, s is a sequence of terms s1, ..., sl in the source language, P(tj|si) is the translation probability, and Ɛ is a parameter (Ɛ =P(m|e)),   TQDL: Integrated Models for Cross-Language Document Retrieval 19 where e is target language and m is the length of source language). Eq. (2) tries to balance the probability of translation, and the query selection, in which problem still exists: it tends to select the terms consisting of more words as query because of its less frequency, while cutting the length of terms may affect the quality of translation. Besides, the IBM model 1 only proposes translations word-by-word and ignores the context words in the query. This observation suggests that a disambiguation process can be added to select the correct translation words (Oard & Diekema, 1998). However, in our method, the conflict can be resolved through contexts.","If translated sentences share cognates, then the character lengths of those cognates are correlated (Yang & Li, 2004). Brown et al. (1991) and Gale and Church (1991) have developed the models based on relationship between the lengths of sentences that are mutual translations. Although it has been suggested that length-based methods are language-independent (Gale & Church, 1991), they really rely on length correlations arising from the historical relationships of the languages being aligned.","The length-based model assumes that each term in Ls is responsible for generating some number of terms in Lt.

Generally speaking, translation model is common for contiguous sequences of words to translate as a whole. Phrasal translation is certainly significant for CLIR (Ballesteros & Croft, 1997), as stated in Section 1. It can do a good job in dealing with term disambiguation.","In this work, documents are translated using the translation model provided by Moses, where the log-linear model is considered for training the phrase-based system models (Och & Ney, 2002), and is represented as:"]},{"title":"∑∑ ∑","paragraphs":["=","= = I e M m JI mm M m JI mm JI feh feh fep 1' 1 11 1 11 11 )),'(exp( )),(exp( )|( λ λ (4) where hm indicates a set of different models, λm means the scaling factors, and the denominator can be ignored during the maximization process.

The source document will maximize the equation to generate the translation including the words most likely to occur in the target document set."]},{"title":"3.2 Query Generation Model","paragraphs":["After translating the source document into the target language of the translation model, the system should select a certain amount of words as a query for searching instead of using the whole translated text. It is for two reasons, one is computational cost, and the other is that the unimportant words will degrade the similarity score. This is also the reason why it often responses nothing from the search engines on the Internet when we choose a whole text as a query.","In this paper, we apply a classical algorithm which is commonly used by the search engines as a central tool in scoring and ranking relevance of a document given a user query. Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) calculates the values for each word in a document through an inverse proportion of the frequency of the word in a particular   TQDL: Integrated Models for Cross-Language Document Retrieval 21 document to the percentage of documents where the word appears (Ramos, 2003). Given a document collection D, a word w, and an individual document d D, we calculate ),( || log),(),(","Dwf D dwfdwP ×= (5) where f(w, d) denotes the number of times w that appears in d, |D| is the size of the corpus, and f(w,D) indicates the number of documents in which w appears in D (Berger et al., 2000).","In implementation, if w is an Out-of-Vocabulary term (OOV), the denominator f(w,D) becomes zero, and will be problematic (divided by zero). Thus, our model makes log (|D|/ f(w,D))=1 (IDF=1) when this situation occurs. Additionally, a list of stop-words in the target language is also used in query generation to remove the words which are high frequency but less discrimination power. Numbers are also treated as useful terms in our model, which also play an important role in distinguishing the documents. Finally, after evaluating and ranking all the words in a document by their scores, we take a portion of the (n-best) words for constructing the query and are guided by: ][ dpercentq LenSize ×= λ (6) Sizeq is the number of terms. λpercent is the percentage and is manually defined, which determines the Sizeq according to Lend, the length of the document.

Conclusion","paragraphs":["This article presents a TQDL statistical approach for CLIR which has been explored for both large and similar documents retrieval. Different from the traditional parallel corpora-based model which relies on IBM algorithm, we divided our CLIR model into four independent parts but all work together to deal with the term disambiguation, query generation and document   30 Long-Yue WANG et al. retrieval. The performances showed that this method can do a good job of CLIR for not only large documents but also the similar documents. This fully illustrates the discrimination power of the proposed method. It is of a great significance to both cross-language searching on the Internet and the parallel corpus producing for statistical machine translation systems. In the future work, the TQDL system will be evaluated for Chinese language, which is a big changing and more meaningful to CLIR. In the further work, we plan to make better use of the proposed models between significantly different languages such as Portuguese-Chinese."]},{"title":"Acknowledgement","paragraphs":["This work was partially supported by the Research Committee of University of Macau under grant UL019B/09-Y3/EEE/LYP01/FST, and also supported by Science and Technology Development Fund of Macau under grant 057/2009/A2."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Ballesteros, L., & Croft, W.
