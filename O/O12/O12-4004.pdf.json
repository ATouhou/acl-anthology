Introduction","paragraphs":["Word segmentation is an indispensable technique in Chinese NLP. Nevertheless, the processing of Japanese names and Chinese word variants has been studied rarely. At the time when Traditional Chinese text was mostly encoded in BIG5, writers often transcribed a Japanese person’s name into its equivalent Traditional Chinese characters, such as the name “滝沢秀明” (Hideaki Takizawa) in Japanese becoming “瀧澤秀明” in Traditional Chinese. After Unicode was widely adopted, we also could see names written in original Japanese Kanji in Traditional Chinese text. Another issue is how different regions may write a character  ∗ Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Taiwan Ocean University No 2, Pei-Ning Road, Keelung, 20224 Taiwan E-mail: cjlin@ntou.edu.tw; jjt@cyber.ntou.edu.tw; {M97570019, M97570020}@ntou.edu.tw   88 Chuan-Jie Lin et al. in a different shape. For example, the Traditional Chinese character 圖 (picture) is written as 图 in Simplified Chinese and 図 in Japanese. How these character variants impact Chinese text processing has been mentioned rarely in earlier studies; thus, it has become our interest.","Chinese word segmentation has been studied for a long time. Many recent word segmentation systems have been rule-based or probabilistic. The most common rules are longest-word-first or least-segmentation-first. The probability models are often built in Markov's unigram or bigram models, such as in Peng and Chang (1993). Word candidate sets are often vocabulary in a dictionary or a lexicon collected from a large corpus. Some systems also propose possible candidates by morphological rules (Gao et al., 2003), such as NOUN+“們” (plural form of a noun) as a legal word (e.g. “學生們,” students, and “家長們,” parents). Wu and Jiang (1998) even integrated a syntactic parser in their word segmentation system.","In addition to word segmentation ambiguity, the out-of-vocabulary problem is another important issue. Unknown words include rare words (e.g. “躉售,” for sale); technical terms (e.g. “三聚氰胺,” Melamine, a chemical compound); newly invented terms (Chien, 1997) (e.g. “ 新流感,” Swine flu); and named entities, such as personal and location names. NE recognition is an important related technique (Sun et al., 2003). In recent times, machine learning approaches have been the focus of papers on Chinese segmentation, such as using SVM (Lu, 2007) or CRF (Zhao et al., 2006; Shi & Wang, 2007).","There have been fewer studies focused on handling words that are not Traditional Chinese words in Traditional Chinese text. The most relevant work is discussion of the impact of the different Chinese vocabulary used in different areas on word segmentation systems. These experiments have been designed to train a system with a Traditional Chinese corpus but test on a Simplified Chinese test set or to increase the robustness of a system using a lexicon expanded by adding new terms in different areas (Lo, 2008).","The main problem in this paper is defined as follows. When a word that is not Traditional Chinese appears in a Traditional Chinese document, such as the Japanese name “滝沢秀明” (written in Japanese Kanji) or “瀧澤秀明” (written in its equivalent Traditional Chinese), word variants (e.g. “裡面” vs. “裏面”), and words written in Simplified Chinese, all of these words can be detected and become word segmentation candidates. This paper is constructed as follows. Section 2 introduces the basic architecture of our word segmentation system. Section 3 explains the Chinese and Japanese name processing modules. Section 4 talks about the character-variant clusters with a corresponding Traditional Chinese character. Section 5 delivers the experimental results and discussion, and Section 6 concludes this paper.

Word Segmentation Strategy","paragraphs":["This paper focuses on approaches to handling words that are not Traditional Chinese during word segmentation. We first constructed a basic bigram model word segmentation system. We did not build a complicated system because its purpose is only for observing the effect of applying different handling approaches for words that are not written in Traditional Chinese on the performance of word segmentation. Word candidates were identified by searching the lexicon or applying detection rules for special-type words, such as temporal or numerical expressions. Note that identical word candidates may be proposed by different rules or the lexicon. Moreover, if no candidate of any length can be found at a particular position inside the input sentence, the system automatically adds a one-character candidate at that position. Afterward, the probabilities of all of the possible segmentations are calculated according to a bigram model. The highest probable segmentation is proposed as the result."]},{"title":"2.1 Special-Type Word Candidate Generation Rules","paragraphs":["As there are many special type words, it is impossible to collect them all in a lexicon. Hence, we manually designed many detection rules to recognize such words in an input sentence. The special types handled in our system include the following: address, date, time, monetary, percentage, fraction, Internet address (IP, URL, e-mail, etc.), number, string written in foreign language, and Chinese and Japanese personal name. Numerical digits in the detection rules can be full-sized or Chinese numbers (一,二...壹貳...). Foreign language characters are detected according to the Unicode table; thus, any character sets, such as Korean or Arabic characters, easily can be added into our system. Consequent characters written in the same foreign language are treated as one word, as most languages use the space symbol as the word-segmentation mark.","Since the focus of this paper is not on the correctness of these special rules, only personal name detection rules will be explained in Section 3."]},{"title":"2.2 Bigram Probabilistic Model","paragraphs":["After enumerating all possible segmentations, the next step is to calculate their probabilities P(S).

Our solution is a unigram-back-off strategy. That is, when a bigram <wi-1, wi> never occurs in a training corpus, its bigram probability P(wi | wi-1) is measured by αP(wi) instead.","When determining the probability of a bigram containing special-type words, the probability is calculated by Eq. 3.

The generation probabilities are set to 1 for all special types other than the personal names, whose definitions are explained in Section 3.","As the boundaries of some special types, including address, monetary, percentage, fraction, Internet address, number, and foreign language string, are deterministic and unambiguous, their special-type bigram probabilities are all set to be 1, which means that we accept the segmentation directly.","On the other hand, characters for Chinese numbers often appear as a part of a word, such as “一切” (“一,” one; “一切,” all) and “萬一” (both characters are numbers but together mean “if it happens”). Therefore, the number-type bigram probability is trained from a corpus.","Some temporal expressions are unambiguous, such as the date expression “中華民國九 十八年六月二十一日” (“June 21 of the 98th","year of the R.O.C.”). Their special-type bigram probabilities are set to 1. For ambiguous temporal expressions, such as “三十年” (meaning “the 30th","year” or “thirty years”), their special-type bigram probabilities are obtained by training.","Before training a bigram model, words belonging to special types first are identified by detection rules and replaced by labels representing their types so that special-type bigram probabilities can be measured at the same time.","Our special-type bigram probability model is very similar to Gao et al. (2003). Nevertheless, they treat all dictionary words as one class and all types of special words as a second class, while we treat different types as different classes."]},{"title":"2.3 Computation Reduction","paragraphs":["When an input sentence is too long or too many possible segmentations can be found (sometimes hundreds of thousands), the computation time becomes intractable. In order to   Strategies of Processing Japanese Names and 91 Character Variants in Traditional Chinese Text reduce the computation load, we use the beam search algorithm to prune some low probability segmentations. The main idea of the algorithm is described as follows.","Let N be the number of characters in an input sentence. Declare N priority queues (denoted as record[i] where i = 1~N) to record the top k segmentations with the highest probability scores covering the first i characters. For each word candidate w beginning with the (i+1)th","character whose length is b, append the word w with every segmentation stored in record[i], compute the probability of the new segmentation, and try to insert it into the queue record[i+b]. If the new segmentation has higher probability than any segmentation stored in the queue record[i+b], the segmentation with the lowest probability in record[i+b] is discarded in order to insert this new segmentation.","At the beginning, all priority queues are empty. Start with the first character in the sentence. Recursively perform the steps described in the previous paragraph until all of the word candidates starting with the Nth","character have been considered. In the end, the top 1 segmentation stored in record[N] is proposed as the result. The queue size k is set to be 20 in our system."]},{"title":"3.

A Chinese surname can be one or two syllables (one or two characters) long. In some cases, a person may have two surnames (usually both with one syllable) in his or her name for various reasons. The first name part in a Chinese name is also one or two syllables long. All name formats possibly seen in an article are listed in Table 1, where “SN” denotes “surname,” “FN” as “first name,” and “char” is “character”.","All strings matching these formats are treated as Chinese name candidates, except the format “1-char FN,” in order to prevent proposing every single character as a personal name candidate. The combination of two surnames is also restricted to two 1-syllable surnames, because one rarely sees a 2-syllable surname combined with another surname.

The list contains 476,269 male names and 503,679 female names. There are only 953 surnames and 4,000 more first name characters seen in the name list. For those unseen surnames and first name characters, we assign them a small probability (10-1000",", tuned by experiments) to avoid the zero probability problem.","The next step is to build the Chinese name format probability PG(π | SCHname). Since it is about the probability of a name format appearing in an article, the distribution is quite different from the ones observed in the list of one million personal names. A person is often mentioned in an article by his or her title, e.g. “Prof. 林” (“Prof. Lin”) or “Mr. 諸葛” (“Mr. Zhu-Ge). When referring to a person in a novel or a letter, it is quite natural to give his or her first name instead of his or her full name. Such cases cannot be captured inside the one million personal names list. Therefore, we need another corpus to train this model.","Personal names in the Academia Sinica Balanced Corpus (Sinica Corpus hereafter) are marked as proper nouns (POS-tagged as Nb). We extracted all of the proper nouns in the Sinica Corpus that matched any name format and assumed them to be personal names. These   94 Chuan-Jie Lin et al. names occur in real documents; thus, they can satisfy our need. The precedence of format matching is defined as follows. Every personal name can only be matched to one format. 1-char word:s > n > not-Chinese-personal-name 2-char word:dd > sn > nn > not-Chinese-personal-name 3-char word:ddn > snn > ssn > not-Chinese-personal-name 4-char word:ddnn > ssnn > not-Chinese-personal-name 5-char word:not-Chinese-personal-name Nevertheless, for the reason that some common characters are uncommon surnames, it is possible to identify a proper noun of some other type incorrectly as a personal name, such as “中興號” (“Zhong Xing Hao,” a bus company name) where “中” (“Zhong”) is also a surname. In order to increase the precision without sacrificing the recall, we used only frequent surnames and first name characters to do the matching. The sets of frequent characters are the ones that dominate 90% of the probabilities in the name generation model, including 64 surnames (陳,林...程), 467 male first name characters (文,明...瀛), and 293 female first name characters (美,淑...吉), together with all of the 2-syllable surnames.","There are two more formats seen in articles: SN+“姓” or SN+“氏”, which call a person or a family, respectively, by the surname only. We denote them as π = ‘p’. After implementing the matching procedure described above, 39,612 of the 92,314 proper nouns in the Sinica Corpus were extracted as personal names. The Chinese name format probabilities are listed in Table 3. Although there may still be false-alarm personal names in the set, we expect the scale of the corpus is large enough that it can still provide relatively accurate information.

Although the last two cases are not often seen, especially the third case (which could not happen until Unicode was invented), we still propose approaches to handle these cases at the same time for the possibility of building a multilingual environment."]},{"title":"4.1 Mapping of Character Variants","paragraphs":["A mapping table between the character variants is required for handling the three cases introduced in the previous paragraph. For Japanese names, we need a list of Japanese Kanji and their corresponding Chinese characters. For word variants, a list of the equivalent Chinese character set is necessary. The mapping between Simplified Chinese terms and the corresponding Traditional Chinese ones requires mapping between the two character sets, which is more easily acquired because there are many kinds of software providing such a mapping function.","We do not know of any well-known Japanese-Chinese Kanji mapping tables. To construct one, we adopted the character variant list9","developed by Prof. Koichi Yasuoka and Motoko Yasuoka in the Institute for Research in Humanities, Kyoto University. There are 8,196 character variant pairs collected in the list. Following the equivalent relationship, we grouped characters in the list into many character-variant clusters.

Take the first cluster illustrated above as an example. The character “豊” is Japanese Kanji and “丰” is a Simplified Chinese character, and they both correspond to the Traditional Chinese character “豐”. Nevertheless, “豊” (ritual vessel) and “丰” (elegance) are also legal Traditional Chinese characters that have different meanings from the one of “豐” (prosperous).","In each character-variant cluster, one Traditional Chinese character (if any) is chosen to be the corresponding character.

The frequencies of characters are provided by the Table of Frequencies of Characters in Frequent Words10","(常用語詞調查報告書之字頻總表) published by the Taiwan Ministry of Education in 1998. Again, considering the first cluster in the examples above, the three characters “丰,” “豊,” and “豐” are all Traditional Chinese characters. “豐” is the most frequent one; hence, it is chosen as the corresponding character of this cluster. By doing so, not only do the Japanese Kanji “豊” and the Simplified Chinese character “丰” have a corresponding Traditional Chinese character, but also the infrequent variants “霻” and “靊” can have a frequent corresponding character.","There are many issues in variant mapping. First, the Traditional Chinese set is larger than the BIG5 character set. Relatively infrequent Traditional Chinese characters, such as “靊,” are not seen in the BIG5 set. Since we are looking for the most frequent Traditional Chinese character, this will not become a problem.","Another issue is the time when two variant characters can be regarded as equivalent. As we have mentioned, the character “豊” is equivalent to “豐” only when it is used as Japanese Kanji. Its meaning in Traditional Chinese is a ritual vessel in ancient times (cf. Revised Mandarin Chinese Dictionary11",", 重編國語辭典修訂本), which is completely different from the current meaning of “豐” (prosperous).

For example, the surname “滝沢” (Takizawa) was changed into “瀧澤” and “中曽根” (Nakasone) was changed into “中 曾根”. The newly created surnames were merged into the original Japanese surname table, and they shared the same probabilities with the original Japanese surnames. If at least one Kanji character in a surname did not have a corresponding Traditional Chinese character (e.g. “畑” in the surname “古畑,” Huruhata), no new surname would be created. The first name Kanji table was expanded in a similar way, along with the assignment of the probabilities.","Merging a newly created term into the name probability table makes our system capable of identifying various methods of name writing at the same time. Our system can identify the two equivalent names in the sentence “滝沢聡就是瀧澤聰” (which means, “滝沢聡 then is 瀧 澤聰”). We can see that “滝沢” and “瀧澤” can be found in the Japanese surname table, just as “聡” and “聰” are found in the Japanese first name table. Both “滝沢聡” and “瀧澤聰” are proposed as word candidates that are Japanese names and share the same probability.","Following the same idea, if we further expand the correspondent relationship to the Simplified Chinese character set, it will be possible to understand the sentence “滝沢聡和泷 泽聪都是瀧澤聰” (“滝沢聡 and 泷泽聪 both are 瀧澤聰”), where “滝沢聡” is in Japanese, “滝沢聡” is in Simplified Chinese, and “瀧澤聰” is in Traditional Chinese.

For example, given a Traditional Chinese word, ABC, each character is searched in the character-variant clusters introduced in Section 4.1. Every character variant found in the character-variant clusters is used to enumerate all possible word variants. Supposing that A’, A”, B’, and C’ are variants of the characters A, B, and C, the following word variants will be enumerated: A’BC, AB’C, ABC’, A’B’C, AB’C’, A’BC’, A’B’C’, A”BC, A”B’C, A”BC’, and A”B’C’.","The newly enumerated word shares the same probability as its original form. Instead of merging the word variants and attaining a large dictionary, we assigned each group of the word variants a unique ID and indexed the bigram probability table (for word segmentation) by the group IDs.","Since the mapping between Simplified Chinese characters and Traditional Chinese characters is not one-to-one, there may be identical word variants enumerated from different words. For example, the Simplified Chinese word variants of “白面” (white-faced) vs. “白麵”   102 Chuan-Jie Lin et al. (white noodles) are both “白面,” and the Simplified Chinese word variants “改制” (rule changing) and “改製” (producing in a different model) are the same term “改制,” too.

Conclusion","paragraphs":["In this paper, we propose methods to find word candidates that are Japanese personal names (written in either Japanese Kanji or their equivalent Traditional Chinese characters) or word variants when doing word segmentation. Documents are encoded in UTF-8 so that characters in different languages can appear in the same document. Our word segmentation is based on a bigram probabilistic model, and it integrates the generation rules and probability models for different kinds of special types of words.","When handling Chinese and Japanese personal names, we propose the idea of the name format probability model and discuss how the model can be built. We also propose a method to find corresponding Traditional Chinese characters for Japanese Kanji so that a Japanese name can be detected whenever it is written in a different language. The experimental results show that the name format probability model does improve the performance, and the mappings between Japanese Kanji and Traditional Chinese characters do help to detect Japanese names more successfully.","The size of the Japanese surname list in our system, which contains only 15,702 surnames, is far less than the amount of 140 thousand mentioned in Wikipedia. Nevertheless, once a larger Japanese surname list can be found, it can be easily integrated into our system as long as we assign a small probability to those unseen surnames for smoothing. Furthermore, our knowledge in Japanese name processing is still not sufficient. As a future work, a syllable probabilistic model regarding the pronunciation of a name will be studied. The most important of all is to find a large collection of Japanese names for training.","Using the character variant clusters, Chinese words written in any character variants can be successfully detected as word candidates. Although the set of newly enumerated word variants is large, the computational complexity remains the same if denoting word variants by their group ID and using hash tables to do searching."]},{"title":"Reference","paragraphs":["Chen, H.H., Ding, Y.W., Tsai S.C., & Bian, G.W.
