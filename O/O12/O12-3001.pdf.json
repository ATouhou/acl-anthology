Introduction","paragraphs":["Verb-result compounds (VR1",") are compounds that are comprised of an event (denoted by the first verb, henceforth V1) and the result of the event (denoted by the second verb, henceforth V2).2","For example, da-po 打破 ‘broken from being hit,’ chi-bao 吃飽 ‘full from eating,’ and tu-hei 塗黑 ‘paint something black’ are VRs, where da 打 ‘hit,’ chi 吃 ‘eat,’ and tu  ∗ CKIP, Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan Tel: +886-2-27883799 ext.1502 Fax:+886-2-27881638 E-mail: {yschung; kchen}@iis.sinica.edu.tw 1 For a complete list of the abbreviations used in this paper, please refer to Appendix I. 2 Despite slight variations in terminology, VRs roughly correspond to Smith’s (1994) resultative verb compounds and Li and Thompson’s (1981) Result RVC.   2 You-shan Chung and Keh-Jiann Chen 塗 ‘paint’ lead to the results po 破 ‘broken,’ bao 飽 ‘full,’ and hei 黑 ‘black.’ Due to limited space, two variants of VRs, directional verb compounds and phase/completive compounds (Smith, 1994), will not be discussed in this paper.","The high productivity of VRs in Chinese makes them a worthwhile topic of investigation for NLP. Nevertheless, this verbal construction poses challenges to traditional linguistic theories of the syntax-semantics interface aimed at mapping the meaning of verbal constructions to their surface structure. This is because most generative frameworks hold that mappings between event meaning representations and syntactic structure are governed by constraints imposed by the verb (e.g. theta theory, cf. Crystal 1997 for its definition). These constraints, however, do not always seem to be applicable to VRs. Since a VR contains two verbs, it is often argued that one of them is to be identified as the “head,” which is supposedly responsible for the mapping. Nevertheless, such an assumption encounters difficulties. For one thing, the head is defined as the component that dominates the resulting meaning and syntactic behaviors, but it is controversial which component it is (i.e. V1 or V2) or even if such a component exists at all in Chinese VRs (Huang, 1998; Li, 2009). Among researchers who do not address head identification, some argue that mappings for VRs are not simply constrained by the argument structures of the component verbs (Yin, 2011; Li, 2007; Huang, 2006).","Various explanations have been proposed to accommodate VRs in a larger framework of syntax-semantics interface, including syntactic operations (Mulkeen, 2011; Shen & Lin, 2005), lexical-semantic properties of the components (Yin, 2011; Li, 2007; Huang, 2006), or a split approach to different VRs (Lin, 1998). Syntactic or lexical-semantic, these accounts all appeal either to extensions of certain underlying syntactic operations, such as movement, or to decisions on thematic role mapping. As far as automatic processing is concerned, the former means adjustments to the general parsing rules and the latter requires the incorporation of real-world knowledge.","In particular, not only do non-lexical accounts present technical challenges, but also a growing consensus in linguistic studies is that the meaning and syntactic behaviors of larger linguistic structures can be explained by the syntactic and semantic properties of the composing words. Along this lexical approach, Levin (1993) presented a heavily-cited framework to explain how the meaning and grammar that are encoded by verbs are mapped onto the syntactic arguments. Therefore, we began the analysis of the VR compound, a kind of verbal compound, with a lexical approach.","For the sake of accuracy and simplicity as a linguistic account and for ease of computer processing, our treatment of VRs is lexically-based. Unlike some lexical accounts, however, we avoid postulations of underlying representations. We address two basic syntactic and   Transitivity of a Chinese Verb-Result Compound and 3 Affected Argument of the Result Verb semantic distinctions of VRs by employing information of verbs’ transitivity3","and selectional restrictions encoded in our on-line lexicon. The research questions are how to predict the transitivity of a VR and how to identify V2’s affected argument (i.e., the argument predicated by V2)."]},{"title":"2. The Prediction of Transitivity and V2’s Affected Argument","paragraphs":["Transitivity and selectional restrictions are two of the most basic syntactic and semantic distinctions for verbs. A special characteristic of Chinese VRs is that V2’s affected argument can either be the logical subject (i.e., subject-controlled, henceforth SC) or the logical object (i.e., object-controlled, henceforth OC) of a VR. Such a contrast can be seen in the VRs da-po 打破 ‘broken from hitting’ and du-dong 讀懂 ‘read something and understand it,’ which belong to the OC and SC type, respectively. For example, in Zhangsan da-po-le boli 張三打 破了玻璃 ‘Zhangsan broke the glass,’ the affected argument of po 破 ‘broken’ is boli 玻璃 ‘glass,’ V1’s object, whereas in Zhangsan du-dong-le naben shu 張三讀懂了那本書 ‘Zhangsan (finally) understood the book,’ it is V1’s subject, Zhangsan 張三, that is being predicated of by V2.","Below, we will briefly introduce how two lexical-semantic accounts (Li, 2007, Huang, 2006) and one lexical-syntactic account (Lin, 1998) address transitivity and V2’s affected argument."]},{"title":"2.1 Review of Lexical-semantic and Lexical-syntactic Works on Chinese VRs","paragraphs":["Lexical-semantic accounts like Li (2007) and Huang (2006) argue that event structure (and argument structure) can explain the meaning and syntactic behaviors of VRs through a set of linking rules that map event participants of various thematic roles (e.g., agent, patient, causer, causee) onto sentence positions (e.g., subject, object). Li (1997) Under Li’s framework, transitivity of a VR compound and V2’s affected argument fall out of the options in expressing the causing factor and the affected entity, assigned the thematic roles “causer” and “causee,” respectively; the causee amounts to V2’s affected argument in our terms. The roles are assigned by the external and internal arguments of V1 and of V2 as well  3 A transitive verb is one that has a direct object, although the object does not have to be overt (i.e., occurring in the surface structure), whereas an intransitive verb does not allow a direct object at all (overt or covert). For example, the transitive verb eat has a direct object, although both He ate a sandwich and He ate are possible. In contrast, as an intransitive verb, go usually cannot have a direct object. (cf. http://www.glottopedia.de/index.php/Transitive.)   4 You-shan Chung and Keh-Jiann Chen as by the event structure of the V1+V2 combination.","With the causer and causee, as well as their corresponding arguments (i.e., internal/external/neither), identified, a proposed set of linking rules determine the sentence positions for the two thematic roles to be realized. Below is one of them (Li, 2007: 96).","(1) The causer argument is realized in subject position and the causee argument in object position, when both arguments are overtly expressed by different linguistic expressions.","As can be seen, Li’s reference point is the causer and the causee. Nevertheless, as far as automatic processing is concerned, the causer and causee have to be identified rather than taken as given. So, Li’s rules are not readily applicable for a system that has no access to knowledge of causer and causee.","Besides methodological issues, Li does not explain his criteria for distinguishing between causer and causee, which his linking rules hinge on. As thematic roles, causer and causee should be defined on semantic grounds rather than by sentence positions. Under his analysis, na-bao yifu 那包衣服 ‘the bundle of clothes’ in Na-bao yifu xi-lei-le Zhangsan 那包衣服洗 累了張三 ‘(Zhangsan washed that bundle of clothes) and the clothes got Zhangsan tired’ (Li, 2007: 119) and shu 書 ‘book’ in Zhangsan kan-lei-le shu 張三看累了書 ‘Zhangsan read a book and as a result became tired’ (Li, 2007: 115) differ in thematic roles. According to Li, in the former sentence, the causer is na-bao yifu 那包衣服 whereas in the latter, the causer is Zhangsan 張三. In terms of meaning, however, it appears that, in both sentences, it is Zhangsan 張三 who is the agent engaging in the activities xi 洗 ‘wash’ and kan 看 ‘read,’ from which he becomes tired. So, it is not clear why the causer-causee mappings in these two sentences are not the same. Huang (2006) There are two components in Huang’s framework: event frames and linking rules. The event frames describe the obligatory and optional participants and predicates for transitive and intransitive verbs. These event participants map to certain syntactic categories and sentence positions by default. For example, the subject of a sentence is usually a noun phrase that receives an agent role.","Although Huang’s account can explain mappings between thematic roles and sentence positions, his model needs to identify the transitivity of a VR first in order to determine the relevant event participants so as to discover the thematic roles of the subject and the object. Nevertheless, he does not address how to determine the transitivity of a VR compound.","Meanwhile, the issue of the definitions of causer and causee arises again. In Baozhi kan-hua-le ta de yian 報紙看花了他的眼 ‘The newspaper got his eyes blurred from reading it’ (Huang, 2006: 27), Huang regards baozhi 報紙 ‘newspaper,’ instead of ta 他 ‘he,’ who engages in the action that leads to the result state, as the causer. It is not clear why baozhi 報   Transitivity of a Chinese Verb-Result Compound and 5 Affected Argument of the Result Verb 紙 here, yifu 衣服 in Na-bao yifu xi-lei-le Zhangsan 那包衣服洗累了張三 and shu 書 in Zhangsan kan-lei-le shu 張三看累了書 from Li (2007) differ in thematic roles. These examples suggest lack of a consistent way to identify causer and causee between researchers and within individual researcher’s analyses while such criteria underpin their theories. Lin (1998) Lin (1998) predicts a VR’s transitivity and V2’s affected argument based on V1’s transitivity and whether V2 is predicative of animate or inanimate entities. This approach seems promising for automatic processing since transitivity properties and selectional restrictions can be annotated.","Regarding transitivity, she argues that the transitivity value of a VR is the same as that of V1. Her prediction of the affected argument, however, is nondeterministic, as exemplified in her analysis of transitive V1s paired with intransitive V2s predicative of animated noun phrases, e.g., zhui-lei 追累 ‘chase-tired’ and chi-bao 吃飽 ‘full from eating.’ She argues that, in such cases, the V2 can be predicative of either the subject or the object, or both. For example, she thinks that Zhangsan zhui-lei-le Lisi 張三追累了李四 allows three readings, which are, with descending degrees of acceptability, ‘Zhangsan chased Lisi and Lisi became tired,’ ‘Zhangsan chased Lisi and Zhangsan became tired,’ and ‘Lisi chased Zhangsan and Lisi became tired.’ In contrast, chi-bao 吃飽 can only have an SC reading. Nevertheless, she does not explain the conditions for a reading to be available, or at least preferred.","In sum, regarding theoretical comprehensiveness, Li’s and Huang’s identification of causer and causee seems arbitrary. In terms of automatic processing, their predictions depend on already knowing what automatic processing needs to figure out, whereas Lin’s account does not address disambiguation.","Despite these suggested theoretical and practical inadequacies, many such lexical-semantic accounts have turned from relying solely on argument structure to what argument structure and selectional restrictions (i.e., the semantic restrictions on what arguments can be taken by a verb) cannot explain. Within the lexical tenets, the general consensus is that, besides the argument structures of individual verbs, the VR construction has its own event structure with thematic roles to assign. The roles from the two structures (i.e., argument structure and event structure) conflate to decide the resulting meaning and syntactic behaviors of the VR. Also frequently considered is the variation in the kinds of composing predicates that exist and whether they are optional/obligatory or general/specific in the event structures of VRs4","of different event types, consequently taking semantic and syntactic variations between different verbs and within the same verb into account.  4 Examples of actual representations can be found in Li (2007: 95) and Huang (2006:21).   6 You-shan Chung and Keh-Jiann Chen","When these interactions and variations allow ambiguities, it is suggested that semantic and pragmatic, or real-world knowledge5",", motivations screen or rank the remaining readings. Some researchers, like Li (2009) and Huang (2002), only cite the role of real-world knowledge in determining whether a VR is possible or not but leave the question of whether an acceptable compound can occur in a sentence with certain noun phrases in a certain order or not and, if it can, what the predication relation is to syntactic, semantic, or pragmatic constraints. For example, Li proposes the Animate Subject as Agent or Experiencer Strategy (ASAES) as well as the principle of prototypicality, both of which he considers pragmatic principles. The content of the former has been made clear by its name; the latter states that the entity that carries out the V1-denoted act is less likely to be the V2-affected entity. Both principles are meant to rank the possibility of acceptable readings. Other researchers contend that real-world knowledge remains an element in the reading(s) of a legal VR. Huang (2006) incorporates the role of real-world knowledge in the event frame of VRs, which is the interface where linking rules are applied to map semantic configurations to sentence positions.","The current study suggests an even more central role for real-world knowledge in the interpretation of VRs. So far as we are aware, Huang’s (2006) constructional framework is one of the few accounts that formally represents real-world knowledge, if not the only account. Nevertheless, even he thinks that real-world knowledge is only an optional participant in the event frame. In spite of this, we not only agree with Huang that real-world knowledge remains at play in deciding the reading(s) of a legal VR, but we also have found real-world knowledge to be central to the meaning and syntactic behaviors of VRs throughout its formation and interpretation. We will support this position with examples in Section 3."]},{"title":"2.2 The Model of the Current Study","paragraphs":["We first propose an affecting direction principle to model the transitivity and affected argument of VR compounds. Then, we develop a set of heuristic rules to emulate the principle using only the information of individual transitivity of V1 and V2 and the selectional restrictions of V1 and V2 but not using real-world knowledge. Based on a lexical approach, we encode the semantic and syntactic properties of each word in the lexicon. Transitivity is one of the listed properties, and so are the selectional restrictions. We manually encode such information based on observations of corpus data. For example, da 打 ‘hit’ requires an animate agent and a physical theme. This is shown in (2):    5 Some researchers use the terms “real-world knowledge” and “pragmatic constraints” interchangeably. Li (2007), however, seems to distinguish between them.   Transitivity of a Chinese Verb-Result Compound and 7 Affected Argument of the Result Verb (2) Zhangsan da Lisi 張三打李四 Zhangsan hit Lisi ‘Zhangsan hit Lisi.’","In contrast, the verb po 破 ‘broken’ requires an inanimate theme (PERF=perfective marker): (3) Boli po le 玻璃破了 glass broken-PERF ‘The glass is broken.’","Thus, the lexical entries of da 打 ‘hit’ and po 破 ‘broken’ would be partially represented as (4) below (Vt=transitive verb; Vi=intransitive verb; [+ANI]=animate entity; [+PHY]=physical entity; [-ANI]=inanimate entity): (4) da 打 ‘hit’ Transitivity: Vt Selectional restrictions: [+ANI] agent, [+PHY] theme  po 破 ‘broken’ Transitivity: Vi Selectional restrictions: [-ANI] theme","With the encoded information, when the computer encounters the compound da-po 打破 ‘broken from being hit,’ the rules of our model can predict the VR’s transitivity and V2’s affected argument. Nevertheless, such information cannot always predict the resulting meaning and syntactic behaviors of VRs. We think this is because the fundamental factor that decides a VR’s transitivity and V2’s affected argument is the affecting direction of the compound.","By “affecting direction” we refer to native speakers’ knowledge of the range of entities that can be affected by the state resulting from an action or another state and of whether the VR can take an argument/arguments or other noun phrases or not. For instance, Mandarin Chinese speakers know that the entity affected by of the state denoted by chi-bao 吃飽 ‘full from eating’ is an animate being that eats and that the VR cannot be followed by noun phrases inside or outside of V1’s argument structure. In formal terms, we say that chi-bao 吃飽 ‘full from eating’ is intransitive and SC. Such knowledge is implicit, with linguistic and non-linguistic motivations underlying it. We will discuss the motivations in more detail in Section 3.    8 You-shan Chung and Keh-Jiann Chen The affecting direction principle: Case 1: When V1 is Vt","Vt+R ̆VRt and SC; if the affecting direction of the VR is toward Vt’s subject, e.g., da-ying 打贏 ‘fight and win,’ du-dong 讀懂 ‘read something and understand it’","Vt+R ̆VRt and OC; if the affecting direction of the VR is not toward Vt’s subject, e.g., jiao-hui 教會 ‘teach someone and make him/her understand’ Case 2: When V1 is Vi Vi + Rt ̆VRt and SC, e.g., pao-shu 跑輸 ‘lose in running’","Vi + Ri ̆VRi and SC; if the affecting direction of the VR is toward Vi’s subject, e.g., pao-lei 跑累 ‘tired from running’","Vi + Ri ̆VRt and OC; if the affecting direction of the VR is toward Ri’s subject, e.g., pao-po 跑破 ‘broken from running’","Two points of clarification are in order here. First, there are some cases where the affecting direction seems to allow both an SC and an OC reading. Two of the oft-cited cases are qi-lei 騎累 ‘ride-tired’ and zhui-lei 追累 ‘chase-tired,’ as in Zhangsan qi-lei le ma 張三 騎累了馬 and Zhangsan zhui-lei-le Lisi 張三追累了李四, both allowing either the “Zhangsan is tired” reading or the “horse/Lisi is tired” reading. Such VRs are believed to be ambiguous in the sense that they seem to have two readings in the same sentence. Nevertheless, we consider the two readings of these VRs as being separate lexical entries, i.e., polysemous. This is based on Huang et al.’s (2005) criterion for distinguishing different words from different meanings of a word, which states that senses that cannot co-exist in the same context have to be treated under different lexical entries. Accordingly, while qi-lei 騎累 and zhui-lei 追累 are possible with two readings in the above sentences, the ambiguity can be resolved with a moderate number of contextual clues. (5) 騎累 1 Zhangsan pa qi-lei-le ai-ma, jueding rang ta xiuxi 張三怕騎累了愛馬,決定讓牠休息 Zhangsan fear ride-tired-PERF beloved-horse, decide let it rest ‘Fearing that it might be exhausted from extended rides, Zhangsan decided to let his beloved horse take a break.’"," 騎累 2 Zhangsan qi-lei-le ma, juede haishi kai-che bijiao qingsong 張三騎累了馬,覺得還是開車 比較輕鬆 Zhangsan ride-tired-PERF horse, feel nevertheless drive-car relatively relax ‘Tired from horse-riding, Zhangsan found driving more relaxing.’   Transitivity of a Chinese Verb-Result Compound and 9 Affected Argument of the Result Verb","A remaining question is how to decide which qi-lei 騎累 or zhui-lei 追累 is relevant when the computer encounters such VRs. Indeed, currently, we can only identify them as transitive verbs that are polysemous between an SC and OC reading. Context is required to decide the affected argument of V2.","Second, when the affecting direction of a VR is not toward the Vt’s subject, it is not necessarily toward its object.","In a few cases, it is the adjunct of the Vt that is V2’s affected object. For example, qie 切 ‘cut’ has an agent-denoting subject that is an animate being, e.g., Zhangsan 張三, a patient-denoting object that is the physical object being cut, e.g., rou 肉 ‘meat,’ and an instrument-denoting adjunct that is the tool for cutting, e.g., dao 刀 ’knife.’ For the VR qie-dun 切鈍 ‘blunt from cutting,’ it is the instrument-denoting adjunct instead of the patient-denoting object that is affected by dun 鈍 ‘blunt.’ Nevertheless, although the instrument is not the object of the Vt, the prediction that the VR is OC is still borne out since V2’s affected argument is indeed the object of the VR qie-dun 切鈍 because dao 刀 is the receiver of the action6","described by the compound.","When V1 is Vi, again, the noun phrase that follows the VR is not necessarily V1’s object. Actually, it does not even have to be any possible argument, adjunct, or complement in the verb frame. To show this, we may have to first make clear what is meant by being SC and OC. It may be suggested that the affecting direction of the VR pao-lei 跑累 ‘tired from running’ is not fixed if sentence pairs like Zhangsan pao-lei-le 張三跑累了 ‘Zhangsan ran and as a result got tired’and Zhangsan pao-lei-le liang-tiao tui 張三跑累了兩條腿 ‘Zhangsan ran, and as a result his legs got tired’ are taken into account. In the former sentence, the affecting direction should be toward Zhangsan 張三, but, in the latter sentence, it seems to be either toward Zhangsan 張三 or liang-tiao tui 兩條腿. As a result, the latter sentence seems to have both an SC and an OC reading.","Our view is that both readings belong to the SC type. First, we find liang-tiao tui 兩條腿 ‘legs’ in the sentence to be more like a complement than an object of pao-lei 跑累 ‘tired from running.’ The first reason is that, for a noun phrase to be allowed to follow the VR pao-lei 跑累, it has to specify a body part of the subject, thus functions like a subject complement, as defined in Crystal (1997). Second, it seems that “Zhangsan’s legs being tired” entails “Zhangsan being tired.” To the extent that Zhangsan is also tired, the sentence can be labeled as the SC type.","Sometimes, the NP in question is not V1’s argument but is still the VR’s object. For example, VRs with intransitive V1s like bing-huang 病慌 ‘sick-nervous’ and ji-bing 急病  6 cf. Crystal 1997 for the definition of object as “the receiver of the action.”   10 You-shan Chung and Keh-Jiann Chen ‘worry-sick’ can have OC readings, as in Zhangsan bing-huang-le Lisi 張三病慌了李四 ‘Zhangsan’s illness made Lisi nervous,’ Zhangsan ji- bing-le Lisi 張三急病了李四 ‘Zhangsan got Lisi so worried, who became sick as a result.’ It is difficult to treat 李四 as a participant in the verb frames of bing 病 ‘sick’ and ji 急 ‘worried.’ Another probably more drastic example is ku-zou 哭走 ‘to cause someone to leave by crying.’ Although ku 哭 cannot be subcategorized for objects, the VR obligatorily take objects and is possible with an OC reading only, as in Zhangsan ku-zou-lie Lisi 張三哭走了李四 ‘Zhangsan cried, making Lisi leave.’ Note in passing that, in Section 2, we argued for the treatment of the OC and SC readings of qi-lei 騎累 and zhui-lei 追累 as belonging to different lexical entries. On this account, bing-huang 病慌 and ji-bing 急病 are also regarded as different VRs.","Since VRs cannot be exhaustively listed, the affecting direction also cannot be exhaustively annotated. Thus, it has to be predicted, too. The affecting direction can generally be predicted by the transitivity properties and selectional restrictions of the two component verbs. Transitivity and selectional restrictions are as exemplified in (4) and are annotated in the lexicon. Therefore, rules based on this information are workable. Where the affecting direction cannot be predicted, however, the VR’s transitivity and V2’s affected argument become unpredictable as a result. Nevertheless, the results have seemed to be as predicted most of the time so far, suggesting that the affecting direction is usually predictable."]},{"title":"2.3 The Heuristics","paragraphs":["With the possibility of unpredictability in mind, we are ready to look at the following heuristics for the automatic prediction of transitivity and V2’s affected argument. Case 1: When V1 is Vt","(a) Vt + Rt ̆VRt and SC, e.g., da-ying 打贏 ‘fight and win,’ du-dong 讀懂 ‘read something and understand it’","(b) Vt + Ri ̆VRt and OC; if Vt’s object or adjunct satisfies the selectional restrictions of Ri’s subject, e.g., da-po 打破 ‘broken from hitting,’ qie-dun 切鈍 ‘blunt from cutting’","(c) Vt + RĭVRt and OC; if Vt’s subject and object both satisfy the selectional restrictions of Ri’s subject, e.g., qi-lei1̀ 騎累 1 ‘tired from being ridden,’ zhui-lei1 追累 1 ‘tired from being chased,’ jiao-fan1 教煩 1 ‘vexed from being taught’","(d) Vt + RĭVRt and SC; if Vt’s subject satisfies the selectional restrictions of Ri’s subject, e.g., qi-lei2 騎累 2 ‘tired from engaging in the activity of riding,’ zhui-lei2 追累 2 ‘tired from engaging in the activity of chasing,’ jiao-fan2 教煩 2 ‘vexed from engaging in the activity of teaching’    Transitivity of a Chinese Verb-Result Compound and 11 Affected Argument of the Result Verb The following rules deal with VRs where V1 is an intransitive verb. Case 2: When V1 is Vi (e) Vi + Rt ̆VRt and SC, e.g., pao-shu 跑輸 ‘lose in running’","(f) Vi + Ri ̆VRi and SC; if Vi’s subject satisfies the selectional restrictions of Ri’s subject, e.g., pao-lei 跑累 ‘tired from running’","(g) Vi + Ri ̆VRt and OC; if Vi’s subject does not satisfy the selectional restrictions of Ri’s subject, e.g., pao-po 跑破 ‘broken from running’","Below, we show how the VR’s transitivity and V2’s affected argument might be predicted by matching a component verb’s transitivity and selectional restrictions with the other’s. Again, we already know the transitivity and selectional restrictions of the component verbs before the computer encounters a context that contains a VR construction. This means the judgment of the VR’s characteristics, except for the cases where both (c) and (d) apply, generally does not depend on on-line context, but we will see exceptions in the following sentences (6), (11), (12), and (15) and will address them in Section 3.","The following sentences from Li (2007) represent some of the most frequent VR patterns, where the subjects and objects are default ones that meet the selectional restrictions of the component verbs. In (6)-(12), V1 is a transitive verb. We will describe the transitivity properties before describing the matching of the selectional restrictions. The relevant rule is given at the end. (6) Zhangsan zhui-lei le 張三追累了 Zhangsan chase-tired-PERF ‘Zhangsan chased (someone) and became tired.’ Prediction: zhui 追 is Vt and lei 累 is Ri. Since Zhangsan 張三 can be the subject of lei 累, zhui-lei 追累 is VRi and SC. (Affecting direction, as predicted by (c) and (d), is ambiguous between VRt and OC and VRi and SC; it is disambiguated by the sentential context7",".) (7) Zhangsan ca-liang le boli 張三擦亮了玻璃 Zhangsan wipe-shiny-PERF glass ‘Zhangsan wiped the glass shiny.’ Prediction: ca 擦 is Vt and liang 亮 is Ri. Since Zhangsan 張三 cannot be the subject of liang 亮, and the object of ca 擦 can be the subject of liang 亮, ca-liang 擦亮 is VRt and OC. (Rule (b))  7 As mentioned in Section 2.2, the VR is polysemous between an OC reading (i.e. zhui-lei","1 追累 1) and an SC reading (i.e. zhui-lei2 追累 2). Nevertheless, while the heuristics are not sufficient to decide the relevant reading, the sentential context of (6) requires the SC reading. The case of (15) is similar to (6) except that, in the former, the relevant rule (i.e. rule (f)) fails to recognize ambiguities.   12 You-shan Chung and Keh-Jiann Chen (8) Zhangsan qie-dun-le dao 張三切鈍了刀 Zhangsan cut-blunt-PERF knife ‘Zhangsan cut (something) with the knife, and as a result the knife became blunt.’ Prediction: qie 切 is Vt and dun 鈍 is Ri. Since Zhangsan 張三 cannot be the subject of dun 鈍, and the adjunct of qie 切 can be the subject of dun 鈍, qie-dun 切鈍 is VRt and OC. (Rule (b)) (9) Zhangsan du-dong-le na-shou shi. 張三讀懂了那首詩 Zhangsan read-understand-PERF that-CL poem ‘Zhangsan read and understood that poem.’ Prediction: du 讀 is Vt and dong 懂 is Rt; du-dong 讀懂 is VRt and SC. (Rule (a)) (10) Zhangsan jiao-fan-le Lisi 張三教煩了李四 Zhangsan teach-vexed-PERF Lisi ‘Zhangsan taught Lisi and as a result Lisi felt vexed.’ (教煩 1, OC reading) ‘Zhangsan taught Lisi and as a result Zhangsan felt vexed.’ (教煩 2, SC reading) Prediction: jiao 教 is Vt and 煩 fan is Ri. Since Zhangsan 張三 and Lisi 李四 do not differ in the possibility of being the arguments of the two verbs, jiao-fan 教煩 is predicted to be VRt and either OC (Rule (c)) or SC (Rule (d)). (Context beyond the sentential level is needed for disambiguation.) (11) Zhangsan jiao-hui-le Lisi 張三教會了李四 Zhangsan teach-know-PERF Lisi ‘Zhangsan taught Lisi (something), and as a result Lisi learned it.’ Prediction: jiao 教 is Vt and hui 會 is Rt. Since Zhangsan 張三 and Lisi 李四 do not differ in the possibilities of being the arguments of the two verbs, jiao-hui 教會 is predicted to be VRt and either OC (Rule (c)) or SC (Rule (d)). Nevertheless, as the affecting direction of jiao-hui 教會 is toward the object of V1, jiao-hui 會 is VRt and OC. (The affecting direction is not predicted by rules.) (12) Zhangsan e-bing-le 張三餓病了 Zhangsan hungry-sick-PERF ‘Zhangsan became sick as a result of being hungry.’ Prediction: e 餓 is Vt8","and bing 病 is Ri. Since Zhangsan 張三 can be the subject of bing 病, e-bing 餓病 is predicted to be VRi and SC. (The affecting direction, as predicted by (c) and (d), is ambiguous between a VRt and SC and a VRt and OC reading; it is disambiguated by the sentential context.)  8 We think that there are two polysemous e 餓. Besides the intransitive sense, sentences like Baba guyi e xiaohai 爸爸故意餓小孩 ‘The father deliberately made/makes his children starve’ suggests the existence of a transitive e 餓.   Transitivity of a Chinese Verb-Result Compound and 13 Affected Argument of the Result Verb In sentences (13)-(15), V1 is an intransitive verb: (13) Zhangsan zou-lei-le tui 張三走累了腿 Zhangsan walk-tired-PERF leg ‘Zhang walked until his legs got tired.’ Prediction: zou 走 is Vi and lei 累 is Ri. Since Zhangsan 張三 can be the subject of lei 累, zou-lei 走累 is predicted to be VRi and SC (Rule (f)). (14) Zhangsan ku-ya-le sangzi 張三哭啞了嗓子 Zhangsan cry-hoarse-PERF throat ‘Zhangsan cried his throat hoarse.’ Prediction: ku 哭 is Vi and ya 啞 is Ri. Since Zhangsan 張三 cannot be the subject of ya 啞, ku-ya 哭啞 is VRt and OC. (Rule (g)) (15) Zhangsan bing-huang-le Lisi 張三病慌了李四 Zhangsan sick-nervous-PERF Lisi ‘Zhangsan's being sick got Lisi nervous.’ Prediction: bing 病 is Vi and huang 慌 is Ri. Since Zhangsan 張三 can be the subject of both, bing-huang 病慌 is predicted to be VRi and SC. Nevertheless, the affecting direction of bing-huang 病慌 can be either toward the subject or the object. Therefore, bing-huang 病慌 can be either VRi and SC or VRt and OC. (The affecting direction is not predicted by rules; it is disambiguated by the sentential context.)","The predictions of rules (a)-(g) are borne out most of the time. Sometimes, though, these heuristics cannot account for the affecting direction. We will discuss some such cases."]},{"title":"3. Discussion and the Applicability of the Rules","paragraphs":["Although language processing can benefit from the heuristics, such rules sometimes fail because they are based on lexical information, to which much of the real-world knowledge, which plays an important role in deciding the affecting direction of VRs, is invisible. As opposed to the views of Li (2007) and Huang (2002), we found real-world knowledge to be no less important in the interpretation of a VR than in its possibility of existence because both a VR’s occurrence and its interpretation presume a reasonable cause-effect relationship. Notably, we suggest that the subjectivity involved in such decisions makes it only natural that definite readings are sometimes non-existent. While believing that the affecting direction is largely determined by world knowledge, we also noticed that syntactic constraints regulate how real-world knowledge can be expressed. Recall that jiao-hui 教會 ‘teach someone and make him/her understand’ in (11) is   14 You-shan Chung and Keh-Jiann Chen predicted by (c) and (d) to be either SC or OC, but turns out to be OC only because the affecting direction of the VR is toward the object. It might be asked if one of the verbal components has contributed to the affecting direction of the VR. As far as jiao-hui 教會 is concerned, the following sentences show that the affecting direction is a co-product of V1 and V2. (16) a. Zhangsan jiao-fan-le Lisi 張三教煩了李四 Zhangsan teach-vexed-PERF Lisi ‘Zhangsan taught Lisi and as a result Lisi felt vexed.’ (教煩 1, OC reading) ‘Zhangsan taught Lisi and as a result Zhangsan felt vexed.’ (教煩 2, SC reading) b. Zhangsan jiao-fan-le ying-wen 張三教煩了英文 Zhangsan teach-vexed-PERF English ‘Zhangsan taught English and as a result Zhangsan felt vexed.’ (17) Zhangsan xue-hui-le gangqin 張三學會了鋼琴 Zhangsan learn-know-PERF piano ‘Zhangsan learned to play the piano.’","That jiao-hui 教會 ‘teach someone and make him/her understand’ and jiao-fan 教煩 ‘teach and got (someone) vexed’ differ in the affected arguments indicates that the affecting direction at least is not determined by V1 in all instances. Likewise, a comparison between jiao-hui 教會 and xue-hui 學會 ‘learned something’ shows that the affecting direction of the VR in question is not determined by V2 alone, either. Rather, it appears that real-world knowledge as a result of the composition of V1 and V2 deems it unlikely to teach oneself and make oneself understand, hence the inherent OC typing of jiao-hui 教會.","Li’s principle of prototypicality states that the one who acts usually is not the one that is affected. While he calls it a “pragmatic principle,” we think it is still derived from experience living in the world. To the extent that the principle of prototypicality is derived from real-world knowledge is true, it is still an abstraction that competes with other kinds of real-world knowledge. Consider the following four sentences where our heuristics make nondeterministic (i.e., (18) and (20)) or wrong predictions (i.e., (19) and (21)). (18) Zhangsan zhui-lei le 張三追累了 Zhangsan chase-tired-PERF ‘Zhangsan chased (someone) and became tired.’ Prediction: zhui 追 is Vt and lei 累 is Ri. Since Zhangsan 張三 can be the subject of lei 累, zhui-lei 追累 is VRi and SC. (The affecting direction, as predicted by (c) and (d), is ambiguous between VRt and OC and VRt and SC; it is disambiguated by the sentential context.)   Transitivity of a Chinese Verb-Result Compound and 15 Affected Argument of the Result Verb (19) Zhangsan jiao-hui-le Lisi 張三教會了李四 Zhangsan teach-know-PERF Lisi ‘Zhangsan taught Lisi (something), and as a result Lisi learned it.’ Prediction: jiao 教 is Vt and hui 會 is Rt. Since Zhangsan 張三 and Lisi 李四 do not differ in the possibility of being the arguments of the two verbs, jiao-hui 教會 is predicted to be VRt and either OC (Rule (c)) or SC (Rule (d)). Nevertheless, as the affecting direction of jiao-hui 教會 is toward the object of V1, jiao-hui 會 is VRt and OC. (The affecting direction is not predicted by rules.) (20) Zhangsan e-bing-le 張三餓病了 Zhangsan hungry-sick-PERF ‘Zhangsan became sick as a result of being hungry.’ Prediction: e 餓 is Vt and bing 病 is Ri. Since Zhangsan 張三 can be the subject of bing 病, e-bing 餓病 is predicted to be VRi and SC. (The affecting direction, as predicted by (c) and (d), is ambiguous between a VRt and SC and a VRt and OC reading; it is disambiguated by the sentential context.) (21) Zhangsan bing-huang-le Lisi 張三病慌了李四 Zhangsan sick-nervous-PERF Lisi ‘Zhangsan's being sick got Lisi nervous.’ Prediction: bing 病 is Vi and huang 慌 is Ri. Since Zhangsan 張三 can be the subject of both, bing-huang 病慌 is predicted to be VRi and SC. Nevertheless, the affecting direction of bing-huang 病慌 can be either toward the subject or the object. Therefore, bing-huang 病慌 can be either VRi and SC or VRt and OC. (The affecting direction is not-predicted by rules; it is disambiguated by the sentential context.)","As far as Li’s (2007) two principles for ranking possible readings are concerned, (19)-(22) all satisfy ASAES (Animate Subject as Agent or Experiencer Strategy) because this paper only deals with such VR patterns. The other principle, i.e., prototypicality, makes SC readings less likely. Nevertheless, SC readings are not only preferred but are the only possibility in (19) and (21). Therefore, the knowledge that “the one who acts is unlikely to be the one that is affected” is not only insufficient to rank readings but actually allows impossible readings. That (19) and (21) allow SC readings seems to come from real-world knowledge that verifies the possibility for the one who acts (i.e., Zhangsan 張三) to be the affected one.","A comparison between (21) and (22) suggests that the ultimate difficulty in pinpointing the most possible reading of a VR lies in the fluidity of real-world knowledge. Such fluidity sometimes comes from subjectivity. Take the readings of e-bing 餓病 ‘hungry-sick’ and bing-huang 病慌 ’sick-nervous’ for example. It seems that, for a VR composed of two Vis,   16 You-shan Chung and Keh-Jiann Chen like bing-huang 病慌, to have an OC reading, it must have a causative reading. As for the Vt+Vi combination e-bing 餓病, the OC reading would be ‘someone makes another person starve so that this starving person becomes sick.’ While both assuming a causative interpretation under the OC readings, the two VRs contrast in two ways. First, in e-bing 餓病, both composing verbs take on causative readings, whereas in bing-huang 病慌, only huang 慌 has a causative reading. Second, in the absence of context, the SC reading seems more natural than an OC reading for e-bing 餓病. Nevertheless, if such a bias is present at all, it is not as pronounced in bing-huang 病慌. This is unexpected in structural terms because, while both VRs have V2s that are Vis, the V1 e 餓 in e-bing 餓病 is a transitive verb, which supposedly is more likely to affect an entity other than the one who acts (thus, have an OC reading) than the intransitive V1 bing 病 in bing-huang 病慌 does. We are led to the hypothesis that the contrasts could result from judgment of plausibility based on real-world knowledge: E-bing 餓病 is less natural with a causative reading because people generally do not intentionally make others suffer; it is unusual to starve people. On the other hand, in the case of bing-huang 病慌, bing 病 is involuntary and cannot be put in intentional terms, while it is human to find another person’s suffering disturbing.","As can be seen, the above judgment is a reflection of the perception of the world. Thus, it is expected that the perceived probability of OC and SC readings will be as varied as people’s perception of the world. A definite OC or SC judgment sometimes could be non-existent.","Finally, we will discuss two cases that seem to be consistent with real-world knowledge but are either downright unacceptable or odd. Sentence (22) presents a reading that is a possible real-world scenario but linguistically unacceptable: (22) Zhangsan zhui-lei-le Lisi 張三追累了李四 Zhangsan chase-tired-PERF Lisi ‘Zhangsan chased Lisi and as a result Zhangsan got tired.’","In terms of real-world knowledge, it is possible that Zhangsan chased Lisi and as a result Zhangsan got tired, but such a reading is not as natural as one where Lisi is tired.","Another example is the intransitive-and-SC-only reading of chi-bao 吃飽 ‘full from eating.’ Consider the following sentence: (23) ?Zhangsan chi-bao-le ji 張三吃飽了雞 Zhangsan eat-full-PERF chicken ‘*Zhangsan ate (something) and the chicken became full.’ (OC reading) ‘?Zhangsan ate the chicken and became full.’ (SC reading)","Since both chi 吃 ‘eat’ and bao 飽 ‘full (from eating)’ can take animate subjects, the VR is predicted to be transitive and either SC or OC. Nevertheless, the impossibility of   Transitivity of a Chinese Verb-Result Compound and 17 Affected Argument of the Result Verb becoming full from someone else’s eating rules out the transitive-and-OC reading. As for why the transitive-and-SC reading is also impossible, however, real-world knowledge does not seem to be a factor, as there is nothing unusual about eating something and becoming full as a result.","For now, we have not been able to explain the underlying motivations for every (im)possible reading. Nevertheless, the proposed rules so far have made the correct prediction most of the time in the VRs we encountered."]},{"title":"4. Conclusion","paragraphs":["In the current study, we explain how we predict a VR’s transitivity and identify the argument predicated by the second verb. We propose a set of rules that are motivated by a lexical-semantic analysis. Although these rules have not been tested against a corpus, they are testable and are worth testing. This is because linguistic analyses suggest their theoretical credibility and because these rules have a uniform formalism and are modular in the sense that they use two kinds of formally-represented information, i.e., 1) the transitivity of V1 and V2 and 2) whether the arguments can be the subject and object of the two component verbs or not. If these rules prove to achieve high prediction rates, they can be readily applied."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Chen, K.-J., Huang, S.-L., Shih, Y.-Y., & Chen, Y.-J. (2005).
