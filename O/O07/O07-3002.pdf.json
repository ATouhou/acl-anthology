Introduction","paragraphs":["In the current speech synthesis and recognition systems, some characteristics of spontaneous speech are treated as noise, such as disfluent utterances, repeated sounds, filled pauses, salient breaths and coughs. In corpus collection for speech synthesis and recognition systems, the speaking style of the speakers is always strictly controlled and the speaker is usually required to give a “canonical pronunciation” to decrease the speaking noise as much as possible. However, in recent study, researchers have begun to pay more attention to the non-verbal information in natural speech, especially the paralinguistic and physiological information. They have focused on how to use these types of information to improve the naturalness and expressiveness of emotion and attitude in synthesized speech, so that the speaker ’s intention can be better understood during verbal communication.","In 1989, Cahn compiled a simple feeling editor based on the phonetic characteristics of emotion [Cahn 1990]. Vroomen, Collier and Mozziconacci examined the duration and intonation of emotional speech and proposed that emotions can be expressed accurately by manipulating pitch and duration based on rules. This conclusion showed that, in emotional  * Institute of Linguistics, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, No. 5 Jianguomennei Dajie, Beijing, 100732 China E-mail: Yuanchu8341@gmail.com; liaj@cass.org.cn   18 Chu Yuan and Aijun Li speech, duration and intonation can be employed to observe the speakers ’ attitude [Vroomen et al. 1993]. In 1998, Campbell found that if one compares the same content in different forms, for example, a news item in its read form, its formal spoken or broadcast form, and its informal conversational form, differences are obvious not only in lexis, word-order, chunking, and prominence relations, but also in the mood of the speaker and in the tone of the voice [Campbell 1998].","In 2000, the International Workshop on Speech and Emotion of ISCA (held in Ireland) invited, for the first time, researchers who were devoted to the study of emotion and speech. Before this conference, many researchers had begun to investigate the voice quality, prosodic features, and acoustic features of emotional speech. Alku and Vilkman designed an experiment to illustrate that the phonation types could be separated from each other effectively when the quantification was based on the parameters extracted from the instant of the maximal glottal opening and the minimal peak of the flow derivative [Alku et al. 1996]. Heuft, Portele, and Rauth carried out a more sophisticated test in order to determine the influence of the prosodic parameters in the perception of a speaker's emotional state in three different testing procedures. Their studies proved that the recognition rates were lower than those in the preliminary test, although the differences between the recognition rates of natural vs. synthetic speech were comparable in both tests. The outcome of the saw tooth test showed that the amount of information about the speaker's emotional state transported by F0, energy, and overall duration was rather small. However, the relations between the acoustic, prosodic parameters, and the emotional content of speech could be determined [Heuft et al. 1996]. Iida recorded a corpus of one speaker which included three kinds of emotion: anger, happiness and sadness. When synthesizing emotional speech, they picked up the corresponding emotional segments from the emotion corpus. The emotion speech, synthesized in this way, achieved a correct recognition rate 50% ~80% higher than through previous means [Iida et al. 2000]. Campbell focused on how to express a modal word in spontaneous speech with various emotions and attitudes [Campbell 2004].","Some researchers have also studied the non-verbal information in emotional speech. Trouvain attempted to analyze the terminological variety from a phonetic perspective. He proposed that the overview of various types of laughter indicated that further concepts of description were needed. In a pilot study on a small corpus of spontaneous laughter, the usefulness of the concepts and terms in practice was examined [Trouvain 2003].","In the light of the above overview of emotion speech research, this paper mainly discusses the function of the non-verbal information in natural speech, specifically the common non-verbal information which includes breath, laugh, filled pause, long silence, and cry. The breath segment is taken as an example to observe how the acoustic characteristics are related to prosodic structure, expressive valence, and activation through statistic analysis of   The Breath Segment in Expressive Speech 19 reading and spontaneous speech. The concluded rules are then applied to a perceptual experiment to see how it works."]},{"title":"2.

Breath segment in spontaneous speech","paragraphs":["The breath shown here is not the normal unconscious physiological exhalation or inspiration process but the deliberate breath for expressing a kind of emotion. Therefore, the following breath segment carries the emotional or attitudinal information of the utterance. Moreover, the acoustic features, such as the length and intensity of the breath segment, may be correlated to the emotional state in terms of valence and activation. Further, the small blanks preceding and following the breath segment which are caused by the physiological need of a breath segment may be inserted when the synthesis of emotional speech is conducted.","The breath has two functions: fulfilling the physiological requirement of the intake of air and the expression of emotion or attitude.

Furthermore, the starting and ending points of breath segments in terms of valence and activation degrees are labeled as well.","The authors labeled the emotion characteristics of the breath segments based on two factors: valence and activation. The theoretical foundation of valence is the concept of a separation of positive or negative emotion. The function of activation is the enabled degree of energy which is in contact with the emotion condition. The activation and valence of one breath segment here refer to the activation and valence of the following intonational phrase.","Emotional valence is categorized into three levels: positive (1), neutral (0) and negative (-1). The activation has three categories as well: excited (1), steady (0) and low (0). When both the emotional valence and activation of a certain breath segment are marked as 0, the breath segment is considered to be a neutral physiological segment without carrying any expressive information.","Three boundary levels (break index) 1, 2, 3 are annotated which stand for prosodic word, minor prosodic phrase, and major prosodic phrase (intonational phrase), respectively. The authors intend to examine whether the breath segment occurs in a normal stop or in an unexpected position. The normal stop refers to the breath at a prosodic phrase boundary, and the unexpected or abnormal position is the breath at a prosodic word boundary or within a prosodic word."]},{"title":"3.

The durations of these breath segments are about 0.5 second or longer.","B. Intervals between two breath segments are no longer than 10 seconds, i.e. one sentence group length in text is shorter than 10 seconds.","C. Within one intonational group, the number of the breath segments is uncertain, generally, there are one or two breath segments before longer intonational phrase and the breath duration ranges from 0.1 to 0.3 second.","D. When the activation of breath segment is not 0, the intensity of this breath segment is set to 0.6 -0.7 times of the intensity of following prosodic phrase. When the activation of breath segment is 0, the intensity of this breath segment is 0.5 times of the intensity of the following prosodic phrase.","E.

The physiological breath segments produced by the audiences appear at boundaries 3 (prosodic phrase) or 4 (turn taking). Thus, the data help prove that when the expressiveness is a performed one, the breath distribution is the same as that in neutral speech. However, for spontaneous speech with natural expression (in Table 9), the breath also appears at boundaries 1 and 2.
