EMD based speaker identification (EMD-IR) was originally designed to be applied to a distributed speaker identification system, in which the feature vectors are compressed by vector quantization at a terminal and sent to a server that executes a pattern matching process. In this structure, we had to train speaker models using quantized data, then we utilized a non-parametric speaker model and EMD. From the experimental results on a Japanese speech corpus, EMD-IR showed higher robustness to the quantized data than the conventional GMM technique. Moreover, it achieved higher accuracy than GMM even if the data was not quantized. Hence, we have taken the challenge of CCC Speaker Recognition Evaluation 2006 using EMD-IR. Since the identification tasks defined in the evaluation were on an open-set basis, we introduce a new speaker verification module. Evaluation results show that EMD-IR achieves 99.3 % Identification Correctness Rate in a closed-channel speaker identification task.

Additionally, it is expected that almost all appliances will connect to the Internet in the future. As a result, it will become increasingly popular to control these appliances using mobile and hand-held devices. We believe that a speaker recognition system will be used as a convenient personal identification system in this case.","In order to meet this demand, we have proposed some speaker recognition techniques [Fattah 2006A; Kuroiwa 2006; Fattah 2006B] that have focused on Distributed Speech/Speaker Recognition (DSR) systems [Pearce 2000; Broun 2001; Grassi 2002; Sit 2004; Fukuda 2004; ETSI 2000; ITU 2004]. DSR separates the structural and computational components of recognition into two components - the front-end processing on the terminal and the matching block of the speech/speaker recognition on the server. One advantage of DSR is that it can avoid the negative effects of a speech codec, because the terminal sends the server quantized feature parameters instead of a compressed speech signal. Therefore, DSR can lead to an improvement in recognition performance. DSR is widely deployed in Japanese cellular telephone networks for speech recognition services [KDDI 2006]. On the other hand, in speaker recognition, since a speaker model has to be trained with a small amount of voice registration samples, quantization poses a big problem, especially in the case of using a continuous probability density function, e.g. GMM [Sit 2004; Fukuda 2004].","To solve this problem, we proposed a non-parametric speaker recognition method that does not require previous assumption of any probability distribution function and estimation of statistical parameters such as mean and variance for the speaker model [Kuroiwa 2006]. We represented a speaker model using a histogram of speaker-dependent VQ codebooks (VQ histogram). To calculate the distance between the speaker model and the feature vectors for recognition, we applied the Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD) algorithm. The EMD algorithm has been applied to calculate the distance between two images represented by histograms1","of multidimensional features [Rubner 1997]. In Kuroiwa [2006], we conducted text-independent speaker identification experiments using the Japanese de facto standard speaker recognition corpus and obtained better performance than GMM for quantized data. After that, we extended the algorithm to calculate the distance between a VQ histogram and a data set. From the results, we observed it achieved higher accuracy than the GMM and VQ distortion methods even if the data was not quantized. We believe that the better results were obtained by the proposed method because it considers not only the centroid location, but also the weight.  1 In Rubner [1997], EMD is defined as the distance between two signatures. The signatures are histograms that have different bins, to that effect we use the term “histogram” in this paper.   Speaker Identification Method Using Earth Mover’s Distance for 241 CCC Speaker Recognition Evaluation 2006  EMD can compare the distribution of the speaker model with the distribution of the testing feature vectors as is.","To evaluate the proposed method using a larger database, we have taken the challenge of CCC Speaker Recognition Evaluation 2006 [Zheng 2006] organized by the Chinese Corpus Consortium (CCC) for the 5th International Symposium on Chinese Spoken Language Processing (ISCSLP 2006). In view of the characteristics of the proposed method, we have chosen the text-independent speaker recognition task from the five tasks in CCC Speaker Recognition Evaluation 2006. The method was originally designed for the classic speaker identification problem that does not require a function to reject out-of-set speaker voices. However, since the evaluation data includes out-of-set speaker voices, we introduce a new speaker verification module in this paper. We also introduce a voice activity detector that classifies each frame as either a valid speech frame or a nonvalid frame (background noise or unreliable speech) on a frame-by-frame basis, in order to avoid miss-identification caused by non-speech frame information.","This paper will continue as follows. Section 2 explains the Earth Mover’s Distance and the originally proposed speaker identification method. Some modifications for CCC Speaker Recognition Evaluation 2006 and its evaluation results for the Japanese de facto standard speaker recognition corpus are also described.

Figure 3 shows conceptual images of the speaker identification score calculation in the VQ distortion method and the proposed EMD method. The number written above each circle (centroid) in figure (b) is the weight or amount of data that each centroid can accept. The VQ distortion method does not care about the amount of data assigned to each centroid. This results in the VQ distortion becoming small when many vectors concentrate on a single centroid, which is caused by specific sounds, such as tone-like noises, the sound of breathing, etc. On the other hand, EMD takes into account the amount of data for each centroid. This means that the proposed method can compare the distribution of the speaker model with the distribution of the testing feature vectors.   Speaker Identification Method Using Earth Mover’s Distance for 247 CCC Speaker Recognition Evaluation 2006 ","Through above modification, we can calculate the EMD between the speaker model and the non-quantized testing data. To confirm the performance of this modification, we conducted text-independent speaker identification experiments using the Japanese de facto standard speaker recognition corpus. From the corpus, we used 21 male speakers’ utterances that were recorded in 7 sessions over 19 months. Each speaker spoke ten sentences, each of which had a length of about five seconds.

The 12-dimensional delta MFCC was extracted from the static MFCC to constitute a 25-dimensional feature vector (12 static MFCCs + 12 delta MFCC + delta log-energy). Cepstral Mean Subtraction (CMS) [Atal 1974] was applied on the static MFCC vectors.","For comparison with the proposed method, we also conducted experiments with speaker recognition methods based on GMM [Reynolds 1995; Kuroiwa 2006] and VQ-distortion [Soong 1985; Kuroiwa 2006].","In the experiment, the number of centroids for each speaker’s codebook was set to 256 for both the proposed method and the VQ-distortion based method. The GMM based method used a diagonal covariance with 64 components. These parameter settings obtained the best results [Kuroiwa 2006]. The LBG algorithm was used for training the VQ codebooks, and the Baum-Welch maximum likelihood algorithm was used for training the GMMs. HTK3.3 [Young 2005] was utilized for both of the training sets.","Table 1 shows the experimental results.

This results in an N -best ( N nearest) speaker list being obtained. Then, the N -best speaker list is compared with the provided candidate speaker list. If no common speaker exists between the lists, the testing datum is rejected. On the other hand, if several speakers appear in the common speaker list, then the nearest speaker is chosen.","N is a parameter that controls False Rejection Rate (FRR) and False Acceptance Rate (FAR) in the method.

The channel each speaker used to speak the utterances was the same across enrollment and testing data.
