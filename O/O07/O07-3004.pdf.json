Working with large volumes of high-dimensional acoustic features, the researchers confront the problem of dimensionality reduction. Unlike classical techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), a new approach, named Enhanced Lipschitz Embedding (ELE) is proposed in the paper to discover the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie the emotional speech corpus. ELE adopts geodesic distance to preserve the intrinsic geometry at all scales of speech corpus. Based on geodesic distance estimation, ELE embeds the 64-dimensional acoustic features into a six-dimensional space in which speech data with the same emotional state are generally clustered around one plane and the data distribution feature is beneficial to emotion classification. The compressed testing data is classified into six emotional states (neutral, anger, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise) by a trained linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) system. Considering the perception constancy of humans, ELE is also investigated in terms of its ability to detect the intrinsic geometry of emotional speech corrupted by noise. The performance of the new approach is compared with the methods of feature selection by Sequential Forward Selection (SFS), PCA, LDA, Isomap and Locally Linear Embedding (LLE). Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with other methods, the proposed system gives 9%-26% relative improvement in speaker-independent emotion recognition and 5%-20% improvement in speaker-dependent recognition.

Introduction","paragraphs":["Human-machine interaction technology has been investigated for several decades. Recent research has put more emphasis on enabling computers to recognize human emotions. As the most effective method in human-human and human-machine communication, speech conveys vast emotional information. Accurate emotion recognition from speech signals will benefit the human-machine interaction and will be applied to areas of entertainment, learning, social development, preventive medicine, consumer relations, etc. [Picard 1997].","The general process of emotion recognition from speech signals can be formulated as below: extracting acoustic features such as Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC), Linear Predictive Cepstral Coefficient (LPCC) or low-level features [Ververidis et al. 2004], reducing feature dimensionality to an appropriate range for less computational complexity and recognizing emotions with trained SVM, Hidden Markov Model (HMM), Neural Network (NN) or other classifiers.","Dimensionality reduction methods can be grouped into two categories: Feature Selection (FS) and Feature Extraction (FE). An FS method chooses a subset from the original features, preserving most characteristics of the raw data. Ververidis [Ververidis et al. 2004] used the Sequential Forward Selection (SFS) method to select the five best features for the classification of five emotional states. However, feature selection needs complex computation to evaluate all the features. How to acquire the best feature set is another tough task. An FE method projects the original features to a completely new space with lower dimensionality through linear or nonlinear affine transformation. PCA, LDA and Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) are popular feature extraction techniques. PCA finds a set of the most representative projection vectors such that the projected samples retain the most information about the original samples. Lee [Lee et al. 2002] used PCA to analyze the feature set in classifying two emotions in spoken dialogs. Chuang [Chuang et al. 2004] adopted PCA to select 14 principle components from 33 acoustic features in the analysis of emotional speech. LDA uses the class information and finds a set of vectors that maximize the between-class scatter while minimizing the within-class scatter. MDS computes the low dimensional representation of a high dimensional data set that most faithfully preserves the inner products between different input patterns. LDA and MDS have also been employed to reduce the feature dimensionality for emotion recognition [Go et al. 2003]. Though widely used for their simplicity, PCA, LDA and MDS are limited by their underlying assumption that data lies in a linear subspace. For nonlinear structures, these methods fail to detect the true freedom degrees of the data.    Manifolds Based Emotion Recognition in Speech 51","Recently, a number of research efforts have shown that the speech points possibly reside on a nonlinear submanifold [Jain et al. 2004; Togneri et al. 1992]. The classical ways of projecting speech into low dimensional space by linear methods are not suitable. Some nonlinear techniques have been proposed to discover the nonlinear structure of the manifold, e.g. Isomap [Tenenbaum et al. 2000] and LLE [Roweis et al. 2000]. Isomap is based on computing the low dimensional representation of a high dimensional data set that most faithfully preserves the pairwise distances between input patterns as measured along the submanifold from which they are sampled. The LLE method captures the local geometry of complex embedding manifold by a set of linear coefficients that best approximate each data point from its neighbors in the input space. These nonlinear methods do yield impressive results in some statistical pattern recognition applications [Jain et al. 2004]. However, they yield maps that are defined only on the training data points, so how to evaluate the maps on novel testing data points remains unclear. Lipschitz embedding [Bourgain 1985; Johnson et al. 1984] is another nonlinear dimensionality reduction method which works well when there are multiple clusters in the input data [Chang et al. 2004]. It is suitable for emotion classification whose input data can be grouped into several emotions.","Most previous work on detecting emotional states investigated speech data recorded in a quiet environment [Song et al. 2004; Zeng et al. 2005], but humans are able to perceive emotions even in a noisy background. The nonlinear manifold learning algorithms mentioned above [Tenenbaum et al. 2000; Roweis et al. 2000; Bourgain 1985] try to discover the underlying reason of how humans perceive constancy even though the raw sensory inputs are in flux. Facial images with different poses and lighting directions were also observed to make a smooth manifold [Tenenbaum et al. 2000]. Similarly, speech with different emotions, even corrupted by noise, could also be embedded into a low dimensional nonlinear manifold, although none of the previous work has paid attention to this area.","In this paper, an enhanced Lipschitz embedding system is developed to analyze the intrinsic manifold of both emotional speech recorded in quiet environment and those corrupted by noise. Geodesic distance is expected to reflect the true geometry of the emotional speech manifold. With geodesic distance estimation, ELE is developed to embed the extracted acoustic features into a low dimensional space. Then, a linear SVM is trained to recognize the emotional states of the embedded results. In addition, other dimensionality reduction methods such as PCA, LDA, feature selection by SFS with SVM, Isomap, and LLE are implemented for comparison.","The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives a brief description of the emotional speech recognition system. Section 3 presents the ELE algorithm. Experimental results are provided and discussed in Section 4. Section 5 concludes the paper and discusses future work.   52 Mingyu You et al."]},{"title":"2. System Overview  Figure 1. The Framework of Emotion Recognition from Speech","paragraphs":["Figure 1 displays the overall structure of this system. Clean speech from the database and speech corrupted by generated noise are both investigated in the system. The emotional speech analysis is done in two phases in this system: training and testing. In the training phase, 64-dimensional acoustic features for each training utterance are obtained after feature extraction. Using ELE, a six-dimensional submanifold is then gained to embody the intrinsic geometry of the emotional training data. Finally, a linear SVM is trained by the embedded training data. In the testing phase, the feature extraction method also extracts 64-dimensional acoustic features for the testing data. The high-dimensional features are then projected into the six-dimensional manifold obtained in the training phase. The emotional state of the testing data is recognized by the trained SVM system. There are two feature spaces mentioned in the workflow: the original acoustic feature space, which is a high-dimensional space found before feature embedding and the embedded space, which is a low-dimensional space found after feature projection."]},{"title":"3.

The relative improvement of the proposed method is 9%-26% in the speaker-independent system and 5%-20% when the system is speaker-dependent. While the classification rate of happiness is lower than other emotions in the speaker-independent system, the accuracy of happiness is comparable with the others in the speaker-dependent.

As mentioned before, Isomap and LLE only decide how to project the training data into a low dimensional manifold and leave the projection problem of novel testing data unsettled. However, in the emotion recognition system, all the training data and testing data should be embedded into low dimensional space. In the implementation of Isomap and LLE, the authors reconstruct the distance matrix M when facing the novel test data. Although it costs a lot of computation time, it will help attain Isomap and LLE’s best performance. Comparison with those results gives one a solid evaluation of the proposed method.","Figure 6 and Figure 7 display the recognition accuracy of the six emotions in a speaker-independent and a speaker-dependent environment, respectively. From both figures, the method based on ELE still yields the best results in almost all of the emotional situations. In a speaker-independent environment, the proposed method outperforms the other two in the emotions angry and fear, especially. For the emotional speech recognition application, Isomap is more suitable than LLE. From Figure 6 and Figure 7, one can see that the recognition accuracy of Isomap is higher than LLE in most of the emotion states. Isomap is based on geodesic distance estimation and captures the global data structure when finding the low embeddings, while LLE focuses on preserving the local geometry of data points. ELE is somewhat similar to Isomap, which may explain why Lipschitz embedding and Isomap both outperform LLE in the experimental results. However, Isomap consumes more computation time than ELE. They both need the time-consuming operation of constructing the neighborhood graph, but the embedding step of Isomap is more complex. LLE conducts unbalanced performance when dealing with different basic emotions. For example, in Figure 6(b), LLE only attains 10% accuracy with the emotion fear, while it achieves about 65% with sad. The unbalanced recognition rate will greatly reduce the system ’s robustness. LLE gets a poor recognition rate for the female speaker in the speaker-dependent environment shown in Figure 7(b). Isomap and LLE behave differently between the male and the female in the speaker-dependent environment, but the performance of ELE seems stable. Comparing the results of Figure 6 and Figure 7 with those of Figures 4 and 5, nonlinear methods ’ performance may not be better than the linear methods ’, although they require more complicated computation.

Nonlinear methods, Isomap and LLE, were also implemented. 64-dimensional features were projected into the six-dimensional space in every method. In many other applications, researchers tended to conduct noise reduction first for the noisy speech data. However, traditional noise reduction methods still face several challenges: the method using microphone array cannot avoid the problem of increasing the number of microphones; in the case of the spectral subtraction (SS) method, the musical tones arise from residual noise and processing delays also occur. With these considerations, the authors investigated emotion recognition from noisy speech directly, instead of conducting noise reduction. Since facial images with different poses and lighting directions were observed to make a smooth manifold, speech corrupted by noise may also be embedded into a low dimensional nonlinear manifold.","Figure 8 demonstrates the six methods’ emotion recognition accuracy for clean speech and speech suppressed by Gaussian white noise. Performances with clean speech and speech corrupted by sinusoid noise are shown in Figure 9. Accuracies in both figures are the average recognition ratio of six emotions. From both figures, this system, based on Lipschitz embedding, shows outstanding performance with every SNR test data. Compared with the other methods, the accuracy of this method on Lipschitz embedding is stable both with speech corrupted by Gaussian white noise and with speech corrupted by sinusoid noise. Although there are differences among individuals, ELE is good at discovering the intrinsic geometry of the emotional speech manifold. The accuracy of LDA on clean speech is high, but drops quickly when noise increases. On the other hand, the accuracy of PCA can hardly be corrupted by louder noise, although its overall performance is poor. The Isomap Method also achieves acceptable accuracy in different experimental environments, except for the male speaker in speech corrupted by sinusoid noise. The performance of LLE is still disappointing. Keeping the local geometry by reconstructing from neighbors seems not to be appropriate for emotional speech recognition applications. From these figures, one can see an interesting phenomenon where the recognition accuracy of noisy speech is sometimes higher than that of clean speech.

Although LDA and Isomap also achieved plausible recognition results in the experiments, the proposed method balanced the classification rate in each emotion, which both of them lacked. The time consumption of Isomap was also higher than the proposed method. As another nonlinear method, LLE showed poor performance, meaning that preserving the intrinsic geometry of data corpus was vital. The key idea of the proposed method is to take the multiple classes of input patterns into consideration. Experimental results show that this idea is successful in emotional speech recognition applications.","With the method based on Lipschitz embedding, the average recognition accuracy of the female speaker is 5% lower than that of the male. The underlying reason should be investigated in detail and a robust algorithm is expected. Besides, the essential reason explaining the phenomenon that the accuracy of noisy speech exceeds clean speech should be investigated.
