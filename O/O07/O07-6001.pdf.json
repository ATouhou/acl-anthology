However, due to the special status of Taiwan, few people can read these materials at present. It is regrettable that the utilization of these plentiful materials is very low. This paper addresses problems raised in the Taiwanese Southern-Min tone sandhi system by describing a set of computational rules to approximate this system, as well as the results obtained from its implementation. Using the romanized Taiwanese Southern-Min text as source, we take the sentence as the unit, translate every word into Chinese via an online Taiwanese-Chinese dictionary (OTCD), and obtain the part-of-speech (POS) information from the Chinese Electronic Dictionary (CED) made by the Chinese Knowledge and Information Processing (CKIP) group of Academia Sinica. By using the POS data and tone sandhi rules based on linguistics, we then tag each syllable with its post-sandhi tone marker. Finally, we implement a Taiwanese Southern-Min tone sandhi processing system which takes a romanized sentence as an input and then outputs the tone markers. Our system achieves 97.39% and 88.98% accuracy rates with training and test data, respectively. Finally, we analyze the factors influencing error for the purpose of future improvement.  * Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University E-mail: {d93001, d93005, cykao}@csie.ntu.edu.tw + Phahng Taiwanese Workshop, http://www.phahng.idv.tw E-mail: kiatgak@gmail.com # Independent scholar E-mail: chenchen@umdnj.edu   350 Un-Gian Iunn et al.

Introduction 1.1 Background and Motivation","paragraphs":["Taiwanese is often used in daily life in Taiwan, but written Taiwanese is less common by far. Even so, the history of written Taiwanese stands at well over a century [Tiunn 2001]. At present, there are several dozen if not more than a hundred proposed phonetic and writing systems for Taiwanese [Iunn and Tiunn 1999]. The orthography adopted by this article is Peh-oe-ji (POJ, 白話字, also known as Latinized Taiwanese or Missionary Romanization System for Taiwanese).","Under the auspices of the National Museum of Taiwanese Literature, the Department of Taiwanese Literature of Cheng Kung University carried out a project titled “The Collection and Cataloging of Taiwanese Peh-oe-ji Literature Data” (CCTPLD). Although many texts have already been lost due to the alternation of political status, this project nevertheless revealed nearly 2,000 POJ books and periodicals, with publication sites spread over Taiwan, Xiamen (Amoy), Shanghai, Guangzhou (Canton), Hong Kong, Singapore, the Philippines, London, Japan, and beyond. The amount of publishing peaked in the 1950’s and 60’s [Iunn and Tan-Tenn, unpublished]. The scope covers both formally published books and periodicals as well as non-published items such as personal letters and medical charts. Later on, the government, citing supposedly detrimental effects of POJ on Mandarin promotion, banned its use and thus caused the rapid decline of this practice.","We hope that the extant materials collected by the above-mentioned CCTPLD project can be accessed by more people, as well as contribute to both basic and applied Taiwanese research. As most people nowadays are not familiar with Latinized Taiwanese, use of state-of-the-art text-to-speech technology would enhance the value of these materials to the general public.","Tone sandhi represents a challenging problem to be solved before one can successfully transform the written Taiwanese text to its natural speech-like tonal contour. This is because the written form of Latinized Taiwanese represents the tones as \"basic tones\", the tones of syllables when they are pronounced in isolation. At the level of the word, all syllables except the last one are usually pronounced differently (that is, they manifest tone sandhi). At the level of a whole sentence, in most situations only the last syllables next to the boundary of the phrases or structural markers are read as basic tones, the others being read as sandhi tones. In fact, besides the \"regular tone sandhi\" mentioned above, there are still several other kinds of tone sandhi phenomena which will be discussed in detail later.   Modeling Taiwanese Southern-Min Tone Sandhi Using Rule-Based Methods 351","We will first formulate the sandhi rules, which are the key to correct pronunciation and the core issue of this paper. The input of our experiment mainly consists of the data collected by the CCTPLD project; these data are processed by our sandhi system to produce sandhi-marked final outputs. Due to the lack of tagged data, we adopt the rule-based model, not the statistical model in this experiment. Figure 1 describes the skeleton of our system, and the webpage http://iug.csie.dahan.edu.tw/nmtl/dadwt/ demonstrates the results. Three of the authors who are native Taiwanese speakers evaluated the outputs for their accuracy.            "]},{"title":"Sandhi marking algorithms                 Sound generator program  Figure 1.

For the sake of apprehensibility, we also add the Mandarin and English translations.","Tone sandhi is a very important characteristic of Taiwanese. At the word level, the last syllable is usually pronounced as basic tone and the others as sandhi tones.

Users input Chinese texts, and the system outputs Taiwanese texts with pronunciation. The corpus is news reports in Chinese. They used the word segmentation and tagged data from the CKIP group and the Taiwanese-Chinese dictionary from Robert Cheng to map the Chinese news into Taiwanese (in both Han and Latin scripts). The sandhi rules applied were as follows: a) pronounce the last syllable at the end of a sentence as basic tone; b) pronounce the syllable before the particle ê as basic tone; c) pronounce the last syllable of a noun as basic tone; d) pronounce other syllables as normal sandhi tones. An accuracy rate of 82.53% was reported. However, as the system did not take Taiwanese as input, word order and semantic ambiguities were not taken into account when converting, the translation was not quite native-like.","[Liang et al. 2004] is a recent text-to-speech system for Taiwanese Southern-Min. Its input was a large corpus of Chinese news texts, but sentences longer than 20 syllables were removed. It utilized a dictionary to convert the Chinese text into Taiwanese Southern-Min, followed by word segmentation, phonetic marking, and rule-based sandhi processing to generate speech files. Due to the size of the corpus, only the first 200 sentences generated were evaluated by two Taiwanese-speaking experts. The accuracy rates were 97% for word segmentation, 89% for pronunciation marking, and 65% for rule-based sandhi processing.","Compared with the above systems, our approach has some major differences: a balanced Taiwanese corpus for both literary and non-literary sources (about 50% each) was prepared; no translation from Chinese to Taiwanese; and no limits for length of sentences. In addition, because the text is written in Latinized script, we do not need to manipulate word segmentation and phonetic marking. However, compared to text with Han character script, there is a more rigorous challenge to deal with homonymy, especially with monosyllabic words."]},{"title":"2.

Of the 46 POSs in the Chinese Electronic Dictionary, we adopt the top level and adjust certain POSs known to affect tone sandhi.
