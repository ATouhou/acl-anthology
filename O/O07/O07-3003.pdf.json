Introduction","paragraphs":["Speech can convey not only literal meanings, but also the mood and emotion of a speaker. Some researchers have proven that the contour of the speech fundamental frequency (henceforth F0 contour) plays an important role in expressing the affective information of an utterance. It is concluded that some statistical characteristics of F0 play the most important roles in emotion perception [Tao and Kang 2005]. Especially, F0 contours differ from each  ∗ Department of Automation, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei 230027, China E-mail: zfwang@ustc.edu.cn The author for correspondence is Zengfu Wang.   34 Zhuangluan Su and Zengfu Wang other because of the speaker’s different emotion in Mandarin [Yuan et al. 2002]. Due to significance of F0, the F0 contour modeling is one of the key issues that should be addressed.","The most popular F0 modeling approaches mainly use the concept of separating the F0 contour into a global trend and local variation [Abe and Sato 1992; Bellegarda et al, 2001]. Mandarin is a tonal language including four basic tone types and a so-called ‘light’ tone. The F0 contour is composed of three elements [Zhao 1980]: the tone of the syllable, the variety of tone in continuous utterance, and the movement influenced by mood. How to extract tones and intonations from speech is a difficult problem. Tian and Nurminen have proposed a data-driven tone modeling approach to describe the tonal element [Tian and Nurminen 2004]. In previous work [Su and Wang 2005], the authors of this paper also proposed an affective-tone modeling approach for Mandarin to separate F0 contour into two elements: variational tones based on syllables and intonations for prosody phrases.","In this paper, the authors propose a data-driven intonation modeling approach based on Principal Component Analysis (henceforth, PCA [Fukunaga 2000]). For modeling affective intonations, an affective corpus of Mandarin has been designed and the corresponding intonations are extracted with an iterative algorithm from the original speech. The eigen-intonation concept is proposed based on the principal components of the above intonations obtained from the affective corpus, and all the intonations are then transformed into the sub-space spanned by the eigen-intonations. The distribution of affective intonations corresponding to an emotion in the above sub-space is a help to establish the corresponding affective intonation model. As a result, speech whose intonation is modified according to the model can express the corresponding emotion, even mixed emotions. In addition, the authors will also show emotion perception results using the proposed modeling approach.","The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The speech corpus and some statistic results of F0 based on the database are described first. Then, the algorithm of eigen-intonation extraction is described, and some of the basic properties of the eigen-intonation representation are concluded. Next, how to model the affective intonation is discussed. Last, the performance of the proposed modeling approach is given by experimental results."]},{"title":"2. Speech Corpus and Statistic Results of F0","paragraphs":["Carrying on the affective speech research, a reasonable classification of the emotion is needed first, and then the speech features with different emotions can be analyzed effectively. In emotional psychology, Robert Plutchik proposed a four pair emotional ring constructed of eight pure emotions, including anger, joy, acceptance, surprise, fear, sadness, hatred and expectation. In the affective speech research for Mandarin, four emotions are generally selected, either including anger, joy, fear, sadness [Yuan et al. 2002; Tao and Kang 2005], or including anger, joy, surprise and sadness [Zhao et al. 2004]. In contrast, five emotions are selected for this paper, and   Affective Intonation-Modeling for Mandarin Based on PCA 35 they are anger, joy, surprise, fear and sadness.","What is discussed in this paper is the global variety of the F0 contour, so a reasonable duration of the target needs to be considered. Due to the multi-level structure of prosody [Abney 1995; Li et al. 2000], a complicated sentence with many syllables can be divided into several simple prosody units with fewer syllables at prosody boundaries. So, studying intonation based on prosody units can transform this complicated problem into several simple ones. Moreover, it is known that prosodic phrases can keep a relatively stable intonation pattern. Therefore, the authors model intonation based on prosodic phrases in the paper.","It is known that F0 contour is influenced by several factors, including syntax, stress, speaker’s emotion and his or her individual character. This paper focuses on the movement of intonation caused by emotion, and the influence of other factors such as syntax, stress, and the individual characters will not be considered. Currently, there are no effective methods that can eliminate the influence of these factors from the original speech signals directly, so the corpus used in the paper are obtained in such a way as to avoid these interferential factors’ influence.","To avoid unwanted factors’ influence and to simplify the following processing, the corpus is designed with some limitations. The authors have designed 40 sentences with different literal contents for the following test, and each sentence only consists of three components: subject, verb, and object. Furthermore, the subject, verb, and the object are all designed to be disyllabic words. So, each sentence only has 6 syllables in this case, and all of these sentences have the same syntax. As the length of a prosodic phrase is approximately six syllables [Zhao et al. 2002], each sentence consists of only one prosodic phrase. An example of such a sentence is given by “北京召开奥运”. This design can be advantageous to the following experiments, and the model will be established directly based on one sentence. Each sentence is then performed by a female actor with all six emotions, including fear, sadness, neutral, anger, joy and surprise. In the end, the corpus used for analysis contains 240 total sentences, consisting of 1,440 syllables from a single speaker, with same syntax and the same individual characters. The speech signals are digitized at 16 kHz with 16-bit precision.","To evaluate the representational ability of the corpus, some experiments about the distributions of F0 are performed. Here, the F0 of a speech is extracted by using a modified autocorrelation algorithm. The results are demonstrated in Figure 1.","Figure 1 shows that “surprise”, “happy” and “angry” make a very high F0, while “sad” generates lower value than the neutral state. It can also be found that the varying range of “sad” is smaller than the others. F0 parameters of “fear” make quite similar behaviors as “sad”. “Angry”, “happy”, and “surprise” also behave similarly. All of the results accord with the conclusions given by other researches [Yuan et al. 2002; Zhao et al. 2004; Tao and Kang 2005]. So the speech corpus is representational and effective for the following analysis.   36 Zhuangluan Su and Zengfu Wang  "]},{"title":"3. Concept of Eigen-Intonation","paragraphs":["The affective intonation will be modeled with a concept called “eigen-intonation”. The concept of eigen-intonation is derived through the use of the PCA technique. PCA [Fukunaga 2000] is a multivariate analysis method that carries out a compact description of a data set. In a PCA process, a set of correlated variables is transformed into a set of uncorrelated variables that are ordered by reducing variability, and these new uncorrelated variables are linear combinations of the original variables. It can be concluded that the first new variable contains the greatest amount of variation; the second contains the next greatest residual variance and orthogonal to the first, and so on. Thus, the last of these variables can be removed with a minimal loss of real data.","With the affective corpus in the paper, the speech intonations for sentences should be very similar in all configurations, and they should be able to be described by some “basic intonations”. From the previous description, one knows that one of the main functions of PCA is that it can be used to extract new uncorrelated features from original data. According to these ideas, one can find the “basic intonations” that best account for distribution of speech intonations within the entire intonation space using the principal components analysis. The “basic intonations” are called “eigen-intonations”.","With eigen-intonation, original intonations can be transformed to corresponding representations with lower dimensions. Some rules can also be possibly given out in the low-dimensional space. Moreover, the resultant rules with low dimensions have simpler expression, and it is advantageous to control the rules for the goal of this study. "]},{"title":"Figure 1.

Analysis for Eigen-Intonation","paragraphs":["The concept of eigen-intonation is proposed based on PCA technique.

After that, the F0 contour will be separated into a global variety, which is regarded as intonation, and rapidly-varying components corresponding to local changes based on syllables. The details of intonation extraction are described in the following. The entire intonation extracting algorithm can be divided into five main steps:","1) Estimating initial F0 values based the modified normalized autocorrelation from voiced regions of the original speech. 2) Cubic Hermite interpolating for unvoiced regions and obtaining a continuous F0 curve. 3) Filtering the continuous F0 contour with two serial modified smoothing processes.","4) Applying piecewise three-order polynomial iterative fitting to the entire F0 contour, the n-th iterative processing step is as: (a) Fitting the entire F0 contour with n pieces of cubic polynomial. (b) Calculating the fitting error En.","(c) If En < Et, ending the iterative algorithm and taking n pieces of cubic polynomial fitting as final resultant F0 contour. Else, n = n + 1, go to (a). Where Et is a given threshold of maximal fitting error.","5) The ln(F0) contour is passed through a high-pass filter with a stop frequency at 0.5Hz, and the residual low frequency contour after filtering is denoted as LF contour.","From the authors’ previous work [Su and Wang 2005], The LF contour can be regarded as the F0 global variety of a speech. As all sentences have the same syntax and each sentence consists of only one prosodic phrase in this corpus, the model can be established directly based on one sentence. It is to say that the resultant LF contour of the algorithm for each sentence in the corpus is the modeling target, intonation based prosodic phrase (henceforth intonation). Finally, each intonation is normalized into an N-dimensional vector (N = 100 in the paper).    38 Zhuangluan Su and Zengfu Wang"]},{"title":"4.2 PCA for Intonation","paragraphs":["Let the data set of intonations be I1, I2, ...
