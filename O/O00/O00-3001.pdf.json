Introduction","paragraphs":["Word sense disambiguation is a long-standing problem in natural language understanding. It seems to be very difficult to statistically acquire enough word-based knowledge about a language to build a robust system capable of automatically disambiguating senses in unrestricted text. For such a system to be effective, a large number of balanced materials must be assembled in order to cover many idiosyncratic aspects of the language. There exist three issues in a lexicalized statistical word sense disambiguation (WSD) model: data sparseness, the lack of abstraction, and static learning. First, a word-based model has a plethora of parameters that are difficult to estimate reliably even with a very large corpus. Under-trained models lead to low precision. Second, word-based models lack a degree of abstraction  * Department of Information Management, Ming Chuan University, Shih-lin, Taiwan, R.O.C  Computational Linguistics and Chinese Language Processing Vol. 5, No. 2, August 2000, pp. 1-42 © Computational Linguistics Society of R.O.C.   2 J. N. Chen that is crucial for a broad coverage system. Third, a static WSD model is unlikely to be robust and portable, since it is very difficult to build a single model relevant to a wide variety of unrestricted texts. Several WSD systems have been developed that apply word-based models to a specific or genre domain to disambiguate senses appearing in generally easy context that has a large number of typically salient words. In the case of unrestricted text, however, the context tends to be very diverse and difficult to capture with a lexicalized model; therefore, a corpus-trained system is unlikely to transfer well to a new domain.","Generality and adaptability are, therefore, keys to a robust and portable WSD system. A concept-based model for WSD requires fewer parameters and has an element of generality built in. Conceptual classes make it possible to generalize from word-specific context in order to disambiguate word senses appearing in an unfamiliar context in terms of word recurrences. An adaptive system, armed with an initial lexical and conceptual knowledge base extracted from machine-readable dictionaries (MRD), has two strong advantages over static lexicalized models trained on a corpus. First, the initial knowledge is rich and unbiased enough for a substantial portion of text to be disambiguated correctly. Second, based on the result of initial disambiguation, an adaptation step can then be performed to make the knowledge base more relevant to the task at hand, thus resulting in broader and more precise WSD.","In this paper we explore in some depth the question of whether conceptual knowledge in the MRD is effective enough to provide a general solution for disambiguating contexts of unrestricted texts, such as the Brown and Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpora. Major emphasis has previously been placed on self-adaptation [Chen and Chang 1998a]. This approach is based on the hypothesis that a substantial part of a given text is easy or prototypical and, therefore, susceptible to interpretation based on general knowledge derived from the MRD. By adapting the contextual representation of word senses to those in the easy context, we hope to be better equipped to interpret the other part, which is usually considered a hard context. Adaptation results in gaps in the general knowledge being filled in or domain specific information being added to the initial knowledge base. Either way, adaptation makes the knowledge base more relevant to the text and, therefore, more effective for WSD in a hard context. We will give experimental results showing the effectiveness of this adaptive WSD approach based on initial knowledge base acquired from the MRD. Although our adaptive approach requires virtually no domain-specific training, it nevertheless achieves high precision rates for WSD of unrestricted text rivaling those of static methods that demand very lengthy training using a very large corpus.","Figure 1 lays out the general framework for the adaptive conceptual WSD approach which this research employed. The learning process described here begins with a step involving knowledge acquisition from MRDs. With this acquired knowledge, the input text is read and a trial disambiguation step is carried out. An adaptation step follows which combines the initial knowledge base with knowledge gleaned from the partially disambiguated text. Once the knowledge base is adjusted to suit the text at hand, it is then applied to the text again to finalize the disambiguation result. For instance, the   Adptive 3  initial contextual representation (CR) extracted from the Longman Dictionary of Contempory English [Proctor 1978, LDOCE] for the bank-GEO sense contains both lexical and conceptual information: {land, river, lake, ···} ∪ {GEO, MOTION, ···}. The initial CR is informative enough to disambiguate a passage containing \"a deer near the river bank\" in the input text. The trial disambiguation step produces sense tagging of deer/ANIMAL and bank/GEO, but certain instances of bank are left untagged due to the lack of WSD knowledge. We observe that the bank-GEO sense in the context of vole is unresolved since there is no link between ANIMAL and GEOGRAPHY. Subsequently, the adaptation step adds deer and ANIMAL to the contextual representation for bank-GEO. The adapted CR is now enriched with information capable of disambiguating the instance of bank in the context of vole to produce the final disambiguation result.","The rest of this paper is organized as follows. First of all, we will peresent how easy contexts are interpreted and ambiguous words are labeled in the initial disambiguation step using general knowledge derived from MRD. Next, we describe the adaptation step that uses the sense labels assigned to polysemous words. After that, we will describe the strategy of using the adapted knowledge base and defaults. Next, we will give a detailed account of experiments conducted to assess the effectiveness of the adaptive approach, including the experiment setup, results and evaluation. Following that, we will review the recent WSD literature from the perspective of various types of contextual knowledge and different representation schemes. Finally, we will draw conclusions.                4 J. N. Chen"]},{"title":"Figure 1 General framework for adaptive WSD using MRD. 2.

Chen situations that call for a conceptual generalization of a word-based representation of word sense from an example sentence. For instance, the RIVER sense of bank in Example (1c) can be correctly interpreted by an MRD-based CR, but only when the contextual word river in the CR is generalized to all words related to RIVER, including the word stream:","(1) a. a ribbon of mist along the river bank; b. a small excavation in the river bank; c. the left bank of the stream. There are many possible approaches to making such a generalization and deriving a conceptualized CR (CCR) of word sense. Chen and Chang [1998b] described one such approach based on thesaurus topics. The CCR for each MRD sense can be viewed as relating to words listed under some Longman Lexicon of Contemporary English [McArthur 1992, LLOCE] topics. By linking MRD senses to thesaurus senses and by classifying senses according to linked senses, we can derive the CCR for a sense definition.

That limits the potential for using dictionary examples as knowledge sources for WSD. Gale, Church and Yarowsky [1992b] first pointed out that the strong constraint of one-sense-per-translation can be exploited to tag a bilingual corpus for training a statistical WSD model. Building on their idea, we describe a new method for tagging bilingual sentences, in the MRD or elsewhere, for automatic acquisition of the CR of senses."]},{"title":"2.2.1 Sense Tagging Based on Conceptual Context Representation and Translations","paragraphs":["Now we are ready to propose a heuristic algorithm for tagging bilingual sentences with sense labels. First, the translation morphemes of an MRD definition are added to the CR so that not only the English context, but also the translation (in Chinese for the particular implementation of LDOCE/E-C we will be describing) is considered. For instance, the representation of MONEY-bank contains not only FINANCE words such as money, pay, cash, capital, account, charge, etc., but also the morphemes \"銀\"   Adptive 9  and \"行\" in the translation of the definition. (See Table 4 for some examples of bilingual context representations for the bank senses in LDOCE/E-C.) Subsequently, each CR for a polysemous word is compared with the bilingual sentences. The polysemous word is tagged in favor of the relevant CR that has the most overlap with the bilingual sentences. For instance, consider the case of tagging the instance of bank in Example (2) extracted from LDOCE/E-C:","(2) a. the interest in my bank account accrued over the years; b. 我銀行帳戶的利息逐年有所增加。 Under the assumption of the one-sense-per-translation constraint, the morphemes \"銀\" and \"行\" in the translation are sufficient evidence for tagging the instance of bank as MONEY-bank. Even if such telling evidence is not present, there nevertheless is a great chance that the sentence contains enough words related to a relevant topic for correct sense tagging to happen. For instance, the FINANCE words, such as interest and account, in Example (2) lead to the correct sense label MONEY-bank for this instance of bank, even when it is not translated as \"銀行.\" The contextual representation derived from the MRD definition also acts as a safety net when the one-translation-per-sense constraint does not hold. For instance, based on the one-translation-per-sense constraint, the instance of star in Example (3) can not be labeled as ENTERTAINMENT-star because both the ENTERTAINMENT and HEAVENLY-BODY senses of star are translated as \"星\":","(3) a. she is a star with the theatre company; b. 她是劇團的紅星。","In such an event, the ENTERTAINMENT words, such as theatre and company, nonetheless result in the correct sense label: ENTERTAINMENT-star.","A bilingual example in the MRD, or text in a bilingual corpus, can be tagged in the way described above, word by word and sentence by sentence. Unambiguous words with only one sense label are tagged as such. Tagging is done only for content words within the scope of this work. Function words can be treated similarly [Chang, Hsu and Chen 1996]. Sentences in English tagged as training materials can facilitate acquisition of WSD knowledge.

The term frequency tf is the number of instances of t in WORD(W, S), and idf is the percentage of CRs in which an instance of t appears. The relevancy of a contextual word is estimated using the commonly used scheme: tf ×idf.

Alternatively, such expanded knowledge is referred to as adaptive knowledge. In this section, we will show how to distinguish between senses of text using adaptive disambiguation techniques. First, we will start with disambiguation of polysemous words in easy (trivial) contexts by using the fundamental knowledge previously acquired from MRD.

In these contexts, one will find an abundance of rich task-specific information not easily covered in a general or static knowledge base. We will also justify the use of contextual information and a task-specific default for WSD."]},{"title":"3.2.1 Discovering Task-specific Contextual Information","paragraphs":["There is indeed an abundance of new and useful contextual information for word sense to be gained from typical, easy contexts. Such information can be extracted as long as ambiguity in these typical contexts can be interpreted successfully. For instance, the Brown corpus passage reproduced here as Example (8) is obviously very typical of MONEY-bank with salient words such as accounts, stocks and property in its context. Without a doubt, this instance of MONEY-bank can be resolved successfully using the kind of MRD-based knowledge base described in Section 3.1. Even though the overall context of this instance of MONEY-bank is a general one, it nevertheless contains many words, such as law and state, not in the MRD-based knowledge base. Such words might very well be incidental and have no intrinsic relation with the sense. For instance, the word law might just as likely be associated with RIVER-bank as MONEY-bank. Without much stretching of the imagination, it is possible to think of a likely event where the state of Texas passes a law to declare an outer bank off limits to commercial development. However, more often than not, these unexpected words will indicate real recurring contexts of word sense, either generally or in a task-specific way. Therefore, adapting the knowledge base to fit such a context is beneficial for WSD. For instance, the instances of tree and camping in the context of RIVER-bank in Example (9) seem to be reasonable additions to CR(bank, RIVER) in the sense that tree and camping are, in general, more strongly associated with RIVER-bank than with MONEY-bank. Even if that assertion generally does not hold, adding tree and camping to CR(bank, RIVER) as a way of adapting the knowledge base is still beneficial since it is likely to be valid in the very text where this association is discovered.

That is due mainly to the fact that the process of evaluation is a difficult and expensive one. It is often difficult to pin down the number of senses allowed for a word in the experiment. For the purpose of comparing results with other approaches, we stick to words that have been studied in various experiments reported in the literature on computational linguistics. These words include bank, bass, bow, cone, duty, galley, interest, issue, mole, sentence, slug, star, and taste.   28 J. N. Chen (2) Sense division The sense division for each of these test words was very crucial in the WSD experiment. We used a sense division based on LDOCE's treatment of the nominal senses of these words. The division is somehow more fine-grained than those used in other WSD studies. This level of sense division is very close to the kind of granularity required for machine translation. For most cases, a word sense has a unique Chinese translation. (3) Test corpora We aimed to determine the effectiveness of the proposed approach for unrestricted text and to find out how domain and genre affect WSD. Therefore, we used the Brown corpus and a collection of WSJ articles from October 30 to November 2, 1989 as the test sets. Passages of 100 words centered at an instance of the test words in the two corpora were extracted using a SED program. It is in general not hard to write a regular expression in the SED program to exclude verbal instances, so only a small number of verb cases were extracted. These verbal instances were excluded from the experiment according to the marks made by human judges. For these thirteen words under investigation, we had 846 and 903 passages of nominal senses from the Brown corpus and WSJ test sets, respectively. (4) Judgement To be as subjective as possible, we asked two human judges to assign a sense label to each nominal instance of these thirteen words in the two test sets. There were also cases which fell out of the scope of our sense division. Most of these cases used proper nouns, so they bore none of the meaning represented in our sense division. Cases judged to be verbal uses or proper names were removed from the test cases. For instance, the word bow in a Brown corpus passage, reproduced here as Example (14), was an instance of a proper name and, therefore, was excluded from the test cases.","(14) ...

Despite our belief in the effectiveness of the MRD-derived knowledge base, we also expected that adaptation could improve its effectiveness a bit further. Therefore, we implemented programs for both Algorithms 4 and 5.

First, evidently, the MRD-based knowledge base was reasonably helpful for WSD. The results shown in Tables 14 and 15 indicate that without adaptation, the knowledge extracted from LDOCE and LLOCE could be used to deliver a precision rate of 65.2% for the Brown corpus and 76.6% for the WSJ articles. Second, adaptation indeed helped boost the precision rate by over 5% for the Brown corpus. As for the WSJ test set (see Table 15), adaptation only marginally increased the average precision rate. Closer examination of the results for this test set shows that three words, bank, interest, and issue, dominated the experiment and evaluation results. The precision rate for bank was over 95%, which left adaptation with very little room for improvement. The other two words, interest and issue, were very general and difficult to disambiguate."]},{"title":"5.

For the Brown corpus, Luk [1995] experimented with the same words we used except for the word bank and reported that there were totally 616 instances of these words (slightly less than the 749 instances we found).

First, the proposed disambiguation system is robust and portable, since absolutely no corpus-specific knowledge is needed in the disambiguation procedure. It can be applied readily to test data in a variety of domains and genres with performance rivaling that of methods requiring a substantial training corpus. Second, the proposed approach is considerably more time efficient when compared to other learning strategies. Although the bootstrap approach proposed by Yarowsky [1995] has an element of adaptation to it, his method still requires a long training process to derive a static knowledge base for WSD. The differences between our method and his lie in the initial knowledge, the level of abstraction, and the learning cycle. We propose to exploit rich conceptualized knowledge from MRD at the outset, while the bootstrap method uses merely a couple of word collocations for each sense to start the learning process. Since the bootstrap method aims to derive a word-based conceptual representation with a large parameter space, a very large training corpus is required. The thesaurus used in the proposed approach provides an appropriate level of abstraction and, thus, alleviates the need for a very large corpus. The time required for learning in the two approaches is also quite different. The adaptive approach requires a single round of adaptation for effective WSD, while the bootstrap method needs many rounds of learning.   Adptive 31   "]},{"title":"Table 15.

In this section, we review the recent literature on WSD from the perspectives of different types of contextual knowledge and their representational schemes."]},{"title":"6.1 Lexicalized vs. Conceptual Encoding of Context","paragraphs":["Any kind of scheme for acquiring contextual information of word sense must begin with a way of identifying the word sense since word sense is an abstract concept not clear on the surface. Once this is done, we can use the surrounding words to build a contextual representation of the word sense for WSD. There are three approaches to the chicken-and-egg problem of dividing word senses. First, one can resort to human intervention to get a hand-tagged corpus of word senses. Most early WSD works used this approach and went to the trouble of hand-tagging the intended sense of each polysemous word in the training corpus [Kelly and Stone 1975; Hearst 1991]. Second, one can take the numbered sense entries readily available in a machine-readable dictionary and treat their definitions and examples as contextual information [Lesk 1986; Veronis and Ide 1990; Wilks et al. 1990; Guthrie et al. 1991]. The third way of identifying word sense exploits linguistic constraints. For instance, three linguistic constraints can be exploited for successful sense tagging and WSD. • One sense per discourse The senses of all instances of a polysemous word are highly consistent within any given document. •One sense per collocation Nearby words provide strong and consistent clues to the sense of a target word, conditional on the relative distance, order, and syntactic relationship. •One sense per translation Translations in a bilingual corpus can be used to represent the senses of words. As an example of the first constraint, consider the word suit. The constraint captures the intuition that if the first occurrence of suit is a LAWSUIT sense, then later occurrences in the same discourse are also likely to refer to LAWSUIT [Gale, Church and Yarowsky 1992a]. The second constraint indicates that most works on statistical disambiguation have made the basic assumption that word sense is strongly correlated with certain contextual features, like occurrence of particular words in a window around the ambiguous word. However, Yarowsky [1995] proposed an approach in which strong collocations were identified for WSD. If a bilingual corpus was available, differences in translations of the polysemous word allowed one to delineate the intended sense, particularly in the case of contrasting polysemy. Gale,   34 J. N. Chen Church and Yarowsky [1992b] used French translations in parallel texts to disambiguate some polysemous words in English. For instance, the senses of duty were usually translated as two different French words, droit and devoir, respectively, representing the senses tax and obligation. Thus, a number of tax sense instances of duty could be collected by extracting instances of duty that were translated as droit, and the same could be done for obligation sense instances of duty.","Once word senses are identified in one way or another, the context of a particular word sense can then be acquired and encoded in some way for use in the subsequent disambiguation step. There are at least two ways of encoding contextual knowledge. The obvious way, the lexicalized representation, is a surface scheme that keeps a weighted list of words appearing in the context of a particular sense. On the other hand, the conceptual representation encodes the classes of words that might appear in the context."]},{"title":"6.1.1 Lexicalized Representation of Context","paragraphs":["Dictionary Definitions as Context Lesk [1986] described a word-sense disambiguation technique based on the number of overlaps between words in a dictionary definition and the fixed-size window of words surrounding the target. The author reported WSD performance ranging from 50% to 70% when the method was applied to a sample of ambiguous words. Lesk’s method had failed to determine the correct senses of words when two or more senses of a word had the same number of overlaps with the context. Veronis and Ide [1990] constructed an artificial neural network from sense definitions, representing each word in the definition text as a node in the network. Different senses of each word competed with each other through the mechanism of spreading activation initiated at the nodes of contextual words. White [1988], Guthrie et al. [1991], and Slator [1991] used measures of words in context overlapping with dictionary definitions. One major problem of these earlier approaches was their lack of abstraction. The rich semantic information in the definition, such as the genus term, differentia, and implicit topics, was not exploited to the fullest. Context as Co-occurrence Probabilities Gale, Church and Yarowsky [1992b] indicated that translation in a bilingual corpus could be used to provide tagged material for supervised learning of WSD knowledge. In their experiment, French translations were, in effect, used to represent the senses of some English words under the assumption of one-sense-per-translation. The Bayesian model was used to represent the contextual words in terms of their probabilities of occurrence. They reported a 90% accuracy rate in discriminating between two constrasting senses of six ambiguous nouns in the Canadian Hansards: duty, drug, land, language, position, and sentence. The weaknesses of this approach include the dreaded problem of data sparseness. Even when a very large corpus is available, it is still difficult to guarantee that each word sense will have enough contextual samples to avoid running into the problem of zero frequency, namely, the difficulty of assigning appropriate probabilistic values to words that do not appear in these contextual samples.    Adptive 35  Smoothing Co-occurrence Probabilities Yarowsky [1992] improved on the WSD method proposed by Gale, Church and Yarowsky [1992b] by smoothing the concurrence probability via predefined semantic classification. Basically, that was done by lumping the probabilities related to all the senses in a thesaurus category to smooth the zero frequency cases. For instance, the contextual information of bird and other animals was used to build a contextual representation for all the senses in the animal category in Roget's Thesaurus [1987]. His experiment showed in a close test using Grolier's Encyclopedia that instances of twelve words, bass, bow, cone, duty, galley, interest, issue, mole, sentence, slug, star, and taste, could be disambiguated with an average precision rate of 92%. However, a very large corpus is required to train such a lexicalized contextual model, and clearly this kind of static model has a portability problem."]},{"title":"6.1.2 Conceptual Representation of Context Context as Definition-Based Conceptual Co-occurrence","paragraphs":["Luk [1995] advocated using defining words in the MRD for the contextual representation of word sense. Reminiscent of an earlier work by Wilks et al. [1990], Luk proposed a definition-based concept co-occurrence model (DBCC) for WSD. With the model, the context of each word sense is represented using a vector of LDOCE defining words in the sense definition. The author argued that by using a fixed, relatively small number of concepts, a small corpus could provide enough concept co-occurrence data for statistical sense disambiguation. In a close test, the DBCC model trained on the Brown corpus was found to be capable of disambiguating 60%9","of the instances of the same twelve ambiguous words used in Yarowsky's experiment. Context as Thesaurus Categories Many researchers have exploited the semantic categories in a thesaurus, such as Roget's and LLOCE, or the subject information in a dictionary for context representation and WSD. Walker and Amsler [1986] applied subject codes in LDOCE as semantic representation for WSD. Black [1988] reported an accuracy rate of around 50% when Walker and Amsler's algorithm was applied to a sample of five ambiguous words: interest, point, power, state, and term. Pure conceptual representation is the most economical kind of WSD model since it requires the smallest parameter space and requires no substantial texts for training. Chen et al. [1996] proposed a mixed representational scheme for context based on contextual words as well as LLOCE topics. With a contextual representation acquired from example sentences in LDOCE/E-C, the authors reported that the method could disambiguate around 70% of the instances of thirteen polysemous words in the Brown corpus.   9 The originally reported value, 77%, was based on the average of the precision rates for all twelve words. This form of evaluation is sensitive to the outcome of a handful of test samples since the precision rate of a word with a couple of samples could have an overly strong impact on the average. In this paper, we use the average rate of precision calculated over all instances.   36 J. N.

For instance, the local context of a line from does not suggest the same sense for the word line as a line for does. Trigram as Local Context Brown et al. [1990] used the trigram model as a way of resolving sense ambiguity for lexical selection in statistical machine translation. This model makes the assumption that only the previous two words have any effect on the translation, and thus, the word sense of the next word. The model was used to attack the problem of lexical ambiguity and produced satisfactory results, under some strong assumptions. For instance, the authors showed that the French sentence Je vais prendre la decision could be correctly translated as I will make the decision using this model. Although in isolation, take was more likely than make to translate as prendre, the trigram language reversed the decision in favor of make. A major problem with the trigram model is long distance dependency. For instance, the model incorrectly rendered the French sentence Je vais prendre ma propre decision as I will take my own decision. The language model did not consider make my own decision more probable since prendre and decision did not fall within a window of three words. Lexical Relation Dagan, Itai and Schwall [1991] and Dagan and Itai [1994] made use of translations of different senses from a Hebrew/English bilingual dictionary to disambiguate contexts. Local context in the form of lexical relations was analyzed in a foreign corpus. The basic idea of the algorithm is best explained with an example. Given two Hebrew words hoze and shalom, hoze has two translations in English: contract and treaty, while shalom is often translated into English as peace. Their experiment showed that all instances of peace appear before treaty and none before contract in the corpus of English language. Therefore, the authors concluded that this instance of hoze in the phrase hoze shalom was best translated as treaty. The authors experimented on lexical choice with 105 Hebrew words and 54 German words from news articles. The precision rates achieved ranged from 75% to 92% for coverage rates between 59% and 70%. Approximating Lexical Relation Brown et al. [1991] described a statistical algorithm for partitioning the senses of a word into two groups. The authors used mutual information to find a local contextual feature that most reliably indicated which of the senses of the French ambiguous word was used. For instance, for the verb prendre, the object was a good indicator: prendre une measure translated as to take a measure, and prendre une decision as to make a decision. Therefore, words (any word, first verb or first noun) immediately to the left or right of the word were evaluated for their effectiveness as good indicators for WSD and lexical choice. The authors reported 20% improvement in the performance of a machine translation system (from 37 to 45 sentences correct out of 100) when the words were first disambiguated in this way.   38 J. N. Chen"]},{"title":"7 Conclusions","paragraphs":["We have described an adaptive approach to word sense disambiguation. Under this new learning strategy, a contextual representation for each sense discriminator is first built based on the sense definition and example sentence in MRD and represented as a weighted-vector of concepts represented by word lists in a thesaurus. This knowledge representation acquired through MRD is based on a limited number of concepts; thus, the dreaded problem of data sparseness is avoided. Conceptual knowledge also offers the additional advantages of reduced storage requirements and increased efficiency due to reduced dimensionality. Also, we can correctly identify at least 50% of the word senses in unrestricted texts. In addition, these disambiguated texts can be used to adjust the fundamental knowledge in an adaptive fashion so to improve disambiguation precision. We have demonstrated that this approach can outperform established static approaches based on direct comparison of results obtained for the same words. This level of performance is achieved without lengthy training or the use of a very large training corpus.
