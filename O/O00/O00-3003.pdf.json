Lately, the information in non-English European languages and in Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese (CJKV) is increasing at an incredibly high rate. Both Japanese and Chinese (also, Korean and Vietnamese, to some extent) are ideographic languages that use thousands of ideographic characters (also known as: Han characters, Kanji, Hanzi or Hanja) in writing. Managing the huge number of characters is no longer a problem in processing Japanese and Chinese language information. However, computer processing of these languages is complicated with the absence of word delimitation and the existence of several national and industrial encoding standards. Word delimitation (also called, segmentation) is an extra task to perform to process these languages, because in the written Japanese and Chinese texts, explicit boundaries between words are not available. Due to the existence of several encoding standards, it is also quite common to notice that most Internet search engines provide two different services to search for Chinese information in Traditional Chinese (commonly encoded in BIG-5 code) and the Simplified Chinese (GB code) form. Technically speaking, the tasks of processing and retrieval of traditional and simplified Chinese can be considered the tasks involving two distinct languages. Similarly, JIS, Shift-JIS and EUC, etc. are common Japanese encoding standards. The existence of several encoding standards complicates the information retrieval (IR) tasks for both Japanese and Chinese [24]. In this paper, we will formulate a unified framework to cope with the above-mentioned problems as well as to facilitate effective multilingual information retrieval.","Electronically available multilingual information can be divided into two major categories: (1) alphabetic language information (English-like alphabetic languages) and (2) ideographic language information (Chinese-like ideographic languages). Unicode, an increasingly popular encoding standard, defines uniform codes for almost all characters (both alphabetic and ideographic) of the world languages [43]. The common CJK ideographs section defined under Unicode is a superset of all ideographic Han characters used across the CJKV languages. This offers us an opportunity to represent Japanese and Chinese documents uniformly in Unicode. By doing so, we can also take advantage of Kanji to index and retrieve information across these languages. Nonetheless, the Kanji-derived semantic units or concepts can also be easily associated with the corresponding terms (stem, word or concept, etc.) of the alphabetic languages, and therefore, a universal multilingual IR framework can also be achieved.","The ubiquity of the Internet, the proliferation of electronic information and the emergence of globalization offer us the challenge of engineering sophisticated techniques to process multilingual and heterogeneous information efficiently. Therefore, in the recent years, the IR community put an exclusive focus on Cross-language Information Retrieval (CLIR) to address this new challenge [33]. CLIR investigates information indexing and retrieval issues across the languages. CLIR is a special case of Monolingual Information Retrieval (MLIR), and addresses the retrieval issues where queries and documents are given in different languages. If either the query or the document collection can be   An Interlingua Approach 61  effectively translated into the target language, the CLIR problems can be reduced to MLIR problems. The commonly used techniques for CLIR include three different approaches: (1) query translation, (2) document translation, and (3) combination of both query and document translation. However, given the fact that the quality of machine translation (MT) is still well below the desired level, CLIR often takes advantage of multilingual dictionaries, thesauri or word or sentence -aligned parallel corpora to circumvent MT. Also, there are CLIR approaches, which tend to bypass MT by making use of multilingual conceptual ontology [8] or multilingual term association [36]. Successful CLIR systems for European languages (English, French, Spanish and German, etc.) are demonstrated using conceptual mapping and term association techniques. In this paper, we investigate mono- and cross- language IR for Japanese and Chinese using Kanji mapping and semantic association of Kanji-derived concepts – a Kanji-based Interlingua CLIR for these ideographic languages.","Precisely speaking, we focus on the semantic information captured in Kanji and attempt to engineer the Kanji for effective mono- and cross- language information retrieval for Japanese and Chinese information. Unlike the characters (letters) of the non-ideographic languages (e.g., English, Arabic or Sanskrit), a single Kanji is capable of capturing significant semantic information within itself. However, single Kanji is ambiguous, and therefore, we attempted to index the Kanji through their explicit and implicit semantic contents. Despite our focus on these ideographic Asian languages, we have also included a discussion towards developing an Interlingua model of multilingual information processing, which is capable of handling other (non-ideographic) languages.","The organization of this paper is as follows. We briefly discuss the special issues of Japanese and Chinese information retrieval (IR) in Section 2. We include a detailed literature review of Japanese and Chinese IR in Section 3. In Section 4, we discuss several encoding standards of Japanese and Chinese texts, and their relationships with the Unicode. Our Kanji oriented retrieval experiments include four different indexing approaches: (1) single Kanji indexing, (2) single Kanji with Kanji bi-gram indexing, (3) single Kanji with correlated Kanji pair indexing (i.e., indexing the Kanji pairs that have high co-occurrence tendencies), and (4) Kanji based semantic indexing (i.e., by extracting latent Kanji concepts after applying the dimensionality reduction techniques). In Section 5, we introduce the vector space IR model in terms of Kanji vectors and Kanji-document matrix. The detail mathematical formalism of Kanji Co-occurrence Tendency (KCT) and Kanji Semantic Indexing (KSI) are outlined in Section 6. Finally, we discuss our mono- and cross- language IR experiments in Section 7, followed by a discussion and analysis in section 8. Throughout the entire article, whenever appropriate, we draw analogical comparisons between our approach and those of others to justify the formalism and the benefit of the proposed Interlingua model for multilingual information indexing and retrieval.","Readers who are familiar with the Japanese and Chinese language processing and vector space IR techniques, may skim through the introductory sections (Section 2, 3 and 4) and focus more on the later sections of this paper.

The indexing and retrieval usually involve with the four major steps: (1) segmentation: to locate word boundaries, (2) morphological analysis: to find the word-stems, (3) representation and indexing of the stems: e.g., to use inverted file or other data-structures to represent the document collection, and (4) query-document similarity measurement: to associate documents with queries using cosine or other similarity measures. The first two steps, segmentation and morphological analysis, are computationally expensive complex tasks, and these preprocessing steps result in a loss of syntactical cues from the documents and the queries. Given also the fact that vector space representation of documents and queries is a flat representation (known as a “bag of words”), which ignores contextual information of the original documents and the queries [37], it makes sense to represent the documents and queries only in terms of Kanji. We will investigate several ways of indexing Kanji (sometimes associated with further processing, such as Kanji mapping and correlation, etc.) straightforwardly to bypass computationally intensive segmentation and morphological analysis. It can be noted that, for Japanese-Chinese CLIR, such an approach can bring us an added advantage because the query or the document translation steps can be easily circumvented with Kanji association.       An Interlingua Approach 63  "]},{"title":"Figure 1 A Japanese text fragment with four different scripts and its maximum likelihood mapping to corresponding Kanji","paragraphs":["Japanese texts are usually written using four different scripts: Kanji, Katakana, Hiragana and Roman alphabet [39]. The following example of a short Japanese text fragment (in Figure 1) shows the combination of all four scripts. In running Japanese texts, however, Kanji is more dominating than any other scripts. In writing, ideographic Kanji can be replaced with its Hiragana spelling. However, the Hiragana spellings are ambiguous. Kanji expresses the semantic more obviously than its Hiragana spelling; and probably because of this reason, despite a long ongoing debate on replacing Kanji completely with the Hiragana, Kanji still remains a major component in Japanese writing. Katakana is mostly used to transliterate loan words (except those borrowed from Chinese). However, the phonetic scarcity of Japanese, made the Katakana transliteration quite ambiguous. For example, the Katakana string, コード may represent different English words: code, cord and chord, etc. Moreover, Katakana transliteration is often inconsistent; the English word, “digital” can be written as デジタル or ディジタル, for instance. Most Katakana strings are content bearing terms and therefore, in Japanese IR, special care has always been taken to efficiently process the Katakana strings. In the ordinary Japanese-English dictionaries, a Katakana","Script-wise Representation Kanji 保存, 日本語 Katakana コード, テキスト Hiragana: で, した, の Roman: JIS  Katakana vs. their Kanji Definition Katakana Corresponding Kanji definition コード: 符号, 記号 (情報を表現する),","弦楽器の弦, 電気器具や電灯線 テキスト: 本文, 文書, 原文, 原典 Original Japanese Text Fragment: JIS コードで保存した日本語のテキスト Segmented and Annotated Representation: JIS /コード(code)/で(PREP)/保存した(saved)/日本語(Japanese)/の(PREP)/テキスト(text) Equivalent English Text Fragment: Japanese text saved in JIS code A Semantically Equivalent Kanji-based Representation:  {JIS 符号保存日本語本文}    64 Md. M. Hasan et al. entry appears with its original foreign word and a Japanese definition (often using Kanji). For example, the Katakana string, テキスト is defined with the relevant Kanji strings 文書, 原文, 原典 or 本文 as well as the English word, “text”. In our Kanji based IR approach, we propose mapping the Katakana strings onto the relevant Kanji with the help of dictionary definitions. Hiragana strings are mostly shorter functional words or inflectional components. Short Hiragana strings usually play syntactical and morphological roles, and are usually ignored. However, continuous and long strings of Hiragana are potentially a replacement1","for a rare and complicated Kanji (or a Kanji string), which, to some extent of accuracy, can also be replaced with the relevant Kanji. The Roman alphabet is usually mapped to the respective ASCII characters and indexed accordingly. For an effective Kanji-based information retrieval, we need to preprocess the Japanese documents and queries and represent them in terms of equivalent Kanji. Although sophisticated algorithms can be developed for Hiragana to Kanji and Katakana to Kanji mapping, we, for simplicity, use maximum likelihood based mapping strategy in this research. In Figure 1, we explain a Kanji based representation of the example text fragment using corresponding Kanji (the acronym, JIS, stands for the Japanese Industrial Standard).","It is worthy to note here that the complexity and the computational costs of such preprocessing are lesser than those of full segmentation and morphological analysis. Another justification for processing Japanese IR in this way is the usability of such indexing for CLIR without machine translation. Nonetheless, mapping a Katakana string to its original language is another feasible option for multilingual IR.","Although a single Kanji captures significant semantic information within itself, such information is highly ambiguous. Therefore, we also derived useful indexing information, such as, Kanji n-grams2",", correlated Kanji pairs and principal components, automatically from the initial Kanji based representation for effective indexing and retrieval."]},{"title":"2.2* Chinese IR","paragraphs":["In comparison to Japanese IR, Chinese information retrieval is more straightforward because Chinese texts are mostly written homogeneously using only Kanji. However, like Japanese, Chinese text is also written without explicit word delimiters and therefore, segmentation must be performed to extract words from the string of Kanji for word or phrase level indexing. Since Chinese is a non-inflectional language, morphological analysis is not important. There are three major approaches to indexing Chinese text: (1) single Kanji indexing, (2) Kanji n-gram indexing, and (3) word or phrase level indexing (after segmentation). However, most practical systems incorporate more than one of the above indexing schemes   1 In Japanese, materials written for the young people often include Hiragana strings to substitute rare Kanji. 2 In this paper, we use the term, n-gram to refer to (n >1) cases. When n =1, we use the term, single character indexing.   An Interlingua Approach 65  for effective retrieval [32]. There are also reports on Chinese conceptual IR using a conceptual or semantic hierarchy [5].","The above discussion provides a fairly straightforward view of Chinese IR. However, due to the existence of several incompatible encoding standards, especially the Traditional (Big-5) and Simplified (GB) Chinese character encoding, Chinese IR is suffering a serious drawback. Moreover, from a technical standpoint, the Traditional Chinese IR and the Simplified Chinese IR can be viewed as two individual monolingual IR problems. This argument is further supported with the fact that most Internet search engines process information for simplified and traditional Chinese separately and offer two individual search interfaces for information retrieval in the specific encoding. We will discuss the coding related matters in Section 4 again after reviewing the CJK information retrieval literatures in the following section."]},{"title":"3*. A Collective Review of CJK Information Retrieval Related Work","paragraphs":["In this section, we will present a brief review of CJK information retrieval. Although we will not report any experimental results on Korean IR in this paper, we have included a few Korean references in the appropriate contexts."]},{"title":"3.1* CJK Mono- and Cross- Language IR","paragraphs":["Several approaches are investigated in CJK text indexing to address monolingual information retrieval (MLIR) - for example, (1) indexing words or phrases after segmentation and morphological analysis, (2) indexing n-gram ideographic characters, and (3) indexing single ideographic characters. From the potentially un-delimited sequence of characters, words must be extracted first. For word and phrase level indexing of the inflectional ideographic languages (e.g., Japanese and Korean), morphological analysis must also be performed. Sentences are segmented into words with the help of a dictionary using heuristic rules or machine learning techniques. Morphological analysis also needs intensive linguistic knowledge and computer processing. Segmentation and morphological analysis are complex tasks, and the accuracies of automatic segmentation and morphological analysis considerably vary across different domains. For the heterogeneous information sources, like the Internet, the accuracy of segmentation and morphological analysis perform more poorly than that of a particular domain. The computationally expensive word-based indexing of CJK texts, however, can contribute to better retrieval results when compared to the n-gram counterpart. Words and phrases are less ambiguous indexing units than the n-grams or the correlated n-grams, and therefore, can boost retrieval performance. Segmentation and morphological analysis related issues of Chinese, Japanese and Korean are intensively addressed elsewhere [40, 26, 18].","The n-gram (n >1) character-based indexing is computationally expensive as well. The number of indexing terms (n-grams) increases dramatically as n increases. Moreover, not all the n-grams are semantically meaningful words; therefore, smoothing and filtering heuristics must be employed to extract   66 Md. M. Hasan et al. lexically meaningful n-grams for effective retrieval of information. See [29, 30, 31, 4, 13, 19] for details. For European language CLIR, exciting experimental results are reported in [16] using n-gram character associations across English and French.","For Japanese and Chinese IR, indexing single character (Kanji) is straightforward and less demanding in terms of both space and time than those of n-gram or other indexing schemes. From a CLIR point of view, for single Kanji indexing, there is no need to (1) maintain a multilingual dictionary or thesaurus of words, (2) to extract words and morphemes, and (3) to employ machine learning and smoothing to prune trivial n-grams or to resolve ambiguity in word segmentation [21, 34, 22]. Moreover, for such a single Kanji based approach, there is no translation overhead for both queries and documents. This approach also eliminates some of the typical CLIR related problems discussed in [14].","Comparison of experimental results in monolingual IR using single character indexing, n-gram character indexing and (segmented) word indexing in Chinese information retrieval is reported in [19, 30, 31, 21]. For MLIR, n-gram and word -based approaches outperformed the single character based approach, at the cost of the extra time and space. Similar comparisons and conclusions for Japanese and Korean MLIR are made in [13] and [22], respectively.","Unlike MLIR, in cross-language information retrieval, a great deal of effort is allocated in maintaining the multilingual dictionary and thesaurus, and translating the queries and documents, and so on. In the CINDOR (Conceptual INterlingua DOcument Retrieval) search from TextWise, LLC [8] uses a multilingual conceptual Interlingua approach for multilingual (English, French, Spanish and other European languages) information retrieval. Chen et al. [5] investigated conceptual CLIR of Chinese and English by mapping the WordNet Synsets to the concept hierarchy of a Chinese thesaurus. There are other approaches to CLIR where techniques like latent semantic indexing (LSI) are used to automatically establish associations between queries and documents independent of language differences [36]. Character tri-gram -based CLIR results [16] are also reported for English and French, which share a similar vocabulary. CLIR using Kanji association is also explored for ideographic languages like Japanese and Chinese [15]. However, no experiments have ever been conducted with a combination of ideographic and alphabetic languages through vocabulary association. This situation probably exists because of our practice of considering alphabetic and ideographic languages from different point of view. Such a practice should not be continued to foster truly multilingual information access and retrieval.","The authors sadly noticed that most of the CLIR research in recent years is focused on European languages. After the opening of the CLIR track in the TREC-6 conference [42], several reports have been published on cross-language information retrieval in European languages, and sometimes, European languages along with one of the Asian languages (e.g., Chinese-English, Japanese-English, etc.). TREC has not yet initiated any CLIR track that focuses on the Asian languages exclusively. In 1999, Pergamon published a special issue of the journal, Information Processing and Management focusing on Information Retrieval with Asian Languages [32]. Among the eight papers included in that special issue, only one   An Interlingua Approach 67  paper [19] addressed CLIR on multiple Asian language information retrieval (English, Japanese and Korean CLIR) using multilingual dictionaries and machine translation techniques (to translate both queries and documents within these languages). The recent initiative from the Asian Multimedia Forum (AMF) brought together three research institutes, NTT (Japan), KAIST (Korea) and KRDL (Singapore) to collaborate on CLIR research for CJK languages. However, their main focus is on using machine translation techniques for query and document translation, and thereby, integration of CJK information on the Internet to facilitate CLIR [2]. The series of conferences held in the name of IRAL (Information Retrieval with Asian Languages) addresses CLIR mostly in the traditional framework of query and document translation. For IRAL participants, the choice of languages still remains English and one of the Asian languages. We will investigate an Interlingua framework for Japanese-Chinese CLIR, which can easily be extendable to cover other languages."]},{"title":"3.2* Important Facts about Japanese and Chinese","paragraphs":["Tan and Nagao [41] used Kanji correlation to align Japanese-Chinese parallel texts. According to them, the occurrence of common Kanji (in Japanese and Chinese language texts) sometimes is so prevalent that even a monolingual reader could perform a partial alignment of the bilingual texts. This fact can be further verified with the example in Figure 2. The common and visually similar Kanji appeared in news articles written in Chinese and Japanese provides enough cues to correlate the two reports (both describing a political crisis in the Korean Peninsula).","We would like to mention here that the named entities play an important role in IR and there is an intensive research focus on named entity extraction -related research. Not only is the extraction of named entities important, but the IR community must also work towards universal (Interlingual) representation and indexing of named entities for effective multilingual IR.","It should be noted that the pronunciations of the Kanji vary significantly across the CJK languages, but the visual appearances of the Kanji in written texts (across CJK language) have a certain level of similarity. The Unicode Kanji Information Dictionary [38] provides cross-references among all the unified CJK ideographs (encoded by the Unicode Consortium) across the CJK languages including the cross-reference between simplified and traditional forms of a Chinese character. As explained above, we may conclude that effective cross-language information retrieval by indexing and associating the non-trivial Kanji semantics holds promises. We can also bypass complicated segmentation or morphological analysis process using such an approach. At the same time, multilingual dictionaries and thesauri maintenance, as well as query and documents translations can also be avoided. In Section 7, we will report such experimental results.   68 Md.

Japanese and Chinese Encoding Standards vs. the Unicode","paragraphs":["Character encoding schemes of Japanese and Chinese have several variations: for example, Chinese encoding standards include two major standards- GB and BIG-5; and Japanese encoding standards include JIS, Shift-JIS and EUC, etc. A typical Internet search engine usually asks users to specify not only the language but also the encoding scheme (e.g., simplified (GB) or traditional Chinese (BIG-5)) while searching for information on the same language. For comprehensive details on different encoding standards, readers are referred to [24]. The number of Kanji encoded under a particular encoding scheme of a particular language also varies. Due to the huge difference in the number of Kanji encoded in simplified Chinese (GB) and in traditional Chinese (BIG-5), the retrieval of simplified and traditional Chinese are currently being processed as if they were two different languages. However, the problem with Japanese IR (due to the existence of different encoding standards) is not as severe as that of Chinese.

A critical analysis of Unicode and a proposal of Multicode can be found in [27]. The Unicode standard avoids duplicate encoding of the same character; for example, the character ‘a’ is encoded only once although it is included in the alphabets of several western languages. However, for ideographic characters, such efforts failed to a certain extent due to the variation of typeface used under different situations and cultural settings. The ideographic characters in Figure 3, although they represent the same word (sword in English), are given six unique codes under the Unicode encoding scheme to satisfy the round-trip criteria3",", that is, to allow round-trip conversion between the source standard (in this case, JIS, which assigns 6 distinct codes) and the Unicode.

Such tasks are less painstaking than the maintenance of multilingual dictionaries and thesauri of words and concepts. New lexical and ontological references, like the Unicode Kanji Information Dictionary [38] provides substantial co-reference information to assist such tasks. In our experiment, we use a table-lookup mapping approach to locate and associate the semantically related (but visually dissimilar) ideographs within and across CJK languages as a pre-processing task. Nonetheless, we are aware that there are cases where the same Kanji represents totally different concepts across the two languages in question.

Single Kanji indexing is the simplest among all types of indexing. Indexing Kanji n-grams (specially, bi-grams) is another possible alternative. Other correlation measures [10], used for calculating word co-occurrence of a language, are equally applicable to calculate Kanji correlation. We compute term frequencies (tf) and inverse document frequencies (idf) for single Kanji and Kanji bi-grams for indexing. We only consider bi-grams with medium frequency and exclude the most frequent and rare bi-grams based on empirically decided cut-offs. We also identify the correlated Kanji pairs based on the co-occurrence tendency measured using mutual information (c.f., Section 6.1). We only compute tf and idf of highly correlated Kanji pairs (decided by their mutual information measure) for indexing.","In the vector space IR model, a term-document matrix is computed from a collection of documents. Each column of the term-document matrix represents a document, and each row represents a term (e.g., a word, a phrase, a Kanji or a Kanji string). Each element of the matrix represents the weight of a term. For the simplest case, weights can be binary values, representing the presence or absence of a particular term in the document. The frequency of a term in a particular document normalized with the same term’s inverse frequency with respect to the entire collection (generically known as, tf.idf) is also often used [37] as weights. A Kanji-document matrix is similar to a term-document matrix when we consider Kanji (one or more) as terms. We compute three different Kanji-document matrices using the tf.idf weighting scheme in three different ways: single Kanji (KA for short), single Kanji with the Kanji Bi-grams (KB), and single Kanji with the correlated Kanji pairs (KC). These matrices are essentially the Kanji Space Representations of our document collection. Each column vector of the Kanji-document matrix is the Kanji Vector Representation of a particular document.

Although theoretically, we can compute three different KCSs from the three Kanji-document matrices, we will restrict us in computing only one KCS from the single Kanji based Kanji-document matrix (using the log-entropy weighting scheme). This restriction is due to the constrain that with a small collection of documents, if we include the Kanji bi-grams or the Kanji correlated pairs as terms, the total number of terms (including single Kanji) exceeds the total number of documents in the collection. This situation violates the assumption behind SVD as explained in Section 6.2. Moreover, using SVD to reduce the   72 Md. M.

Similarly, with a collection of properly aligned Japanese and Chinese parallel documents, it is possible to compute a reduced rank Kanji-document matrix on the unified Kanji space, where each column represents an aligned pair of bilingual documents (in terms of all the Kanji that appeared in the Japanese documents and in its corresponding Chinese document). A moderate size of such  5 Wilcoxon tests can measure whether the difference in retrieval results between two experiments is significant [17].   An Interlingua Approach 73  a parallel corpus can capture the bilingual Kanji Conceptual Space across the two languages. Decomposing this bilingual Kanji-document matrix into a conceptual space theoretically enables us to compute an Interlingual Kanji Conceptual Space. Both mono- and cross- language information retrieval can be efficiently performed on this unified KCS. We discussed the mathematical formalism of such an approach in Section 6.2.","Since we did not find any suitable parallel corpora of Japanese and Chinese documents, we used a commercial MT system to translate the Japanese document collection into Chinese, and the Chinese collection into Japanese. Assuming that the quality of the machine translation has a trivial impact (since we are only interested in finding the Kanji association), the original documents and their translations provide us an alternative opportunity to roughly estimate the bilingual KCS. First, we computed a bilingual Kanji-document matrix using the log-entropy of each Kanji. By reducing the rank of this bilingual matrix using SVD, we can derive an Interlingual representation of our bilingual document collection on the unified KCS.","We want to conclude this section by pointing out that such an Interlingua representation, although derived from ideographic Kanji, is easily extendable to non-ideographic languages because of the flexibility of representation in the vector space model. Rather than associating Kanji with the word-stems of each alphabetic language, we consider mapping the words to their respective word-roots. Since the vocabulary of many European languages can be mapped back to their original roots (Latin, and Greek, etc.), word-roots associated with the Kanji can provide a multilingual conceptual space for effective representation and retrieval of multilingual information."]},{"title":"6.

Various weighting schemes can be applied to the raw occurrence counts. In this work, we used log-entropy weighting.","Once the Kanji-document matrix A has been created, KSI computes the similarity between two text objects (a query and a document, for example) as follows. First, a text object q is represented by an n x 1 vector, much like a column of the A matrix and with the same sorts of term weighting applied. Next, the similarity between text objects, q1 and q2 can be computed, typically by cosine scoring in the vector space model. This similarity can be represented as, sim (q1, q2) = q1T","q2 / √(q1T","q","1 . q2T q 2).","A mathematically useful way of viewing the process of computing text-object similarity scores in the vector space model is: (1) Each of the n Kanji in the collection has a vector representation. Specifically speaking, Kanji i is an n x 1 vector of zeros with a 1 in component i; (2) The representation of a text object, q is the weighted sum of the Kanji vectors of all the Kanji that appear in the text object. Thus, the similarity between text objects, q1 and q2 is: sim (In q1 , In q2 ) (2) where In is the n x n identity matrix. Here, In plays the role of a vector lexicon, in the sense that it assigns each Kanji a vector definition. Of course, pre-multiplying by the identity matrix in the Eq. 2 does not change the comparison in any way. On the other hand, by using other vector lexicons, we can substantially change the way similarities are computed. In addition, the only role played by the Kanji-document matrix A in the vector space model is in the computation of weighting factors for the components (i.e., Kanji or terms) of text objects.","KSI, like LSI, is a vector space IR formalism. KSI begins with the formation of the Kanji-document matrix A. Then, the A matrix is analyzed using singular value decomposition (SVD) to extract structure concerning document-document and Kanji-Kanji correlations. Mathematically, an SVD of A can be written as, A = U(A) Σ(A) V(A)T","(3) where U(A) is an n x n matrix such that U(A)T","U(A) = In , Σ(A) is an n x n diagonal matrix of singular values, and V(A) is an n x m matrix such that V(A)T","V(A) = Im.

Document Collection and Queries","paragraphs":["The most popular IR Test Collections in Japan are the NTCIR collection and the BMIR-J2 collection. The NTCIR collection consists of a collection of 330,000 English and Japanese scientific articles. Half of the collection (187,081 documents) consists of bilingually aligned English-Japanese document pairs. This collection was not suitable for our experiments since we want to experiment with Chinese as well. The BMIR-J2 Test Collection is a Japanese text collection of 5,080 newspaper articles chosen from the Mainichi newspaper. However, due to the participants’ interests, this collection is restricted to the Engineering and Economics domains only. We could use this collection along with a set of corresponding Chinese document collection (not strictly parallel, but comparable counterparts). However, locating corresponding Chinese articles in the Engineering and Economics domains using Search Engines or Internet Robots is a tedious task.","Another international test collection, the TREC test collection includes English-Chinese and English-Japanese parallel corpora but no test collection of Japanese-Chinese parallel documents is yet available. Since we want to experiment with Japanese and Chinese IR and since there is no Japanese-Chinese bilingual test collection available so far, we took the initiative to prepare a bilingual test collection for our use. Nevertheless, we adhered to the TREC and NTCIR guidelines as strictly as possible. For the ease of locating corresponding Chinese documents, we restricted ourselves to current international affairs. We will explain the details of our collection preparation procedures below.","Mainichi newspaper is publishing their newswire archive on the CD-ROM on a yearly basis since early 90s. First, we used full-text search engines to index the most recent archives of the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper articles. Initially, we constructed 50 initial queries by selectively examining the collection. We used the freely available full-text search tools (NAMAZU and FREYA) to retrieve documents (likely to include both relevant and non-relevant) from a selected portion of the most recent Mainichi Newspaper archives [1995-1999]. For each query, we retained the top 20 documents retrieved by each search engine. By merging a few hundred documents from each search engine, we obtained a collection of about 1,600 documents. We carefully investigated the 224 articles retrieved by both the search tools against our 50 initial queries. Finally, we settled on a set of 33 revised queries and 1,000 news articles. After deciding on a set of documents and queries, we re-indexed this collection of 1,000 articles   78 Md. M. Hasan et al. and used the polling method6","to prepare the query-relevance matrix. Our polling process is highly approximated because we used the output results of only two systems validated by a single human evaluator. The accuracy of the query-relevance matrix can be further improved by employing more human evaluators.","After deciding on the set of Japanese queries and documents, we translated the queries into Chinese and used Internet search engines to retrieve and choose a collection of 1,000 Chinese documents using advanced search features provided by AltaVista [1]. Because our Japanese document collection mostly consists of articles about current and International affairs in recent years, it was easier to locate similar Chinese articles on the Internet. Moreover, the AltaVista search engine facilitates restricted-search within a particular domain. By restricting us to news sites, we could quickly extract a collection of Chinese documents comparable to the Japanese document collection. We again used the polling strategy to compute a query-relevance matrix for this collection with the help of two search tools and one human evaluator."]},{"title":"7.2.

Retrieval Results for Cross-language IR","paragraphs":["In this section, we discuss three different retrieval results. First, we use Japanese queries to retrieve Chinese documents.

Discussions","paragraphs":["In this paper, we explored one of the few possibilities of cross-language IR research with Asian languages. We experimented with Japanese and Chinese, where Kanji play an important semantic role; and we demonstrated that mono- and cross- language IR can be performed effectively through Kanji associations. In our experiments, we deliberately used Kanji and Kanji-derived semantics to address Japanese and Chinese IR (including CLIR). It is worthy to mention here that we do not advocate abandoning linguistic enhancements (e.g., segmentation, morphological analysis, etc.) and classical IR enhancements (e.g., query expansion, relevance feedback, etc.) techniques for IR tasks. Our exclusive attention to Kanji in our experiments is to identify the role of Kanji semantics in IR and CLIR. This approach can easily accommodate other linguistic and IR enhancements, and with such enhancements, the proposed approach will eventually give birth to practical CLIR systems.","Several types of ambiguities with Kanji usage across the Japanese and Chinese languages [15] exist. Such ambiguities contribute highly to the lower precision in single Kanji oriented indexing and retrieval. For bi-gram based indexing, we cannot conclude anything with high confidence due to the small document collections used in our experiments because of the data sparseness problem. However, the average precision of mono- and cross-language IR with KCT and with SVD shows that Kanji based indexing and retrieval of these ideographic languages is effective. Unlike other IR research reports where the IR task is comprehensively addressed, our experiments involves with only a straightforward hypotheses. Because of our exclusive focus on Kanji semantics and Japanese-Chinese language pair, we could not make direct comparison of our experimental results with those of the others’.","For Japanese-Chinese CLIR, this is one of the very first reports. The indexing methods we tried inherently bypass the complicated segmentation and morphological analysis phases, which would otherwise be necessary. Nonetheless, incorporating such linguistic analyses with the proposed approach will certainly improve the retrieval results. We are also aware that query expansion and relevance feedback -based enhancements can also be easily incorporated with the proposed Interlingua framework since this framework uses a flexible vector space representation. Moreover, Kanji association makes cross-language IR simpler than the traditional MT-based approach. We mapped Katakana and Hiragana strings to their relevant Kanji using an ad-hoc approach. During the error analysis, we noticed that such an approximated mapping significantly contributed to erroneous retrieval. Accurate mapping of Katakana and Hiragana strings to Kanji can further boost the retrieval effectiveness.","Since words in the non-ideographic languages can also be mapped to their original roots, the proposed Kanji-based Interlingua framework can be extended to deal with multilingual information indexing and retrieval of any combination of languages as far as parallel (or comparable) corpora and   82 Md. M. Hasan et al. sufficient computing power are available. Effective processing of multilingual heterogeneous information in this Internet age is inevitable. Revolution in storage capacity, abundance in computing power and invention of sophisticated mathematical methods for dimensionality reduction and projection (e.g., [23]) may present us with a better opportunity to integrate alphabetic and ideographic languages equally effectively under a uniform Interlingua representation. Indexing and retrieving heterogeneous multilingual information in a unified manner will therefore be possible. Traditional lexical (or Boolean) IR techniques will continuously be less effective as the number of documents grows. Multilingual IR is inevitable because of the global connectivity and the proliferation of electronic information. Automated and conceptual IR techniques will therefore dominate the future IR research."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["We would like to extend our thanks to the people involved with NZDL, NAMAZU and FREYA projects.
