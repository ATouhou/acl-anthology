The proposed method extracts plain words that are the most similar to the headword from the dictionary definition. The definition statements describe the headword using plain words; therefore, paraphrasing by replacing the headword with the most similar word in the dictionary definition is expected to be an accurate means of lexical simplification. However, it is difficult to determine which word is the most appropriate for the paraphrase. The method proposed in this paper measures the similarity of each word in the definition statements against the headword and selects the one with the closest semantic match for the paraphrase. This method compares favorably with the method that acquires the target word from the end of the definition statements. Keywords: Lexical Simplification, Lexical Paraphrase."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["In the current information age, a various readers have easy access to diverse text data. To achieve information transmission and gathering effectively, we must address the gap in readers’ linguistic skills. The gap of linguistic skills results from differences in age, such as between children and adults, as well as from differences in expert knowledge. In the effort to bridge this gap, and also to facilitate better communication with foreign language speakers[8] and people with disabilities, technology can play an important role. To investigate how technology can be applied toward bridging the gap in readers’ linguistic skills, we simplify the text of newspaper articles containing words that pose difficulties in communication, especially for elementary school students. Children are still developing their language skills, and as such, they have smaller vocabularies than adults. In this paper, we perform text simplification for children by paraphrasing selected newspaper articles using only words found in Basic Vocabulary to Learn (BVL)(3) . BVL is a collection of words selected based on a lexical analysis of elementary school textbooks. It contains 5,404 words that can help children write expressively. We define words not included in BVL as Difficult Words (DWs) and those in BVL paraphrased from DW as Simple Words (SWs). Paraphrasing newspaper articles using words that children can understand makes a great contribution to reading assistance for young students.

Related Works","paragraphs":["Although there are some methods [10] proposed for automatically acquiring paraphrasable expressions from Web pages, the quality of the results are still unsatisfactory. Hence typical methods use thesauri or dictionaries. Thesaurus is a language resource that contains semantically classified vocabulary words. Methods that utilize a thesaurus have an advantage in that they can measure the semantic relatedness between words (i.e., the distance between meanings). Japanese dictionaries are another language resource that provides the definition of a given lemma. Methods that utilize a dictionary have an advantage in that they are able to acquire simplified text. The aim of this study is to simplify the text of newspaper article through paraphrasing based on the use of a Japanese dictionary. Fujita et al. [1] and Mino and Tanaka [9] paraphrased the headword of a noun in a dictionary as the headword of another noun by assessing the similarity of the definitions for the two. Yet, as also reported by Mino and Tanaka, the target words acquired by this method are not simpler than the original words. We paraphrase by taking advantage of Japanese dictionary characteristics, namely that “The definition statements are simpler than the headwords” [9], because our aim is lexical simplification. Kaji et al. [3] assumed that the definition statement has an inflectable word as a nominative if the headword is inflectable, and the nominative is placed at the end of the definition statement. Then, they proposed a method for paraphrasing inflectable words. Mino and Tanaka assumed that the last segment of the main sentence in the definition statement represents the meaning of the headword, and they proposed a method for paraphrasing nouns. Kajiwara and Yamamoto [4] assumed that the target word is the same part-of-speech as headword and is placed at the end of the definition statement. They proposed a method for paraphrasing both nouns and inflectable words. These describe the selection of target words from the end of the definition statement in the dictionary. As shown in Figure 1, however, appropriate target words are not always found at the end of definitions. In Figure 1, the dictionary definition of “大詰め (final stage)” is “芝居の最後の場面 (the last scene of the play).” The end of the definition statement is “場 面 (scene).” However, the DW “大詰め (final stage)” cannot be paraphrased as “場面 (scene).” In this example, paraphrasing with the SW “最後 (last)” is correct. The original phrase “大詰めの大一番 (big match of the final stage)” is paraphrased as “最後の大一番 (big match of the last).” Therefore, we propose a better method for identifying target words from within a definition statement. definition:【大詰め】芝居の最後の場面 paraphrase:大詰めの大一番 → 最後の大一番 Figure 1: Example of a word that cannot be paraphrased as the end portion of the definition statement Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth Conference on Computational Linguistics and Speech Processing (ROCLING 2013) 60 Multiple target word candidates can be acquired by making use of the entire definition statement. Therefore, a process is needed for selecting the most appropriate target words. In the study of the selection of target words, researchers employ various methods such as assessing semantic similarity based on data from a thesaurus [7] or using the statistical information from large resources based on the distributional hypothesis [3][6]. Thesauruses provide hierarchical semantic classifications of words. By measuring the semantic distance between words in the thesaurus, it is possible to measure the proximity of meaning between words. Furthermore, according to the distributional hypothesis [2], words with similar meanings are often used in similar contexts. Based on this hypothesis, Lapata et al. and Keller et al. reported that the plausibility determination of the expression can be achieved by utilizing co-occurrence frequency and n-gram. In this paper, in order to maintain as much of the original meaning as possible in the paraphrase, we select the SW with the highest similarity to the DW (as determined using a thesaurus)."]},{"title":"3. Proposed Method 3.1 Acquisition of the Target Word Candidates","paragraphs":["As shown in Figure 2, the target word candidates are selected according to the following steps. 1. DWs are extracted from the input (i.e., the original sentence). DWs are content words that do not appear in BVL. A content word is one whose part-of-speech is identified as either a noun, verb, adjective, or adverb. In Figure 2, the DW “教授 (professor)” is included in the original sentence “教授はどうなのだろう (What would the professor have in mind?).” 2. The original DW is located in the Japanese dictionary. Figure 2 shows that Japanese dictionaries give four different definition statements for “教授 (professor)”: “教授とい う地位の人 (people with the status of professor),” “教授という地位 (status of professor),” “学問や技などを教えること (teaching learning and skill),” and “大学の 先生 (university teacher).” 3. The definition statements of headwords are analyzed by the Japanese language morphological analyzer MeCab (5) , and words are extracted if they are the same part-of-speech as the headword. In Figure 2, DW “教授 (professor)” is a noun. Therefore, seven nouns are extracted: “ 教授 (professor),” “ 地位 (status),” “ 人 (people),” “ 学問 (learning),” “ わざ (skill),” “ 大学 (university),” and “ 先生 (teacher).” DWs are removed, and only SWs are retained. In Figure 2, “教授 (professor)” and “地位 (status)” are DWs. Therefore, five SWs are obtained as target words: “人 (people),” “学問 (learning),” “わざ (skill),” “大学 (university),” and “先生 (teacher).” Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth Conference on Computational Linguistics and Speech Processing (ROCLING 2013) 61 Figure 2: Target word selection by the proposed method"]},{"title":"3.2 Selection of the Proper Target Word","paragraphs":["In the proposed method, SWs with the highest similarity scores relative to the DW are selected for the purpose of maintaining as much of the original meaning \\as possible.

(2) (3) Selection by Point-wise Mutual Information In criterion (2), simply the summation of co-occurrence frequencies is used. For this selection criterion, in addition to the previous criteria, the Point-wise Mutual Information (PMI) criterion, which ignores the effect of single-word frequency, is utilized as well. From the calculation of co-occurrence with PMI shown in equation (3), the co-occurrence frequency can be accurately measured, even for words with high frequencies. (4) Selection by tri-gram frequency To select SWs from the same context as DWs, tri-gram frequency is obtained. For the sentences with DWs, the frequencies of all tri-grams whose DW is replaced with a SW are obtained by using the three types of tri-grams, two surrounding words, and the DW. Then, as shown in equation (4), the score of SW x is represented using the two words before and after DW y in the source sentence {w-m...w-2w-1yw+1w+2...w+n}. score(x) = log freq(x, z!) freq(x)freq(z!)!

There are two major types of such errors: 1) The target word is selected at random because two or more SWs have the highest similarity of WordNet with original word, and 2) the non-paraphrasable word’s similarity is higher than that of the word at the end of the definition statement. For example, in the case of DW “再生 (play),” the SW “利用 (use)” has the highest WordNet similarity compared to the words from the end of the definition statement, but the SW “力 (power)” is acquired from another part, not the end of the definition statement, and its similarity is higher than the SW “利用 (use).” In this original sentence in Table 5, the DW “再生 (play)” and SW “力 (power)” are non-paraphrasable, but the DW “再生 (play)” and SW “利用 (use)” are paraphrasable.

Conclusion","paragraphs":["This paper demonstrates that to achieve lexical simplification for elementary school students, it is effective to paraphrase using definition sentences from multiple Japanese dictionaries and the lexical restrictions of BVL. Since the proposed method acquires target words from the full text of the definition, it may be able to select more appropriate target words than comparative methods, which make use of only the end of the definition statement. However, if the appropriate target word appears in other places (i.e., other than the end of the definition), which is the case for a few words in this experiment, the proposed method still achieves about the same level of the accuracy of paraphrase as does the comparative method. It is necessary to select a proper target word from among several candidates that have been acquired. The results of this experiment show that the method of utilizing WordNet similarity is better than the method utilizing frequency and context inf\\ormation.
