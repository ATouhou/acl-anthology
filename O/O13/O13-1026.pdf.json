Vowels appear early in speech development and they are central to the understanding of the acoustic properties of speech. Therefore, the current study aimed to examine the differences of vowel formant frequencies among five children with cerebral palsy in different severity ranging from ages 3 to 7. First and second vowel formants (F1 and F2) were measured to investigate: 1) the changes of the F1 and F2 values, 2) vowel space, and 3) the vowel space area in CP children of different ages and severity. The major findings are: 1) There was no obvious decline in F2 values from 3 to 7 years old, which indicated delayed speech development; 2) The overlapping ellipses of all vowel spaces illustrated unstable motor control in all the five children; and 3) The five CP children had centralized corner vowels and there was no expansion of vowel spaces at different ages. This indicated their limited motor control.

Introduction","paragraphs":["Cerebral palsy is regarded as the most common cause of severe motor disability in children who are attributed to non-progressive disturbances that occurred in the developing infant brain [ 1]. Estimation from several different developed countries reported that 1.2-3.0 per 1000 children were diagnosed with cerebral palsy [2][3]. Vowels are central to the understanding of the acoustic properties for speech, and vowels appear early in speech development. Children achieve high degree of accuracy in producing vowels by the age of 36 months [4]. Therefore, the current study focused on vowel acoustical characteristics in five CP children of different ages."]},{"title":"2.Methodology 2.1.The participants","paragraphs":["Five children with cerebral palsy participated in current study for investigating the differences of vowel formant in their speech production.

The blue dots represent the vowel /a/ and its range is scattered apart which indicates the instability in producing vowel /a/ for each child in this study. The lines were drawn to illustrate the changes of vowel space areas in different ages and severity. Previous studies indicated that children tend to have smaller vowel space in early age, and later expand a little when the children are older, then become more centralized. The broader vowel space at early stages corresponds to the increased variability of vowel formants which might be due to immature motor control [6][7]. After acquiring more mature motor control for vowel production, the decreased variability of vowel formants leads to the reduction of F1-F2 space at later stage. However, the current study did not discover obvious change of vowel space in different ages. In this current study, CP1 had larger corner vowel space than CP3 due to age difference. CP2, with severe dysarthria, tended to have very scattered corner vowels distribution due to the difficulty of motor control.","/ɪ/ /ɛ/ /ʊ/ /a/ /o/ /ə/ CP F1 F2 F1 F2 F1 F2 F1 F2 F1 F2 F1 F2 CP1 2;5,13 Min Max 423 687 2281 3788 439 905 1382 3271 431 740 867 1375 563 1412 1551 2715 521 1244 1246 2240 472 953 864 2023 CP2 2;9,16 Min Max 563 727 2546 2843 724 1030 1206 2835","650 1297 381 1677 1030 2851 730 1037 1167 1508 469 959 747 2325 CP3 3;11,6 Min Max 437 788 2583 3832 559 943 2119 3711 563 1000 1130 3058 740 1278 1767 2930 728 953 1207 2103 515 1028 909 2885 CP4 4;11,16 Min Max 385 611 3230 4008 384 876 1288 3272 338 723 850 1767 649 1204 1423 2542 468 946 812 1638 597 1030 1423 2409 CP5 6;5,14 Min Max 335 816 940 3446 571 1166 890 2847 555 1169 1037 2881 430 1426 1031 3185 477 1122 951 2119 334 905 642 2329 Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth Conference on Computational Linguistics and Speech Processing (ROCLING 2013) 264 CP1 (2;5,13, moderate) CP4 (4;11,16, severe) CP2 (2;9,16, Most severe) CP5 (6;5,14, Severe ) CP3 (3;11,6, moderate) Figure 2.

The data in the current study indicated unstable development in vowel production in terms of age difference in respect of F1 and F2 values.
