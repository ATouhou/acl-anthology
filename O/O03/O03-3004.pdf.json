Introduction","paragraphs":["Recently, there are renewed interests in using bilingual corpus for building systems for statistical machine translation (Brown et al. 1988, 1991), including data-driven machine translation (2002), computerassisted revision of translation (Jutras 2000) and cross-language information retrieval (Kwok 2001). It is therefore useful for the bilingual corpus to be aligned at the sentence level and even sub-sentence level with very high precision (Moore 2002; Chuang, You and Chang 2002, Kueng and Su 2002). Especially, for further analyses such as phrase alignment, word alignment (Ker and Chang 1997; Melamed 2000) and translation memory, high precision and quality alignment at sentence or sub-sentential levels would be very useful. Furthermore, alignment at sub-sentential level has the potential of improving the effectiveness of alignment at word, chunk and phrase levels and providing finer grained and more reusable translation memory. Much work has been reported in the literature of computational linguistics studying how to align sentences. One of the most effective approaches is length-based approach proposed by Brown et al. and by Gale and Church. Length-based approach for aligning parallel corpora has commonly been used and produces surprisingly good results for the language pair of French and English at success rates well over 96%. However, it does not perform as well for alignment of two distant languages such as Chinese-English. Furthermore, for sub-sentential alignment, length-based approach gets less effectiveness than running it in sentence level since sub-sentence has less information in length.  2 Punctuations based approach (Yeh, Chuang and Chang 2003 ) for sentence alignment produces high accuracy rates as same as length based approach and was independent of languages. Although the ways different languages around the world use punctuations vary, symbols such as commas and full stops are used in most languages to demarcate writing, while question and exclamation marks are used to show emphasis. However, for sub-sentential alignment, punctuation-based approach has the same problem as length-based approach — no enough information in sub-sentence since sub-sentence might be very short and just include one or two punctuations within it. Yeh, Chuang and Chang (2003) examined the results of punctuation-based sentence alignment and observed: “Although word alignment links do cross one and other a lot, they general seem not to cross the links between punctuations. It appears that we can obtain sub-sentential alignment at clause and phrase levels from the alignment of punctuation.” Building on their work, we develop a new approach to sub-sentential alignment by interleaving the alignment of text and punctuations. In the following, we first give an example for bilingual sub-sentential alignment in Section 2. Then we introduce our probability model in Section 3. Next, we describe experimental setup and results in Section 4. We conclude in Section 5 with discussion and future work."]},{"title":"2. Example","paragraphs":["Consider a pair of aligned sentences in a parallel corpus as below: “My goal is simply this - to safeguard Hong Kong's way of life. This way of life not only produces impressive material and cultural benefits; it also incorporates values that we all cherish. Our prosperity and stability underpin our way of life. But, equally, Hong Kong's way of life is the foundation on which we must build our future stability and prosperity.” 我的目標很簡單,就是要保障香港的生活方式。這個生活方式,不單在物質和文化方面為我們帶來了 重大的利益,而且更融合了大家都珍惜的價值觀。香港的安定繁榮是我們生活方式的支柱。同樣地, 我們未來的安定繁榮,亦必須以香港的生活方式為基礎。 We can observe that although word alignment links might cross one and other a lot, there exist some text-blocks as follow that general seem not to cross the links between punctuations: “My goal is simply this –“ “我的目標很簡單,” “to safeguard Hong Kong's way of life.” “就是要保障香港的生活方式。” “This way of life not only produces impressive material and cultural benefits;” “這個生活方式,不單在物質和文化方面為我們帶來了重大的利益,”  3 “it also incorporates values that we all cherish.” “而且更融合了大家都珍惜的價值觀。” ... That’s what we call sub-sentences here. From the examples above, we can define that a sub-sentence is a text-block that include at least one or more punctuations. That’s an unclear definition since a sentence and a paragraph also fit the definition too. However, what we want is to find out the shortest parallel text-block pairs that fit the definition. That’s why in the third pair of above examples, “這個生活方式,” is a Chinese text-block but we have to combine it with ”不單在物質和文化方面為我們帶來了重大的利 益,”, because we can’t find any English text-block correspond to “這個生活方式,”, we have to combine the two Chinese above first, than we can find the corresponding one : “This way of life not only produces impressive material and cultural benefits;”."]},{"title":"3. Probability Model","paragraphs":["In this section we describe our probability model. To do so, we will first introduce some necessary notation. Let E be an English paragraph e1, e2,...,em and C be a Chinese paragraph c1, c2,...,cn, which ei and cj is a text-blocks as described in Section 2. We define a link l(ei, cj) to exist if ei and cj are translation ( or part of a translation ) of one another. We define null link l(ei, c0) to exist if ei does not correspond to a translation of any cj. The null link l(e0, cj) is defined similarly. An alignment A for two paragraphs E and C is a set of links such that every text-block in E and C participates in at least one link, and a text-block linked to e0 or c0 participates in no other links. We define the alignment problem as finding the alignment A that maximizes P(A|E, C). An alignment A consists of t links {l1, l2,..., lt}, where each lk = l(eik, cjk) for some ik and jk.We will refer to consecutive subsets of A as"]},{"title":"},...,,{","paragraphs":["1 jiij i"]},{"title":"llll","paragraphs":["+"]},{"title":"=","paragraphs":[", Given this notation, P(A|E, C) can be decomposed as follows:"]},{"title":"∏","paragraphs":["= −"]},{"title":"==","paragraphs":["t k k k t"]},{"title":"lCElPFElPFEAP","paragraphs":["1","1 11"]},{"title":"),,|(),|(),|(","paragraphs":["For each condition probability, given any pair ei and cj, the link probabilities can be determined directly from combining the probability of length-based model with punctuation-based model.

Discussion and future work","paragraphs":["We propose a model combining length-based approach with punctuation-based approach to do sub-sentential alignment and we got about 93% precision rates here. It was not bad but still had a lot of space to improve. We should change the sub-sentence match type probability first of all. We use the probability of sentence match type instead of sub-sentence match type in this experiment since we don’t do sub-sentence training first. It causes a problem, because a sub-sentence has higher probability to include two  6 or three text-blocks within it than a sentence do. An inverted sentence causes the second problem here, no matter length-based or punctuation-based approach you used; they cannot solve this kind of problem. We might add lexical information in it to solve this kind of problem in the future."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Brown, P. F., J. C. Lai and R. L.
