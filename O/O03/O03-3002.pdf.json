Introduction","paragraphs":["Recently, there are renewed interests in using bilingual corpus for building systems for statistical machine translation (Brown et al. 1988, 1991), including data-driven machine translation (Richardson et al. 2002), computer-assisted revision of translation (Jutras 2000) and cross-language information retrieval (Kwok 2001). It is therefore useful for the bilingual corpus to be aligned at the sentence level and even sub-sentence level with very high precision (Moore 2002; Chuang, You and Chang 2002, Kueng and Su 2002). Especially, for further analyses such as phrase alignment, word alignment (Ker and Chang 1997; Melamed 2000) and translation memory, high-precision alignment at sub-sentential levels would be very useful. Alignment at sub-sentential level has the potential of improving the effectiveness of alignment at word and phrase levels and providing finer grained and more reusable translation memory. Much work has been reported in the literature of computational linguistics on how to align sentences, while very little is touched on alignment just below the sentence level. The most effective approach for sentence alignment is the length-based approach proposed by Brown et al. (1991) and by Gale and Church (1991). Both methods use normal distribution to model the ratio of lengths between the counterpart sentences measured in number of words or characters. Length-based approach for aligning parallel corpora has commonly been used and produces surprisingly good results for the language pair of French and English at success rates well over 96%. However, it does not perform as well for alignment of text in two distant languages such as Chinese and English.  2 Yeh (2003) proposed a punctuation-based approach for sentence alignment which produces even high accuracy rates than the length based approach. It was pointed out that the ways different languages use punctuations are more or less similar and the correspondence of punctuations across different languages can be obtained using a small set of training data. By soft matching punctuations of the two languages in ordered comparison, the probabilities of mutual translation for a pair of bilingual sentences can be estimated more effectively than lengths. This is not surprising since the average sentence contains many punctuations which carry more information than lengths. Yeh also examined the results of punctuation-based sentence alignment and observed:  “Although word alignment links do cross one and other a lot, they general seem not to cross the links between punctuations. It appears that we can obtain sub-sentential alignment at clause and phrase levels from the alignment of punctuation.” This observation indicates that in bilingual corpus pieces of text delimited by punctuations behave much the same way as sentences with non-crossing alignment links. Therefore, it is reasonable to align pieces of text ending with a couple of punctuations, much the same way as sentence alignment. Building on their work, we develop a new approach to sub-sentential alignment by interleaving the matches of alphabetic texts and punctuations. In the following, we first give an example for bilingual sub-sentential alignment in Section 2. Then we introduce our probability model in Section 3. Next, we describe experimental setup and results in Section 4. We conclude in Section 5 with discussion and future work."]},{"title":"2. Example","paragraphs":["Consider a pair of counterpart paragraphs in the official records of Hong Kong Legislative Council: “My goal is simply this - to safeguard Hong Kong's way of life. This way of life not only produces impressive material and cultural benefits; it also incorporates values that we all cherish. Our prosperity and stability underpin our way of life. But, equally, Hong Kong's way of life is the foundation on which we must build our future stability and prosperity.” 我的目標很簡單,就是要保障香港的生活方式。這個生活方式,不單在物質和文化方面為我們帶來了 重大的利益,而且更融合了大家都珍惜的價值觀。香港的安定繁榮是我們生活方式的支柱。同樣地, 我們未來的安定繁榮,亦必須以香港的生活方式為基礎。(Source: Oct. 7, 1992, Governor Christopher Francis Patten’s address to the HK LEGCO)  By sub-sentential alignment, we mean identifying the shortest possible pair of counterpart texts ending with punctuations. From the example above, the following is the intended results of sub-sentential alignment:  3","z My goal is simply this – 我的目標很簡單,","z to safeguard Hong Kong's way of life. 就是要保障香港的生活方式。","z This way of life not only produces impressive material and cultural benefits; 這個生活方式,不單在物質和文化方面為我們帶來了重大的利益,","z it also incorporates values that we all cherish. 而且更融合了大家都珍惜的價值觀。 Notice that longer pairs such as the following translation equivalent pair of sentences My goal is simply this – to safeguard Hong Kong's way of life. 我的目標很簡單,就是要保障香港的生活方式。 does not fit the bill, since a finer grained subdivision into two 1-1 matches, (My goal is simply this –, 我的 目標很簡單,) and (to safeguard Hong Kong's way of life., 就是要保障香港的生活方式。) also preserve translation equivalence. Not unlike the situation in sentence alignment, there are many to one, one to many, and many to many matches. For instance, it is not possible to find a 1-1 match for “This way of life not only produces impressive material and cultural benefits;” since it only corresponds to “這個生活 方式,” in part. Therefore, we have to combine the subsequent clause “不單在物質和文化方面為我們 帶來了重大的利益,” for a 1-2 match. "]},{"title":"3. Probability Model","paragraphs":["In this section we describe our probability model. To do so, we will first introduce some necessary notation. Let E be an English fragment e1, e2,...,em and C be a Chinese paragraph c1, c2,...,cn, which ei and cj is a text-fragment as described in Section 2. We define a link l(ei, cj) for ei and cj that are translation ( or part of a translation ) of one another. We define null link l(ei, c0) for ei which does not correspond to a translation. The null link l(e0, cj) is defined similarly. An alignment A for two paragraphs E and C is a set of links such that every text-fragment in E and C participates in at least one link, and a text-block linked to e0 or c0 participates in no other links. We define the alignment problem as finding the alignment A that maximizes P(A|E, C). An alignment A consists of t links {l1, l2,..., lt}, where each lk = (eik, cjk) for some ik and jk.We will refer to consecutive subsets of A as"]},{"title":"},...,,{","paragraphs":["1 jiij i"]},{"title":"llll","paragraphs":["+"]},{"title":"=","paragraphs":[", Given this notation, P(A|E, C) can be decomposed as follows:  4"]},{"title":"∏","paragraphs":["= −"]},{"title":"==","paragraphs":["t k k k t"]},{"title":"lCElPFElPFEAP","paragraphs":["1","1 11"]},{"title":"),,|(),|(),|(","paragraphs":["For each condition probability, given any pair ei and cj, the link probabilities can be determined directly from combining the probability of length-based model with punctuation-based model.

The method seems to work reasonably well with an average precision rate around  6 90% in the evaluation of a preliminary implementation. There is still a lot of room for improvement. We are currently working on identification of more punctuations useful for sub-sentential alignment, proper segmentation of text ending with punctuations, and better model for lengths of sub-sentential fragment. We are also looking into the issues of best weighting scheme of length and punctuation information. Finally, the cases where there is inverion of translated fragments are difficult to handle with length information alone. We are also preparing to work with additional lexical information to solve this kind of problem in the future."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["We acknowledge the support for this study through grants from Ministry of Education, Taiwan (MOE EX-91-E-FA06-4-4).
