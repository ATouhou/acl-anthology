These suffixes are predicted to differ in their degree of productivity: -hua and -men appear to be productive, being able to systematically form a word with a variety of base words, whereas -zi and -tou (and perhaps also -r) may be limited in productivity. Baayen [1989, 1992] proposes the use of corpus data in measuring productivity in word formation. Based on word-token frequencies in a large corpus of texts, his token-based measure of productivity expresses productivity as the probability that a new word form of an affix will be encountered in a corpus. We first use the token-based measure to examine the productivity of the Mandarin suffixes. The present study, then, proposes a type-based measure of productivity that employs the deleted estimation method [Jelinek & Mercer, 1985] in defining unseen words of a corpus and expresses productivity by the ratio of unseen word types to all word types. The proposed type-based measure yields the productivity ranking “-men, -hua, -r, -zi, -tou,” where -men is the most productive and -tou is the least productive. The effects of corpus-data variability on a productivity measure are also examined. The proposed measure is found to obtain a consistent productivity ranking despite variability in corpus data.

Introduction 1.1 Morphological Productivity","paragraphs":["The focus of a study of morphological productivity is on derivational affixation that involves a base word and an affix [Aronoff, 1976], as seen in sharp + -ness → sharpness, electric + -ity  * Ph.D. Program in Linguistics, The Graduate Center, The City University of New York, 365 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10016, U.S.A. e-mail: enishimoto@gc.cuny.edu   50 Eiji Nishimoto → electricity, child + -ish → childish.1","Native speakers of a language have intuitions about what are and are not acceptable words of their language, and if presented with non-existent, potential words [Aronoff, 1983], they accept certain word formations more readily than others [Anshen & Aronoff, 1981; Aronoff & Schvaneveldt, 1978; Cutler, 1980]. Most intriguing in the issue of productivity is that the degree of productivity varies among affixes, and many studies in the literature have been devoted to accounting for this particular aspect of productivity [see Bauer, 2001, and Plag, 1999, for an overview].","How the degree of productivity varies among affixes is best illustrated by the English nominal suffixes -ness and -ity, which are often considered “rivals” as they sometimes share a base word (e.g., clear → clearness or clarity). In general, -ness is felt to be more productive than -ity.2","The word formation of -ity is limited, for example, by the Latinate Restriction [Aronoff, 1976: 51] that requires the base word to be of Latinate origin; hence, purity is acceptable but *cleanity is not. In contrast, -ness freely attaches to a variety of base words of both Latinate and Germanic (native) origin; thus, both pureness and cleanness are acceptable. There are also some affixes that could be regarded as unproductive; for example, Aronoff and Anshen [1998: 243] note that the English nominal suffix -th (as in long → length) has long been unsuccessful in forming a new word that survives, despite attempts at terms like coolth. Varying degrees of productivity are also observed in Mandarin Chinese word formation. As will be discussed shortly, some Mandarin suffixes appear to be more productive than others."]},{"title":"1.2 Measuring the Degree of Productivity","paragraphs":["Early studies on productivity mainly focused on restrictions on word formation and viewed the degree of productivity to be determined by such restrictions [Booij, 1977; Schultink, 1961; van Marle, 1985]. Booij [1977: 120], for example, considers the degree of productivity of a word formation rule to be inversely proportional to the amount of restrictions that the word formation rule is subject to. Although the view that productivity is affected by restrictions on word formation is certainly to the point, from a quantitative point of view, measuring productivity by the amount of restrictions on word formation is limited in that the restrictive weight of such restrictions is unknown [Baayen & Renouf, 1996: 87].","Baayen [1989, 1992] proposes a corpus-based approach to the quantitative study of productivity. His productivity measure uses word frequencies in a large corpus of texts to  1 Excluded from the study of productivity are seemingly irregular word formations, or “oddities” [Aronoff, 1976: 20], such as blendings (e.g., smoke + fog fi smog) and acronyms (e.g., NATO). 2 -ity can be more productive than -ness depending on the type of base word; for instance, -ity is more productive than -ness when the base word ends with -ile as in servile [Aronoff, 1976: 36] or with -ible as in reversible [Anshen & Aronoff, 1981]. Still, overall, -ness is intuitively felt to be more productive than -ity.   Measuring and Comparing the Productivity of Mandarin Chinese Suffixes 51 express productivity as the probability that a new word form of an affix will be encountered in a corpus (see Section 3). Although Bauer [2001: 204] observes that a generally agreed measure of productivity is yet to be achieved in the literature, Baayen’s corpus-based approach seems to be appealing and promising. Most importantly, since corpus data include productively formed words that are typically not found in a dictionary [Baayen & Renouf, 1996], corpus-based descriptions of productivity reflect how words are actually used.3","The corpus-based approach is also timely, as linguists have growing interests in corpus data. The present study pursues the corpus-based approach to measuring productivity using a corpus of Chinese texts.","The outline of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, five Mandarin suffixes are introduced and are analyzed qualitatively based on observations in the literature. In Section 3, Baayen’s token-based productivity measure is discussed, and the measure is applied to a corpus of Chinese texts to quantitatively analyze the productivity of the Mandarin suffixes. In Section 4, a type-based productivity measure is proposed, and its performance is evaluated. Also, some experiments are conducted to examine the effects of corpus-data variability on a productivity measure. Section 5 summarizes the findings."]},{"title":"2. Mandarin Chinese Suffixes 2.1 A Qualitative Analysis of Five Mandarin Suffixes","paragraphs":["The present study examines the productivity of five Mandarin suffixes: the verbal suffix -hua, the plural suffix -men, and the nominal suffixes -r, -zi, and -tou. The verbal suffix -hua 化 functions similarly to English -ize (and -ify): (1) xiàndài 现代 ‘modern’ → xiàndàihuà 现代化 ‘modernize’ Verbs formed with -hua can be used as nouns [Baxter & Sagart, 1998: 40], so xiàndàihuà 现 代化 in (1) can also be interpreted as ‘modernization’. Analogous to English -ize (and -ify), -hua systematically attaches to a variety of base words to form verbs, such as gōngyèhuà 工业化 ‘industrialize’, guójìhuà 国际化 ‘internationalize’, and jìsuànjīhuà 计 算机化 ‘computerize’. The suffix -men 们 pluralizes a noun, as in the following example: (2) xuésheng 学生 ‘student’ → xuéshengmen 学生们 ‘students’ According to Packard’s [2000] classification, -men is a grammatical affix, whereas the other four suffixes that we examine are word-forming affixes. If we use the standard terminology of  3 But see also Plag [1999] for a discussion of how dictionary data can be useful in a study of productivity.   52 Eiji Nishimoto the field, -men could be viewed as an inflectional affix, and the other four suffixes could be considered derivational affixes. There are three major characteristics of -men that differentiate -men from the English plural suffix -s [Lin, 2001: 59; Norman, 1988: 159; Ramsey, 1987: 64]. First, -men attaches only to human nouns4","; hence, *zhuōzimen 桌子们 ‘desks’ and *diànnǎomen 电脑们 ‘computers’ are not acceptable, unless they are considered animate as in a cartoon. Second, -men is obligatory with pronouns (e.g., wǒ 我 ‘I’ → wǒmen 我们 ‘we’) but not with nouns; for example, háizi 孩子 without -men can be interpreted as ‘child’ or ‘children’ depending on the context. Third, -men is not compatible with numeral classifiers; hence, *sāngè xuéshengmen 三个学生们 ‘three students’ is ungrammatical. Due to these characteristics, -men may not be as frequently used or “productive” [Lin, 2001: 58] as the English plural suffix -s. However, -men has many base words to which it can attach, for there are a variety of nouns in Mandarin (as in any language) designating human beings (e.g., jìzhěmen 记者们 ‘reporters’, kèrénmen 客人们 ‘guests’, shìzhǎngmen 市长们 ‘mayors’).","The suffix -r 儿 forms a noun from a verb or an adjective, or -r can create a diminutive form [Ramsey, 1987: 63; Lin, 2001: 57–58]: (3) huà 画 ‘to paint’ → huàr 画儿 ‘painting’ (4) niǎo 鸟 ‘bird’ → niǎor 鸟儿 ‘small bird’ The use of -r is abundant in the colloquial speech of local Beijing residents, and three distinct usages of -r by local Beijing residents are identified [Chen, 1999: 39]. First, -r can create a semantic difference: (5) xìn 信 ‘letter’ → xìnr 信儿 ‘message’ Second, a form with -r may be habitually preferred to a form without it: (6) huā 花 ‘flower’ → huār 花儿 ‘flower’ Third, -r may be attached to a word solely for a stylistic reason. The use of -r in the last category is the most frequent among local Beijing residents [Chen, 1999: 39]. In both Mainland China and Taiwan, the use of -r is not favored especially in broadcasting, and -r words are rarely incorporated into the standard [Chen, 1999: 39; Ramsey, 1987: 64]. The suffixes -zi 子 and -tou 头 typically appear in the following constructions: (7) *mào 帽 → màozi 帽子 ‘hat’ (8) *mù 木 → mùtou 木头 ‘wood’ In these examples, -zi and -tou combine with a bound morpheme that does not constitute a  4 In colloquial speech, -men can occasionally attach to some animal nouns (e.g., gǒurmen 狗儿们 ‘doggies’).   Measuring and Comparing the Productivity of Mandarin Chinese Suffixes 53 word by itself (i.e., neither *mào 帽 nor *mù 木 is a word).","Historically, the word formation of -zi and -tou appeared in the course of two changes in Chinese: a shift from monosyllabic to disyllabic words and a simplification of the phonological system [Packard, 2000: 265–266]. According to Packard [2000: 265], the shift toward disyllabic words occurred as early as in the Zhou dynasty (1000–700 BC) and underwent a large scale development during and after the Han dynasty (206 BC–AD 220). The phonological simplification, which occurred around the same time [Packard, 2000: 266], caused syllable-final consonants to be lost, and many single-syllable words that were once distinct became homophones [Li & Thompson, 1981: 44]. One possible account of how the two changes occurred is that the phonological simplification preceded as a natural linguistic process of phonetic attrition, and the shift toward disyllabic words occurred as a solution to the increase of homophonous syllables [Li & Thompson, 1981: 44; Packard, 2000: 266]. The increase of homophonous syllables was particularly significant in Mandarin [Li & Thompson, 1981: 44], and -zi and -tou played a role in the disyllabification of Mandarin words.","The word formation of -zi and -tou is not limited to bound morphemes [Lin, 2001: 58–59; Packard, 2000: 84]: (9) shū 梳 ‘to comb’ → shūzi 梳子 ‘comb’ (10) xiǎng 想 ‘to think’ → xiǎngtou 想头 ‘thought’ In these examples, -zi and -tou form a noun by attaching to a free morpheme (i.e., both shū 梳 and xiǎng 想 are independent words).","The term “productive” is sometimes used in the literature to describe the above-discussed suffixes. Ramsey [1987: 63] describes -tou to be much less productive than -zi, while Li and Thompson [1981: 42–43] observe that -zi and -tou are both no longer productive. Lin [2001: 57] views -r to be the most productive Mandarin suffix. Unfortunately, the basis for these observations is left unclear. Some observations may be based on the number of word forms of a suffix found in a dictionary; for example, present-day Mandarin has by far more -zi word forms than -tou word forms, and this may lead to the view that -zi is more productive than -tou. However, as Aronoff [1980] argues, of interest to linguists is the synchronic aspect of productivity (i.e., how words of an affix can be formed at a given point in time), rather than the diachronic aspect of productivity (i.e., how many words of an affix have been formed between two points in time). Concentrating on the synchronic aspect, if we associate productivity with regularity in word formation [Spencer, 1991: 49] or availability of base words with which a new word can be readily formed, we may predict -hua and -men to be productive, and -zi and -tou to be limited in productivity. The productivity of -r would likely depend on the context—if we focus on broadcasting, the productivity of -r may also be limited. Admittedly, these predictions are speculative, and the difficulty in describing the productivity   54 Eiji Nishimoto of an affix is where a quantitative productivity measure becomes important. In the following sections, the productivity of the Mandarin suffixes will be examined quantitatively."]},{"title":"3. Quantitative Productivity Measurement 3.1 Baayen’s Corpus-Based Approach","paragraphs":["Baayen [1989, 1992] proposes a corpus-based measure of productivity, formulated as: (11) Nn p","1 = where given all word forms of an affix found in a large corpus of texts, n1 is the number of word types of the affix that occur only once in the corpus, the so-called hapax legomena (henceforth, hapaxes), N is the sum of word tokens of the affix, and p is the productivity index of the affix in question.5","The measure (11) employs Good’s [1953] probability estimation method (commonly known as the Good-Turing estimation method) that provides a mathematically proven estimate [Church & Gale, 1991] of the probability of seeing a new word in a corpus, based on the probability of seeing hapaxes in that corpus. The productivity index p expresses the probability that a new word type of an affix will appear in a corpus after N tokens of the affix have been sampled. One important characteristic of the measure (11) is that it is token-based; that is, the measure relies on word-token frequencies in a corpus. The sum of word types of an affix in a corpus, represented by V, is not directly tied to the degree of productivity (see Section 4.1). In the remaining sections, the measure (11) will be referred to as the hapax-based productivity measure.6","","While the hapax-based measure has been primarily used in the studies of Western languages, such as Dutch [e.g., Baayen, 1989, 1992] and English [e.g., Baayen & Lieber, 1991;","","5 A clear distinction has to be made between word tokens and word types in the context of a corpus study. To give the simplest example, if we have three occurrences of the in a small corpus, the token frequency of the is three, and the type frequency of the is one. In the case of affixation, we ignore the differences between singular and plural forms; for example, if we have a corpus that has {activity, activity, activities, possibility, possibilities}, the token frequency of -ity is five (the sum of all these occurrences of -ity) while the type frequency of -ity is two (after normalizing the plural forms, we have two distinct -ity words, activity and possibility). An exception to ignoring the plural suffix is when we are interested in the productivity of the plural suffix itself. In that case, if we have a corpus consisting of {book, books, books, student, students}, the token frequency of -s is three (i.e., books, books, and students), and the type frequency of -s is two (we have two distinct -s forms, books and students).","6 For the purposes of this paper, the term hapax-based measure is used to express, in a shorthand manner, the fact that the measure defines new words based on hapaxes and that the measure is token-frequency-based. It should not be confused with the hapax-conditioned measure, p*, discussed in Baayen [1993].   Measuring and Comparing the Productivity of Mandarin Chinese Suffixes 55 Baayen & Renouf, 1996], the measure was also used by Sproat and Shih [1996] in a study of Mandarin word formation. The focus of Sproat and Shih’s study was on productivity in Mandarin root compounding, as seen in the nominal root yǐ 蚁 of mǎyǐ 蚂蚁 ‘ant’ that forms many words of ‘ant-kind’, such as yǐwáng 蚁王 ‘queen ant’ and gōngyǐ 工蚁 ‘worker ant’. By analyzing the degree of productivity of a number of Mandarin nominal roots, Sproat and Shih showed that, contrary to a claim in the literature, root compounding is a productive word-formation process in Mandarin. For example, while shí 石 ‘rock-kind’ and yǐ 蚁 ‘ant-kind’ had the productivity indices of 0.129 and 0.065, respectively, apparently unproductive bīn 槟 and láng 榔 of bīnláng 槟榔 ‘betel nut’ were found to have zero productivity. Sproat and Shih’s study shows that a corpus-based study of productivity in Chinese is fruitful."]},{"title":"3.2 A Corpus of Segmented Chinese Texts","paragraphs":["A major difficulty in conducting a corpus-based study of productivity in Chinese is that Chinese texts lack word delimiters. Segmentation of Chinese text is, by itself, a contested subject [see Sproat, Shih, Gale, & Chang, 1996], and consequently, a large-size corpus of segmented Chinese texts is not as readily available as a large-size corpus of English texts. Sproat and Shih [1996] used a large-size Chinese corpus (40-million Chinese characters) in their study by running an automatic segmenter to segment strings that contained the Chinese characters of interest and manually processing some problematic cases where the segmentation was not complete.","The corpus of choice in the present study is a “cleaned-up” version of the Mandarin Chinese PH Corpus [Guo, 1993; hereafter, the PH Corpus] of segmented Chinese texts, made available in a study by Hockenmaier and Brew [1998].7","The corpus contains about 2.4-million (2,447,719) words—or 3.7-million (3,753,291) Chinese characters—from XinHua newspaper articles between January 1990 and March 1991. The texts of the PH Corpus are originally encoded in GB (simplified Chinese characters), and to facilitate the processing of the texts in computer programs, we convert the texts into UTF8 (Unicode) using an encoding conversion program developed by Basis Technology [Uniconv, 1999]. The size of the PH Corpus is relatively small by today’s standards (cf. a corpus of 80-million English words used in Baayen & Renouf, 1996), but the PH Corpus is one of few widely available corpora of segmented Chinese texts. Another widely available corpus of segmented Chinese texts is the Academia Sinica Balanced Corpus [1998; hereafter, the Sinica Corpus] that contains 5-million words from a variety of text sources. The sentences of the Sinica Corpus are syntactically parsed, so the part-of-speech of each segmented word is identified. Although the Sinica Corpus is not  7 The PH Corpus can be downloaded from the ftp server of the Centre for Cognitive Science at University of Edinburgh.   56 Eiji Nishimoto","used in the present study, the use of the Sinica Corpus is certainly of interest. 8 ","Certain words were filtered out as potentially relevant words of the Mandarin suffixes in question were collected from the PH Corpus. With -r and -zi, a criterion for distinguishing a suffix from a non-suffix is that -r and -zi as a suffix lose their tone [Liu, 2001, 57–58; Norman, 1988, 113–114]. This criterion helps identify and block many non-suffixal cases where -r and -zi denote ‘son’ or ‘child’, such as yīng’ér 婴儿 ‘baby’, fùzǐ 父子 ‘father and son’, and xiàozǐ 孝子 ‘filial son’.9","We exclude wénhuà 文化 ‘culture’ because it is never a verb, and according to Norman [1988: 21], the specific use of wénhuà 文化 to mean ‘culture’ was adopted from Japanese. Also excluded are some -tou words, such as máotóu 矛头 ‘spearhead’, in which -tou is a bound morpheme denoting ‘head’. In addition, all pronouns in -men are excluded, as suggested in Sproat [2002]. As discussed earlier, -men behaves differently between pronouns and nouns (i.e., it is obligatory only with pronouns), and it is -men attaching to open-class nouns, rather than closed-class pronouns, that we are currently interested in."]},{"title":"3.3 A Quantitative Analysis of the Mandarin Suffixes","paragraphs":["The result of the hapax-based measure applied to the PH Corpus is shown in Table 1.

The suffixes are sorted in descending order by p.","","","8 The use of the PH Corpus in the present study is solely due to the fact that the computer programs currently used were written for the PH Corpus. It must be noted, however, that findings from a larger, more balanced corpus do not necessarily minimize findings from a smaller, less balanced corpus. Findings from both the PH Corpus (a small corpus of newspaper texts) and the Sinica Corpus (a large corpus of a variety of texts) are of interest because corpora of different types enable a comparison of findings by the corpus type.","9 Note in these examples that the tone of -r and -zi is retained (i.e., -ér and -zǐ, respectively). -r is originally -ér, and it becomes -r as a suffix, as a result of losing its syllabicity [Norman, 1988: 114].   Measuring and Comparing the Productivity of Mandarin Chinese Suffixes 57","Among the five suffixes, -r is found to be the most productive. The high productivity of -r is somewhat unexpected given the fact that the PH Corpus consists of newspaper texts. If the use of -r is not favored in broadcasting, we may also expect a limited use of -r in a newspaper context. In addition, the use of -r is often a mere phonological phenomenon as seen in the speech of local Beijing residents, and it is unlikely for such a phonological phenomenon to be represented in newspaper texts. In Table 1, the number of types (V) of -r does not reach the number of types of the least productive suffix -tou. However, the token frequency (N) of -r is lower than that of -tou, and -r has a larger number of hapaxes than -tou. Under the hapax-based measure, a high token frequency is associated with a high degree of lexicalization of words (i.e., the extent to which words are stored in the lexicon in their full form), and a high degree of lexicalization of words, in turn, is associated with a low degree of productivity [Baayen, 1989, 1992]. The rationale behind this mechanism is that if many words of an affix are lexicalized, the word formation rule of the affix needs to be invoked less often to form a word. What the present data of -r indicate, then, is that -r words are characterized by a low degree of lexicalization. The low degree of lexicalization of -r words and the relatively large number of hapaxes (as compared with -tou) suggest that the word formation rule of -r is active. 00.010.020.030.040.050.060.070.08 -tou -hua -zi -men -r s u f f i x"]},{"title":"p  Figure 1 The productivity ranking of the Mandarin suffixes by the p values (the vertical axis lists the suffixes, and the horizontal axis shows the p values of the suffixes).

Comparing -men and -hua in Table 1, we see that -men and -hua are similar with respect to both V and n1, but the p value of -hua is lowered by the high token frequency (N) of -hua. The high token frequency of -hua could be attributed to the fact that the present analysis includes -hua words used as nouns. According to Baxter and Sagart [1998: 40], -hua words are formed as verbs first, and these verbs can be used as nouns. If this is the case, the word formation of -hua is also relevant in -hua nouns. However, the uniform treatment of -hua verbs and -hua nouns may not be appropriate for the hapax-based measure. It could be the case, for example, that some -hua words are typically used as nouns with high token frequencies while other -hua words are typically used as verbs with low token frequencies. It is, therefore, necessary to make a more detailed analysis of the word frequency distribution of -hua by separating -hua nouns from -hua verbs. Distinguishing nouns from verbs is unfortunately not available in the PH Corpus due to lack of syntactic information. A clearer description of the productivity of -hua could be achieved with a syntactically parsed corpus such as the Sinica Corpus."]},{"title":"4. Type-Based Deleted Estimation 4.1 Type-Based Measures","paragraphs":["The present study explores a type-based measure of productivity. It has been argued that the sum of types of an affix in a corpus, V, alone often leads to some unintuitive results in measuring productivity [Baayen, 1989, 1992; Baayen & Lieber, 1991]. 10","For example, Baayen and Lieber [1991: 804] point out that the type frequencies of -ness and -ity in their corpus (497 and 405, respectively) do not adequately represent the fact that -ness is intuitively felt to be much more productive than -ity. If the number of types in a corpus can be misleading with respect the degree of productivity, how can we make use of type frequencies in a productivity measure?","An early attempt at a type-based measure of productivity was made by Aronoff [1976: 36], in which he proposed that the degree of productivity of an affix could be measured by the ratio of the number of actual words of the affix to the number of possible words of the affix. The measure is described by Baayen [1989: 28] as: (12)","SV I = where V is the number of actual words with the relevant affix, S is the number of possible words with the affix, and I is the productivity index of the affix. Baayen [1989: 28] argues that  10 See Baayen [1992] and Baayen and Lieber [1991] for a discussion of the global productivity of an affix (expressed as P*) based on a two-dimensional analysis of p and V.   Measuring and Comparing the Productivity of Mandarin Chinese Suffixes 59 the measure lacks specification on how to obtain V and S. Moreover, he argues that the measure can be interpreted to express, ironically, the degree of “unproductivity” of an affix because the number of possible words (S) would be, in theory, increasingly large (hence, the productivity index I would be increasingly small) for a very productive affix [Baayen, 1989: 30].","Baayen [1989, 1992] defines V and S based on corpus data. V is (as before) the sum of types of the relevant affix found in a corpus, and S (expressed as Ŝ) is statistically estimated for an infinitely large corpus; that is, Ŝ is the number of possible word types of the relevant affix to be expected when the corpus size is increased infinitely. 11","The measure that Baayen [1989: 60] proposes: (13) VS I","ˆ = is the inverse of (12) and expresses the potentiality of word formation rules, the extent to which the number of actual word types of an affix exhaust the number of possible word types of the affix [Baayen, 1992: 122]. The measure (13), however, is not considered an alternative measure of the degree of productivity [Baayen, 1992: 122].","What does not appear to have been explored so far is the question of what new words would mean under a type-based measure. One major appeal of the hapax-based measure is that it centers on the formation of new words, and we may wish to try focusing on the formation of new words under a type-based measure. However, a problem with taking a type-based approach is that we can no longer rely on the Good-Turing estimation method. In the next section, we will discuss another method of defining new words of a corpus."]},{"title":"4.2 The Deleted Estimation Method","paragraphs":["To define new words of a corpus in a type-based manner, we can employ the deleted estimation method [Jelinek & Mercer, 1985] used in language engineering. In a probabilistic language model, given a training corpus and a test corpus, we process words in the test corpus based on the probabilities of word occurrence in the training corpus. Since not all words of the test corpus appear in the training corpus, we need a method of assigning an appropriate probability mass to the unseen words in the test corpus. The main task involved here is to adjust the probabilities of word occurrence in the training corpus so that non-zero probability can be assigned to unseen words of the test corpus. A method used in this probability adjustment, if incorporated into a productivity measure, can tell us the probability of encountering unseen words in a corpus. The Good-Turing estimation method underlying the  11 The statistical techniques for obtaining Ŝ, which involve an extended version of Zipf’s law, are","beyond the scope of this paper. For more details, the reader is referred to Baayen [1989, 1992].   60 Eiji Nishimoto hapax-based measure is widely used in probabilistic language modeling, and its successful performances are reported in the literature [Chen & Goodman, 1998; Church & Gale, 1991]. While the Good-Turing estimation method is a mathematical solution to the task of probability adjustment, where the needed probability adjustment is mathematically determined, the deleted estimation method is an empirical solution, where the needed adjustment is determined by comparing discrepancies in word frequency between corpora [Church & Gale, 1991; Manning & Schütze, 1999].","The deleted estimation method, when incorporated into a type-based productivity measure, proceeds as follows. We begin by preparing two corpora of the same size and text type. The easiest way to have two such corpora is to split a large corpus in the middle into two sub-corpora, which we will call Corpus A and Corpus B.12","Comparing word types that appear in Corpus A against word types in Corpus B, unseen word types (or unseen types) in Corpus A are defined as those word types that do not appear in Corpus B. Likewise, unseen types in Corpus B are those that are absent in Corpus A. We obtain the average number of unseen types between Corpus A and Corpus B. Defining all word types (or all types) in a corpus as all the word types found in that corpus,13","we also obtain the average number of all types between the two sub-corpora. The ratio of the average number of unseen types to the average number of all types expresses the extent to which word types of an affix are of an unseen type. With an assumption that unseen types are good candidates for new word types, the degree of productivity expressed in this manner comes close to Anshen and Aronoff’s [1988: 643] definition of productivity as “the likelihood that new forms will enter the language.” The type-based deleted estimation productivity measure is formulated as follows:","Given Corpus A and Corpus B of the same size and text type, and all word types of an affix found in these corpora, (14) B\" in types all\" A\" in types all\" A\" given B in types unseen\" B\" given A in types unseen\" BAP tde","++ =),( where all types of a corpus are all the word types found in that corpus, unseen types in one corpus are those that are absent in the other corpus, and Ptde is the degree of productivity of the affix in question (tde = type-based deleted estimation).

This will conveniently give us the average number of unseen types and the average number of all types, which are both of interest by themselves, before examining the ratio of the two (as  12 These sub-corpora would be labeled retained and deleted (hence the term deleted estimation) under","the original deleted estimation method.

Conclusion","paragraphs":["The present study has proposed a type-based measure of productivity, the Ptde measure, that uses the deleted estimation method [Jelinek & Mercer, 1985] in defining unseen word types of a corpus. The measure expresses the degree of productivity of an affix by the ratio of unseen word types of the affix to all word types of the affix. If the ratio is high for an affix, a large proportion of the word types of the affix are of an unseen type, indicating that the affix has a great potential to form a new word.   Measuring and Comparing the Productivity of Mandarin Chinese Suffixes 69","We have tested the performance of the Ptde measure as well as the hapax-based measure of Baayen [1989, 1992] in a quantitative analysis of the productivity of five Mandarin suffixes: -hua, -men, -r, -zi, and -tou. The Ptde measure describes -hua, -men, and -r to be highly productive, -zi to be less productive than these three suffixes, and -tou to be the least productive, yielding the productivity ranking “-men, -hua, -r, -zi, -tou.” The Ptde measure and the hapax-based measure rank the suffixes differently with respect to -hua and -r. The relatively low productivity of -hua under the hapax-based measure could be attributed to the inclusion of -hua nouns in the present analysis. -r is assigned a larger productivity score under the hapax-based measure. The two measures agree on the high productivity of -men and the low productivity of -tou. The different results of the two measures are likely due to the type-based/token-based difference of the measures. The result of each measure requires an individual evaluation, for the knowledge that we can obtain from the result of each measure is different; for example, while the hapax-based measure takes into consideration the degree of lexicalization of words of an affix, the Ptde measure does not consider such an issue.","We have also examined how corpus-data variability affects the results of a productivity measure. It was found that a large number of random splits of a corpus adds stability to both the Ptde measure and the hapax-based measure. Moreover, it was found that even without randomization of words, the averaging of unseen types and all types under the Ptde measure reduces the effects of corpus-data variability. This is an advantage of the Ptde measure, considering the computational cost involved in randomizing words repeatedly, especially when the corpus is large.","With an assumption that unseen words of a corpus are good candidates for new words, a corpus-based productivity measurement can be regarded as a search for unseen words in a corpus. The apparent paradox is that the words that we seek are “unseen.” Baayen’s hapax-based measure achieves a mathematical estimate of the probability of seeing unseen words in a corpus by the Good-Turing estimation method. The deleted estimation method provides another way of defining unseen words of a corpus by comparing discrepancies in word frequency between two corpora, and the method also enables defining unseen words in a type-based context. It is hoped that words identified as unseen by the Ptde measure are also good candidates for new words, and this requires further investigation in future research. The implication of the successful result of the Ptde measure presented in this paper is that, in addition to what has been proposed by Baayen [1989, 1992, and subsequent works], there appear to be possibilities for capturing and exploiting elements in corpus data that are relevant to the quantitative description of productivity. The study of morphological productivity will be enriched by exploring such possibilities in the corpus-based approach to measuring productivity.   70 Eiji Nishimoto"]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["The author wishes to thank Harald Baayen, Richard Sproat, Martin Chodorow, and the anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments on the first draft of this paper.
