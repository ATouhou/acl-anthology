Unfortunately, the tremendously large number of collocates returned by these tools usually overwhelms language learners. In this paper, we introduce a thesaurus-based semantic classification model that automatically learns semantic relations for classifying adjective-noun (A-N) and verb-noun (V-N) collocations into different thesaurus categories. Our model is based on iterative random walking over a weighted graph derived from an integrated knowledge source of word senses in WordNet and semantic categories of a thesaurus for collocation classification. We conduct an experiment on a set of collocations whose collocates involve varying levels of abstractness in the collocation usage box of Macmillan English Dictionary. Experimental evaluation with a collection of 150 multiple-choice questions commonly used as a similarity benchmark in the TOEFL synonym test shows that a thesaurus structure is successfully imposed to help enhance collocation production for L2 learners. As a result, our methodology may improve the effectiveness of state-of-the-art collocation reference tools concerning the aspects of language understanding and learning, as well as lexicography.

Introduction","paragraphs":["Researchers have developed applications of computational collocation reference tools, such as several commercial collocation dictionary CD-ROMs, Word Sketch (Kilgarriff & Tugwell, 2001), TANGO (Jian et al., 2004), to answer queries (e.g., a search keyword “beach” for its adjective collocates) of collocation usage. These reference tools typically return collocates (e.g., adjective collocates for the pivot word “beach” are “rocky,” “golden,” “beautiful,” “raised,” “sandy,” “lovely,” “unspoiled,” “magnificent,” “deserted,” “fine,” “pebbly,” “splendid,” “crowded,” “superb,” etc.) extracted from a corpus of English texts (e.g., British National Corpus).","Unfortunately, existing tools for language learning sometimes present too much information in a batch on a single screen. With corpus sizes rapidly growing to Web scale (e.g., Web 1 Trillion 5-gram Corpus), it is common to find hundreds of collocates for a query word. The bulk of information may frustrate and slow L2 learners’ progress of learning collocations. An effective language learning tool also needs to take into consideration second language learners’ absorbing capacity at one sitting. To satisfy the need for presenting a digestible amount of information at one time, a promising approach is to automatically partition collocations of a query word into various categories to support meaningful access to the search results and to give a thesaurus index to collocation reference tools.","Consider the query “beach” in a search for its adjective collocates. Instead of generating a long list of adjectives like the above-mentioned applications, a better presentation could be composed of clusters of adjectives inserted into distinct semantic categories such as: {fine, lovely, superb, beautiful, splendid} assigned with a semantic label “Goodness,” {sandy, rocky, pebbly} assigned with a semantic label “Materials,” etc. Intuitively, by imposing a semantic structure on the collocations, we can bias the existing collocation reference tools towards giving a thesaurus-based semantic classification as one of the well-developed and convincingly useful collocation thesauri. We present a thesaurus-based classification system that automatically groups collocates of a given pivot word (here, the adjective collocates of a noun, the verb collocates of a noun, and the noun collocates of a verb) into semantically related classes expected to render highly useful applications in computational lexicography and second language teaching for L2 learners. A sample presentation for a collocation thesaurus is shown in Figure 1.   A Thesaurus-Based Semantic Classification of English Collocations 259 "]},{"title":"Figure 1. Sample presentation for the adjective collocate search query “beach”.","paragraphs":["Our thesaurus-based semantic classification model has determined the best semantic labels for 859 collocation pairs, focusing on: (1) A-N pairs and clustering over the adjectives (e.g., “fine beach”); (2) V-N pairs and clustering over the verbs (e.g., “develop relationship”); and (3) V-N pairs and clustering over the nouns (e.g., “fight disease”) from the specific underlying collocation reference tools (in this study, from JustTheWord). Our model automatically learns these useful semantic labels using the Random Walk Algorithm, an iterative graphical approach, and partitions collocates for each collocation types (e.g., the semantic category “Goodness” is a good thesaurus label for “fine” in the context of “beach” along with other adjective collocates such as “lovely,” “beautiful,” “splendid,” and “superb”). We describe the learning process of our thesaurus-based semantic classification model in more detail in Section 3. At runtime, we assign the most probable semantic categories to collocations (e.g., “sandy,” “fine,” “beautiful,” etc.) of a pivot word (e.g., “beach”) for semantic classification. In this paper, we exploit the Random Walk Algorithm to disambiguate word senses, assign semantic labels, and partition collocates into meaningful groups.","The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We review the related work in the next section. Then, we present our method for automatic learning to classify collocations into semantically related categories, which is expected to improve the presentation of underlying collocation reference tools and support collocation acquisition by computer-assisted language learning applications for L2 learners (Section 3). As part of our evaluation, two metrics are designed with very little precedent of this kind. One, we assess the performance of resulting   260 Chung-Chi Huang et al. collocation clusters by a robust evaluation metric; two, we evaluate the conformity of semantic labels by a three-point rubric test over a set of collocation pairs chosen randomly from the classifying results (Section 5)."]},{"title":"2. Related Work","paragraphs":["Many natural language processing (NLP) applications in computational lexicography and second language teaching (SLT) build on one part of lexical acquisition emphasizing teaching collocation for L2 learners. In our work, we address an aspect of word similarity in the context of a given word (i.e., collocate similarity), in terms of use, acquisition, and ultimate success in language learning.","This section offers the theoretical basis on which recommendations for improvements to the existing collocation reference tools are made, and it is made up of three major sections. In the first section, an argument is made in favor of collocation ability being an important part of language acquisition. Next, we show the need to change the current presentation of collocation reference tools. The final section examines other literature on computational measures for word similarity versus collocate similarity."]},{"title":"2.1 Collocations for L2 Learners","paragraphs":["The past decade has seen an increasing interest in the studies on collocations. This has been evident not only from a collection of papers introducing different definitions of the term “collocation” (Firth, 1957; Benson, 1985; Nattinger & DeCarrico, 1992; Nation, 2001), but also from the inclusive review of research on collocation teaching and the relation between collocation acquisition and language learning (Lewis, 1997; Hall, 1994).","New NLP applications for extracting collocations, therefore, are a great boon to both L2 learners and lexicographers alike. SLT has long favored grammar and memorization of lexical items over learning larger linguistic units (Lewis, 2000). Nevertheless, several studies have shown the importance of acquisition of collocations; moreover, they have found specifically that the most important is learning the right verbs in verb-noun collocations (Nesselhauf, 2003; Liu, 2002). Chen (2004) showed that verb-noun (V-N) and adjective-noun (A-N) collocations were found to be the most frequent error patterns. Liu (2002) found that, in a study of English learners’ essays from Taiwan, 87% of miscollocations were attributed to the misuse of V-N collocations. Of those, 96% were due to the selection of the wrong verb. A simple example will suffice to illustrate: in English, one writes a check and also writes a letter while the equivalent Mandarin Chinese word for the verb “write” is “kai” (開) for a check and “xie” (寫) for a letter, but absolutely not “kai” (開) for a letter.    A Thesaurus-Based Semantic Classification of English Collocations 261","This type of language-specific idiosyncrasy is not encoded in either pedagogical grammars or lexical knowledge but is of utmost importance to fluent production of a language."]},{"title":"2.2 Meaning Access Indexing in Dictionaries","paragraphs":["Some attention has been paid to the investigation of the dictionary needs and reference skills of language learners (Scholfield, 1982; Béjoint, 1994), and one important cited feature is a structure to support users’ neurological processes in meaning access. Tono (1984) was among the first attempts to claim that the dictionary layout should be more user-friendly to help L2 learners access desired information more effectively. According to Tono (1992) in his subsequent empirical close examination of the matter, menus that summarize or subdivide definitions into groups at the beginning of entries in dictionaries would help users with limited reference skills to access the information in the dictionary entries more easily. The Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English, 3rd edition [ISBN 0-582-43397-5] (henceforth called LDOCE3), has just such a system called “Signposts”. When words have various distinct meanings, the LDOCE3 begins each sense anew with a word or short phrase which helps users more effectively discover the meaning they need. The Cambridge International Dictionary of English [ISBN 0-521-77575-2] does this as well, creating an index called “Guide Word\" which provides similar functionality. Finally, the Macmillan English Dictionary for Advanced Learners [ISBN 0-333-95786-5], which has “Menus” for heavy-duty words with many senses, utilizes this approach as well.","Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a classification model for imposing a thesaurus structure on collocations returned by existing collocation reference tools, aiming at facilitating concept-grasping of collocations for L2 learners."]},{"title":"2.3 Similarity of Semantic Relations","paragraphs":["The construction of practical, general word sense classification has been acknowledged to be one of the most difficult tasks in NLP (Nirenburg & Raskin, 1987), even with a wide range of lexical-semantic resources such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) and Word Sketch (Kilgarriff & Tugwell, 2001).","Lin (1997) presented an algorithm for word similarity measured by its distributional similarity. Unlike most corpus-based word sense disambiguation (WSD) algorithms, where different classifiers are trained for separate words, Lin used the same local context database as the knowledge source for measuring all word similarities. Approaches presented to recognize synonyms have been studied extensively (Landauer & Dumais, 1997; Deerwester et al., 1990; Turney, 2002; Rehder et al., 1998; Morris & Hirst, 1991; Lesk, 1986). Measures of recognizing collocate similarity, however, are not as well developed as measures of word similarity.   262 Chung-Chi Huang et al.","The most closely related work focuses on automatically classifying semantic relations in noun pairs (e.g., mason:stone) and evaluation with a collection of multiple-choice word analogy question from the SAT exam (Turney, 2006). Another related approach, presented in Nastase and Szpakowicz (2003), describes how to automatically classify a noun-modifier pair, such as “laser printer,” according to the semantic relation between the head noun (printer) and the modifier (laser). The evaluation is manually conducted by human labeling. For a review of work to a more fine-grained word classification, Pantel and Chklovski (2004) presented a semi-automatic method for extracting fine-grained semantic relations between verbs. VerbOcean (http://semantics.isi.edu/ocean/) is a broad-coverage semantic network of verbs, detecting similarity (e.g., transform::integrate), strength (e.g., wound::kill), antonymy (e.g., open::close), enablement (e.g., fight::win), and temporal happens-before (e.g., marry::divorce) relations between pairs of strongly associated verbs using lexico-syntactic pattern over the Web. Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1993) presented a method towards the automatic identification of adjectival scales. Based on statistical techniques with linguistic information derived from the corpus, the adjectives, according to their meaning based on a given text corpus, can be placed in one group describing different values of the same property. Their clustering algorithm suggests some degree of adjective scalability; nevertheless, it is interesting to note that the algorithm discourages recognizing the relationship among adjectives, e.g., missing the semantic associations (for example a semantic label of “time associated”) between new-old. More recently, Wanner et al. (2006) sought to semi-automatically classify the collocations from corpora via the lexical functions in dictionary as the semantic typology of collocation elements. While there is still a lack of fine-grained semantically-oriented organization for collocation, WordNet synset (i.e., synonymous words in a set) information can be explored to build a classification scheme for refinement of the model and develop a classifier to measure the distribution of class for the new tokens of words set foot in. Our method, which we will describe in the next section, uses a similar lexicon-based approach for a different setting of collocation classification."]},{"title":"3. Methodology 3.1 Problem Statement","paragraphs":["We focus on the preparation step of partitioning collocations into categories for collocation reference tools: providing words with semantic labels, thus, presenting collocates under thesaurus categories for ease of comprehension. The categorized collocations are then returned in groups as the output of the collocation reference tool. It is crucial that the collocation categories be fairly consistent with human judgment and that the categories of collocates cannot be so coarse-grained that they overwhelm learners or defeat the purpose of users’ fast access. Therefore, our goal is to provide semantic-based access to a well-founded collocation   A Thesaurus-Based Semantic Classification of English Collocations 263 thesaurus. The problem is now formally defined.  Problem Statement: We are given (1) a set of collocates Col = {C1, C2, ..., Cn} (e.g., “sandy,” “beautiful,” “superb,” “rocky,” etc.) with corresponding parts-of-speech P={p| p ∈ Pos and Pos={noun,adjective,verb}} for a pivot word X (e.g., “beach”); (2) a combination of thesaurus categories (e.g., Roget’s Thesaurus), TC = {(W, P, L)} where a word W with a part-of-speech P is under the general-purpose semantic category L (e.g., feelings, materials, art, food, time, etc.); and (3) a lexical database (e.g., WordNet) as our word sense inventory SI for semantic relation population. SI is equipped with a measure of semantic relatedness: REL(S, S’) encodes semantic relations holding between word sense S and S’. ","Our goal is to partition Col into subsets of similar collocates by means of integrated semantic knowledge crafted from the mapping of TC and SI, whose elements are likely to express related meanings in the same context of X. For this, we leverage a graph-based algorithm to assign the most probable semantic label L to each collocation, thus giving collocations a thesaurus index.","For the rest of this section, we describe our solution to this problem. In the first stage of the process, we introduce an iterative graphical algorithm for providing each word with a word sense (Section 3.2.1) to establish integrated semantic knowledge. A mapping of words, senses, and semantic labels is thus constructed for later use of automatic collocation partitioning. In the second stage (Section 3.2.2), to reduce out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words in TC, we extend word coverage of limited TC by exploiting a lexical database (e.g., WordNet) as a word sense inventory, encoding words grouped into cognitive synonym sets and interlinked by semantic relations. In the third stage, we present a similar graph-based algorithm for collocation labeling using the extended TC and Random Walk on a graph in order to provide a semantic access to collocation reference tools of interest (Section 3.3). The approach presented here is generalizable to allow construction from any underlying semantic resource. Figure 2 shows a comprehensive framework for our unified approach.

Then, we construct a matrix, whose element Mx,y stands for the proportion of the probability Px , that will be propagated to node y. Since Mx,y may not be equal to M,y,x, the edges in G are directed. In matrix M, we assign 1-d to Mx,x where x ∈ V(Step (3a)) while the rest of the proportion (i.e., d) is uniformly distributed among the outgoing edges of the node x (Step (3c)).

That is, more connected nodes tend to collect scores, in turn propagating comparatively more significant scores to their connected neighboring nodes. Consequently, the flow or re-distribution of probabilities or scores mostly would be confined to nodes in groups and the convergence of the probabilities over the network is to be expected normally. In this stage of our method, an edge is added if and only if there are some semantic relations, in the sense inventory, existing between two word senses (e.g., one is the immediate hyponym/hypernym of the other), to differentiate semantically-related senses from those that are not. The PageRank-like algorithm in Figure 4 is exploited to determine the most well-connected or more semantically related (sense) group. Additionally, the senses in the group are assumed to be the most suitable senses of words for the given semantic category or semantic topic. This assumption is more likely to be correct if the number of given words in a category is big enough (it is usually easier to uniquely determine the sense of words given more words). Moreover, empirically, the number of iterations needed for probabilities to converge is less than ten (Usually, six is enough. It took only three iterations for words in Figure 6 to converge.); a quick scan of the results of this sense-assigning step reveals that the aforementioned assumption leads to satisfying sense analyses.

LLOCE contains 15,000 distinct entries for all open-class words, providing semantic fields of a pragmatic, everyday common sense index for easy reference. The words in LLOCE are organized into approximately 2,500 semantic word sets. These sets are divided into 129 semantic categories and further organized as 14 semantic fields. Thus, the semantic field, category, and word set in LLOCE constitute a three-level hierarchy, in which each semantic field contains 7 to 12 categories and each category contains 10 to 50 sets of semantic related words. The LLOCE is based on coarse, topical semantic classes, making them more appropriate for WSD than other finer-grained lexica. Alternatively, Roget’s Thesaurus can be used as the thesaurus."]},{"title":"4.1.2 Data Source 2: A Word Sense Inventory","paragraphs":["For our experiments, we need comprehensive coverage of word senses.

Results and Discussions","paragraphs":["Two pertinent sides were addressed for the evaluation of our results. The first was whether such a model for a thesaurus-based semantic classification could generate collocation clusters correlating with human word meaning similarities to a significant extent.

In the following sections, two evaluation metrics are described to respectively examine our results in these two aspects, that is, the accuracy of   274 Chung-Chi Huang et al. our collocation clusters and the helpfulness of our labels in terms of language learning."]},{"title":"5.1 Performance Evaluation for Semantic Clusters","paragraphs":["Traditional cluster evaluation (Salton, 1989) might not be suited to assess our model, where we aim to facilitate collocation referencing and help learners improve their collocation production. Hence, to evaluate the performance of our clustering results, an evaluation sheet made up of test items, resembling synonym test items of the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), was automatically generated for human judgment. Landauer and Dumais (1997) first proposed using the synonym test items of TOEFL as an evaluation method for semantic similarity. Fewer fully automatic methods of a knowledge acquisition evaluation, i.e., ones that do not depend on knowledge being entered by a human, have been capable of performing well on a full scale test used to measure semantic similarity. A test item provided by Landauer (1997, as cited in Padó & Lapata, 2007) is shown below where “crossroads” is the synonym for “intersection” in the context. You will find the office at the main intersection. (a) place (b) crossroads (c) roundabout (d) building","As to our experiment, we evaluated the semantic relatedness among collocation clusters according to the above-mentioned TOEFL benchmark by setting up test items out of our clustering results. Then, human judges performed a decision task similar to TOEFL test takers: deciding which one of the four alternatives was synonymous with the target word. A sample question is shown below where “rocky” is clearly the most similar word for “sandy” given the pivot word “beach”. sandy beach (a) long (b) rocky (c)super (d)narrow","There were 150 multiple-choice questions randomly constructed to test the accuracy of our clusters, 50 questions for each collocation types (i.e., A-N, V-N, and V-N) and 10 for each of collocation pairs. In order to evaluate the degree to which our model achieved production of good clusters, two judges were asked to choose the most appropriate answer. More than one answer was allowed if the judges found some of the distractors in the test items to be plausible answers. Moreover, the judges were allowed not to choose any of the alternatives given if they thought no satisfactory answer was provided. Table 5 shows the performance of collocation clusters generated by JustTheWord and the proposed system. As suggested in the table, our model achieved significantly higher precision and recall in comparison with our baseline, JustTheWord.

The evaluation is aimed at examining the extent to which semantic labels are useful, and to what degree of reliability.","Two native speakers were asked to grade half of the labeled collocations randomly selected from our classifying results (all test data considered). A three-point rubric is used to evaluate the effectiveness, or usefulness, of the given semantic labels in terms of navigating users to the desired collocates. The three types of rubric points with their descriptions are: three points for those collocations with effective semantic labels in navigation in a collocation reference tool, two points for those with somewhat helpful assigned labels, and one point for those with misleading labels.","Table 5 shows that 77% of the semantic labels assigned as a reference guide have been judged as adequate in terms of guiding a user finding a desired collocation in a collocation learning tool and that our classification model provably yields productive performance of semantic labeling of collocates to be used to assist language learners. The results justify the thought that the move towards semantic classification of collocations is of probative value.","Table 6 shows that 76% of the semantic labels assigned as a reference guide were judged adequate in terms of guiding users to find a desired collocation in a collocation learning tool, and this suggests that our classification model yielded promising performance in semantically labeling collocates further to be used to assist language learners.

Conclusion and Future Work","paragraphs":["The research seeks to create a thesaurus-based semantic classifier within a collocation reference tool without meaning access indices. We describe a thesaurus-based semantic classification for a semantic grouping of collocates with a pivot word. The construction of a collocation thesaurus is meant to enhance L2 learners’ collocation production. Our classification model is based on two graph-based Random Walk Algorithms (i.e., word sense assignment and semantic label assignment) to categorize collocations into semantically-related groups for easy dictionary lookup and collocation understanding and production. The limited vocabulary size of the semantic thesaurus is dealt with using the sense information and the semantic operators in the word sense inventory, WordNet. The evaluation shows that the thesaurus structure imposed by our model for an existing computational collocation reference tool is quite accurate and is helpful for users to navigate the collocations of a pivot word.","Many avenues exist for future research and improvement of our system. For example, semantic relations existing between word senses may take on different weights in that some may be more informative than others in determining semantic similarities. Another interesting direction to explore is to see if our model can benefit from other thesauri with semantic labels."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Benson, M. (1985).
