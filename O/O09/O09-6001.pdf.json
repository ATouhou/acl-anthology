The examination of VOT values for Mandarin and Hakka word-initial stops /p, t, k, ph",", th",", kh","/ followed by three vowels /i, u, a/ in different lexical tones revealed that lexical tone has significant influence on the VOT values for stops. The results are important as they suggest that future studies should take the influence of lexical tone into account when studying VOT values and when designing wordlists for stops in tonal languages. In Mandarin, stops’ VOT values, from the longest to the shortest, are in MR, FR, HL, and HF tones. This sequence is the same as in Liu, Ng, Wan, Wang, and Zhang (2008). Later, however, it was found that it is very likely that the sequence results from the existence of non-words. In order to produce non-words correctly, participants tended to pronounce them at a slower speed, especially those in MR tone. Therefore, we further examined the data without non-words, in which no clear sequence was found. For Hakka, post-hoc tests (Scheffe) show that aspirated stops in entering tones, which are syllables ending with a stop, have significantly shorter VOT values than they have in other tones. Although the tonal effects on VOT values are not consistently found in different sets of data, probably due to a methodology problem, the possibility of tonal effect on VOT values could not be excluded. Tonal effect, thus, should be taken into consideration in designing word lists for VOT studies. Moreover, further studies should include both real words and non-words in separate sets of word lists to verify the current study results.

Introduction","paragraphs":["The aim of this paper is to explore whether lexical tones influence the VOT values for word-initial stops. This issue is important because VOT is considered one of the reliable acoustic features for differentiating consonant stops (Cho & Ladefoged, 1999; Gósy, 2001; Lisker & Abramson, 1964; Riney, Takagi, Ota, & Uchida, 2007; Rochet & Fei, 1991; Zheng & Li, 2005) and it has been applied recently to the study of the language production of patients with language deficits or disorders (Auzou, Ozsancak, Morris, Jan, Eustache, & Hannequin, 2000; Jäncke, 1994). Among the languages being investigated, some are tonal languages, i.e. Mandarin, Cantonese, and Taiwanese. In a tonal language, the duration of each lexical tone (which can change the meaning of a word) differs slightly. Consequently, it is possible that lexical tone will affect stops’ VOT to some extent; nevertheless, few studies have taken this factor into consideration when studying tonal languages. Therefore, the current study examines two tonal languages, Mandarin and Hakka spoken in Taiwan, to verify the effects of lexical tone. It is hoped that the results of the current study can establish the groundwork for future studies related to VOTs in tonal languages. If lexical tone does influence VOT, it should be considered when creating speech materials in future studies for tonal languages."]},{"title":"2. Literature Review 2.1 Voice Onset Time (VOT)","paragraphs":["Lisker and Abramson (1964) defined VOT as the temporal interval from the release of an initial stop to the onset of glottal pulsing for a following vowel. VOT has been considered a reliable phonetic cue for categorizing stop consonants (i.e., voiced versus voiceless or unaspirated versus aspirated) in various languages (Cho & Ladefoged, 1999; Gósy, 2001; Keating, Linker, & Huffman, 1983; Lisker & Abramson, 1964; Riney et al., 2007; Rochet & Fei, 1991; Zheng & Li, 2005). In addition, by comparing VOT values for stops produced by native and non-native speakers for specific languages, researchers have put forth specific suggestions for language learning and teaching (Liao, 2005; Riney & Takagi, 1999; Zheng & Li, 2005). Moreover, recently, researchers have studied production deficits of aphasia, apraxia, and stuttering patients by observing their VOT values for stops (Jäncke, 1994; Auzou et al., 2000; Tsen, 1994)."]},{"title":"2.2 Factors Affecting Voice Onset Time","paragraphs":["When investigating stops, researchers found that the VOT values for stops varied in relation to the place of articulation. Lisker and Abramson (1964) demonstrated that, for both unaspirated and aspirated stops, velar stops have longer mean VOT values than alveolar and bilabial stops.   Tonal Effects on Voice Onset Time 343 In the languages examined, except for Tamil, Cantonese, and Eastern Armenian, alveolar stops tend to have longer mean VOT values than bilabial stops. Cho and Ladefoged’s (1999) study further revealed that velar stops have the longest mean VOT values, alveolar stops have intermediate mean VOTs, and bilabial stops have the shortest mean VOTs, with the exception of Navajo and Dahalo. The fact that VOT values get longer when the place of articulation moves from an anterior to a posterior position is confirmed in most languages (Cho & Ladefoged, 1999; Lisker & Abramson, 1964; Rosner, López- Bascuas, García-Albea, & Fahey, 2000; Zheng & Li, 2005); nevertheless, some exceptions exist, including Hungarian, Japanese, and Mandarin.","As for the influence of vowel context, Lisker and Abramson (1967) reported that the vowels following the consonants do not have a significant effect on stops’ VOTs. Recently, however, other researchers have made opposing claims. Morris, McCrea, & Herring (2008), who studied English word-initial stops, claimed that stops preceding the high vowels /i/ and /u/ had longer VOTs than stops preceding the low vowel /a/. Similar results were revealed in Rochet and Fei (1991), Chao, Khattab, and Chen (2006), and Chen, Chao, and Peng (2007) studies of Mandarin and Gósy’s (2001) study of Hungarian. Furthermore, Gósy (2001) indicated that the higher the tongue position, the longer the VOTs for the preceding voiceless stops. Fant (1973), however, found the opposite to be true in a study of Swedish: the VOTs for aspirated stops preceding /a/ were longer than the VOTs for stops preceding /i/ and /u/. Fant’s results are extraordinary, as most studies report that stops preceding high vowels tend to have longer VOTs than stops preceding low vowels.","Moreover, speaking rate might have influences on stops’ VOTs. Kessinger and Blumstein (1997), who investigated English, French, and Thai, claimed that the speaking rate affected VOT values for long lag stops in Thai and English and for pre-voiced stops in Thai and French, but did not influence VOTs in the short lag category. Magloire and Green (1999) suggested that the speaking rate affected English monolinguals’ VOT production and Spanish monolinguals’ production of pre-voicing of the voiced stops. By examining English, Kessinger and Blumstein (1998) also reported that both VOT and vowel duration increased as the speaking rate slowed down. Gósy’s (2001) study results further proved this. Gósy found that Hungarian bilabial and velar stops had significantly shorter mean VOTs in natural fluent speech than in carefully produced speech. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that, in careful speech, the speaking rate will decrease and the accompanying VOT will get longer.","The VOT values for word-initial stops in various languages have been extensively investigated. Although some of the languages studied are tonal languages (e.g., Mandarin, Taiwanese, and Cantonese), few studies have considered the effects of lexical tone when designing speech materials (Chao et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2007; Liao, 2005; Lisker & Abramson, 1964; Rochet & Fei, 1991). Gu (2005) claimed that tone is affected primarily by   344 Jui-Feng Peng et al. pitch. Different tones have different pitch levels, which are determined by the vibrating frequency of the vocal cord. When the vocal cord tenses, the frequency of vibration increases, resulting in a higher pitch level. Conversely, the pitch level is low when the vocal cord is loose. Liu, Ng, Wan, Wang, and Zhang (2008) speculated that VOT durations may be affected by tone, as different tones have different fundamental frequencies and pitch levels, which are determined primarily by the tension of the vibrating structure. In order to achieve different levels of tension, different amounts of time might be needed. Consequently, VOT values may vary when they occur in different lexical tones. Gu (2005) further indicated that duration affects lexical tone to some extent; for example, in Hakka, the entering tone is short and rapid, meaning less time is needed to produce it. In a tonal language, the durations for each lexical tone are slightly different; therefore, it is reasonable that lexical tone might have some effects on stops’ VOTs. Liu et al. (2008), who studied the effect of tonal changes on VOTs between normal laryngeal and superior esophageal speakers of Mandarin Chinese, reported an important finding. Normal laryngeal speakers produce significant differences in VOT values as a result of lexical tones. According to their results (Figure 1), stops in the High-falling tone have significantly shorter mean VOT values than stops in the Mid-rising tone and Falling-rising tone. Nevertheless, it should be noted that, in Liu et al.’s study, some of the speech materials were non-words. The researchers did not determine whether participants produced real words and non-words differently; therefore, more studies examining the influences of tone are needed. By carrying out a systematic study with respect to the influence of lexical tone on a stop’s VOT using two tonal languages (i.e., Mandarin and Hakka spoken in Taiwan), the current study aims to create a foundation for future linguistic studies focused on tonal languages.

","paragraphs":["Tonal Effects on Voice Onset Time 345"]},{"title":"2.3 Tones in Mandarin and Hakka Spoken in Taiwan","paragraphs":["Mandarin and Hakka only have voiceless stops; therefore, the current study investigates the unaspirated stops /p, t, k/ and aspirated stops /ph",", th",", kh","/. In addition, Mandarin and Hakka are tonal languages, in which a word’s meaning can be changed by the tone in which it is pronounced. Chao (1967) suggested a numerical notation for lexical tones, dividing a speaker’s pitch range into four equal intervals by five points: 1 (low), 2 (half-low), 3 (middle), 4 (half-high), and 5 (high). The numerical notation indicates how the pitches of a lexical tone change. For example, the numerical notation for a Mid-rising tone in Mandarin is 35, which indicates that the pitch will go from middle to high. Mandarin has four contrasting lexical tones: High-level (HL) (55), Mid-rising (MR) (35), Falling-rising (FR) (214), and High-falling (HF) (51). Sixian Hakka has six contrasting lexical tones: low-rising (LR) (24), mid-falling (MF) (31), high-level (HL) (55), low-entering (LE) (32), low-level (LL) (11), and high-entering (HE) (55). Among them, LE and HE tones are short and rapid, and the words in these two tones end in a stop, like /p/, /t/, /k/.","Mandarin Chinese and Hakka have specific tone sandhi rules. In Mandarin, FR tone, which has the longest duration among the four lexical tones, becomes MR tone when followed by another FR tone (Cheng, 1973). In Sixian Hakka, LR tone becomes LL tone when preceding a LR tone, HL tone, or HE tone. Therefore, tone sandhi rules are taken into consideration when developing speech materials in order to avoid the combinations that might cause tonal change.  Mandarin (Chao, 1967) FR Tone → MR Tone / {FR Tone}  Sixian Hakka (Chung, 2004) LR Tone → LL Tone / {LR Tone, HL Tone, HE Tone}"]},{"title":"3.

The Mandarin participants included 15 male and 15 female Mandarin speakers from Tainan City with an age range from 23 to 33 years (mean = 27.2 years). All participants had grown up in Taiwan and had no hearing or speech defects. For Hakka, Sixian Hakka was chosen because it is the most extensively used Hakka dialect in Taiwan. The average age of the 21 participants - 11 men and 10 women - was 51 years, with the oldest being 80 and the youngest being 36. All of the participants for Hakka were also fluent Mandarin speakers as Mandarin is the official language in Taiwan. In the current study, the age range of Mandarin participants is controlled to within 10 years to avoid the effect of age difference. As for Hakka participants, the age-range was quite wide because it is not easy to find fluent Hakka speakers."]},{"title":"3.2 Data Collection","paragraphs":["The speech materials in both languages were combinations of six stops /p, t, k, ph",", th",", kh","/ and three vowels /i, u, a/, resulting in 18 combinations. Mandarin’s 4 contrasting lexical tones meant that a total of 72 monosyllabic words were created; among them, 18 combinations do not have corresponding Chinese characters in Mandarin. The 6 contrasting lexical tones in Sixian Hakka resulted in 108 monosyllabic words, 12 of which do not have corresponding Chinese characters. Chen et al. (2007) claimed that disyllabic words can create a more natural-like context for participants. Therefore, in order to make speakers produce the words more naturally, all of the words were followed by another word in order to create meaningful disyllables, including non-words. For example, the Mandarin word /pi/ was followed by another word /ph","uo/ to become the existing disyllable /pi ph","uo/ “force.” Even non-words were arranged in disyllabic forms to give them a more natural-like quality. Since the neutral tone in Mandarin never occurs in phrase-initial position, it was not evaluated in this study. The structure of non-words was the same as real words, which is a CV syllable with one consonant (stop) and one vowel (corner vowel). For example, there is no /kh","a/ in MR tone in Mandarin or /pu/ in MF tone in Hakka, so non-words were created for these combinations. The way we measure VOTs of non-words is the same as with the real words. For example, /kh","a/ is measured from target consonant /kh","/ to /a/.","The corpus was arranged randomly. Participants were asked to read the words out loud in a normal voice and at a comfortable rate. After finishing, the participants were asked to read the words a second time. Therefore, two groups of data were gathered for each participant.

Results and Discussion","paragraphs":["When examining the VOT values for Mandarin stops, it became apparent that they tend to be longer than the mean VOT values reported in the studies by Liao (2005), Chao et al. (2006), and Chen et al. (2007) and shorter than those reported by Rochet and Fei (1991). Examining the methodologies in these previous studies indicated that the speech materials in Rochet and Fei’s study were monosyllabic, but disyllabic in the remaining four studies. Gósy (2001) claimed that speakers speak in a careful and disciplined way while uttering syllables and words in isolation. Therefore, participants are expected to produce monosyllables in a more careful manner as their speech tempo decreases. According to Kessinger and Blumstein (1998), VOTs get longer while the speaking rate slows down. This may explain why the mean VOTs for Mandarin stops in Rochet and Fei’s study were longer than in other reports. Another possible explanation might be regional differences in the target language. Although the target language is the same, participants in Rochet and Fei’s study grew up in Mainland China, while participants in the other studies were raised in Taiwan. Consequently, regional differences might be another origin of the variations. As a result, comparing the results of Liao (2005), Chao et al. (2006), and Chen et al. (2007) to those of the present study indicates that the mean VOT values for the stops in the present study tend to be longer than their counterparts in the other studies. Such differences stem primarily from the existence of non-words in the current study. During the recording process, speakers tended to produce non-words more carefully and at a lower speed because they were not familiar with the non-words. An examination of the data both with and without non-words separately demonstrated that the existence of non-words resulted in stops having longer mean VOTs.

Unaspirated and aspirated stops in LR and LL have longer mean VOTs than stops in other tones, whereas the shortest mean VOTs for both unaspirated and aspirated stops are in HE. The post-hoc test revealed that aspirated stops in HE and LE have significantly shorter mean VOTs than those in other tones (all p < .001). In Hakka, HE and LE tones are entering tones, which are short, rapid, and end in a stop like /p, t, k/. Gu (2005) further claimed that the durations for entering tones are shorter than the durations for other tones. Therefore, the VOTs for stops in the entering tones are shorter than stops in other tones."]},{"title":"Table 3. Mean VOT values of Hakka stops with different lexical tones.

Conclusion","paragraphs":["The study results revealed that lexical tones significantly influence VOT values for stops in Mandarin (with both real words and non-words), and significant tonal effect was also found in   Tonal Effects on Voice Onset Time 355 Hakka data of real words. Nevertheless, there is no significant tonal effect on VOT in Mandarin data with only real words.","The study results are important as they suggest that future studies should take the influence of lexical tones into account when studying VOT values and when designing wordlists for stops in tonal languages. Although the tonal effects on VOT values are not consistently found in different sets of data, probably due to a methodology problem, the possibility of tonal effect on VOT values could not be excluded. Several factors might contribute to this inconsistency. First, we used different methods in eliciting non-words production in these two languages. In Mandarin, we used Zhuyin Fuhao to guide non-words productions, which might force participants to take a few seconds to figure out the new combinations of Chinese phonetic symbols. In contrast, we asked participants to read a real word first as a clue in producing a target non-word in Hakka. Second, many of the participants in Hakka were at the age range of 50-80, and we found the participants were not flexible enough to comprehend our instructions in producing non-words. Therefore, we decided not to take the data of non-words (mostly by guessing with uncertainly) into analysis in order to have a reliable result. (The discarded cells (non-words) are less than 25% of the total, which fulfills the requirements of ANOVA test for reliable test results (Gravetter & Wallnau, 2008). Future studies should keep the method of elicitation consistent across languages, recruit participants of similar age range, and include both real words and non-words in separate sets of word lists in order to verify the current study findings. Moreover, although the results of this study indicate that lexical tones influence VOT of stops to some extent, we cannot exclude the possibility of correlation between VOT and the duration of lexical tones. Further study can explore this possibility by adopting mean durations of each tone in Mandarin as the normalized parameters upon calculating mean VOTs of stops."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Auzou, P., Ozsancak, C., Morris, R.
