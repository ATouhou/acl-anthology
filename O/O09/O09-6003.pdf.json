Our method achieves an f-score of 0.734 in the NTCIR7 MOAT task on the Traditional Chinese side, which is the best performance among results of machine learning methods proposed by participants, and also it is close to the best performance of this task.

Introduction","paragraphs":["Opinions describe subjective thinking of people. With the blooming of Web 2.0, a large number of free and online articles have become easily accessible. Although people are interested in the shifting of opinions, they cannot read such a large quantity of articles in a short time. Opinion mining can analyze opinions from many information sources automatically and helps extract opinions, along with determining their polarities, strength, holders, and targets. Opinion polarities tell us whether the current opinions are positive, neutral, or negative. The opinion strength then tells us the degree of their attitude, i.e., strong, medium, or weak. Opinion holders are the people who express opinions, while opinion targets are the objects of those opinions. Let us take “Mr. Wang loves to play baseball” as an example. In this opinion sentence, its polarity is positive, its strength is strong, the opinion holder is Mr. Wang, and the opinion target is playing baseball. It is an opinion from Mr. Wang that indicates  ∗ Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, No. 1, Sec. 4, Roosevelt Road, Taipei, 10617 Taiwan, TEL: +886-2-33664888*311, FAX: +886-2-23628167 E-mail: {lwku, cylee}@nlg.csie.ntu.edu.tw; hhchen@csie.ntu.edu.tw   384 Lun-Wei Ku et al. he has a positive attitude towards playing baseball.","Opinion holder identification is useful in knowing who has the same attitude, what kind of issues a specific person cares about, and whether there are different opinions from some specific persons. This technique can also be applied to social network analysis to discover who the opinion leader is. It is also important in an opinion question answering system as it can provide the owner of opinions.","There are three major challenges in opinion holder identification: co-reference resolution, parsing nested opinions, and inconsistent annotation utilization. Like the conventional question answering problem, pronoun-antecedent and zero anaphor problems have to be solved before identifying opinion holders. Nested opinions are common in long sentences. People like to quote opinions of other people to show that they are impartial, but this behavior also implies that they agree with their quotes. In this case, we need to identify both the quoting and the quoted holders for further analysis.","It is sometimes difficult to determine the holder of an opinion. For example, even though the holder is obvious in the opinion sentence, we may find that he represents some organization and is presenting the organization’s opinion. The following sentence is an example: “According to the media, [the] U.S. and China are discussing the agreement of terminating the usage of nuclear weapons; Becon said they have discussed this issue before.” In this sentence, “they” refers to the U.S. and China. Becon quoted words from the U.S. and China, so this is a nested structure. In addition, although this expression is said by the media and Becon, the holder should be the U.S. and China. These challenges all complicate the annotation process, and a double check and a selection process are necessary when generating the gold standard."]},{"title":"2. Related Work","paragraphs":["Pang and Lee (2008) have mentioned some important research projects in the domain of opinion mining. Kim and Hovy (2004) proposed four elements in opinion mining, including the opinion polarity, the opinion strength, the opinion holder, and the opinion target. Among them, the research for opinion holder identification is new. Previous researchers mainly have proposed two kinds of methods: heuristic rule based and machine learning based methods."]},{"title":"2.1 Heuristic Rule based Methods","paragraphs":["For heuristic rule based methods, Seki et al. (2009) utilized noun phrases and linguistic features, and adopted SVM to classify opinion holders into authors and non-authors in English and Japanese materials. Xu and Wang (2008) first solved the co-reference resolution, and extracted opinion holders by rules involving punctuation marks, conjunctions, prefixes,   Identification of Opinion Holders 385 suffixes, and opinion operators. They achieved an f-score of 0.825 in the NTCIR7 MOAT task on the Traditional Chinese side, which is the state of the art."]},{"title":"2.2 Machine Learning based Methods","paragraphs":["For the machine learning based methods, many researchers have adopted maximum entropy algorithms, SVM, or the conditional random field model. Kim and Hovy (2006) utilized the maximum entropy model to extract opinion holders and targets from news articles. They first found opinion words and labeled semantic roles, then identified the semantic roles that are opinion holders and targets. Kim (2007, 2008) classified opinion holders into authors, simple holders and co-referenced holders, then extracted lexical and syntactic features for SVM to select the best opinion holder. So far, this is the best method for English materials, and it achieved an f-score of 0.346. Wu (2008) used words and parts of speech as features in L2-norm linear SVM to solve this research problem as a similar method for named entity identification. Breck and Choi (2007, 2005) utilized lexical features, syntactic features, dictionary-based features, and dependency features by CRF to identify opinion holders. Meng and Wang (2008) used words, parts of speech, and opinion operators, while Liu and Zhao (2008) extracted parts of speech, semantic features, contextual features, dependency features, and position features by CRF."]},{"title":"2.3 Proposed Methods","paragraphs":["We propose a unique approach that divides opinion holder identification into two tasks: author’s opinion recognition and opinion holder labeling. We then find better strategies to perform these two tasks. For author’s opinion recognition, we adopt SVM by features such as words and their parts of speech, named entities, punctuation marks, the context, and opinion related information in the current sentence. Among them, some context features (the roles of verbs) and opinion related features (information of positive words, neutral words, negative words, and opinion operators) have not been utilized in opinion holder identification before. Detailed features will be described in Sections 3.2 and 3.3."]},{"title":"3. Opinion Holder Identification","paragraphs":["Five procedures of opinion holder identification are proposed in this paper, including text pre-processing, author’s opinion recognition, opinion holder labeling, post-processing, and result generation. Chinese word segmentation, parts of speech tagging, and named entity recognition are performed in the text pre-processing stage. Then, author’s opinions are recognized and opinion holder labeling determines the text segment referring to the holder. We have two strategies for applying the proposed methods of author’s opinion recognition and opinion holder labeling. These two strategies are described in Section 3.5. After that, this   386 Lun-Wei Ku et al. labeled text segment is processed by the post-processing procedure to generate the final opinion holder.

We, however, modify its segmentation module and add additional name dictionaries to it. The length limit of the modified Chinese name module is set looser and Japanese family names are added so that the segmentation system can recognize Japanese names, which are usually longer than Chinese names. Occupations, titles, and company names are also added to the dictionary of the segmentation system to provide useful holder relevant information."]},{"title":"3.2 Author’s Opinion Recognition Stage","paragraphs":["Author’s opinion recognition finds out whether the opinion holder of the current sentence is the author. In this paper, this task is viewed as a binary classification task and LIBSVM (Chang & Lin, 2001) is adopted for classification. The main features extracted for this task are words, parts of speech, named entities, punctuation marks, sentence components, and opinion operators. Table 1 shows all of the features utilized in this task. The lexicon features include   Identification of Opinion Holders 387 first person pronouns, which are often utilized by the authors to refer to themselves. The part-of-speech features include general pronouns and personal pronouns, because pronouns usually refer to persons and organizations and they can express opinions.

For example, exclamation points and question marks often appear in sentences expressed by people because they can bear sentiment, whereas colons and quotations are usually used to quote expressed words. The sentential features tell the length of the sentences by their composite characters, words, and clauses. We consider these features because we think that authors may need a sentence of a suitable length to express opinions. As to the opinion features, a total of 203 opinion operators, such as 說 (say), 指出 (point out), and 認為 (think), are collected manually from the earlier NTCIR corpus (Seki et al., 2008) for this task."]},{"title":"3.3 Opinion Holder Labeling Stage","paragraphs":["Opinion holder labeling finds the text segment that represents the opinion holder.

It is a pruned decision tree using the chi-square test.","As the other alternative, we view the opinion holder labeling problem as a sequential labeling problem.

Some of the features are the same as those we have selected for the author’s opinion recognition. The lexicon feature is the current word to be determined. The part-of-speech features of the current word include its part of speech, and whether it is a noun or a pronoun. The binary properties of being a noun or a pronoun are emphasized here because they are the most commonly seen parts of speech in opinion holders. Punctuation marks also are considered as features here. Sentential features tell the position of the current word in the current sentence. They are included in the feature set because, according to our observations,  1 The part of speech tagging set is listed in Technical Report no. 95-02/98-04, Chinese Knowledge Information Processing Group, Academia Sinica.   390 Lun-Wei Ku et al. holders often appear in the beginning or at the end of the sentence. The context features include the information of the nearest verbs with respect to the current word. If the current word is a part of the opinion holder, its nearest verb could be an opinion operator. The collocation of the current word and the nearest verb are considered. For the opinion information, the appearance of opinion operators, positive words, neutral words, and negative words are considered. Here, positive words are words used to express a supportive attitude, such as success, good, etc.; neutral words express an impartial attitude, such as no comment, difficult to say, etc.; negative words express opposite attitude, such as objection, accusation, etc. The occurrence of opinion words may indicate the existence of opinions, and opinions may further indicate the existence of their holders. The method of utilizing contextual and opinion information, along with the features of nouns and pronouns, are first proposed in this paper.","The training set for the NTCIR-7 MOAT Task, introduced in Section 4.1, is adopted for extracting training features and for building models. As the size of this set is not large, the co-training method is adopted to improve the performance (Blum & Mitchell, 1998). Co-training is a semi-supervised learning method that trains models together with labeled and un-labeled materials. In co-training, sentences with high CRF confidence scores are selected, and sentences among them without words that are portions of the opinion holder are dropped. These selected sentences, along with their predicted labels, are fed back to the CRF system as the training sentences in the next iteration. The co-training process is shown in Figure 2."]},{"title":"Figure 2.

Nevertheless, opinion holders often are composed of multiple words, and we need to combine these words to propose the final result if the holder is longer than one word."]},{"title":"3.4.1 Processing Phrasal Opinion Holders","paragraphs":["In our experiments for processing phrasal opinion holders, five labels are used to label words in CRF opinion holder labeling: H (head word), I (middle word), T (tail word), S (single word), and O (not opinion portion), abbreviated as HITSO hereafter. Instead, when working with CHAID, the decision tree, it can only generate two labels “YES” and “NO” to tell whether the current word is a portion of the opinion holder. In this phase, comparing the performances of using different label sets is not the focus, so we just use the label set HITSO. The effect of different labels will be tested later.","Different post-processing rules are applied according to the tagging sets. If words are labeled by the tagging set H, I, T, S, and O by CRF, we use the following rules to combine words to a phrase if necessary: (1) Find the H labeled word with the highest confidence score in the current sentence. (2) Combine the sequent I labeled words until a T labeled word is found.","(3) The final opinion holder includes words that begin from the word with label H found in (1) to the word with label T found in (2).","(4) If all words in the current sentence are all labeled “O”, the opinion holder will be set to the author.","If words are labeled with the tagging set {YES, NO} by CHAID, we use the following three rules to combine words to a phrase if necessary:","(1) Combine consecutive nouns. For example, “印度 (India, Nc) 總統 (president, Na) 瓦希德 (Abdurrahman Wahid, Nb)” are combined into one opinion holder phrase.","(2) Use conjunctions and “、” (a mark in Chinese punctuations to list items in a series) to combine nouns into one holder group. For example, “瓦希德 (Abdurrahman Wahid, Nb) 、 (PAUSECATEGORY) 柯林頓 (Clinton, Nb) 與 (and, Caa) 小淵惠三 (Keizo Obuchi, Nb)” are combined into one opinion holder group.

These segmentation errors will make opinion holders incomplete, so recovering wrongly segmented named entities is necessary. In this paper, we postulate that the number of occurrences of a complete named entity should be the same as its partial sequences. Therefore, we will compare the occurrences of the current holder sequence with the current holder sequence plus its previous/following word to decide whether we should combine them to generate a more complete opinion holder. For example, in the sentence “Indonesian big man Suharto ruled Indonesia for 32 years,” the name “Suharto” is translated into “蘇哈托”. Nevertheless, this name is wrongly segmented into two words ”蘇哈” and “托”. In this case, we will check whether the number of appearance of “蘇哈托” is the same as ”蘇哈”. If it is, we will combine ”蘇哈” and “托” into one word “蘇哈托”. This process is done iteratively until the numbers of appearance of the current word and that plus the previous/following word are not the same. In this example, we further check the next word “統”. In doing so, we will find that the numbers of appearance of “蘇哈托” and “蘇哈托統” are not the same. Therefore, the recovery process stops and we propose “蘇哈托” as the opinion holder.

Therefore, different tagging sets were tested (IO, ISO, HTO, HISO, HITSO, etc.), and we have found that using the tagging set {H, I, O} can achieve the best performance, which is the set f-score of 70.57% for strict opinion sentences. We also propose the name entity recovery method to deal with errors of the sixth type. Experiments show that with co-training, the best confidence score threshold 0.7 and the named entity recovery, our system achieves the best set f-score of 72.03%."]},{"title":"4.5 Experiments for Opinion Holder Identification","paragraphs":["After author’s opinion recognition and opinion holder labeling, we need to propose the opinion holder according to these results.

WIA’s system performs the best in both evaluation metrics. WIA adopts heuristic rules to design their systems. Therefore, our system performs the best among all systems using machine learning methods. Moreover, our system performs better for strict opinion sentences, which is different from other systems. In other words, our system is good at identifying the holder of opinions that were consistently annotated by annotators.   Identification of Opinion Holders 399"]},{"title":"Table 6.

Conclusion and Future Work","paragraphs":["We proposed a machine learning based method for opinion holder identification. We classified this task into two subtasks: author’s opinion recognition and opinion holder labeling. SVM was adopted for author’s opinion recognition, and CRF was adopted for opinion holder labeling. We proposed lexical, syntactic, contextual, and opinion features. Named entities and punctuation marks were also utilized as features. We tested different tagging sets to find the best set {H, I, O}. Co-training was proposed to solve the problem of insufficient training materials, and results merging strategies were proposed to improve the performance. We also mentioned the methods of utilizing inconsistent annotated materials and analyzed system errors to find solutions for improving the performance.","The proposed system for the opinion holder identification achieved an f-score of 0.734, which is the best among machine learning based systems and is close to the state of the art. The state of the art system adopts heuristic rules. Nevertheless, heuristic rule based systems like it are difficult to rebuild because the rules are usually not described in detail in the previous literature. In the future, we hope to solve the co-reference resolution problem, which is important in   400 Lun-Wei Ku et al. named entity extraction and also in opinion holder extraction. In addition, we plan to add parsing information to improve the performance. Finding a good named entity recovery algorithm is also one of our next attempts. In summary, utilizing techniques of opinion holder identification in the opinion analysis system to compare opinions of different people is our future goal."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Blum, A., & Mitchell, T.
