We use the more than 62,000 entries of the Taiwanese-Mandarin dictionary and 10 million words of Mandarin training data to tag Taiwanese. The literary written Taiwanese corpora have both Romanized script and Han-Romanization mixed script, and include prose, novels, and dramas. We follow the tagset drawn up by CKIP. We developed a word alignment checker to assist with the word alignment for the two scripts. It searches the Taiwanese-Mandarin dictionary to find corresponding Mandarin candidate words, selects the most suitable Mandarin word using an HMM probabilistic model from the Mandarin training data, and tags the word using an MEMM classifier. We achieve an accuracy rate of 91.6% on Taiwanese POS tagging work, and we analyze the errors. We also discover some preliminary Taiwanese training data.

Introduction 1.1 Background","paragraphs":["There are about 46 million Southern Min speakers in the world. If we list languages by the size of their speaking population, Southern Min is ranked 21. The Southern Min speakers are mainly distributed in eight countries(Gordon, 2005). It is an important language that has received very little attention.","The percentage of Southern Min speakers in Taiwan was over 70% (Huang, 1995). Taiwan has the highest percentage of Southern Min speakers in the world. We will call this language as “Taiwanese” for simplification in this paper.","Many different types of written Taiwanese systems exist. Among these systems, the Han character script and one of the Romanized scripts (Pe̍h-ōe-jī, 白話字, abbrev. POJ, vernacular writing) are the most popular. Also, the mixture of the above two scripts, called the Han-Romanization mixed script (abbrev. as HR mixed script), has been adopted by many people (Iunn, 2009)."]},{"title":"1.2 Motivation","paragraphs":["In order to establish the bases of written Taiwanese processing, we have constructed some tools over the past few years, including an online Taiwanese syllable dictionary (Iunn, 2003a); an online Taiwanese-Mandarin dictionary (abbrev. OTMD) (Iunn, 2000, 2003b); a 5,800,000 syllable HR mixed script and 3,400,000 syllable POJ script Taiwanese corpus; the online Taiwanese concordancer system based on this corpus (Iunn, 2003c; Iunn & Lau, 2007); preliminary Taiwanese word frequency reports for the Taiwanese POJ and HR mixed scripts, based on the above Taiwanese corpus (Iunn, 2005); the digital archive database for written Taiwanese (abbrev. DADWT) literature data with POJ and HR mixed script paragraph alignment (Iunn, 2007); etc.","We intend to annotate the Taiwanese corpus with POS markers for more advanced applications, including Taiwanese tone sandhi TTS system improvement (Iunn et al. 2007), Taiwanese Treebank construction, etc."]},{"title":"1.3 Problem","paragraphs":["The primary difficulty encountered in the POS tagging of Taiwanese corpora is the question, “What is the Taiwanese POS tagset?” To date, no standard tagset for Taiwanese has been proposed. Under the circumstances, we have temporarily employed the Chinese POS tagset established by the CKIP Group of Academia Sinica (CKIP, 1993). Unfortunately, we still encountered some problems because we did not have a Taiwanese dictionary that contained   Modeling Taiwanese POS Tagging 239 Using Statistical Methods and Mandarin Training Data the Mandarin POS tagset. The existing Taiwanese dictionaries merely contain basic vocabulary words, that is, nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.","Moreover, there was another problem to surmount – manpower shortage. We did not have enough manpower to fully execute the POS tagging of the Taiwanese corpora.","Therefore, we proposed employing statistical procedures with the existing Mandarin resources and the OTMD to automatically complete the Taiwanese POS tagging. We used the Mandarin language model under the assumption that the word sequence in Taiwanese is similar to Mandarin."]},{"title":"1.4 Review","paragraphs":["Shi (2006) translated the Mandarin sentences in the book, “Modern Chinese 800 words ‘現代 漢語八百詞’ ” (by Shu-xiang Lü) into Taiwanese and Hakka to establish the T3 corpus and developed some editing tools to help in the construction of the T3 Treebank. Chou (2006) used the Brill tagger based on the HMM model to tag words in the T3 Treebank. They used a tagset size of 26, and attained tagging accuracy rates of 92.80% and 85.59% for the training and test data, respectively.","T3 Treebank has not been released publicly. Thus, we decided to use different tagsets and different tagged corpora in our experiments."]},{"title":"2. POS Tagging Method","paragraphs":["Figure 1 shows our system architecture diagram.

Step 1 converts the texts to word alignment form. Step 2 adds the Mandarin candidate words (translations). Step 3 selects the best Mandarin translation using the HMM model. Finally, we decide the POS tagging of each word using the MEMM model. The following subsection will describe this process in detail.","For example, the original texts are “Tâi-ôan tē-it kôan ê Gio̍k-san ê hū-kūn khah kē ê só.","-chāi ... ” and “台灣 第一 懸 ê 玉山 ê 附近 較 低 ê 所在 ... ” Taiwan first high of Mt.Jade of nearby more low of place  Step 1 converts the texts to word alignment form: “台灣/Tâi-ôan 第一/tē-it 懸/kôan ê/ê 玉山/Gio̍k-san ê/ê 附近/hū-kūn 較/khah 低/kē ê/ê 所在/só.","-chāi ... ”  Then, Step 2 adds the Mandarin translations: “台灣/Tâi-ôan{台灣} 第一/tē-it{第一;絕頂} 懸/kôan{高} ê/ê{的} 玉山 /Gio̍k-san{玉山} ê/ê{的} 附近/hū-kūn{附近} 較/khah{較} 低/kē{低} ê/ê{的} 所在/só.","-chāi(去 處; 地方;角頭;所在;處所;場所;間量} ...” ","Step 3 selects the best Mandarin translation using the HMM model (we omit the original Taiwanese texts): “台灣 第一 高 的 玉山 的 附近 較 低 的 地方 ...”  Finally, Step 4 decides the POS tagging of each word using the MEMM model: “台灣/Tâi-ôan(Nc) 第一/tē-it(Neu) 懸/kôan(VH) ê/ê(DE) 玉山/ Gio̍k -san(Nc) ê/ê(DE) 附近/hū-kūn(Nc) 較/khah(Dfa) 低/kē(VH) ê/ê(DE) 所在/só.","-chāi(Na)... ”  We will illustrate our work with Figure 1 in the following subsections.

It contains both POJ and HR mixed scripts with paragraph by paragraph alignment, including novels, prose, dramas, and poems (Iunn, 2007)."]},{"title":"2.2 Word by Word Alignment","paragraphs":["First, we developed a word alignment program to aid manual processing. We arranged the word alignment of the two scripts, where the paragraphs were already aligned. This program not only collates the number of syllables in the two scripts, but it also compares and contrasts the two scripts with the entries of the OTMD. If the program does not find the two scripts within the same entry, it highlights the corresponding words to remind the user that the word may be an unknown word, an inconsistent usage of the Han character, or a typographical error.","The OTMD was announced and has been online since 2000. The main data provider is Robert L. Cheng, but many anonymous contributors also offer entries and correct the typographical errors. There are a total of more than 62,000 entries. The URL is http://iug.csie.dahan.edu. tw/q. This dictionary offers POJ, HR mixed script, and Mandarin fields, with the POJ field also offering the different accents. The pronunciation function was added in 2006, and English translation was added to more than 10,000 entries in 2007 based on Embree (1984), which contains English, Mandarin, and POJ fields."]},{"title":"2.3 Finding the Corresponding Mandarin Candidate Words","paragraphs":["Next, we continued to search for the corresponding Mandarin candidate words from the POJ and HR mixed script word pairs via the OTMD. The mapping was one-to-many. In short, a Taiwanese word pair would have more than one Mandarin word counterpart. For example, “愛 /ài” in Taiwanese has the meanings of “愛”‘love (person),’ “喜歡”‘like (thing),’ “要” ‘want to,’ “需要”‘need to,’ etc. in Mandarin. Nevertheless, we were not able to find counterparts for certain words, since they were not contained in the OTMD. We also found some that had different HR mixed script usage.","For instance, the Taiwanese word that appears as “較贏/khah-iân” ‘more than’ in the corpus appears as “khah 贏/khah-iân” in the dictionary. With regard to problems of this nature, we applied the following solution. If the POJ and HR mixed script word pair could not be found, we temporarily removed the HR mixed script and searched for the Mandarin word counterpart again using the POJ script. If the characters of HR mixed script were all Han characters, we regarded the Han characters as one of a Mandarin candidate word (assuming that the word is common to both Taiwanese and Mandarin).   242 Un-Gian Iunn et al.","This method might increase the number of the Mandarin candidate words, especially for single syllable words. For instance, the word pair “轉/chōan”‘turn’ appears in the text. We could not find an entry that contains both “轉” and “chōan” in the OTMD. The corresponding Mandarin translations of “chōan” in the dictionary are “扭”’twist’ and “上” ‘up’. We added “轉”‘turn’ as the supplementary Mandarin translation, but the meanings of these three words differ."]},{"title":"Table 1. Partial Entries of the OTMD","paragraphs":["HR Mixed Script POJ Script Mandarin Translation chōan chōan 扭 撰 chōan 上","Note: There exists not “轉/chōan” entry in the OTMD. The Mandarin translation of “轉/chōan” will be “扭,” “上” and “轉”","If the strategy was still unable to find any results, the HR mixed script was directly recognized as the Mandarin candidate word. For instance, no dictionary entry was found for the word pair appearing as “有形/iú-hêng”‘tangible’ in the text, neither could one be found in the search using the POJ script “iú-hêng.” So, the HR mixed script “有形” was directly recognized as the Mandarin candidate word (Lau, 2007)."]},{"title":"2.4 Selecting the Best Mandarin Translation","paragraphs":["We employed the Hidden Markov Model and Viterbi algorithm, and we made use of the bigram word training data of the ten-million word balanced Sinica corpus of the CKIP Group of Academia Sinica to select the most appropriate corresponding Mandarin word from the Mandarin candidate words.

Results","paragraphs":["We used the aforementioned method to perform the Taiwanese POS tagging task; nevertheless, as no standard answers were available to gauge the accuracy rate, we extracted partial results and checked them manually. The primary consideration of the manual checking procedure was the Chinese Word Segmentation and Tagging System of the CKIP group of Academia Sinica (CKIP, 2004). We selected fourteen literary works belonging to three different eras – the Ching Dynasty, the Japanese-ruled Period, and the Post-war Era. These literary works were in the form of prose (seven), novels (five), and dramas (two). We selected the first paragraph from each composition, or, if the length (number of syllables) of the first paragraph was less than 60, we selected the second paragraph.","","1","number of tagging errors","accuracy rate ( ) 100% number of total words=− (5)","The test data list is shown in the Appendix. Table 2 shows the test data selected for manual checking.

It should be noted that sometimes, even when the corresponding Mandarin word selected was inappropriate, the POS tagging result was still accurate. On the other hand, an appropriate or correct corresponding Mandarin word did not always have accurate POS tagging.","Furthermore, sometimes one Taiwanese word would correspond to two Mandarin words. For instance, while the Taiwanese word “壁頂/piah-téng” ‘on the wall’ is treated as only one word, the Mandarin translation “牆壁 上” should be treated as two words. There are also occasions wherein two Taiwanese words would correspond to only one Mandarin word counterpart. For instance, the Mandarin counterpart of the Taiwanese words “Tiong-kok/中 國” ‘Chinese’ and “jī/字” ‘character’ was “中國字.” The former is processed as an unknown word, whereas the latter, which was separated into two independent words, was processed as two words. In these types of cases, if the POS tagging was accurate, we still regarded the results as accurate.

Discussion 5.1 Is Improvement Possible?","paragraphs":["The ideal situation would be to resolve the foregoing errors and use this method to conduct the Taiwanese POS tagging to achieve an accuracy rate of 97.1%. Nevertheless, there is an apparent difficulty in the realization of this goal.","There are differences between the Taiwanese word order and the Mandarin word order; thus, the selection of the incorrect Mandarin word, and consequently incorrect POS tagging, occurred with high probability. The absence of appropriate Mandarin translation was the second leading cause of the POS tagging errors.","The unknown word problem was also a cause of POS tagging errors. From the Mandarin perspective, these words are not actually unknown words; this problem mostly resulted from the fact that translations between different languages are not one-to-one mappings. Another significant factor involves the use of hyphens in the POJ script, as their usage has not yet been standardized. It is probable that due to the use of Han characters, word boundaries are relatively vague in the different languages of the Chinese language family."]},{"title":"5.2 Hyphen Problems, Distinction between Taiwanese and Mandarin","paragraphs":["In Taiwanese, some words take on the POJ script, thus, the use of the hyphen. Used one way, they separate the syllables of words, making it possible for a syllable to correspond to a Han character; used another way, they serve as word separators. Each syllable in a hyphenated word represents a unigram, and a space separates each word. Unfortunately, no original word   252 Un-Gian Iunn et al. boundaries of Han character writing can be found to correspond to the hyphenated word.","In addition, Taiwanese has around 3,000 legal syllables, whereas Mandarin has around 1,200 legal syllables (Chan, 2008). Because of this, it may be said that the Taiwanese language has more single-syllable words. Nevertheless, as a single-syllable word may have several corresponding Han characters, the use of two-syllable or multi-syllable words resolves most of the problems.","For instance, if the Taiwanese word “這個”‘this one’ is written as “chit ê” (no hyphen used), the syllable “chit” may be made to correspond to several Mandarin words, such as “這” ‘this,’ “職”‘job,’ “質” ‘quality,’ “織,” ‘knit,’ etc. The syllable “ê” may also be made to correspond to several Mandarin words, such as “的” ‘of,’ “個” ‘(a numerary adjunct),’ “鞋” ‘shoe,’ etc. If the word is written as “chit-ê” (hyphenated), it definitely corresponds to “這個” in HR script. Hence, under the POJ script, the writer may tend to use a hyphen to link a single-syllable word to another single-syllable word if these two single-syllable words may likely form one composite word or one phrase. Present practices show that the word “這個” may appear hyphenated or in a separated syllable form, thus creating inconsistencies.","As the use of hyphenated words creates the problem of one Taiwanese word corresponding to two Mandarin words, if the original text is not revised and the Mandarin corresponding word is manifested as an unknown word, it may be possible to just remove the hyphen and try again. This method may reduce the chance of POS tagging errors due to the unknown word factor."]},{"title":"5.3 The Distinction between Different Eras or Different Genres","paragraphs":["We investigated whether texts of a different era or a different literary genre would affect the accuracy rate of the POS tagging. Table 10 shows the POS tagging accuracy rates for texts of three types of literary genres and Table 11 shows the POS tagging accuracy rates for texts of literary works belonging to three different periods or eras. Table 9 shows that the POS tagging accuracy rate for novel materials is comparably lower than other genres; whereas Table 10 indicates that the POS tagging accuracy rate for the materials written in the Post-war era are comparably lower than the other periods investigated. Basically, there are no significant differences among three genres or three eras as a whole."]},{"title":"Table 9.

Conclusion and Future Works","paragraphs":["We proposed a Taiwanese POS tagging method using a statistical method and Mandarin training data, and we achieved an accuracy rate of 91.6%. Due to the lack of Taiwanese training data, we sought the help of Mandarin.","This strategy could also be applied to other languages that lack resources. We think that this is a very important idea. It is preferable to select an intermediate language close to the target language from the viewpoint of the language family.","We also developed an online Taiwanese word segmentation and POS tagging system for people who are interested in this topic. Users can input Taiwanese text and get the POS tagging results. It is somewhat difficult for a user to prepare both POJ and HR mixed scripts; therefore, we also provide the functions in the absence of one of these two scripts (Iunn, et. al., 2007). This, however, will decrease the accuracy rate.","If we can construct a Taiwanese-Mandarin parallel corpus, we can use other methods like the Coerced Markov Models proposed by Fung and Wu (1995) to accomplish the Taiwanese POS tagging task. We hope that we can proceed to the construction of Taiwanese Treebank."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This research was supported in part by National Science Council of Taiwan, under the contract number NSC 95-2221-E-122 -006.
