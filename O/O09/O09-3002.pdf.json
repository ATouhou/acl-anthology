Introduction","paragraphs":["Building a knowledge base is time consuming work. The CKIP Chinese Lexical Knowledge Base has about 80 thousand lexical entries, and their senses are defined in terms of the E-HowNet format. E-HowNet is a lexical knowledge representation system. It extends the framework of HowNet (Dong et al., 2006) to allow semantic composition. Based on the framework of E-HowNet, we intend to establish an automatic semantic composition mechanism to derive sense of compounds and phrases from lexical senses (Chen et al., 2005b),  ∗ CKIP, Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica E-mail: {glaxy; kitajava; kchen} @iis.sinica.edu.tw + Department of Language and Literature Studies, National Hsinchu University of Education E-mail: slhuang@mail.nhcue.edu.tw   20 Chia-Hung Tai et al. (Huang et al., 2008). Determinative-Measure compounds (abbreviated as DM) are the most common compounds in Chinese. As a determiner and a measure normally coin a compound with unlimited versatility, the CKIP group does not define the E-HowNet representations for all DM compounds. Nevertheless, construction patterns for DMs are regular (Li et al., 2006). Therefore, an automatic identification schema in regular expression (Li et al., 2006) and a semantic composition method under the framework of E-HowNet for DM compounds were developed.","In this paper, we take DMs as an example to demonstrate how the E-HowNet semantic composition mechanism works in deriving the sense representations for all DM compounds. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the background knowledge of DM compounds and sense representation in E-HowNet. We’ll describe our method in Section 3 and discuss the experiment result in Section 4 before we present conclusions in Section 5."]},{"title":"2. Background","paragraphs":["There are numerous studies on determiners as well as measures, especially on the types of measures1","F","Tai (1994) asserts that classifiers and measures words are often treated together under one single framework of analysis. Chao (1968) treats classifiers as one kind of measure word. In his definition, a measure is a bound morpheme which forms a DM compound with the determiners enumerated below. i. Demonstrative determiners, e.g. 這 “this”, 那 “ that”... ii. Specifying determiners, e.g. 每 “every”, 各 “each”...","iii. Numeral determiners, e.g. 二 “two”, 百分之三 “three percent”, 四百五十 “four hundred and fifty”... iv. Quantitative determiners, e.g. 一 “one”, 滿 “full”, 許多 “many”...","Measures are divided into nine classes by Chao (1968). Classifiers are defined as ‘individual measures’, which is one of the nine kinds of measures. i. classifiers, e.g. 本 “a (book)”, ii. classifier associated with V-O constructions, e.g. 手 “hand”, iii. group measures, e.g. 對 “pair”, iv. partitive measures, e.g. 些 “some”,  1 Chao (1968) and Li and Thompson (1981) detect measures and classifiers. He (2002) traces the diachronic names of measures and mentions related literature on measures. The dictionary of measures pressed by Mandarin Daily News Association and CKIP (1997) lists all the possible measures in Mandarin Chinese.

Standard measures, e.g. 公尺 “meter”, viii. quasi-measure, e.g. 國 “country”, ix. Measures with verb, e.g. 次 “number of times”.","As mentioned in the introduction, Chao considered that determiners are listable and measures are largely listable, so D and M can be defined by enumeration, and that DM compounds have unlimited versatility. In this paper, we adopt the CKIP DM rule patterns and Part-of-Speeches for morpho-syntactic analysis, and, therefore, inherit the definition of determinative-measure compounds (DMs) in Mo et al. (1991). Mo et al. defined a DM as the composition of one or more determiners together with an optional measure. It is used to determine the reference or the quantity of the noun phrase that co-occurs with it. We use the definition of Mo et al. to apply to NLP and somewhat different from traditional linguistics definitions."]},{"title":"2.1 Regular Expression Approach for Identifying DMs","paragraphs":["Due to the possible infinite number of DMs, Mo et al. (1991) and Li et al. (2006) proposed to identify DMs by regular expression as part of their morphological module in NLP. For example, when the DM compound is the composition of one determiner, e.g. numerals in (1), rules (2a), (2b), or (2c) will be first applied, and then rules (2d), (2e), or (2f) will be applied to compose complex numeral structures, and finally rule (2g) will generate the pos Neu of numeral structures. From the processes of regular expression, the numerals 534 and 319 in (1) are identified and tagged as Neu.F2","  (1) 鼓勵534人完成319鄉之旅 guli wubaisanshisi ren wancheng sanbaiyishijiu xiang zhi lu encourage 534 persons to accomplish the travel around 319 villages      2 The symbol “Neu” stands for Numeral Determiners.

The detailed regular expressions can be found in Li et al. (2006). Rule patterns in regular expression only provide a way to represent and to identify morphological structures of DM compounds, but do not derive the senses of complex DM compounds."]},{"title":"2.2 Lexical Sense Representation in E-HowNet","paragraphs":["Core senses of natural language are compositions of relations and entities. Lexical senses are processing units for sense composition. Conventional linguistic theories classify words into content words and function words. Content words denote entities and function words mainly serve grammatical functions which link relations between entities/events. In E-HowNet, the senses of function words are represented by semantic roles/relations (Chen et al. 2005a). For example, ‘because’ is a function word. Its E-HowNet definition is shown in (3).  (3) because|因為 def: reason={};  which means reason(x)={y} where x is the dependent head and y is the dependent daughter of ‘因為’.","In the following sentence (4), we’ll show how the lexical concepts are combined into the sense representation of the sentence.  (4) Because of the rain, all the clothes are wet. 因為下雨,衣服都濕了     Automatic Sense Derivation for Determinative-Measure 23 Compounds under the Framework of E-HowNet In the above sentence, ‘濕 wet’, ‘衣服 clothes’ and ‘下雨 rain’ are content words while ‘都 all’, ‘了 Le’ and ‘因為 because’ are function words. The difference of their representation is that function words start with a relation but content words have under-specified relations. If a content word plays a dependent daughter of a head concept, the relation between the head concept and this content word will be established after parsing process. Suppose that the following dependent structure and semantic relations are derived after parsing the sentence (4).  (5) S(reason:VP(Head:Cb:因為|dummy:VA:下雨)|theme:NP(Head:Na:衣服) | quantity: Da:都 | Head:Vh:濕|particle:Ta:了)。 ","After the feature unification process, the following semantic composition result (6) is derived. The sense representations of dependent daughters became the feature attributes of the sentential head ‘wet|濕’.  (6) def:{wet|濕: theme={clothing|衣物}, aspect={Vachieve|達成}, manner={complete|整}, reason={rain|下雨}} ","In (5), the function word ‘因為 (because)’ links the relation of ‘reason’ between head concept ‘濕 wet’ and ‘下雨 rain’. The result of the composition is expressed as reason(wet| 濕)={rain|下雨}, since, for simplicity, the dependent head of a relation is normally omitted. Therefore, reason(wet| 濕 )={rain| 下雨} is expressed as reason={rain| 下雨}; theme(wet| 濕)={clothing|衣物} is expressed as theme={clothing|衣物} and so on in the expression (6)."]},{"title":"2.3 The sense representation for determiners and measures in E-HowNet","paragraphs":["The sense of a DM compound is determined by its morphemes and the morphemes of DMs are determiners and measures which are exhaustively listable. Therefore, in order to apply a semantic composition mechanism to derive the senses of DM compounds, we first need to establish the sense representations for all determiners and measures. Determiners and measures are both modifiers of nouns/verbs and their semantic relation with head nouns/verbs are well established.

Semantic Composition for DM Compounds","paragraphs":["To derive sense representations for all DM compounds, we study how to combine the E-HowNet representations of determiners and measures into a DM compound representation and make rules for automatic composition accordingly. Basically, a DM compound is a composition of some optional determiners and an optional measure. It is used as a modifier to describe the quantity, frequency, container, length, etc. of an entity. The major semantic roles played by determiners and measures are listed in Table 1. Since an E-HowNet sense representation is basically a feature value structure, we will apply feature unification process for semantic derivation of DMs. The basic feature unification processes (Duchier et al., 1999) is as follows:   Automatic Sense Derivation for Determinative-Measure 25 Compounds under the Framework of E-HowNet If a morpheme B is a dependency daughter of morpheme A, i.e. B is a modifier or an argument of A, then unify the semantic representation of A and B via the following steps.

Usually, determiners are modifiers of measures, such as ‘這 (this)’ and ‘一 (one)’ are modifiers of ‘碗 (bowl)’ in the examples of 這碗, 一碗, 這一碗. For instance, Example (11) has the dependent relations of  NP(quantifier:DM(quantifier:Neu:一|container:Nfa:碗)|Head:Nab:麵)   Automatic Sense Derivation for Determinative-Measure 27 Compounds under the Framework of E-HowNet "]},{"title":"Figure 1. The dependent relations of 一碗麵 “a bowl of noddle”.","paragraphs":["After the feature unification process, the semantic representation of “ 一 def: quantity={1}” becomes the feature of its dependent head “碗 def: container={bowl|碗}” and derives the feature representation of “one bowl 一碗 def: container={bowl|碗:quantity={1}}”. Similarly, “one bowl 一碗” is the dependent daughter of “noodle|麵 def:{noodle|麵}”. After the unification process, we derive the result of (11).  (11) one bowl of noodles|一碗麵 def:{noodle|麵:container={bowl| 碗:quantity={1}}}  The above feature unification process, written in rule form, is expressed as (12).  (12) Determiner + Measure (D+M) ̆def: semantic-role(M) = {Sense-representation(M): Representation(D)} ","The rule (12) says that the sense representation of a DM compound with a determiner D and a measure M is a unification of the feature representation of D as a feature of the sense representation of M as exemplified in (11).","Nevertheless, a DM compound with a null sense measure word, such as “this copy|這本” , “a copy|一本”, or without measure word, such as “these three|這三”, will be exceptions, since   28 Chia-Hung Tai et al. the measure word cannot be the semantic head of DM compound. The dependent head of determiners become the head noun of the NP containing the DM and the sense representation of a DM is a coordinate conjunction of the feature representations of its morphemes of determiners only.","For instance, in (10), “copy” has weak content sense; therefore, we regard it as a null-sense measure word and only retain the feature representation of the determiner as the definition of “this copy|這本”. The unification rule for DM with null-sense measure is expressed as (13).  (13) Determiner + {Null-sense Measure} (D+M) ̆def: Representation(D); ","If a DM has more than one determiner, we can consider the consecutive determiners as one D and the feature representation of D is a coordinate conjunction of the features of all its determiners. For instance, “this one|這一” and “this one|這一本” both are expressed as “quantifier={definite|定指}, quantity={1}”.","Omissions of numeral determiner occur very often while the numeral quantity is “1”. For instance, “這本” in fact means “this one|這一本”. Therefore, the definition of (10) should be modified as:  這本 def: quantifier={definite|定指}, quantity={1};  The following derivation rules cover the cases of omissions of numeral determiner.  (14) If both numeral and quantitative determiners do not occur in a DM, then the feature quantity={1} is the default value of the DM. ","Another major complication is that senses of morphemes are ambiguous. The feature unification process may produce many sense representations for a DM compound."]},{"title":"3.2 Sense Disambiguation","paragraphs":["Multiple senses will be derived for a DM compound due to ambiguous senses of its morpheme components. For instance, the measure word “頭 (head)” has either the sense of {頭|head}, such as “滿頭白髮 full head of white hair” or the null sense in “一頭牛 a cow”. Some DMs are inherent sense ambiguous and some are pseudo ambiguous. For instance, the above   Automatic Sense Derivation for Determinative-Measure 29 Compounds under the Framework of E-HowNet example “一頭” is inherently ambiguous, since it could mean “full head” as in the example of “一頭白髮 full head of white hair” or could mean “one + classifier” as in the example of “一 頭牛 a cow”. For inherently ambiguous DMs, the sense derivation step will produce ambiguous sense representations and leave the final sense disambiguation until seeing collocation context, in particular seeing dependent heads. Some ambiguous representations are improbable sense combination. The improbable sense combinations should be eliminated during or after feature unification of D and M. For instance, although the determiner “一” has ambiguous senses of “one”, “first”, and “whole”, “一公尺” has only the sense of “one meter”, so the other sense combinations should be eliminated.","The way we tackle the problem is that first we find all the ambiguous Ds and Ms by looking their definitions shown in Appendix A. We, then, manually design content and context dependent rules to eliminate the improbable combinations for each ambiguous D or M types. For instance, according to Appendix A, “頭” has 3 different E-HowNet representations while it functions as a determiner or measure, i.e. “def:{null}”, “def:{head|頭 }”, and “def:ordinal={1}”. We write three content or context dependent rules below to disambiguate its senses.  (15) 頭 “head”, Nfa, E-HowNet: “def:{null}” : while E-HowNet of the head word is “動物({animate|生物})” and its subclasses.  (16) 頭 “head“, Nff, E-HowNet: “def:{head|頭}” : while pre-determiner is 一(Neqa) “one” or 滿 “full” or 全 “all” or 整 “total”.  (17) 頭 “first”, Nes, E-HowNet: “def:ordinal={1}” : while this word is being a demonstrative determiner that is a leading morpheme of the compound. ","The disambiguation rules are shown in Appendix B. In each rule, the first part is the word and its part-of-speech. Then, the E-HowNet definition of this sense is shown, followed by the condition constraints for this sense. If there is still remaining ambiguity after using the disambiguation rule, we choose the most frequent sense as the result.     30 Chia-Hung Tai et al."]},{"title":"3.3 Simplification and Normalization for Sense Representation","paragraphs":["Members of every type of determiners and measures are exhaustively listable except numeral determiners. Also, the formats of numerals are various. For example, “5020” is equal to “五零 二零” and “五千零二十” and “五千二十”. So, we have to unify the numeral representation into a standard form. All numerals are composed of basic numerals, as shown in the regular expressions (2). Their senses, however, are not possible to define one by one. We take a simple approach. For all numerals, their E-HowNet sense representations are expressed as themselves. For example, 5020 is expressed as quantity={5020} and we will not further define the sense of 5020. Furthermore all non-Arabic forms will be converted into Arabic expressions, e.g. “五千零二十” is defined as quantity={5020}.","The other problem is that the morphological structures of some DMs are not regular patterns. Take “兩個半(two and a half)” as an example. “半(half)” is not a measure word. So, we collect those words, like “多 (many), 半 (half), 幾 (many), 上 (up), 大 (big), 來 (more)” to modify the quantity definition. So, we first remove the word “半” and define the “兩個” as quantity={2}. As the word “半” means quantity={0.5}, we define the E-HowNet definition for “兩個半” as quantity={2.5}. For other modifiers such as “多 (many), 幾 (many), 餘 (more), 來 (more),” we use a function over() to represent the sense of “more”, such as “十多個 more than 10” is represented as quantity={over(10)}.","In E-HowNet, complex word senses are expressed by some limit number of basic or primitive concepts. Nevertheless, some certain domain concepts can hardly be expressed by primitive concepts, for instance “焦耳 (joule),” “盧比 (rupee),” “五千零二十 (five thousand and twenty),” etc.. Therefore, we simplify our representations and consider many domain specific concepts as basic concept without further decomposing into primitive concepts.","Appendix A shows the determiners and measures used and their E-HowNet definition in our method. Now, we have the basic principles for compositing semantics of DM under the framework of E-HowNet.","The following steps show how we process DMs and derive their E-HowNet definitions from an input sentence.

Furthermore, sense disambiguation rules will also be developed according to the context of sense ambiguous instances. First, we need to know how many DMs are sufficient to derive a list of determiners and measures with high coverage, if it is not exhaustive. Therefore, we extract DMs from different size subsets of Sinica Treebank and observe their character token coverage. The results are shown in Table 2 and Figure 2.

A total of 405 determiner types and 211 measure types were found, in which 367 out of the 405 determiners were numerals. Since the numbers of numeral determiners are infinite, all numerals will be converted into their Arabic form automatically instead of representing their E-HowNet sense representations individually. The rest of the determiners and measures are encoded with their E-HowNet sense representations manually.

More contextual information is required to resolve such kinds of sense ambiguity.","For the type of unknown domain error, the solution is to expand the disambiguation rules and the sense representations for morphemes. For sense ambiguities, we need more information and better features to determine true senses."]},{"title":"5. Conclusion","paragraphs":["E-HowNet is a lexical sense representational framework and intends to achieve sense representation for all compounds, phrases, and sentences through automatic semantic composition processing. For this purpose, we defined word senses of the CKIP Chinese lexicon in E-HowNet representation. Then, we tried to automate semantic composition for phrases and sentences. Nevertheless, many unknown words or newly coined compound words may occur in the target sentences. In fact, DM compounds are the most frequently occurring unknown words. Therefore, our first goal was to derive the senses of DM words automatically.   Automatic Sense Derivation for Determinative-Measure 35 Compounds under the Framework of E-HowNet","In this paper, we take DMs as an example to demonstrate how the semantic composition mechanism works in E-HowNet to derive the sense representations for all DM compounds. We analyze morphological structures of DMs and derive their morphological rules in terms of regular expression. Then, we defined the sense of all determiners and measures in E-HowNet format exhaustively. We created some simple composition rules to produce candidate sense representations for DMs. Then, we reviewed the development set to write some disambiguation rules. We used these heuristic rules to determine the final E-HowNet representation and reach 89% accuracy. The current version did not exhaustively collect all determiners and measures. The system, however, can be improved by gradual extension of the representations of new determiners and measures without retraining.","In the future, we will use similar methods to handle general compounds and to improve sense disambiguation and semantic relation identification processing. We intend to achieve semantic compositions for phrases and sentences in the future and we had shown the potential in this paper. 9 B"]},{"title":"Acknowledgement","paragraphs":["This research was supported in part by the National Science Council under a Center Excellence Grant NSC 96-2752-E-001-001-PAE and Grant NSC96-2221-E-001-009."]},{"title":"Reference","paragraphs":["Chao, Y.
