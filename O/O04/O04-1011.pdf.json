Anaphora resolution is one of essential tasks in message understanding. In this paper resolution for pronominal and sortal anaphora, which are common in biomedical texts, is addressed. The resolution was achieved by employing UMLS ontology and SA/AO (subject-action/action-object) patterns mined from biomedical corpus. On the other hand, sortal anaphora for unknown words was tackled by using the headword collected from UMLS and the patterns mined from PubMed. The final set of antecedents finding was decided with a salience grading mechanism, which was tuned by a genetic algorithm at its best-input feature selection. Compared to previous approach on the same MEDLINE abstracts, the presented resolution was promising for its 92% F-Score in pronominal anaphora and 78% F-Score in sortal anaphora."]},{"title":"1 Introduction ","paragraphs":["Anaphora resolution is one of essential tasks in message understanding as well as knowledge discovering. For example recognizing biomedical relations among biomedical entities from research literature like MEDLINE database requires anaphora resolution for those mentioned entities from texts. There are different types of anaphora to be solved like pronominal, sortal (definite), zero, event, and coreference anaphora. In biomedical literature, pronominal anaphora and sortal anaphora are the two common anaphora phenomena. Pronominal anaphora is that mentioned entity is substituted by the pronoun. Sortal (definite) anaphora occurs in the situation that a noun phrase is referred by its general concept entity. Definite noun phrases are noun phrases stating with demonstrative articles, such as those, this, both, each and these or starting with a definite article.","Generally identifying antecedents of an anaphor can be handled by using syntactic, semantic or pragmatic clues. In past literature, syntax-oriented approaches for general texts can be found in [Hobbs, 76; Lappin and Leass 94; Kennedy and Boguraev 96] in which syntactic representations like grammatical role of noun phrases were used.","On the other hand more information other than syntactic information like co-occurring patterns obtained from the corpus was employed during antecedent finding in [Dagan and Itai, 90]. Information with limited knowledge and linguistic resources for resolving pronouns were found in [Baldwin, 97]. In [Denber, 98, Mitkov, 02], more knowledge from the outer resource like WordNet was employed in solving anaphora. Similarly WordNet together with additional heuristic rules were applied for resolving pronominal anaphora in [Liang and Wu, 04] which animacy information is obtained by analyzing the hierarchical relation of nouns and verbs in the surrounding context learned from WordNet.","In biomedical literature, it was found that sortal anaphors are prevalent in the texts like MEDLINE abstracts [Castaño et al., 02]. To deal this type of anaphora, Castaño et al. [02] used UMLS (Unified Medical Language System) as ontology to tag semantic type for each noun phrase and used some significant verbs in biomedical domain to extract most frequent semantic types associated to agent (subject) and patient (object) role of SA/AO-patterns. The result showed SA/AO-pattern could gain increase in both precision (76% to 80%) and recall (67% to 71%). In [Hahn et al., 02], a center list mechanism was presented to relate each noun to those nouns appearing in a previous sentence anaphora. Gaizauskas et al. [03] presented a predefined domain rules for ensuring co-referent between two bio-entities so that implicit relations between two entities could be recognized.","In this paper, the anaphora resolution for biomedical literature is achieved by employing UMLS ontology and syntactic information. The proposed system identifies both intra-sentential and inter-sentential antecedents of anaphors. In addition, anaphora resolution for unknown words has concerned in this paper by using headword mining and patterns mined from PubMed search results. Determining semantic coercion type of pronominal anaphor is done by SA/AO patterns, which were pre-collected from GENIA 3.02p corpus, a MEDLINE corpus annotated by Ohta et al. [02]. The final set of antecedents finding is decided with a salience grading mechanism, which is tuned by a genetic algorithm at its best-input feature selection. Compared to previous approach on the same MEDLINE abstracts, the presented resolution is promising for its 92% F-Score in pronominal anaphora and 78% F-Score in sortal anaphora."]},{"title":"2 The Presented Resolution ","paragraphs":["Figure 1: Architecture overview.","Figure 1 is the presented overview architecture which contains background processing, including SA/AO patterns and headword collection, indicated with dotted lines and foreground processing, including preprocessor, grammatical pattern extractor anaphor recognizer, and antecedent finder, indicated with solid lines."]},{"title":"2.1 SA/AO Patterns Collection","paragraphs":["In this paper we used co-occurring SA/AO patterns obtained from GENIA corpus for pronominal anaphora resolution.

In [Pustejovsky et al., 02], they use the righthand head rule (the head of a morphologically complex word to be the righthand member of that word) to extract headwords to be subtype of the semantic type in UMLS. Table 1 is an example for headword ‘receptor’ which changes other noun phrase which were tagged with different semantic into ‘Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein’. ‘Adhesion’ is tagged with ‘Acquired Abnormality, Disease or Syndrome’ but ‘adhesion receptor’ becomes the tag of ‘Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein’ by addition of ‘receptor’.

For example, concept ‘interleukin-2’ has synonyms ‘Costimulator’, ‘Co-Simulator’, ‘IL 2’, and ‘interleukine 2’. We collected ‘interleukin’, ‘costimulator’, ‘simulator’, ‘IL’, and ‘interleukine’ as headwords for ‘interleukin-2’. Then, we found semantic types of ‘interlukin-2’ is ‘Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein’ and ‘Immunologic Factor’. We assigned synonym headwords of ‘interleukin-2’ into both semantic types.

Each candidate antecedent is assigned with zero at initial state.","Recency is a feature about distance between an anaphor and candidate antecedents. The closer between an anaphor and a candidate antecedent, the more chance the anaphor points to this candidate antecedent. For grammatical role agreement, if we use same entity in the second sentence and in the same role, it is easy for readers to identify which antecedent that the anaphor points to, so an author might use anaphor instead of full name of the entity. In addition to role agreement, subjects and objects are important role in sentence, which may be mentioned many times and writer might use an anaphor to replace a previously mentioned items. Singular anaphors may only point to one antecedent, while plural anaphors usually points to plural antecedents. For the feature of semantic type agreement, when we mention entity the second time, it is common for us to use its hypernym concept. Therefore such feature will receive high weights at salience grading. Table 3: Salience grading for candidate antecedents.
