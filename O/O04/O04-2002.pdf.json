In this paper, anaphora resolution is achieved by employing WordNet ontology and heuristic rules. The proposed system identifies both intra-sentential and inter-sentential antecedents of anaphors. Information about animacy is obtained by analyzing the hierarchical relations of nouns and verbs in the surrounding context. The identification of animacy entities and pleonastic-it usage in English discourses are employed to promote resolution accuracy.","Traditionally, anaphora resolution systems have relied on syntactic, semantic or pragmatic clues to identify the antecedent of an anaphor. Our proposed method makes use of WordNet ontology to identify animate entities as well as essential gender information. In the animacy agreement module, the property is identified by the hypernym relation between entities and their unique beginners defined in WordNet. In addition, the verb of the entity is also an important clue used to reduce the uncertainty. An experiment was conducted using a balanced corpus to resolve the pronominal anaphora phenomenon. The methods proposed in [Lappin and Leass, 94] and [Mitkov, 01] focus on the corpora with only inanimate pronouns such as “it” or “its”. Thus the results of intra-sentential and inter-sentential anaphora distribution are different. In an experiment using Brown corpus, we found that the distribution proportion of intra-sentential anaphora is about 60%. Seven heuristic rules are applied in our system; five of them are preference rules, and two are constraint rules. They are derived from syntactic, semantic, pragmatic conventions and from the analysis of training data. A relative measurement indicates that about 30% of the errors can be eliminated by applying heuristic module.  * Department of Computer and Information Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan Email: tliang@cis.nctu.edu.tw; gis90507@cis.nctu.edu.tw   22 Tyne Liang and Dian-Song Wu"]},{"title":"1. Introduction 1.1 Problem description","paragraphs":["Anaphora resolution is vital in applications such as machine translation, summarization, question-answering systems and so on. In machine translation, anaphora must be resolved in the case of languages that mark the gender of pronouns. One main drawback with most current machine translation systems is that the translation produced usually does not go beyond the sentence level and, thus, does not successfully deal with discourse understanding. Inter-sentential anaphora resolution would, thus, be of great assistance in the development of machine translation systems. On the other hand, many automatic text summarization systems apply a scoring mechanism to identify the most salient sentences. However, the task results are not always guaranteed to be coherent with each other. This could lead to errors if a selected sentence contained anaphoric expressions. To improve accuracy in extracting important sentences, it is essential to solve the problem of anaphoric references beforehand.","Pronominal anaphora, where pronouns are substituted by previously mentioned entities, is a common phenomenon. This type of anaphora can be further divided into four subclasses, namely: nominative: {he, she, it, they}; reflexive: {himself, herself, itself, themselves}; possessive: {his, her, its, their}; objective: {him, her, it, them}.","However, “it” can also be a non-anaphoric expression which does not refer to any previously mentioned item, in which case it is called an expletive or the pleonastic-it [Lappin and Leass, 94]. Although pleonastic pronouns are not considered anaphoric since they do not have antecedents to refer to, recognizing such occurrences is, nevertheless, essential during anaphora resolution. In [Mitkov, 01], non-anaphoric pronouns were found to constitute 14.2% of a corpus of 28,272 words.","Definite noun phrase anaphora occurs where the antecedent is referred by a general concept entity. The general concept entity can be a semantically close phrase, such as a synonym or super-ordinates of the antecedent [Mitkov, 99]. The word one has a number of different usages apart from counting. One of its important functions is as an anaphoric form. For example: Intra-sentential anaphora means that the anaphor and the corresponding antecedent occur   Automatic Pronominal Anaphora Resolution in English Texts 23 in the same sentence. Inter-sentential anaphora means the antecedent occurs in a sentence prior to the sentence with the anaphor. In [Lappin and Leass, 94], there were 15.9% inter-sentential cases and 84.1% intra-sentential cases in the testing results. In [Mitkov, 01], there were 33.4% inter-sentential cases and 66.6% intra-sentential cases.","Traditionally, anaphora resolution systems have relied on syntactic, semantic or pragmatic clues to identify the antecedent of an anaphor. Hobbs’ algorithm [Hobbs, 76] was the first syntax-oriented method presented in this research domain. From the result of a syntactic tree, they checked the number and gender agreement between antecedent candidates and a specified pronoun. In RAP (Resolution of Anaphora Procedure) proposed by Lappin and Leass [94], an algorithm is applied to the syntactic representations generated by McCord's Slot Grammar parser, and salience measures are derived from the syntactic structure. It does not make use of semantic information or real world knowledge in choosing among the candidates. A modified version of RAP system was proposed by [Kennedy and Boguraev, 96]. It employed only part-of-speech tagging with a shallow syntactic parse indicating the grammatical roles of NPs and their containment in adjuncts or noun phrases.","Cardie et al. [99] treated coreferencing as a clustering task. Then a distance metric function was used to decide whether two noun phrases were similar or not. In [Denber, 98], an algorithm called Anaphora Matcher (AM) was implemented to handle inter-sentential anaphora in a two-sentence context. This method uses information about the sentence as well as real world semantic knowledge obtained from other sources. The lexical database system WordNet is utilized to acquire semantic clues about the words in the input sentences. It is noted that anaphora do not refer back more than one sentence in most cases. Thus, a two-sentence “window size” is sufficient for anaphora resolution in the domain of image queries.","A statistical approach to disambiguate pronoun “it” in sentences was introduced in [Dagan and Itai, 90]. The disambiguation is based on the co-occurring patterns obtained from a corpus to find the antecedent. The antecedent candidate with the highest frequency in the co-occurring patterns is selected as a match for the anaphor.","A knowledge-poor approach was proposed in [Mitkov, 98]; it can be applied to different languages (English, Polish, and Arabic). The main components of this method are the so-called “antecedent indicators” which are used to assign a score (2, 1, 0, -1) for each candidate noun phrase. The scores play a decisive role in tracking down the antecedent from a set of possible candidates. CogNIAC (COGnition eNIAC) [Baldwin, 97] is a system developed at the University of Pennsylvania to resolve pronouns using limited knowledge and linguistic resources. It is a high precision pronoun resolution system that is capable of achieving more than 90% precision with 60% recall for some pronouns. Mitkov [02] presented   24 Tyne Liang and Dian-Song Wu a new, advanced and completely revamped version of his own knowledge-poor approach to pronoun resolution. In contrast to most anaphora resolution approaches, the system called MARS operates in the fully automatic mode. Three new indicators included in MARS are Boost Pronoun, Syntactic Parallelism and Frequent Candidates.","In [Mitkov, 01], the authors proposed an evaluation environment for comparing anaphora resolution algorithms. Performances are illustrated by presenting the results of a comparative evaluation conducted on the basis of several evaluation measures. Their testing corpus contained 28,272 words, with 19,305 noun phrases and 422 pronouns, of which 362 were anaphoric expressions. The overall success rate calculated for the 422 pronouns found in the texts was 56.9% for Mitkov’s method, 49.72% for Cogniac and 61.6% for Kennedy and Boguraev’s method."]},{"title":"2.

The TOSCA-ICLE tag set consists of 16 major word classes. These major word   26 Tyne Liang and Dian-Song Wu classes may be further specified by means of features of subclasses as well as a variety of syntactic, semantic and morphological characteristics. 2.2.2 NP Finder According to the part-of-speech result, the basic noun phrase patterns are found to be as follows: base NP → modifier+head noun modifier → <article| number| present participle| past participle |adjective| noun>","At the beginning, our system identifies base noun phrases that contain no other smaller noun phrases within them. For example, the chief executive officer of a financial company is divided into the chief executive officer and a financial company for the convenience of judging whether the noun phrase is a prepositional noun phrase or not. This could be of help in selecting a correct candidate for a specific anaphor. Once the final candidate is selected, the entire modifier is combined together again.","The proposed base noun phrase finder is implemented based on a finite state machine (Figure 2). Each state indicates a particular part-of-speech of a word. The arcs between states indicate a word input from the first word of the sentence. If a word sequence can be recognized from the initial state and ends in a final state, it is accepted as a base noun phrase with no recursion; otherwise, it is rejected.

","paragraphs":["Automatic Pronominal Anaphora Resolution in English Texts 27 2.2.3 Pleonastic-it Module The pleonastic-it module is used to filter out those semantic empty usage conditions which are essential for pronominal anaphora resolution. A word “it” is said to be pleonastic when it is used in a discourse where the word does not refer to any antecedent.","References of “pleonastic-it” can be classified as state references or passive references [Denber, 98]. State references are usually used for assertions about the weather or the time, and this category is further divided into meteorological references and temporal references.","Passive references consist of modal adjectives and cognitive verbs. Modal adjectives (Modaladj) like advisable, convenient, desirable, difficult, easy, economical, certain, etc. are specified. The set of modal adjectives is extended by adding their comparative and superlative forms. Cognitive verbs (Cogv), on the other hand, are words like anticipate, assume, believe, expect, know, recommend, think, etc. Most instances of \"pleonastic-it\" can be described by the following patterns: 1. It is Modaladj that S. 2. It is Modaladj (for NP) to VP. 3. It is Cogv-ed that S. 4. It seems/appears/means/follows (that) S. 5. NP makes/finds it Modaladj (for NP) to VP. 6. It is time to VP. 7. It is thanks to NP that S. 2.2.4 Number Agreement The quantity of a countable noun can be singular (one entity) or plural (numerous entities). It makes the process of deciding on candidates easier since they must be consistent in number. With the output of the specific tagger, all the noun phrases and pronouns are annotated with number (single or plural). For a specified pronoun, we can discard those noun phrases that differ in number from the pronoun. 2.2.5 Gender Agreement The gender recognition process can deal with words that have gender features. To distinguish the gender information of a person, we use an English first name list collected from (http://www.behindthename.com/) covering 5,661 male first name entries and 5,087 female ones. In addition, we employ some useful clues from WordNet results by conducting keyword search around the query result. These keywords can be divided into two classes:    28 Tyne Liang and Dian-Song Wu Class_Female= {feminine, female, woman, women} Class_Male= {masculine, male, man, men} 2.2.6 Animacy Agreement Animacy denotes the living entities which can be referred to by some gender-marked pronouns (he, she, him, her, his, hers, himself, herself) in texts. Conventionally, animate entities include people and animals. Since it is hard to obtain the property of animacy with respect to a noun phrase by its surface morphology, we use WordNet [Miller, 93] to recognize animate entities in which a noun can only have one hypernym but can have many hyponyms. With twenty-five unique beginners, we observe that two of them can be taken as representations of animacy. These two unique beginners are {animal, fauna} and {person, human being}. Since all the hyponyms inherit properties from their hypernyms, the animacy of a noun can be determined by making use of this hierarchical relation. However, a noun may have several senses, depending on the context. The output result with respect to a noun must be employed to resolve this problem. First of all, a threshold value t_noun is defined (equation 2) as the ratio of the number of senses in animacy files to the number of total senses. This threshold value can be obtained by training a corpus, and the value is selected when the accuracy rate reaches its maximum:"]},{"title":"nountheofsensestotalthe filesanimacyinsensesofnumberthe nount _____ _______ = ,","paragraphs":["(2)"]},{"title":"verbtheofsensestotalthe filesanimacyinsensesofnumberthe verbt _____ ______ _ = ,","paragraphs":["(3)"]},{"title":"entitiesanimacyofnumbertotalthe correctlyidentifiedentitiesanimacyofnumberthe accuracy _____ ______= .","paragraphs":["(4)","Besides the noun hypernym relation, unique beginners of verbs are also taken into consideration.

We utilized the ratio of senses from the WordNet output to decide whether the entity was an animate entity or not. Therefore, the ratio of senses in the noun and its verb is obtained in the training phase to achieve the highest possible accuracy. Afterwards, the testing phase makes use of these two threshold values to decide on the animate feature. Threshold values can be obtained by training on the corpus and selecting the value when the accuracy rate (equation 4) reaches its maximum.

Syntactic parallelism rule The syntactic parallelism of an anaphor and an antecedent could be an important clue when other constraints or preferences can not be employed to identify a unique unambiguous antecedent. The rule reflects the preference that the correct antecedent has the same part-of-speech and grammatical function as the anaphor. Nouns can function grammatically as subjects, objects or subject complements. The subject is the person, thing, concept or idea that is the topic of the sentence. The object is directly or indirectly affected by the nature of the verb. Words which follow verbs are not always direct or indirect objects. After a particular kind of verb, such as verb “be”, nouns remain in the subjective case. We call these subjective completions or subject complements. For example: The security guard took off the uniform after getting off duty. He put it in the bottom of the closet.","“He” (the subject) in the second sentence refers to “The security guard,” which is also the subject of the first sentence. In the same way, “it” refers to “the uniform,” which is the object of the first sentence. Empirical evidence also shows that anaphors usually match their antecedents in terms of their syntactic functions. II. Semantic parallelism rule This preference works by identifying collocation patterns in which anaphora appear. In this way, the system can automatically identify semantic roles and employ them to select the most appropriate candidate. Collocation relations specify the relations between words that tend to co-occur in the same lexical contexts. The rule emphasizes that those noun phrases with the same semantic roles as the anaphor are preferred answer candidates. III. Definiteness rule Definiteness is a category concerned with the grammaticalization of the identifiability and non-identifiability of referents. A definite noun phrase is a noun phrase that starts with the word \"the\"; for example, \"the young lady\" is a definite noun phrase. Definite noun phrases which can be identified uniquely are more likely to be antecedents of anaphors than indefinite noun phrases. IV. Mention Frequency rule Recurring items in a context are regarded as likely candidates for the antecedent of an anaphor. Generally, high frequency items indicate the topic as well as the most likely candidate.   Automatic Pronominal Anaphora Resolution in English Texts 31 V. Sentence recency rule Recency information is employed in most of the implementations of anaphora resolution. In [Lappin, 94], the recency factor is the one with the highest weight among a set of factors that influence the choice of antecedent. The recency factor states that if there are two (or more) candidate antecedents for an anaphor, and that all of these candidates satisfy the consistency restrictions for the anaphor (i.e., they are qualified candidates), then the most recent one (the one closest to the anaphor) is chosen. In [Mitkov et al., 01], the average distance (within a sentence) between the anaphor and the antecedent was found to be 1.3, and the average distance for noun phrases was found to be 4.3 NPs. VI. Non-prepositional noun phrase rule A noun phrase not contained in another noun phrase is considered a possible candidate. This condition can be explained from the perspective of functional ranking: subject > direct object > indirect object. A noun phrase embedded in a prepositional noun phrase is usually an indirect object. VII. Conjunction constraint rule Conjunctions are usually used to link words, phrases and clauses. If a candidate is connected with an anaphor by a conjunction, the anaphora relation is hard to be constructed between these two entities. For example:","Mr. Brown teaches in a high school. Both Jane and he enjoy watching movies on weekends."]},{"title":"2.3 The Brown Corpus","paragraphs":["The training and testing texts were selected randomly from the Brown corpus.

Conclusion and Future Work","paragraphs":["In this paper, the WordNet ontology and heuristic rules have been adopted to perform anaphora resolution.

From the experiment results, our proposed method is comparable in performance with prior works that fully parse the text. In contrast to most anaphora resolution approaches, our system benefits from the recognition of animacy agreement and operates in a fully automatic mode to achieve optimal performance. With the growing interest in natural language processing and its various applications, anaphora resolution is essential for further message understanding and the coherence of discourses during text processing.
