With the Sinica Corpus on-line tools, a significant difference is found in the collocation of adverbial adjuncts with the use of zai and zhengzai. This paper discusses three types of adverbials to distinguish these two markers: modality adverbs, time adverbs, and manner adverbs. Zhengzai cannot co-occur with [+iterative] adverbs and adverbs without a specific time reference. It mainly indicates the progression of an on-going event at a given specific time point. On the other hand, zai not only indicates the on-going process but can also signal the progression of repeated event as habitual- progressive."]},{"title":"1 Introduction ","paragraphs":["In Mandarin Chinese, both zai and zhengzai are progressive markers which present an internal interval of a durative situation, and often have the connotations of activity and temporary imperfectivity associated with non-statives [3]. But, when talking about imperfective aspect markers in Mandarin Chinese, most studies just represent zai as a progressive marker ([2], [5], [6], [7], [11], [17], and [18]), while fewer studies indicate that there are other representations of progressive markers ([3] , [4], and [15]). Although mentioning both zai and zhengzai as progressive markers, previous studies treat them almost as interchangeable and only focus on the discussion of zai with few detailed distinction between these two forms. Given that these two markers are morphologically distinct, some questions will have to be asked: do they encode the same grammatical, semantic and pragmatic information? Do they occur in completely the same contexts or they have different contextual constraints? If the two markers are functionally identical, we may wonder why Chinese has two different and redundant progressive representations. Given the principle of economy in language, our assumption is that there must be some fine-grained distinctions between zai and zhengzai. In this paper, we adopt a corpus-based approach, since corpus data provide a wealth of grammatical associations that may help delimit the key semantic distinctions, as successfully shown in recent studies on lexical semantics (cf. [9], [13], and [14]). This paper thus aims to explore the semantic distinction between zai and zhengzai by examining their collocational patterns in discourse."]},{"title":"2 Methodology ","paragraphs":["Most of our data come from the Sinica Corpus. Since zai has a variety of senses, we only look at the instances of zai that are compatible with zhengzai as aspectual markers. As a result, there are 2000 utterances with zai and 696 utterances with zhengzai. With the searching tools and POS tags in Sinica Corpus, we can readily retrieve the frequency counts of neighboring categories which precede or follow zai and zhengzai for further analysis."]},{"title":"3 Finding and Discussion ","paragraphs":["The data in Sinica Corpus reveal that the top ten grammatical categories before and after zai and zhengzai do vary, as shown in Tables la, lb and 2a, 2b.

The three categories commonly found after zai and zhengzai are the same and their percentages are close— no more than five percent. On the other hand, from Tables 1a and 2a, we found an interesting difference in the preceding positions. The three higher-frequency categories preceding the two markers are categorically the same but with different rankings, among which adverbs show a significant distinction. Adverbs preceding zai is 10 percent more than that of zhengzai. It may suggest that adverbs could be an important indicator to distinct zai and zhengzai. In the following, we mainly focus on three types of adverbs to characterize their relations with zai and zhengzai: modality adverbs, time adverbs, and manner adverbs. Both zai and zhengzai can occur with modality adverbs such as yiding (), keneng (Q)̈, yexu (¤), haoxiang (‰), and so on. (1) 4 QQ̈Q̈Q̈̈g 6","ta keneng zai duobi sheme he possibly ZAI avoiding something","“ He is possibly avoiding something.” (2) C , _/_/_/_/ ‘","ta xiangle yixia sihu zai zhao taici she think a while seem ZAI search what to say “ She thought for a while, seemingly to be searching what to say.” (3) 4 QQ̈Q̈Q̈̈ıı h tade shou keneng zhengzai mo heihei de jiyou his hands may ZHENGZAI group dark and black engine oil","“ His hands may be groping in the dark the black engine oil.”","(4) łx _/_/_/_/ h jishuxing fantan sihu zhengzai yunniang technical rebound seem ZHENGZAI ferment “ The technical rebound seems to be fermenting.” However, when the modality adverb contains the feature [+ iterative], indicating a repetition or recurrence of an event, such as you () and zai ()̆ [6], the marker zhengzai is not allowed to co-occur. (5) ? c / *1 zhendema ni you zai/*zhengzai qianren really you again ZAI/*ZENGZAI decive people","“ Really? You are deceiving people again.” The above example indicates that the event with zhengzai can not be viewed as a repetition or a recurrence pertaining to a previous reference event. Thus, zhengzai is [-iterative], constrained by semantic and contextual factors, but zai is free to be used with [+iterative] events. According to Givon [16], time adverbs can be classified into three sub-groups: temporal adverbs, frequency adverbs, and aspectuality adverbs. Both zai and zhengzai can co-occur with temporal adverbs, such as xianzai (\\), muqian (ß), zuijin (()̈ and the like. (6) cz p W *8 \\\\\\\\ ̋C 6 nimen zhidao nage nanhai xianzai xinzhong zai xiang sheme ma you know that boy now in mind ZAI think what","“ You know now what that boy is thinking in mind.” (7) 4, : 6 mingzhi ta zheshi zai zuo sheme know perfectly well she at this time ZAI do what","“ Knew perfectly well what she is doing at this time” (8) \\\\\\\\ | ̋ xianzai zhengzai shigong zhong now ZHENGZAI construction under","“ Now it is under construction” (9) ̀WWWW 8• yinwei nashi haizi zhengzai shangxin because at that time child ZHENGZAI sad","“ Because at that time the child is being sad.” But, there are some limitations of zhengzai. It can only occur with temporal adverbs referring to a specific time point or a short period of time with a clear reference point as youyitian (œ), xianzai (\\), zuijin (()̈ and so on. It cannot occur with a durational time adverb without a specified reference point, such as meitian (œ), shiwunianlai (p), yibeizi (x•), etc. (10) z n \\\\\\\\ œœœœ / * >̧ darenmen hui bi xianzai meitian zai/*zhengzai yong deren haiyao dong ma adults will than now everyday ZAI/*ZENGZAI use people more understand","“ Will the adults understand more than those who use everyday?”","(11) 4 1• i Bz x•x•x•x• / * † ̆‡","Ta bushi ge pianzi jiushi ge meiyou ganjue yibeizi dou zai/*zhengzai shuohuang de baichi","he either a liar or a without feeling lifetime all ZAI/*ZENGZAI tell a lie DE idiot","“ He is either a liar or an idiot who telling a lie for a lifetime without feeling.” From this, we know that zhengzai indicates what is on-going at a specific time reference, locating the event in the time axis and contributing contrastive and attitudinal features to the sentence [3]. With frequency adverbs such as changchang (⁄⁄), zhongshi (t) and aspectuality adverbs as luxu (»), buduan (), zhengzai are NOT allowed to appear, either, since these frequency adverbs signal a progressive aspect in the habitual sense, i.e. without a specific time reference [16] or indicate repetitive-progressive that extends over an unspecified period of time.","(12) frequency adverbs wn̨ ¤ ⁄⁄⁄⁄⁄⁄⁄⁄ / * v N jijinhui ye changchang zai/*zhengzai guanggao dachangai foundation also often ZAI/*ZENGZAI advertise Colon Cancer “ Foundation is also often advertising Colon Cancer.”","(13) aspectuality adverbs ß õ nO BŁ n »»»» /* T n' n I [qc [č§ Muqian quanguo ge yundong danxiang xiehui luxu zai/*zhengzai zhaokai currently national each exercise single-item association continuously ZAI/*ZENGZAI hold huiyuan dahui jinxing lijianshi ji lishizhang gaixuan‡ general meeting carry on supervisor and director re-election “ Currently each national association of single-item exercise is continuously holding the","general meeting to carry on the re-election of the supervisor and the director.” The shorter form zai can co-occur with the above frequency adverbs, since it is compatible with the feature [+iterative] in that the progressive event can be repetitive. It not only represents simple progressive as an on-going event but can also signal habitual-progressive with the use of durational adverbs. With regard to manner adverbs, both zai and zhengzai may occur with a variety of manner adverbs. But, there is a significant constraint in terms of the position of the manner adverb. Zhengzai cannot take a preceding manner adverb as shown in (14), while zai can occur both with preceding and following manner adverbs as (14) and (15).","(14) ̨‰‰‰‰ /* j","huajia youxiandi zai/*zhengzai xiesheng","painter leisurely and carefree ZAI/*ZENGZAI draw from nature","“ The painter is leisurely and carefree drawing from nature” (15) a. œ 6666 [ zhengtian dou zai butingde jiao all day ZAI continuously cry “ (she) is crying continuously all day.”","b. @ » fifififififififi","tingjian xiauji zhengzai jijide chaunau","hear chicken ZHENGZAI peep make noise","“ Hears the chicken is peeping and making noise.” Manner adverbs typically characterize the way or means the event is carried out. Since zhengzai signals the overlapping of an on-going event with a specific time point, which, when substantiated, is supposed take up the slot immediately preceding zhengzai. Thus, a manner adverb cannot take the pre-aspectual position that may be occupied by a time reference. It then ended up only in the post-aspectual position immediately preceding the verb, a slot that will not block the expression of reference time. On the other hand, zai is free from a specified time reference and may take a pre- or post-aspectual manner adverb. But the scope of modification differs with different positions of manner adjuncts. When a manner adjunct occurs after zai and immediately before the verb, it is event-internal, modifying the single instance of the predicated event. However, when a manner adjunct occurs before zai, it is event-external, modifying the relation of the predicated event with some other constituent. In sum, zhengzai requires a time reference, indicating the on-going process pertaining to a specific time point. It is a semantically and pragmatically stronger form to represent progressive event [8]. It cannot be used to express repetitive-progressive (He is repetitively hitting the ball), continuous-progressive (He continued hitting the ball) or habitual progressive (He is always hitting the ball). But zai can occur with [+iterative] and [-iterative] events without a specified time reference. The distinction between them is that zhengzai only indicates deictic progressive (tensed aspect), while zai is compatible with other types of progressives."]},{"title":"4 Conclusion ","paragraphs":["This paper discusses the distinction between zai and zhengzai with evidence from their collocational patterns. It is found that the use of adverbial adjuncts with zai and zhengzai represents a significance difference. Zhengzai is more constrained in semantic and pragmatic specifications. It cannot co-occur with [+iterative] adverbials indicating repetition of an event or adverbials without a specific time reference. Zhengzai indicates an on-going progressive event at a specific time, signaling temporally deictic aspectuality. On the other hand, zai is less restricted in marking all kinds of progressive perspective.","In Chinese, there are other markers which can also indicate the progressive or imperfective aspect, such as zheng (%) or zhe (). Thus, in further studies, we can compare zai, zhengzai and other progressive markers to come to a complete picture of the imperfective marking system. In addition, this paper does not exhaust all types of adverbial collocations. There are other types of adverbs which do not collocate with zhengzai , such as negative adverbs. It can be reserved for a follow-up study in the future. Moreover, discourse-level constraints on the use of the two markers would be another interesting area to look further into."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["[1] B. Corrie. Aspect.
