In the analysis of speech signals, thirty-three acoustic features are extracted from the speech input.

Introduction","paragraphs":["Human-machine interface technology has been investigated for several decades. Recent research has placed more emphasis on the recognition of nonverbal information, and has especially focused on emotion reaction. Many kinds of physiological characteristics are used to extract emotions, such as voice, facial expressions, hand gestures, body movements, heartbeat and blood pressure. Scientists have found that emotion technology can be an important component in artificial intelligence [Salovey et al. 1990], especially for human-human communication. Although human-computer interaction is different from human-human communication, some theories show that human-computer interaction shares  * Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, ROC E-mail: {bala, chwu}@csie.ncku.edu.tw   46 Ze-Jing Chuang, and Chung-Hsien Wu basic characteristics with human-human interaction [Reeves et al. 1996]. In addition, affective information is pervasive in electronic documents, such as digital news reports, economic reports, e-mail, etc. The conclusions reached by researchers with respect to emotion can be extended to other types of subjective information [Subasic et al. 2001]. For example, education assistance software should be able to detect the emotions of users and; therefore; choose suitable teaching courses. Moreover, the study of emotions can apply to some assistance systems, such as virtual babysitting systems or virtual psychologist systems.","In recent years, several research works have focused on emotion recognition. Cohn and Katz [Cohn et al. 1998] developed a semi-automated method for emotion recognition from faces and voices. Silva [Silva et al. 2000] used the HMM structure to recognize emotion from both video and audio sources. Yoshitomi [Yoshitomi et al. 2000] combined the hidden Markov model (HMM) and neural networks to extract emotion from speech and facial expressions. Other researchers focused on extracting emotion from speech data only. Fukuda and Kostov [Fukuda et al. 1999] applied a wavelet/cepstrum-based software tool to perform emotion recognition from speech. Yu [Yu et al. 2001] developed a support vector machine (SVM)-based emotion recognition system. However, few approaches have focused on emotion recognition from textual input. Textual information is another important communication medium and can be retrieved from many sources, such as books, newspapers, web pages, e-mail messages, etc. It is not only the most popular communication medium, but also rich in emotion. With the help of natural language processing techniques, emotions can be extracted from textual input by analyzing punctuation, emotional keywords, syntactic structure, semantic information, etc. In [Chuang et al. 2002], the authors developed a semantic network for performing emotion recognition from textual content. That investigation focused on the use of textual information in emotion recognition systems. For example, the identification of emotional keywords in a sentence is very helpful to decide the emotional state of the sentence. A possible application of textual emotion recognition is the on-line chat system. With many on-line chat systems, users are allowed to communicate with each other by typing or speaking. A system can recognize a user’s emotion and give an appropriate response.","In this paper, a multi-modal emotion recognition system is constructed to extract emotion information from both speech and text input. The emotion recognition system classifies emotions according to six basic types: happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise and disgust. If the emotion intensity value of the currently recognized emotion is lower than a predefined threshold, the emotion output is determined to be neutral. The proposed emotion recognition system can detect emotions from two different types of information: speech and text. To evaluate the acoustic approach, a broadcast drama, including speech signal and textual content, is adopted as the training corpus instead of artificial emotional speech. During feature selection, an initial acoustic feature set that contained 33 features is first analyzed and   Multi-Modal Emotion Recognition from Speech and Text 47 extracted. These acoustic features contain several possible characteristics, such as intonation, timbre, acoustics, tempo, and rhythm. We also extract some features to represent special intonations, such as trembling speech, unvoiced speech, and crying speech. Finally, among these diverse features, the most significant features are selected by means of principle component analysis (PCA) to form an acoustic feature vector. The acoustic feature vector is fed to the Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to determine the emotion output according to hyperplanes determined by the training corpus.","For emotion recognition via text, we assume that the emotional reaction of an input sentence is essentially represented by its word appearance. Two primary word types, “emotional keywords” and “emotion modification words,” are manually defined and used to extract emotion from the input sentence. All the extracted emotional keywords and emotion modification words have their corresponding “emotion descriptors” and “emotion modification values.” For each input sentence, the emotion descriptors are averaged and modified using the emotion modification values to give the current emotion output. Finally, the outputs of the textual and acoustic approaches are combined with the emotion history to give the final emotion output.","The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the module for recognizing emotions from speech signals. The details of SVM classification model is also provided in this section. Then the textual emotion recognition module and the integration of these two modules are presented in sections 2.3 and 3, respectively. Finally, experimental results obtained using the integrated emotion recognition system are provided in section 5, and some conclusions are drawn in section 6."]},{"title":"2. Acoustic Emotion Recognition Module","paragraphs":["Deciding on appropriate acoustic features is a crucial step in emotion recognition. As in similar research, this study adopts the pitch and energy features and their derivatives.

These features are also extracted in our approach."]},{"title":"2.1 Feature Extraction","paragraphs":["A diagram of the acoustic feature extraction approach is shown in Figure 1. In the proposed approach, four basic acoustic features, pitch, energy, formant 1 (F1), and the zero crossing rate (ZCR), are estimated first. Previous research has shown that emotional reactions are strongly related to the pitch and energy of the speech. For example, the pitch of speech associated with anger or happiness is always higher than that associated with sadness or disappointment, and the energy associated with surprise or anger is also greater than that associated with fear.   48 Ze-Jing Chuang, and Chung-Hsien Wu "]},{"title":"Figure 1.

If a principle component is selected, the features that have larger combination weights are also selected and form a feature subspace. The combination weights of the original features are represented in the transformation matrix, which is calculated in PCA. By setting the threshold of the combination weights to a value of 0.2, we can select the significant features for each principle component to form a feature set. Therefore, we have 14 feature subspaces.","Table 1 shows an example of feature subspace generation.

The emotion descriptor is a set of descriptions of the emotion reactions corresponding to the keywords. Basically, it contains an emotional state label and an intensity value, which ranges   Multi-Modal Emotion Recognition from Speech and Text 53 from 0 to 1. The emotional state label can be one of the following six labels: happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and disgust. The intensity value describes how strongly the keyword belongs to this emotional state. In many cases, however, a word may contain one or more emotional reactions. Accordingly, there may be more than one emotion descriptor for each emotional keyword. For example, two emotional states, sadness and anger, are involved in the keyword “disappointed.” However, the keyword “depressed” is annotated with only one emotional state: sadness. After the tagging process is completed, the emotion descriptors of the word “disappointed” are {(2, 0.2), (3, 0.6)}, and the emotion descriptor of the word “depressed” is {(3, 0.6)}. The numbers 2 and 3 in the parentheses indicate the emotional states anger and sadness, respectively. The numbers 0.2 and 0.6 represent the degree of the emotional states.

For example, the following three phrases have different emotional states and emotion degrees: “happy,” “very happy,” and “not happy.” The only difference between these three phrases is in the emotion modification words “very” and “not.” In order to quantify the emotional effect for different emotion modification words, we define an emotion modification value. According to the previous analysis of emotions [Lang. 1990], all emotion modification words can be classified into two groups: positive emotion modification words and negative emotion modification words. Positive emotion modification words strengthen the current emotional state, while negative emotion modification words reverse the current emotional state. For example, “very happy” is stronger than “happy” because of the use of word “very,” but “not happy” may be sad or angry.","The emotion modification value is manually defined for each emotion modification word. It consists of a sign and a number. The sign indicates the positive or negative state of the emotion modification word, and the number indicates the modification strength of the emotion modification word. For example, the emotion modification values of the words or phrases “a little,” “very,” and “extremely” are +1, +2, and +3, respectively. And the emotion modification values of the words or phrases “not at all,” “not,” and “never” are -1, -2, and -3, respectively. The degree ranges from 1 to 3.

The outside test was performed using an extra corpus collected from the same broadcast drama. There were a total of 200 sentences in 51 dialogues in this corpus. When the integration strategy was used, the performance of the integrated system is better than that any of the individual modules. Compared with the results obtained by the acoustic module, the results obtained with the integrated system were 5.05% higher. In order to understand the results, we verified the test corpus manually and found that when a sentence was recognized as having one emotional state, it usually contained either emotional keywords or no keywords. Only a few sentences contained emotional keywords with opposite the emotional states. Thus when the output of the acoustic module was reliable, the output of the textual module could slightly support the results obtained by the acoustic module. But if the acoustic module could not identify the emotional state of an input sentence, the emotional keywords played an important role in the final calculation."]},{"title":"Table 7.

Conclusion","paragraphs":["In this paper, an emotion recognition system with multi-modal input has been proposed. When PCA and the SVM model are applied, the emotional state of a speech input can be classified and fed into the textual emotion recognition module. This approach to recognizing emotions from textual information is based on pre-defined emotion descriptors and emotion modification values. After all the emotion outputs have been integrated, the final emotional state is further smoothed by mean of the previous emotion history. The experimental results show that the multi-modal strategy is a more promising approach to emotion recognition than the single module strategy.","In our study, we investigated a method of textual emotion recognition and also tested the combination of the two emotion recognition approaches. Our method can extract emotions from both speech and textual information without the need for a sophisticated speech recognizer. However, there are still many problems that remain to be solved. For example, in the textual emotion recognition module, syntactic structure information is important for natural language processing but cannot be obtained using HowNet alone. An additional parser may be needed to solve this problem. In the acoustic module, crying and laughing sounds are useful for deciding on the current emotional state but are hard to extract. A sound recognizer may, thus, be useful for improving the emotion recognition performance."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Salovey, P. and J.
