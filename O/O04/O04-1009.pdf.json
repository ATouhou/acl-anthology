Syllable-to-word (STW) conversion is a frequently used Chinese input method that is fundamental to syllable/speech understanding. The two major problems with STW conversion are the segmentation of syllable input and the ambiguities caused by homonyms. This paper describes a meaningful word-pair (MWP) identifier that can be used to resolve homonym/segmentation ambiguities and perform STW conversion effectively for Chinese language texts. It is designed as a support system with Chinese input systems. In this paper, five types of meaningful word-pairs are investigated, namely: noun-verb (NV), noun-noun (NN), verb-verb (VV), adjective-noun (AN) and adverb-verb (DV). The pre-collected datasets of meaningful word-pairs are based on our previous work auto-generation of NVEF knowledge in Chinese (AUTO-NVEF) [30, 32], where NVEF stands for noun-verb event frame.","The main purpose of this study is to illustrate that a hybrid approach of combining statistical language modeling (SLM) with contextual information, such as meaningful word-pairs, is effective for improving syllable-to-word systems and is important for syllable/speech understanding. Our experiments show the following: (1) the MWP identifier achieves tonal (syllables with four tones) and toneless (syllables without four tones) STW accuracies of 98.69% and 90.7%, respectively, among the identified word-pairs for the test syllables; (2) by STW error analysis, we find that the major critical problem of tonal STW systems is the failure of homonym disambiguation (52%), while that of toneless STW systems is inadequate syllable segmentation (48%); (3) by applying the MWP identifier, together with the Microsoft input method editor (MSIME 2003) and an optimized bigram model (BiGram), the tonal and toneless STW improvements of the two STW systems are 25.25%/21.82% and 12.87%/15.62%, respectively.","Keywords: syllable-to-word, contextual information, top-down identifier, n-gram model."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["More than 100 Chinese input methods have been developed in the past [1, 17, 12, 5, 18, 10, 19, 16, 4, 28, 11, 20]. Their underlying approaches can be classified into four types:","(a) Optical character recognition (OCR) based [5],","(b) On-line handwriting based [19],","(c) Speech based [4, 10], and","(d) Keyboard based, such as syllabic-input-to-character [27, 16, 2, 14, 15, 22]; arbitrary codes based [8]; and","structure scheme based [11]. The major goal of these syllable input systems is to achieve high STW accu-","racy, but syllable understanding is rarely considered [16]. Currently, the most popular method for Chinese input is syllable based (or phonetic/pinyin based), because Chinese people are taught to write the corresponding phonetic/pinyin syllable of each Chinese character in primary school. Basically, each Chinese character corresponds to at least one syllable. Although there are more than 13,000 distinct Chinese characters (of which 5,400 are commonly used), there are only 1,300 distinct syllables. The homonym (homophone) problem is, therefore, quite severe when using a Chinese phonetic input method [5]. As per [26], each Chinese syllable can be mapped from 3 to over 100 Chinese characters, with the average number of characters per syllable being 17. Therefore, homonym disambiguation is a critical problem that requires the development of an effective syllable-to-word (STW) conversion system for Chinese. A comparable problem for STW conversion in English is word-sense disambiguation (WSD).","There are two conventional approaches for STW conversion: the linguistic approach based on syntax parsing, semantic template matching and contextual information [18, 22, 16, 28, 15]; and the statistical approach based on the n-gram model where n is usually 2 or 3 [12, 10, 11, 20, 21, 13, 27]. Although the linguistic approach requires considerable effort in designing effective syntax rules, semantic templates or contextual information, it is more user-friendly than the statistical approach (i.e. it is easier to understand why such a system makes a mistake) [16]. On the other hand, the statistical language model (SLM) used in the statistical approach requires less effort and has been widely adopted in commercial systems. However, the power of the statistical approach depends on the training  corpus [10] and the SLM pays little attention to syllable understanding [16]. Following the work of [12, 18, 10, 28, 11, 15, 13], a better approach to STW conversion is to integrate both linguistic knowledge (such as contextual information) and statistical approaches (such as an n-gram model). We believe that our research proves the efficacy of such an integrated approach.","According to previous studies [5, 28, 11, 20, 9], besides homonyms, correct syllable-word segmentation is an-other crucial problem of STW conversion. Incorrect syllable-word segmentation directly influences the conversion rate of STW. For example, consider the syllable sequence “yi1 du4 ji4 yu2 zhong1 guo2 de5 niang4 jiu3 ji4 shu4” of the sentence “⁄@«(once)»̀¿(covet)⁄⁄Œ(China)“”(of)C̆s(making-wine)§‡N(technique).” According to the CKIP lexicon [6], the two possible syllable-word segmentations are:"," (F) “yi1/du4ji4/yu2/zhong1guo2/de5/niang4jiu3/ji4shu4”; and (B) “yi1/du4/ji4yu2/zhong1guo2/de5/niang4jiu3/ji4shu4.” (We use the forward (F) and the backward (B) longest syllable-word first strategies [3], and “/” to indicate a syllable-word boundary).  Among the above syllable-word segmentations, there is an ambiguous syllable-word section: /du4ji4/yu2/ (/{§“ §}/{⁄_,ƒf,§E,',“»,«\\,fiT,‡‰,·r,·,,̋a,¶¤,fi,•M,•fi,•,‚•,„O,”fi,‰,l,}̀/); and /du4/ji4yu2/ (/{§“,§ø,¤{,«,·, Æ̀,ß̄}/{»̀¿,V̂‡‰}/), respectively. In this case, if the system has the contextual information that the pairs “§‡N (technique)-»̀¿(covet)” and “⁄@«(once)-»̀¿(covet)” are, respectively, meaningful noun-verb (NV) and adverb-verb (DV) word-pairs, then the ambiguous syllable-word section can be effectively resolved and the word-pairs “§‡N(technique)-»̀¿(covet)” and “⁄@«(once)-»̀¿(covet)” of this syllable sequence can be correctly identified.","For the above case, if we look at the Sinica corpus [6], the bigram frequencies of “»̀¿(covet)-⁄⁄Œ(China)” and “'(at)-⁄⁄Œ(China)” are 0 and 24, respectively. Therefore, by using a bigram model trained with the Sinica corpus, the forward syllable-word segmentation would conclude that the following word segmentation /'/⁄⁄Œ/, will be incorrect. In fact, if we use Microsoft Input Method Editor 2003 for Traditional Chinese (a trigram like STW product), the syllables of the above example will be converted to “⁄@«(once)~̃(continue)'(to)⁄⁄Œ(China)“”(of) C̆s(making-wine)§‡N(technique).” It is widely recognized that unseen event (“»̀¿-⁄⁄Œ”) and over-weighting (“'-⁄⁄Œ”) are two major problems of SLM systems [10, 11]. Practical SLM is either a bigram or a trigram model. As the above case shows, the meaningful word-pairs (or contextual information) “§‡N(technique)-»̀¿(covet)” and “⁄@«(once)-»̀¿(covet)” can be used to overcome both the unseen event and over-weighting problems of SLM-based STW systems. In [29], we showed that the knowledge of noun-verb event frame (NVEF) sense-pairs and their corresponding NVEF word-pairs (NVEF knowledge) are useful for effectively resolving word sense ambiguity with an accuracy of 93.7%. In [28], we showed that a NVEF word-pair identifier with pre-collected NVEF knowledge can be used to obtain a tonal (syllables with four tones) STW accuracy of more than 99% for the NVEF related portion in Chinese.","The objective of this study is to illustrate the effectivness of meaningful noun-verb (NV), noun-noun (NN), verb-verb (VV), adjective-noun (AN) and adverb-verb (DV) word-pairs for solving Chinese STW conversion problems. We conduct STW experiments to show that the tonal and toneless STW accuracies of conventional SLM models and the commercial input products can be improved by using a meaningful word-pair identifier without a tuning process. In this paper, we use tonal to indicate the syllables input with four tones, such as “niang4(C̆) jiu3(s) ji4(§) shu4(‡N),” and toneless to indicate the syllables input without four tones, such as “niang(C̆) jiu(s) ji(§) shu(‡N).”","The remainder of this paper is arranged as follows. In Section 2, we propose the method for auto-generating the meaningful word-pairs in Chinese based on [30, 32], and a meaningful word-pair identifier to resolve homonym/segmentation ambiguities of STW conversion in Chinese. The meaningful word-pair identifier is based on pre-collected datasets of meaningful word-pairs. In Section 3, we present our STW experiment results and analysis. Finally, in Section 4, we give our conclusions and suggest some future research directions."]},{"title":"2. Development of the Meaningful Word-Pair Identifier","paragraphs":["To develop the meaningful word-pair (MWP) identifier, we selected Hownet [7] as our system’s dictionary because it provides knowledge of Chinese words, word senses and part-of-speeches (POS).

It extracts NVEF knowledge from Chinese sentences by four major processes: (1) Segmentation checking; (2) Initial Part-of-Speech (IPOS) sequence generation; (3) NV knowledge generation; and (4) NVEF knowledge auto-confirmation. The details of the four processes can be found in [32]. Take the Chinese sentence “›...•|(concert)/†{‡ı(locale)/·Ø⁄J (enter)/‡\\ƒh(many)/[̆†‡(audience members)” as an example. For this sentence, AUTO-NVEF will generate two collections of NVEF knowledge: †{‡ı(locale)-·Ø⁄J(enter) and [̆†‡(audience members)-·Ø⁄J(enter). In [32], we reported that AUTO-NVEF achieved 98.52% accuracy for news and 96.41% for specific text types, which included research reports, classical literature and modern literature. In addition, it automatically discovered over 400,000 NVEF word-pairs in the UDN 2001 corpus.","Using AUTO-NVEF as the base, we extended the system into a meaningful word-pair (MWP) generation called AUTO-MWP. The steps of AUTO-MWP are:","Step 1. Use AUTO-NVEF to generate NVEF word-pairs for the given Chinese sentence. AUTO-NVEF adopts a","forward=backward maximum matching technique to perform word segmentation and a bigram-like model","to perform POS tagging [32]. If no NVEF word-pairs are generated, go to Step 3.","Step 2. According to the generated NVEF word-pairs and the word-segmented sentence with POS tagging from Step","1, the auto-generation methods of meaningful NN, VV, AN and DV word-pairs are:","(1) Generation of NN word-pair. When the number of generated NVEF word-pairs is greater than 1, this sub-process will be triggered. If the nouns of two generated NVEF word-pairs share the same verb, the two nouns will be designated as a meaningful NN word-pair.

When the number of generated NVEF word-pairs is greater than 1, this sub-process will be triggered. If the verbs of two generated NVEF word-pairs share the same noun, the two verbs will be designated as a meaningful VV word-pair.

For each noun of a generated NVEF word-pair, if the word immediately to its left is an adjective, the noun and the adjective are designated as one AN word-pair.

Furthermore, the results indicate that the meaningful word-pairs, or contextual information, can be used to effectively overcome the unseen event and over-weighting problems of SLM models in Chinese STW conversion."]},{"title":"3.4 Error Analysis of STW Conversion","paragraphs":["We examine the Top 300 cases in the tonal and toneless STW conversion from the open testing results of BiGram","with the MWP identifier and classify them according to the following three major types of error (see Table 6): (1) Unknown words: For any NLP system, unknown word extraction is one of the most difficult problems","[31]. Sinc proper names are major types of unknown words, we classify the cases of unknown words into","two sub-types and calculate their corresponding percentages, as shown in Table 6. (2) Inadequate syllable segmentation: When an error is caused by word overlapping, instead of an unknown","word problem, we call it inadequate syllable segmentation. (3) Homophones: These are the remaining errors. ","Table 6. Three major error types of tonal/toneless STW conversion.","Types Sub-Types Percentage within","this type (%) Examples Overall Per-","centage (%) Proper names 50 / 50 '̄¡B„”ß•¡B‹¤„ Unknown word Other cases 50 / 50 «„A¡B⁄̄U 11.7 / 10.5 Inadequate syllable segmentation ","Tonal cases: ‚g/„‚̀¡F‚g–‘/‹O¡B ‡o¤/̇›“o/‹O¡F‡o¤/̇⁄‚/¶l¥«¡B","Toneless cases: •N«/‹O¡F¥H/¥|¥v¡B “”/Œfia¡F...wŒ/fia 35.9 / 50.8 Homophone Tonal cases: »/¶•¡B⁄§/̨•s«‹¡B‹“/¤C“ Toneless cases: ¥D‚q/“‘•N¡B‹̀O/Hfi¡B·£¿/Ø̄«‹ 52.4 / 38.7  From Table 6, we make the following observations: (1) The percentages of unknown word errors for the tonal and toneless STW systems are similar. Since","the unknown word problem is not specifically a STW problem, it can be easily taken care of through man-","ual editing or semi-automatic learning during input. In practice, therefore, the tonal and toneless STW ac-","curacies could be raised to 98% and 91%, respectively. However, even though unknown words of the first","error type have been incorporated in the system dictionary, they could still face the problems of inadequate","syllable segmentation or failed homophone disambiguation. (2) The major error types of tonal and toneless STW systems are different. To improve tonal STW sys-","tems, the major targets should be cases of failed homophone disambiguation. For toneless STW systems,","on the other hand, cases of inadequate syllable segmentation should be the focus for improvement. To sum up the above observations, the bottlenecks of the STW conversion lie in the second and third error","types. To resolve these issues, we believe one possible approach is to extend the size of MWP data to increase the","identified MWP character ratio. This is because our experiment results show that the MWP identifier can achieve","better tonal and toneless STW accuracies than those of BiGram and MSIME 2003 on the MWP-related portion (see","the examples given in Appendix B)."]},{"title":"4. Conclusions and Directions for Future Research","paragraphs":["In this paper, we have applied a MWP identifier to the Chinese STW conversion problem and obtained a high degree of STW accuracy on the MWP-related portion. All of the MWP data was generated fully automatically by using AUTO-MWP on the UDN 2001 corpus. The experiments on STW conversion in [28] and on WSD in [29], as well as the STW experiments in this study, demonstrate that meaningful word-pairs (i.e. contextual information) are key linguistic features of NLP/NLU systems. We are encouraged by the fact that MWP knowledge can achieve tonal and toneless STW accuracies of 98.46% and 90.70%, respectively, for the MWP-related portion of the testing syllables. The MWP identifier can be easily integrated into existing STW conversion systems by identifying meaningful word-pairs in a post-processing step. Our experiment shows that, by applying the MWP identifier together with MSIME 2003 (a trigram-like model) and BiGram (an optimized bigram model), the tonal and toneless STW improvements are 25.25%/21.82% and 12.87%/15.62%, respectively.","Currently, our approach is quite basic when more than one MWP occurs in the same sentence (Step 3 in Section 2.2). Although there is room for improvement, we believe it would not produce a noticeable effect as far as the STW accuracy is concerned. However, this issue will become important as we apply the MWP knowledge to parsing or speech understanding.","The MWP-based approach has the potential to provide the following information for a given syllable sequence: (1) better word segmentation; and (2) MWP-sentence including the information of five types of MWPs. Such information will be useful for general NLP and NLU systems, especially for syllable/speech understanding and full/shallow parsing. According to our computations, the collection of MWP knowledge can cover approximately 50% of the characters in the UDN 2001 corpus.","We will continue to expand our collection of MWP knowledge to cover more characters in the UDN 2001 corpus. In other directions, we will try to improve our MWP-based STW conversion with other statistical language models, such as HMM, and extend it to other areas of NLP, especially Chinese shallow parsing and syllable/speech understanding."]},{"title":"5.
