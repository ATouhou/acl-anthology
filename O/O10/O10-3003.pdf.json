Introduction","paragraphs":["The blogspace is a large resource for opinion mining. Opinion extraction methods are valuable for a wide range of applications.","Our initial interest is to extract opinions related to tourist attractions from blog articles because it is helpful to see other people’s opinions about tourist attractions when planning a tour. Nevertheless, two issues arise when trying to apply published methods to retrieve opinions of tourist attractions:  ∗ Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Taiwan Ocean University No 2, Pei-Ning Road, Keelung, 20224 Taiwan E-mail: {cjlin, M96570038}@ntou.edu.tw   38 Chuan-Jie Lin and Pin-Hsien Chao  (1) Sentence-level or document-level: A travel article is often multi-topic because a travel route often includes several tourist attractions. Therefore, the opinion analysis for a specific tourist attraction should be carried out at sentence level, not document level. (2) Opinion topic or opinion target: Tourist attractions may be treated as topics (queries in IR) or as targets of opinions. Consider the following two sentences selected and adapted from our dataset: The Dream Lake is a beautiful place. The water is green and clear. Both sentences are considered tourism-related opinions by us. Their opinion targets, however, are not the same. The opinion target of the first sentence is “the Dream Lake” itself, while the target of the second sentence is “the water” (in the Dream Lake). Both sentences are related to the same topic, “the Dream Lake,” but the second sentence does not contain its topic words. We find difficulty in applying the previously developed methods due to these reasons. Opinion mining and analysis have been widely studied in several topics, including opinion detection and polarity classification (Wiebe et al., 2001; Pang et al., 2002; Alm et al., 2005; Ghose et al., 2007), opinion holder finding (Choi et al., 2005; Kim & Hovy, 2005; Breck et al., 2007), and opinion summarization (Ku et al., 2005). Some well-known large-scale opinion mining benchmarks have also been created, such as the NTCIR MOAT datasets (Seki et al., 2010) which are constructed on four languages, including Traditional Chinese.","Opinion retrieval is one of the research topics relevant to our work. Godbole et al. (2007) estimated the polarity scores for a large set of named entities. Nevertheless, the opinionated sentences that did not contain named entities were skipped because they measured the scores by the co-occurrences of named entities and opinion words. Ku et al. (2005) retrieved documents containing relevant opinions relating to TREC-like topics. Zhang et al. (2008) accepted short queries (titles only) and expanded the queries by web resources and relevance feedback. The units of their retrieval work, however, were documents, not sentence-level. Okamoto et al. (2009) extracted relevant opinionated sentences by language model. Unfortunately, a large-scale training set is required to build a reliable probabilistic model, which is labor-consuming to prepare in the tourism domain.","Opinion target identification is another research topic that is relevant to our work. Many researchers have focused on learning features of pre-defined types of products from reviews (Hu & Liu, 2004; Ghani et al., 2006; Xia et al., 2009). Nevertheless, the question remains whether the features of all kinds of tourist attractions are common. Moreover, in the   Tourism-Related Opinion Detection and Tourist-Attraction Target Identification 39 conventional definition, an opinion target in a tourism-related opinion is not always the name of the tourist attraction.","Therefore, we define tourism-related opinion mining as a new topic and propose several approaches to solve the problem, including rule-based approaches and machine learning approaches. Although the experimental data used in this paper are written in Chinese, many of the rules and features are not language-dependent or can be easily adopted if necessary resources are available. We also hope that the experience gained from these experiments can be applied to other domains where articles are often multi-topic, such as baseball game critics.","The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 presents the main ideas of tourism-related opinion identification and introduces the resources prepared for the work. Section 3 describes the design of a rule-based opinion identification system. Section 4 defines the features for training classifiers to build an opinion identification system. Section 5 discusses the experimental results, and Section 6 concludes this paper."]},{"title":"2. Tourism-Related Opinion Analysis 2.1 Problem Definition","paragraphs":["Opinionated sentences related to tourist attractions are the main interest of this paper. We call such an opinionated sentence a tourism-related opinion (hereafter “TR-opinion”) and its targeted tourist attraction a tourist attraction target (hereafter “TA-target”).","The main goal of this paper is to retrieve TR-opinions and determine their TA-targets. That is, given an opinionated sentence, determine whether it is tourism-related or not, and decide which tourist attraction is the focus of this opinion. Our experiments were performed based on two assumptions: (1) sentences have been correctly tagged as ‘opinionated’ or not; (2) tourist attraction names appearing in a document have been correctly recognized. Hence, we have not integrated an opinion detection module and a tourist-attraction recognition module into our system yet.","Opinion identification is not the main focus of this paper. There has been a lot of research on this topic. In the future, we would like to perform well-developed methods to do opinion detection in order to build a full system. In this paper, though, the input sentences are those sentences correctly labeled as opinions.","Tourist attraction name recognition also is not a focus of this paper. It requires a named entity recognition system specifically designed for tourist attraction names, but we cannot find one. Although some of the tourist attractions are locations or organizations, such as parks or museums, there are various types of names, such as monuments or scenic spots that would need to be learned. In this paper, we simply prepare a list of tourist attraction names and manually check the correctness of the occurrences of the attraction names in the articles.   40 Chuan-Jie Lin and Pin-Hsien Chao  Tourist attraction name recognition will be studied in the future. The main ideas in accomplishing the tasks are: (1) Some opinion words strongly hint that a sentence is tourism-related.","(2) The frequency of use of a tourist attraction and its distance to an opinionated sentence can be useful information.","(3) A tourist attraction can be expressed in several ways in an article. This is the well-known coreference problem.","(4) A sentence may target a tourist attraction if its preceding sentence also focuses on a tourist attraction. Before designing rules or features according to these ideas, some resources were prepared beforehand, as described in the following subsections."]},{"title":"2.2 Experimental Dataset Preparation","paragraphs":["The best known benchmarks for opinion mining are the NTCIR MOAT datasets (Seki et al., 2010). There was one pilot task in NTCIR-6 and were two formal tasks in NTCIR-7 and NTCIR-8. There are a total of 70 topics in Traditional Chinese. Nevertheless, none of their information need is about tourism attraction opinions. Although some topics may bring in tourism-related documents, such as the terrorist bombing on Bali Island and the tsunami in Sumatra, the number of topics is too small, and we still have to find TR-opinions among the opinionated sentences. For these reasons, we decided to build a new experimental dataset in the tourism domain.","200 travel articles were collected from a blog site called Wretch1","(無名小站). These articles were categorized as “domestic travel” on the blog site. We chose the most recommended articles by the readers in order to assure that the articles were truly about travel.","Three annotators were asked to annotate the data. Each sentence was labeled as opinionated or not, its opinion polarity was assigned, and its TA-target was found if the annotator considered it a TR-opinion.","The guidelines of TA-target decision for the annotators are as follows. Given a document, a list of tourist attractions mentioned in the document is shown to the annotators. A TA-target must be one of the tourist attractions on the list. If an opinion is made on a part of a tourist attraction (e.g. the souvenir shop in an amusement park), its TA-target is set to be the tourist attraction. If an opinionated sentence mentions a tourist attraction together with the city it belongs to, its TA-target is set to be the tourist attraction only. A city can be chosen as a TA-target only when the blogger directly expresses his or her feeling about the city. Note that,  1 http://www.wretch.cc/blog   Tourism-Related Opinion Detection and Tourist-Attraction Target Identification 41 if a sentence only expresses the blogger’s emotion (e.g. “I am so happy today”), it is not a TR-opinion.","The final annotations of the experimental dataset were determined by two-stage voting. The first stage determined a sentence being positive-, neutral-, negative-, or non-opinionated. The second stage determined the sentence being a TR-opinion or not by deciding its TA-target. In each stage, an option agreed upon by at least two annotators became the final annotation. If no agreement was found, the authors of this paper would choose one of the decisions made by the annotators. Those sentences voted as “non-opinionated” in the first stage were automatically labeled as “not TR-opinion” in the second stage."]},{"title":"Table 1. Agreements of Data Annotations Comparison Opinion and Polarity TR-opinion TA-target","paragraphs":["Annotator 1 vs. 2 0.608 0.569 0.568 Annotator 1 vs. 3 0.584 0.518 0.518 Annotator 2 vs. 3 0.589 0.529 0.529 Exp Data vs. A1 0.791 0.761 0.761 Exp Data vs. A2 0.792 0.769 0.769 Exp Data vs. A3 0.758 0.701 0.701 Table 1 lists the agreement of TR-opinion and TA-target measured by Cohen’s kappa coefficient. The first three rows show the agreement among the annotators. The last three rows give the agreement between the final experimental dataset and each annotator. We can see that the agreement level is not high enough. This means TR-opinion detection and TA-target identification are very challenging.","Among the 200 articles, 37 of them did not contain a tourist attraction and 7 did not contain a TR-opinion. After removing these articles, there were a total of 10,904 sentences in the remaining 156 articles, with 3,542 opinionated sentences and 1,199 TR-opinions, which leads to a precision rate of 33.9% (1199/3542) if a baseline system guesses all of the opinions as TR-opinions.","Table 2 lists the statistical data regarding the number of tourist attractions mentioned in the articles. As we can see, 28 articles contained only one tourist attraction, which means that almost 89% of the articles mentioned multiple tourist attractions, making TA-target detection an issue. There were on average 6.378 tourist attractions mentioned in each article."]},{"title":"Table 2.

Consider the following two examples: I am so excited that the vacation is coming. The lake is so large and clear. The adjective “excited” is often used when describing personal feelings. On the other hand, “clear” is often seen in sentences describing scenic spots. We can say that opinion words are often domain-dependent.","Many papers have focused on finding domain-specific opinion words and deciding their polarities, as mentioned in Section 1. This, however, is slightly different from our need. “Domain” in their works often refers to “a product type,” such as digital cameras. Opinion words related to digital cameras are the adjectives used to express the features of digital cameras, such as “long” for battery life and “heavy” for weight.","Nevertheless, the question remains as to whether there are common features or attributes among tourist attractions. The feature water or clearness only relates to bodies of water, such as rivers and lakes, while the feature design only relates to buildings. Moreover, there are many adjectives expressing opinions directly without denoting any specific features, such as amazing and beautiful (e.g. “this city is beautiful”). Therefore, we want to collect a set of opinion words which are often used in tourism-related opinionated sentences without considering features.","We define a simple function TRscore(ow), the tourism-relatedness score, to estimate the likelihood of an opinion word ow appearing in a TR-opinion by evaluating the ratio of the opinionated sentences where the word ow appears to be tourism-related: )opinionin (# )opinion-TRin (# )(","owow owTRscore = (1) Opinion words whose TR-scores are higher than a predetermined threshold are collected as the tourism-related opinion words (hereafter “TR-opword”). The determination of the value of the threshold of TR-scores is discussed in Section 5.1."]},{"title":"2.4 Coreferential Expressions","paragraphs":["Coreference is an important problem in natural language processing. When a tourist attraction is mentioned in an article, it is quite often expressed in several different ways. Consider the following three sentences selected and adapted from our experimental dataset:    Tourism-Related Opinion Detection and Tourist-Attraction Target Identification 43 My family and I visited the Wufeng Resort last week. We were impressed by the fresh air when we arrived at the resort. Wufeng also thoughtfully provides parking service. All three underlined expressions refer to the same tourist attraction “the Wufeng Resort,” where “resort” is its category, “Wufeng” its name, and “the Wufeng Resort” its full name.","It is quite common to refer a tourist attraction by the category keyword in its name. For this reason, we created a list of tourist attraction keywords (hereafter TA-keywords), which are tourist attraction categories. Note that there are several synonymous keywords in the same category. The method of collecting TA-keywords is as follows.","First, a tourism website called Travel King2","(旅遊資訊王) was visited and 1,836 tourist attraction names located in Taiwan were collected. All of the names were written in Chinese without word segmentation.","For every pair of tourist attraction names, their longest common trailing substring was extracted. The substrings containing only one Chinese character were discarded. After having humans check their correctness, 158 TA-keywords were collected, such as 國家公園 (national park) and 溫泉 (hot spring).","We do not resolve the coreference problem directly. Instead, we try to find potential coreferential expressions. The frequency or distance feature of a tourist attraction is measured by the occurrences of all kinds of coreferential expressions of this tourist attraction. The first type of coreference is expressed by the longest TA-keyword found in a tourist attraction’s name.","The list of the TA-keywords may not be complete enough. Some types of names are not in the list. In order to make the system more robust, we also take the trailing substring (the last two characters) of a full name as one of its possible coreferential expressions.","Similarly, although we can extract the name part of a tourist attraction by deleting the keyword part from its full name, we simply take its leading substring (the first two characters) as one of its possible coreferential expressions.","The function refall(a) is defined to denote all possible coreferential expressions of a tourist attraction a. For example, refall(五峰渡假村) = {五峰渡假村, 渡假村, 五峰, 假村}, i.e. for the tourist attraction 五峰渡假村, its possible coreferential expressions include its full name “五峰渡假村” (the Wufeng Resort), its TA-keyword “渡假村” (Resort), its leading substring “五峰” (Wufeng), and its trailing substring “假村”. An example of coreferential expression detection is given here:  2 http://travel.network.com.tw/tourguide/twnmap/   44 Chuan-Jie Lin and Pin-Hsien Chao ","我和家人上星期去五峰渡假村玩 (My family and I visited the Wufeng Resort last week.)","一到渡假村 1 就對那邊的新鮮空氣印象深刻 (We were impressed by the fresh air when we arrived at the resort1.)","五峰 2 也貼心地提供了停車的服務 (Wufeng2 also thoughtfully provides parking service.)","如果只是單純的放鬆自己什麼都不想 (If you simply want to relax and get away from it all,) 五峰渡假村是個不錯的選擇 (the Wufeng Resort will be a good choice.) In this paragraph, a full name “the Wufeng Resort” (the bordered text) appears in the first and the last lines, while its TA-keyword “resort” (the first underlined text) is found in the second line and its leading substring “Wufeng” (the second underlined text) in the third line.","The strategy for finding occurrences of tourist attractions in a sentence is longest-expression-first. In other words, given a set of tourist attractions {A1, A2, ..., Am}, we will find the attraction Ai whose coreferential expression appearing in this sentence is the longest.","This strategy has its limitations. If a tourist attraction does not reveal its category in its name, it would be difficult to know its category, such as the Louvre as a museum. Another limitation is to know the hierarchy of the tourist attractions. For example, some people will refer to the Wufeng Resort as a hotel or a park. How to detect a tourist attraction and identify its category will be our future work."]},{"title":"3.

All of the features introduced in Section 4.1 and 4.2 are used for training even if a feature only relates to the sentence Si only. Dual-Layer Model The classification module consists of two classifiers. The first-layer classifier determines whether Si is a TR-opinion. Only features introduced in Section 4.1 are used to train the first-layer classifier. If Si is classified as a TR-opinion, the pair <Si, Aj> is passed to the second-layer classifier.

Conclusions and Future Work","paragraphs":["This paper aims at detecting tourism-related opinionated sentences and identifying their tourist attraction targets. Several rules and features were invented and tested in different combinations. The performance is improved by building a dual-layer classification system where the classifiers of TR-opinion detection and TA-target identification are trained separately. Retraining by the prediction method is introduced to decide the values of the TR-Opinion Context Features. This feature, together with the tourism-related opinion words and distances to the tourist attractions were verified to be useful. The best overall performance of TA-target identification is 52.72%, which is about 60% to 75% of human ability.","In the future, we would like to implement known methods to do opinion detection and tourist attraction recognition so we can build a real system and evaluate its performance. More features should be studied for TR-opinion detection.","By the location information of the tourist attractions, it is also interesting to make a summary for a city or a country by the opinions about the tourist attractions located in that area.
