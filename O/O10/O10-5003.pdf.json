Introduction","paragraphs":["Reading is a key competence for language learners. For learners of English as a Second Language (ESL), reading provides a crucial channel for learners to integrate and exercise the knowledge of previously learned vocabulary and grammar. If we could provide appropriate material to ESL learners, they would receive individualized stimulus, maintain the motivation to learn, and benefit more from reading activities. Hence, researchers have been investigating the readability of articles and books for a long time (Flesch, 1948).","In recent decades, research about readability has not been confined to just classifying the readability of articles. In large-scale language tests that include a writing assessment, grading the writing of a large number of test takers is very time consuming. Moreover, maintaining a consistent grading standard over the group of graders is also a challenge. Hence, techniques  1 This paper was converted from the technical report for an NSC-funded undergraduate practice project,","NSC-98-2815-C-004-003-E, for Wei-Ti Kuo. This paper was revised from its Chinese version that","was previously published in the ROCLING XXII conference (Huang et al., 2010). ∗ Department of Computer Science, National Chengchi University, Taipei, Taiwan E-mail: {94703041, 97753007, chaolin}@nccu.edu.tw The author for correspondence is Chao-Lin Liu.   194 Wei-Ti Kuo et al. for automated grading were studied and introduced in the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT2",") in the USA (Burstein et al., 2003; Attali & Burstein, 2006; Chang et al., 2006).","In a broader sense, the problems of determining the readability of articles and judging the scores of essays are specialized instances of text classification. They are similar in that text materials are categorized based on some selected metrics, and they differ in the implications of the classification results.","Early work in readability analysis considered the frequency of words, number of sentences, and length of sentences (Flesch, 1948; Kincaid et al., 1975; Chall & Dale, 1995). These methods may seem deficient nowadays, but it was not easy to consider all conceivable factors when the training corpora and the computing power were not sufficient. Other factors clearly are relevant to readability (Bailin & Grafstein, 2001), and one may consider more lexical level information, such as the hypernyms and hyponyms of words in an article, to determine the readability (Lin et al., 2009). Higher levels of information, such as the structure of the articles, semantic information, and cognition-related connotation, may also be included in readability analysis (Crossley et al., 2008).","Depending on the purpose of classifying the textual material, a classifier should consider factors of various aspects. Linguistic features are obvious candidates, but psycholinguistic, educational, and cultural factors are important as well. Moreover, characteristics of the readers and writers of the essays should also be considered. Classifications of articles written by native speakers and non-native speakers might be quite different. Good reading materials for second graders of native and non-native speakers would vary in terms of their vocabulary and content.","In this study, we examine short essays that were designed for reading comprehension tests at the high school level in Taiwan. Essays were classified based on a comprehensive list of lexical and syntactic features that were extracted from the words, sentences, and paragraphs in a given essay. The essays used in the experiments were realistic; therefore, they were limited in regards to the available amount. We focused on 845 tests for the first four semesters in high school, so essays were classified into four categories that corresponded to the semester of the examinee. We explored the applications of several machine learning models for the classification task, and the best F1 measure (Witten & Frank, 2005) that we achieved was only 0.536.","We understand that there is room to improve our work, in terms of both the scale of experiments and the achieved results of accuracy. The current experience, however, supports a popular viewpoint that lexical and syntactic information about the short essays are  2 We highlighted acronyms of phrases and special terms with boldface and blue text to help readers find","their meanings.   Using Linguistic Features to Predict Readability of Short Essays for 195 Senior High School Students in Taiwan instrumental but are not sufficient for predicting readability (Bailin & Grafstein, 2001). Some deep analysis is required to achieve better results. For instance, the set of a reading comprehension test consists of a short essay and questions for the students to answer. The set of a reading comprehension test may be considered more difficult because of its questions, not just because of its essay. Analyzing the questions is a major step for us to complete the current study.","We introduce the data source and their preprocessing in Section 2, deal with the extracted lexical features in Section 3, discuss the syntactic features in Section 4, present and compare the effects of using different combinations of the features to predict the readability in Section 5, and make some concluding remarks in Section 6."]},{"title":"2. Background","paragraphs":["To make the results of this study close to reality, we obtained essays for comprehension tests for students at senior high schools in Taiwan. The essays were retrieved from the item pool that was designed for the San-Min version (三民版) of English courses, and the item pool was published in the 96th","school year. The 96th","school year spanned August 2007 to July 2008.","The item pool was designed for preparing competence examinations that are similar to the SAT in the USA. Students apply for college during the fifth semester in high school in Taiwan. Hence, the contents of the item pool covered only English for the first two years in senior high school and we treated a semester as a level in our experiments.","The goal of our work was to determine the level of the short essay of a given comprehension test. Namely, we classified an essay into one of four possible levels.","Table 1 shows the number of essays that we gathered from the item pool. The original essays were classified according to their levels and “tracks”. The test items were designed for three tracks of English courses. The first track was designed by Ling-Hsia Chen (陳凌霞) of National Taiwan University, and we denote this track as NTUC in Table 1. The other two tracks were designed by Kwock-Ping John Tse (謝國平) of Providence University. One of these two tracks was more recent than the other. We denote the relatively more recent one as PUTN and the older as PUTO.","The words used in the comprehension tests were chosen based on the expected competence of the students. In Taiwan, the Ministry of Education (MOE) has issued a ruling about what words middle school graduates are expected to be acquainted with (MOE, 2008). Partially because of this constraint, essays for the comprehension tests contained Chinese translations for selected words. The numbers of the essays that did not contain Chinese translations were counted, and the totals are placed under the column “No Hints”. The total number of Chinese words that appeared in the essays was placed under “Chinese Hints” in   196 Wei-Ti Kuo et al. Table 1. Chinese translations were provided in the essays for special nouns, such as names, places, and medical terms, in order to avoid the disturbance of these challenging words against comprehension."]},{"title":"Table 1.

We took the latter position in some of our experiments and ignored the Chinese translations in some experiments. The statistics in Table 1 suggested that the appearance of Chinese translations was related to the levels. On average, there were fewer Chinese translations for the second semester of each school year.","Figure 1 shows the major steps we used to convert an essay into a feature vector. We first removed and recorded the Chinese translations from the original essay, as we discussed in the previous paragraphs. The remaining English texts were then processed by the Stanford Part-of-Speech (POS) tagger3","and the Stanford parser4","to extract the lexical and syntactic features. Except for the Stanford NLP tools, we relied on word lists that were selected by experts (cf. Section 3.1), the CMU Pronouncing dictionary5","(cf. Section 3.2), and Dr.eye6"," dictionary (cf. Section 3.3) to broaden the types of lexical level information that we could extract.","Some linguistic features intuitively are related to the difficulty of essays, e.g., the number of sentences, the number of words, the popularity (frequency) of words, the number of senses a word can carry, and the number of complex sentences. We applied tools and dictionaries for analyzing the linguistic features to create feature vectors (cf. Section 4).","Some basic features could be extracted easily. We calculated the number of sentences (N) in an essay and collected the following features: the number of tokens (f1), the number of punctuations (f2), the number of tokens and punctuations (f3=f1+f2), the average number of  3 http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tagger.shtml 4 http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.shtml 5 http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict 6 http://www.dreye.com/   Using Linguistic Features to Predict Readability of Short Essays for 197 Senior High School Students in Taiwan tokens per sentence (f4=f1/N), the average number of punctuations per sentence (f5= f2/N), and the average number of tokens and punctuations per sentence (f6=f3/N).

In this section, we explain various types of lexical level features that we extracted from words in an essay."]},{"title":"3.1 Word Lists","paragraphs":["Due to the crucial role of individual words in learning English, experts compiled different word lists for different purposes. We employed three lists in our work. Table 2 shows the detailed statistics of the NTNU, GETP, and CEEC word lists.","Professors at National Taiwan Normal University compiled a list of words for a competition related to English words, and we refer to this list as the NTNU list7",". The NTNU list classifies words into three major groups – elementary, middle, and senior high schools – that are further divided for the targeted grades. For instance, “E34” is for the third and the fourth grades in elementary schools; and M3 is for the third year in middle school.","The General English Proficiency Test8","(GEPT) is a standardized test accepted by domestic and some international institutions. To provide references for test takers, the GEPT offers word lists for different levels of test takers.

These three lists include words that people who have graduated from middle schools, high schools, and colleges (non-English majors), respectively, should have learned.","The College Entrance Examination Center9","(CEEC) is an institution for managing the college entrance examinations in Taiwan.

We lemmatized the tokens and identified their POS tags. After this step, we looked up the word lists to see which level the tokens belonged to and updated the frequencies of the levels. Similar to how Dale-Chall dealt with their word list (Dale & Chall, 1995), a word not belonging to any level was considered to belong to the “difficult” level, which is an additional level not listed in Table 2.  9 http://www.ceec.edu.tw/   Using Linguistic Features to Predict Readability of Short Essays for 199 Senior High School Students in Taiwan","We created feature vectors based on the NTNU, GEPT, and CEEC lists separately. With the above procedure, we created 10 features for an essay when we considered the NTNU list – 9 levels in Table 2 and one “difficult” level. Analogously, we had 4 and 7 features for the GEPT and CEEC lists, respectively.","We expected these features to be useful for the essay classification under the premise that, if an essay contains more words in the more advanced levels, the essay should be more difficult."]},{"title":"3.2 Pronunciation","paragraphs":["For ESL learners in Taiwan, an English word with relatively more syllables is generally more difficult to remember and pronounce. This is partially due to the fact that Chinese is a tonal language and students may not be used to words with several syllables yet.","Based on this observation, we thought it might be worthwhile to explore the influence of the number of syllables on the readability of essays. Although not all long words are difficult and not all short words are easy, it was interesting to explore the intuitive impression.","After obtaining the lemmatized tokens in an essay, we looked at the CMU Pronouncing dictionary (CMUPD) to find the number of syllables in the tokens. The CMUPD contains more than 125000 words. The pronunciation of an English word is represented with English letters and numbers. The pronunciation of “university” is shown below. Y UW2 N AH0 V ER1 S AH0 T IY0","Vowels and consonants are separated in CMUPD, and only vowels are followed by digits. The digits indicate stresses: 0 for no stress, 1 for primary stress, and 2 for secondary stress.","Given the CMUPD phoneme notation, we could compute the number of syllables in an English word and the total number of vowels and consonants in a word. Take “university” as an example. This token has 5 syllables and 10 vowels and consonants. In our corpus, a token may have at most 7 syllables and at most 16 vowels and consonants. If a token was not covered by CMUPD, we would record that this token had no syllables, no vowels, and no consonants.10","","","10 We employed distributions of some random variables as features in this paper, and we generally used larger numbers to denote relatively more difficult cases. For instance, when creating features for word lists, larger indices indicated higher grade and more challenging words. Here, we converted the number of syllables of a word into a sequence of features. The first feature denoted the number of words with one syllable, the second feature denoted the number of words with two syllables, etc. We used the zero-th feature to denote the number of words not covered by CMUPD. This would not confuse the classifiers that we tried in Section 5 because the semantics of the order of the features was not explicit to the classifiers.   200 Wei-Ti Kuo et al.","For a given essay, we would record the frequencies of tokens that have i syllables and j vowels and consonants, where i is in the range [0, 7] and j is in the range [0, 16]. Therefore, we had 25 features related to pronunciation of tokens in an essay."]},{"title":"3.3 Lexical Ambiguity","paragraphs":["Ambiguity may not be just a problem for natural language processing of computers; it could be a problem for ESL learners as well. Many English words carry multiple possible meanings. If an essay contains many words with multiple possible meanings, its contents may become relatively difficult to understand. Based on this intuition, we considered the distribution of the numbers of translated senses of words in an essay as features.","Finding the number of translated senses of an English word took a little bit of work. Using the Stanford POS tagger, we could find the POS of a token. The POS tag followed the Penn TreeBank convention11",". Also, we used Dr.eye to find the Chinese translations of English words. Dr.eye only has a very rough POS system: noun, transitive verb, intransitive verb, adjective, adverb, preposition, pronoun, conjunction, and determiner. Therefore, we had to convert a POS tag in the Penn TreeBank system into a category in Dr.eye. We employed the classification in a CEEC publication12",", and considered only 8 different POS tags.

Using Linguistic Features to Predict Readability of Short Essays for 215 Senior High School Students in Taiwan","Intuitively, considering syntactic features should have improved our results. Nevertheless, we probably did not choose the right features. Another possibility would be that the challenging levels of the short essays used in the comprehension tests in Taiwan simply did not relate to syntactic factors."]},{"title":"6. Concluding Remarks","paragraphs":["A random classification of an essay into four categories would have achieved only 25% in accuracy on average. We considered features at the word, sentence, and essay levels in this classification task, and we found that it was possible to improve the F measure from 0.381 (Table 6) to 0.536 (Table 11). The best F measures were observed in 10-fold cross-validation tests for LMT in Weka. Not all classifiers achieved the same quality of classification. Among the four types of classifiers we used in this study, LMT performed the best on average.","The identified improvement was not small, but it was not significant enough either. The problem of determining levels of readability may not be as easy as the public scores suggested. We analyzed our corpus with the SMOG scores in Section 5.1, and found that the essays of supposedly more challenging levels may not have higher SMOG scores than the scores of the supposedly easer essays.

Hence, if using SMOG would not achieve good results for the classification task in our study (cf. Figure 4), then using the other two alternatives would not achieve much better results either.","One challenge to our work is whether we should consider only the short essays and classify the levels of the comprehension tests. A comprehension test contains the essay part and the question part. Obviously, we should take the questions into consideration in the classification task, which we have not begun yet. In addition, due to the “examination-centered” style of education in Taiwan, the same short essay may be reused in tests of students of higher classes. Such a reuse of short essays made our classification more difficult, because that made the “correct class” of an essay rather ambiguous.","Whether linguistic features were sufficient for the determination of readability of essays is also an issue. Understanding an essay may require domain-dependent knowledge that we have not attempted to encode with our features (Carrell, 1983). Culture-dependent issues may also play a role (Carrell, 1981). Hence, more features are needed to accomplish more improvement on the predication of readability, e.g. (Crossley et al., 2008; Zhang, 2008).","A review comment suggested that there might not be sufficient differences in the short essays used in the first and the second semesters of a school year, so trying to classify the short essays into three levels (each for a school year) may be more practical. Although we did not move our work in this direction, we think the suggestion is interesting.","A reviewer noticed an interesting crossing point in Figure 4. The SMOG score at 11.5 seems to be a major point for the curves in Figure 4 to intersect. A similar phenomenon appeared in Figure 8, where approximately half of the scores of the 100 essays were above 11.5. Whether 11.5 is the watershed of the easy and difficult essays is an interesting hypothesis to verify with a larger amount of essays."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["The work was supported in part by the funding from the National Science Council in Taiwan under the contracts NSC-97-2221-004-007, NSC-98-2815-C-004-003-E, and NSC-99-2221-004-007.
