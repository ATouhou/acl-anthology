Introduction","paragraphs":["Corpus is the basis of Corpus Linguistics. It is also important in Computer Music (Manaris et al., 2007). In the research of corpus-based generation, such as generating articles from text corpora (Stribling et al., 2009; Marom & Zukerman, 2005), speech synthesis based on audio corpora (Iida et al., 2003), and generating music from music corpora (Conklin, 2003; Polashek et al., 2005), one interesting topic is that the selection of corpora may lead to results with different styles. For example, an article generated from a corpus of Abraham Lincoln may reveal his style, which reads differently from one generated from a corpus of William Shakespeare. In this paper, we develop a new model, the Harmony Graph, to make music using corpus-based generation and use this model for music-corpus distinction.","The Harmony Graph is applied to organize a music corpus into a social-network-like structure, analogous to the Word Graph (Oerder & Ney, 1993) in Corpus Linguistics. Four distinct music corpora were prepared that are collections of music in different genres.","In Corpus Linguistics, there has been relevant research on text corpus visualization (Paley, 2002; Fortuna et al., 2005; Rohrer et al., 1998), which generally provides the overall concept of the corpora. Nevertheless, they cannot be used to tell corpora apart at a glance. In the area of Computer Music, distinction of music pieces into different genres using Harmony Graphs is found to be accurate and believed to be new.","In addition to visual inspection, we apply social network analysis to these Harmony Graphs. The calculated measures, namely degree distribution, average path length (APL), and clustering coefficient (CC), indicate that social network analysis is very useful for distinguishing corpora. We also devise a measure, Agglomeration, to capture the density of connections in the graph. This new measure is found to be even more helpful in distinguishing music corpora.","In corpus-based music generation, we begin by performing a random-walk in a Harmony Graph to generate music. For zero-occurrence smoothing, we apply the link prediction technique in social network methodology to add potential edges, and increase the variety of produced music. The generated music somewhat reflects the style of selected corpus according to results of subject tests. Although some relevant research regarding regeneration of music styles has been published (Dubnov et al., 2003; Trivino-Rodriguez & Morales-Bueno, 2001; Pachet, 2003), the Harmony Graph model stands out for being visualizable, analyzable and interpolable by social network methodology.","Sequential music pattern mining has also been applied to model music by finding important sequences sampled from a database and using the model to classify or generate music (Shan et al., 2002). Harmony Graph, however, is an approach quite different from pattern mining. After constructing the Harmony Graph, the music content is reduced from   Harmony Graph, a Social-Network-Like Structure, and Its Applications to 3 Music Corpus Visualization, Distinguishing and Music Generation sequential data into a folded form, and attributes like APL, CC, and Agglomeration can be retrieved from it, based on social network analysis techniques. These attributes cannot be retrieved from pattern mining models directly.","To quantitatively evaluate the Harmony Graph's distinguishing ability, we built up a classifier according to the results of the social network analysis. Given a music input, the classifier predicts which corpus it belongs to by the social network features of its Harmony Graph. The accuracy of our experimental result is 73% out of 59 songs. As for the evaluation of corpus-based music generation, we conducted a subject test. In about 70% of the test queries, subjects agree that the generated music matches its corresponding corpus best in style among five choices. A demonstration program is also provided on the Internet for free download."]},{"title":"2. Experimental Setting and Model 2.1 The Four Corpora","paragraphs":["In this study, we prepared four corpora, namely polyphony, homophony, pantonality, and atonality. Polyphony and homophony are tonal music, and the other two belong to atonal music. These corpora will be used for visualization, social network analysis, and corpus-based music generation. Table 1 shows the details."]},{"title":"Table 1. Four corpora used in this paper","paragraphs":["Genre Composer and Works polyphony Bach Inventions, Sinfonias, preludes, fuga homophony Chopin etude, ballade Mendelssohn Songs Without Words pantonality Prokofiev toccata, prelude, sonata Shostakovitch toccata, prelude, sonata atonality Schoenberg Klavierstücke"]},{"title":"2.2 The Harmony Graph","paragraphs":["Western music evolved from modal music in the Middle Ages to polyphonic music, glorified by Bach at its peak, and gradually became homophonic, which is music with melody accompanied by chords. The development of Harmony has been mature. As time progressed into the 20th century, the breakdown of tonality led to escape from harmony rules. In this research, we do not refer \"harmony\" as \"chords\" in classical Harmony. Rather, in a wider   4 Wei-An Chen et al. sense, we refer harmony as \"the notes played simultaneously.\"","In this sense, we build a graph from music accordingly, which is named Harmony Graph. A node of a Harmony Graph is a harmony represented by a string of note names, e.g. \"D F #A\". The octave information is suppressed, which means that both C1 and C2 are regarded as the same, and are notated as C. The links of a Harmony Graph represent note changes, that is, the progression of harmonies. Notice that, for simplicity of explanation, Harmony Graph here does not contain any temporal information, such as beat and rhythm, but only the progression of harmonies, namely pairs of harmonies that are temporally neighbored.","In addition, we create a \"null\" node, at which the music starts and ends. The music starts from null to the first harmony, and ends from the last harmony to null. Null also represents rests, where no notes occur.","Harmonies are encoded as a 12-bit binary number, corresponding to the twelve tones in an octave. For example, \"000000000001\" represents C, \"001000000010\" represents \"A C#\", and so on. There are 4096 possible combinations of all harmonies. Hence, each harmony can also be represented by an integer from 0 to 4095, including the null node “000000000000”.","The weight of each link represents the number of times that the same progression happens. For example, the more harmony A to harmony B occurs in a piece of music, the higher the weight of the link AB will be.","We use MIDI as raw data format. To simplify the problem, we consider only the onset time, offset time, and the pitch position of each MIDI event.","Figure 1 is an example of how to build a simple Harmony Graph. Three steps are required to construct the Harmony Graph of one music piece: Step 1. Extracting notes.","Scan the sheet music along the time line and record notes happening at the same time as a harmony. As soon as a note combination changes, a new harmony is generated and recorded. Step 2. Suppressing octave information.","Suppress the octave information of the harmonies obtained in Step 1, and merge the notes with the same note name. For example, the first harmony (C3 E3 G3 C4) becomes (C E G), because C3 and C4 are both C, just in different octaves. Step 3. Constructing the graph.","Connect the harmonies in Step 2 according to their sequential order. Then, link the null node to the first harmony, and link the last harmony back to the null node. Furthermore, rest notes in the music piece are treated as the null node. After connecting the harmonies and the null node, a Harmony Graph is accomplished.

Results 3.1 Corpus Visualization","paragraphs":["Graphviz (Ellson et al., 2002) is applied to visualize a Harmony Graph.

Therefore, there are a maximum of two notes at the same time. The upper bound of node number is 79 for two-part polyphonic music, since","C C","1 79.

This means that these harmonies are used only once in the whole masterpiece. These harmonies tend to be special ones used by the composer.","Figure 3 is the Harmony Graph of “Song Without Words”, Op. 19-2 by Mendelssohn, and is a representative for homophonic music. It has a larger scale with more nodes than Fig. 2 has. And the phenomenon of agglomeration is also obvious. In the periphery, however, there are more lower-degree nodes. This may stand for the more freedom of harmony usage, compared with polyphonic music. Furthermore, unlike in Figure 2, we can find a thick link in Fig. 3.

","Figure 4 is the picture of Sonata, Op. 14, Movement 2, by Prokofiev, which is a pantonal piece. Apparently, the number of peripheral nodes is much more than in the previous two figures. This is an indication of atonal music and the increased freedom in usage of harmonies. The agglomeration is less obvious, which means that the treatment of harmonies is less confined than traditional music. We also can see thick links near the center. After inspection of Prokofiev's graphs in general, we find that the thick links are mostly linked to the null node, which may be an indication that Prokofiev treats the piano as a percussive instrument.","Figure 5 shows Schoenberg's “Klavierstücke”, Op. 19-5, which is atonal piece.

In each figure, the upper bar chart shows the degree distribution of weighted degree, unweighted incoming degree, and unweighted outgoing degrees in linear scale. As previously mentioned, the weighting is the count of the occurrences of edges. The lower scattered chart shows the same data in logarithmic scale to examine if it fits the Power Law. From those results, we see that all of them follow the Power Law except Fig. 6, Bach's two-part “Inventions”. At first glance, the reason might be that there are not enough nodes, since the Harmony Graphs of the three-part “Sinfonia”, which all follow the Power Law, have more nodes. Nevertheless, there are also very few nodes in Fig. 10, which still meets the Power Law. The same result applies in all of the other masterpieces of this genre.","Therefore, we speculate that the Harmony Graph follows the Power Law in normal circumstances, but for two-part polyphonic music such as “Invention”, the Power-Law effect is weaker due to strong tonality and node scarcity. This conjecture requires further in-depth investigation."]},{"title":"3.2.2 Average Path Length","paragraphs":["In Section 3.1 we mentioned that there exist \"long bridges\" in the Harmony Graphs of 12-tone serial works. This can be best described in terms of the average path length (APL). Actually, in our experiments, we find that APL is the most significant characteristic to distinguish musical styles.","For two-part polyphonic music, APLs are normally under 3 due to fewer nodes and a high degree of agglomeration. As the music becomes more complex, for three-part polyphony and homophonic music, APL is slightly larger, between about 3 to 4. For non-tonal music, which was composed by numerous and various techniques, the corresponding APL has the most deviation, varying from 2 to 7. For Twelve-tone series works, all of the APLs are larger than 6."]},{"title":"3.2.3 Clustering Coefficient","paragraphs":["In traditional social network analysis, the Clustering Coefficient (CC) is mostly relevant to characterize the aforementioned agglomeration phenomenon. For the most agglomerated Harmony Graph in our experiments, the two-part polyphonic music, the CC is about 0.3 to 0.4. For the other types of music, the CC is relatively smaller, about 0.001 to 0.1. Generally, CC alone is insufficient to distinguish the corpora, but when used in conjunction with other measures, the results are useful.   12 Wei-An Chen et al.","In some cases, the CC does not confirm with agglomeration. For example, the Harmony Graph of “Invention” 6 in Fig. 11 has CC = 0.003, which is relatively small, but we can see that the nodes are strongly bonded with each other.","Since CC is calculated through the number of triangles, which is not necessarily related to bonding, a more reliable measure for explaining this phenomenon is needed."]},{"title":"3.2.4 Agglomeration","paragraphs":["After studying Figure 2 to Figure 11, we found that the agglomeration phenomenon occurs when high-degree nodes link together, in contrast to the conditions for a large CC, which is due to large number of triangles formed by clusters of links in the graph. We thus propose an Agglomeration measure (agg): ","∑ , ∑ G , (2)"]},{"title":"Figure 11. Visualization of Harmony Graph of Inventia 6.   ","paragraphs":["Harmony Graph, a Social-Network-Like Structure, and Its Applications to 13 Music Corpus Visualization, Distinguishing and Music Generation where δ denotes the adjacent status between nodes i and j. If nodes i and j are adjacent to each other, δ 1 , otherwise δ 0. Notation Dx represents the degree of node x. By design, if high-degree nodes connect with each other, the corresponding agg value will be large. Equation (2) can also be rewritten as:      ,G , (3) where m is the total degree of the graph. From (3), we can see that agg is also the probability showing the likelihood that two randomly-chosen nodes are adjacent. We can verify that, if the high-degree nodes are linked with each other, the probability that an adjacent node pair is selected is higher. Note that the range of this measure is from 1 for a complete graph down to 0 for a completely isolated graph.","In our experiments, we find agg is more suitable than CC to describe agglomeration. For instance, “Invention” 6, an especially agglomerative case, has an agg of 0.25, which is noticeably higher than the average agg of all “Inventions”. On the other hand, its CC is 0.003, which is far below the average CC of all “Inventions”.","Generally speaking, agg represents the degree of relation between harmonies. The agg of the Harmony Graphs we studied varies from 0.05 to 0.4. For a genre with strong harmony relations such as tonal music, agg tends to be large, and vice-versa. Nevertheless, we should not take agg as a measure of the degree of tonality, because non-tonal music might also have some strong harmony relations, such as modal music."]},{"title":"3.3 Corpus-Based Music Generation 3.3.1 By Random Walk","paragraphs":["In a Harmony Graph each node represents a harmony; therefore, one directed edge binds two harmonies, and can be treated as a harmony progression. If we walk randomly in the Harmony Graph, the resultant harmony progression can produce music. We call this Graph Music.","For music generation, the build-up of the Harmony Graph is slightly extended. We not only need to save the count of occurrences of the harmony progressions as the weighting of edges, but also the durations. Thus, each edge is additionally tagged with a duration, such as a quarter note or a sixteenth, according to the learned data. Then, during the random walk, the random walker can pick among edges of different durations. So, the duration of the random chord progression is also randomly picked, and the produced music is rhythmic.    14 Wei-An Chen et al.","One feature of Graph Music is that it can reproduce similar music styles. We constructed a demonstration program that is harnessed with different Harmony Graphs built from masterpieces of Bach, Mendelssohn, Chopin, Brahms, Prokofiev, Shostakovich, and Schoenberg. If we switch among different composers, we can hear the style of the generated Graph Music changing accordingly, because the Harmony Graph has the effect of shuffling the corpus evenly, while reserving the most important information about the styles. Thus, the produced music sounds novel yet familiar."]},{"title":"3.3.2 By Link Prediction","paragraphs":["The preliminary version of Graph Music has a drawback. During the random walk, if the degree of the current node is 1, there is only one choice for the next node. It is very likely that the next node also has degree of 1 if the portion of the corresponding original music in the corpus is quite unique, thereby trapping the random walker. The longer the path with such nodes, the more the produced music sounds like just a copy of the original music. It is analogous to the zero-occurrence problem in Corpus Linguistics. Here, we utilize the \"link prediction\" technique in social network for improvement.","Link prediction estimates the probability of connection for two unconnected nodes. When our random walker departs from one node, we make it choose some other unconnected nodes as extra candidates according to their link prediction probability. The estimated probability that two harmonies are linked is derived from their similarity. We believe similar harmonies have better continuity.","For two harmonies, A and B, we define the similarity as the number of their common notes divided by the number of notes in each harmony: similarityA, B || |||| . (4)","Note that the result will range between 0 and 1, inclusively. Then, we define the link prediction probability that an edge connecting from node S to node T exists in (5). probS, T E max maxS,E similarityi, T ,max,TE similarityS, j. (5)","Here, E denotes the set of edges. By (5), we first find the outbound node of S with the highest similarity to T. We also find the inbound node of T with the highest similarity to S. Then, we pick the larger similarity value between the two as the link prediction probability. The logic is “Since S connects to a node similar to T, it is likely that S also connects to T.” or “Since a node similar to S connects to T, it is likely that S also connects to T”. Since we added soft links to harmonies with good continuity, the new music demonstrated more variety without abrupt changes.

We set up a website to allow online testing and collected 245 responses from 21 participants. For each independent test, the participant would listen to a piece of music generated from one out of the five corpora of different composers, namely Bach, Mendelssohn, Brahms, Schoenberg, and Shostakovich.

After answering this question, the participant could decide to take one more independent test or just stop.","Our theory behind the experiment is as following. If the music was unrelated to the style, the participant could answer only by random guessing, hence, the accuracy should be about 20%. On the other hand, if the accuracy is greater than random guess, it indicates that there exists some recognizable relation behind the generated music and its corresponding corpora.
