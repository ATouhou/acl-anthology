The Generative Lexicon Theory (GL Theory) provides us with an explanatory model of compounds that captures the qualia modification relations in the semantic composition within a compound, which can be applied to natural language processing tasks. In this paper, we primarily discuss the qualia structure of noun-noun compounds found in Chinese as well as a couple of other languages like German, Spanish, Japanese and Italian. We briefly review the construction of compounds and focus on the noun-noun construction. While analyzing the semantic relationship between the words that compose a compound, we use the GL Theory to demonstrate that the proposed qualia structure enables compositional interpretation within the compound. Besides, we attempt to examine whether or not for each semantic head, its modifier can fit in one of the four quales. Finally, our analysis reveals the potentials and limits of qualia-based treatment of composition of nominal compounds and suggests a path for future work. "]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["Compounding is regarded as one means of word formation especially productive for analytic languages such as Chinese that want agglutinative inflectional markers [2]. Morpho-syntactically, within each compound word there is an internal structure comparable to those found on the sentential level of a given language. In Chinese, for example, the verb-noun construction of xún-qiú-zhèn-gjù „to look for proof‟ can also be morphologically encoded as a discrete unit qiú-zhèn „seek-proof‟. According to Headedness Principle [3], in addition to the foregoing verb-noun structure, compounds in Chinese can also be composed of noun-noun, noun-verb and verb-verb. Such categorization is essentially based on the parts of speech of the individual words within a compound.","Packard [3] has a different system of classifying Chinese compounds by taking grammatical relations into consideration. Under his classification, the compound qiú-zhèn „seek-proof‟ is decomposed into a verb along with its object, zhǔ-gù „master-care‟ a subject plus its predicate. However, very few, if any, work has taken into account the semantics of the separate constitutive words that, when combined, would derive the meaning of the compound. This present study is set to look at the traditionally labeled noun-noun compounds found across a couple of dominant languages in addition to Chinese under the framework of the Generative Lexicon, and to see whether such mechanism would apply across different languages. "]},{"title":"2. Semantic Classification in Noun-Noun Compounds","paragraphs":["In English and Chinese noun-noun compounds, the most common construction is modifier-head with the head on the right. For example, in bookstore, the modifier is book and the head is store; in shā-táng (sand-sugar) 'sugar', the modifier is shā and the head noun is táng. However, such analysis is derived on the basis of syntax rather than semantics. Since this present work focuses on the meaning relationship between the components of a given compound, we may encounter noun-noun compounds in which the head noun can be both the word on the left and the word on the right.","When choosing examples, we eliminate compound-like words which are composed of the construction of a word and an affix. For instance, some Chinese noun-noun compounds may be composed of a noun and an affix, such as zhuō-jiǎo (table-leg) 'table leg', in which zhuō is an affix rather than a word. This sort of compound is not taken into consideration due to the fact that an affix, which cannot stand alone as an individual word, is not a noun.","Moreover, in other languages, especially modern Romance languages, we may also find different constructions of noun-noun compounds from those found in English and Chinese. For example, in Italian, a noun-noun compound is composed as head-preposition-modifier, such as succo di limone (juice-preposition-lemon) „lemon juice‟; in French, café au lait (coffee-preposition-milk) „white coffee‟ is also composed as head-preposition-modifier; Spanish has cuchillo de cocina (knife-preposition-kitchen) „kitchen knife‟. In the Romance languages mentioned above, the semantic head noun is usually located before the preposition, which means that the preposition in a noun-noun compound can function as an indicator for the head noun, while Chinese does not have this linguistic property.","In the semantic analysis of nominal compounds, Gagne and Shoben [1] first proposed a set of „thematic relations‟, which are claimed to cover the majority of semantic relations between modifier and head in English noun-noun compounds: ","","Table 1: Thematic relations (Gagne et al. 1997)  ","However, upon close scrutinization some deviance and discrepancies can be found. The enumerative approach to the compositionality of compounds would easily lose the power in facing with usage in the novel context. As an alternative approach, in the next section, we will introduce a formally elaborated lexical semantic theory of a generative approach to compound meaning. "]},{"title":"3. Qualia Structure in the Generative Lexicon Theory 3.1 Overview","paragraphs":["The Generative Lexicon Theory (GL Theory) gives a new interpretation of the traditional qualia structure mentioned in the previous section. As pointed out by Pustejovsky [4], the qualia structure of lexical items can be explained as follows: a. CONSTITUTIVE: the relation between an object and its constituents, or proper parts i. Material ii. Weight iii. Parts and component elements  b. FORMAL: that which distinguishes the object within a larger domain i. Orientation ii. Magnitude iii. Shape iv. Dimensionality v. Color vi. Position  c. TELIC: purpose and function of the object i. Purpose that an agent has in performing an act ii. Built-in function or aim which specifies certain activities  d. AGENTIVE: factors involved in the origin or “bringing about” of an object i. Creator ii. Artifact iii. Natural Kind iv. Causal Chain  Let us examine some English examples that can demonstrate the qualia structure in noun-noun compounds, which in English is composed in the modifier-head structure. In glass door, chocolate cake, and oil painting, the modifier is a sort of material of the head. Here, the examples demonstrate the CONSTITUTIVE quale, while in history book, history distinguishes book from other sorts of books, such as math books or chemistry books; in horror movie, horror distinguishes movie form other sorts of movies, such as action movies; in noun phrase, noun distinguishes phrase from other sorts of phrases, such as verb phrases; in college student, college distinguishes student from other sorts of students, such as high school students. Here, the examples demonstrate the FORMAL quale.","In jewelry box, jewelry indicates the function of box, which means that the box is used to contain jewelry; in bookstore, the function of store is to sell books; in operation knife, knife is with the function of surgical operation; in drinking water, water is with the function of being safely drunk by people. Here, the examples demonstrate the TELIC quale. In adenovirus pneumonia, adenovirus is a sort of virus that causes pneumonia; in steamboat, steam is the power for boat; in turtle egg, turtle is the producer of egg. Here, the examples demonstrate the AGENTIVE quale."]},{"title":"3.2 The Base Modes of the Qualia Structure","paragraphs":["In this research, we use a lexical entry of the GL Theory in order to represent the structure of noun-noun compounds as follows: (α as the term itself; TYPESTR as type structure; ARG as argument; ARGSTR as argument structure; EVENTSTR as event structure)"," ","","Figure 1. The Base Mode of the Qualia Structure","","The representation of the CONSTITUTIVE quale is as the following:  ","","Figure 2 The Mode of the CONSTITUTIVE Quale","","For the FORMAL quale, Pustejovsky [4] interprets the FORMAL quale with the GL Theory into two structures: (a). Simple Typing: value of FORMAL role is identical to sortal typing of the argument. (b). Complex Typing: value of FORMAL role defines the relation between the arguments of different types. The base mode of the FORMAL quale is as the following form:  "," Figure 3. Types of the FORMAL Quale The GL Theory interprets the TELIC quale into two base modes as described below:  "," Figure 4. Direct TELIC: something which one acts on directly    Figure 5. Purpose TELIC: something which is used for facilitating a particular activity ","Also, the AGENTIVE quale can be interpreted by the GL Theory with the base mode as the following:   Figure 6. Types of the FORMAL quale  The next section is going to discuss the modification of the qualia structure in the GL Theory with cross-language data for comparison. "]},{"title":"4. Qualia Modification","paragraphs":["In previous sections, we discuss the morphology of Chinese compounds and the GL Theory. In this section, we are going to discuss the mapping of qualia in Chinese compounds. The proposed qualia structure in GL theory can be used to provide the lexical connection which binds semantic contributions of modifying nouns and the head noun in the compound [5].","In the Headedness Principle Packard [3] noted that there are two kinds of headedness, one is structurally (syntactically), the other is semantically. For example, gāng-qín-jiànpán, which means piano keyboard, structurally the head noun must be jiàn-pán, and thus the qualia structure is FORMAL. On the contrary, if we analyze the compound semantically, both gāng-qín and jiàn-pán can be the head noun. While we consider gāng-qín the head noun, the qualia structure is CONSTITUTIVE; however, if we consider jiàn-pán the head noun, the qualia structure is FORMAL. In short, the form of the semantic relation between the head and the modifier is not as specific as viewed from a syntactic perspective. Therefore, we choose the word that serves the semantic content of the compound to be the head noun.

Discussion","paragraphs":["In previous sections, we choose the word that serves the primary semantic content of the compound to be the head noun. Although the syntactic head noun and semantic head noun are the same in our examples, there are words that the syntactic head noun is not the same as semantic head noun. For example, in Chinese làng-huā (wave-flower) „surf‟, if we assume that the syntactic head noun is huā, there is a semantic confusion due to the fact that intuitively, làng-huā is not a kind of huā, but the shape of làng, and therefore làng serves the primary semantic content. Thus we say the head noun is làng rather than huā. Similar examples are huǒ-huā 'sparkle', dàn-huā 'egg flower', xuě-huā 'snowflake' and shuǐ-huā 'water spray'.","Still, there are some words that cannot fit into anyone of the four quales, even though they are individual words. For example, in Chinese shān-jiǎo (mountain-leg) „the base of a mountain‟, we cannot judge which quale in which the modifier shān fits if we take jiǎo as the semantic head noun. "]},{"title":"6. Conclusion and Future Works","paragraphs":["In this paper, we only discuss noun-noun compounds. However, in the study of Chinese morpho-syntax, there are other sorts of construction within compounds, such as noun-verb, verb-noun, verb-verb, etc. For further study on the qualia structure of compounds, other constructions can also be taken into consideration.","Moreover, large-scale statistics can also enhance similar research. With appropriate statistics of the distribution of the four quales within compounds, we can examine whether the four quales are used with apparently different frequencies. Also, this research can be applied to some important NLP and IR/IE tasks such as automatic classification of semantic relations between nominals. With manually annotated training data at hand, we are working on the system that can automatically predict the meaning of a compound by matching the qualia structures of the nominals from a given compound."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["[1] C.
