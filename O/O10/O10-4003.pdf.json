Introduction","paragraphs":["In essays written in Chinese by students, incorrect Chinese characters are quite common. Since incorrect characters are a negative factor in essay scoring, students should avoid such errors in their essays. Our research goal is to build a computer tool that can detect incorrect Chinese characters in student essays and correct them, so that teachers and students can learn faster with help from the computer system.","Compared with the detection of spelling errors in English, the detection of incorrect Chinese characters is much more difficult. In English, a word consists of a series of letters while a meaningful Chinese word usually consists of 2 to 4 Chinese characters. The difficulty lies partly in the fact that there are more than 5,000 high-frequency characters. In previous works on Chinese character error detection systems (Zhang, Huang, Zhou, &  ∗ Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Chaoyang University of Technology E-mail: {9727602, shwu}@cyut.edu.tw The author for correspondence is Shih-Hung Wu. + Institute for Information Industry E-mail: {maciaclark, cujing}@iii.org.tw   128 Yong-Zhi Chen et al. Pan, 2000) (Ren, Shi, & Zhou, 1994), a confusion set for each character is built and is used to detect the character error with the help of a language model. The confusion set is based on a Chinese input method. The characters that have similar input sequences probably belong to the same confusion set. For example, the Wubizixing input method (Wubi), which is a Chinese character input method primarily for inputting both simplified and traditional Chinese text in a computer, is used in (Zhang, Huang, Zhou, & Pan, 2000). The Wubi method is based on the structure of the characters rather than on the pronunciation. It encodes every character in four keystrokes at the most. Therefore, if one keystroke is changed, another character similar to the correct one will show up. Once a student chooses the similar character instead of the accurate one, a character error is established, and a confusion set is automatically generated by the character error. Another approach is to manually edit the confusion set. Common Errors in Chinese Writings gives 1477 common errors (National Languages Committee, 1996). Nevertheless, this amount is not sufficient to build a system. Hung manually compiled 6701 common errors from different sources (Hung & Wu, 2008). These common errors were compiled from essays of junior high school students and were used in Chinese character error detection and correction.","Since the cost of manual compilation is high, Chen et al. proposed an automatic method that can collect these common errors from a corpus (Chen, Wu, Lu, & Ku, 2009). The idea is similar to template generation, which builds a question-answer system (Ravichandran & Hovy, 2001) (Sung, Lee, Yen, & Hsu, 2008). The template generation method investigates a large corpus and mines possible question-answer pairs. Templates for Chinese character error detection can be generated and tested by the chi-square test on the basis of a large corpus. In this paper, we will further improve the methods for building confusion sets and automatically generating a template.","According to recent studies(Liu, Tien, Lai, Chuang, & Wu, 2009a; 2009b), character errors in student essays are of four major types: errors in which characters have similar shapes (30.7%), errors in which characters have similar pronunciation (79.9%), errors in which the two previous types are combined (20.9%), and other errors (2.4%). Therefore, an ideal system should be able to deal with these errors, especially those resulting from similar pronunciation and similar character shapes. The confusion set for similar pronunciation is relatively easy to build, whereas the confusion set for similar shapes is more difficult. In addition to the Wubi input method, the Cangjie input method is also used to compile confusion sets (Liu & Lin, 2008).","The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the system design and related works. In Section 3, we describe a new process of template generation. Section 4 describes the experimental procedure and the data. Finally, in Section 5, we give the conclusion and propose our future research.   Improving the Template Generation for 129 Chinese Character Error Detection with Confusion Sets"]},{"title":"2. System Design 2.1 Chinese Character Error Detection and Correction System","paragraphs":["The system that can detect and correct Chinese character errors works as follows. First, it needs a student to input an essay. The system then reports the errors in the essay and gives suggestions on correction, as shown in Figure 1. Such a system uses templates that can detect whether common errors have occurred. A template consists of a pair of words, a correct one and an error one, such as “辯論會”-“辨論會”. For example, if the error template “辨論會” is matched in an essay, our system can conclude that there is an error and make a suggestion on correction to “辯論會”."]},{"title":"Figure 1. System function of Chinese character error detection in an essay","paragraphs":["In previous works, these templates were compiled manually (Liu, Tien, Lai, Chuang, & Wu, 2009b). The quality of the manually-edited templates is high. Nevertheless, the method is time-consuming and costs too much manpower. Therefore, an automatic template generation method based on the context of errors was proposed in 2009 (Chen, Wu, Lu, & Ku, 2009), several examples of automatically generated tri-gram and four-gram templates are shown in Figure 2. The automatic template generation method is less costly; however, it does not accommodate conventional vocabulary. The template generation method has a serious drawback. In Figure 2, we find that several templates contain unrecognizable words, such as “辯護律,” “視辯論,” and “電視辯,” which are trigrams of Chinese characters that do not have   130 Yong-Zhi Chen et al. any meaning. These templates can be used to detect character errors, but are not suitable for suggesting corrections. In the following subsections, we will propose a new method to avoid this drawback.

The templates for error detection and correction in (Chen, Wu, Lu, & Ku, 2009) 2.2 Confusion Set","paragraphs":["The first step in template generation is to replace one character in a word with a character in the corresponding confusion set. For example, by replacing one character in the correct word “芭蕉,” we get a wrong word “笆蕉”. Such a correct-wrong word pair is used as the template for error detection and correction suggestion.","According to Liu et al. (Liu, Tien, Lai, Chuang, & Wu, 2009a; 2009b), the most common error types are characters with similar shapes and characters with similar pronunciation. The percentage of these two types of errors combined is 89.7% of all errors. Therefore, the confusion set should deal with characters with similar pronunciation and shapes.","We first compile all of the characters that have the same pronunciation from a dictionary and make them the elements of a confusion set. For example, “八(ba1)” and “巴(ba1)” have the same pronunciation. Therefore, they belong to the same confusion set. To reduce the size of the confusion set, we treat characters with different tones as belonging to different sets, even though they sound similar. For example, “罷(ba4)” is not in the confusion set of “八 (ba1)”. We formed 1,351 sets with a total of 15,160 characters, as shown in Figure 3.","In this paper, we use a simple rule to compile characters with similar shapes. In the first book on Chinese characters, known as Shuowen Jiezi (說文解字) (Xu, 2009), in the second   Improving the Template Generation for 131 Chinese Character Error Detection with Confusion Sets century, radicals (部首) were used to categorize characters. We use the key component of a character, its radical, as the basic shape of the character to find the characters with the same radicals. There are 214 radicals in Chinese, according to the Kangxi Dictionary (康熙字典) (Zhang, 1999). Therefore, we compile 214 confusion sets with a total of 9,752 different characters. Figure 4 shows some examples.","After constructing the confusion sets, our system can find characters with the same pronunciation and characters with similar shapes for any character that is input. For example, given a character “兇,” the system can find characters with the same pronunciation “凶兄匈洶 恟胸,” and characters with similar shapes “兄光兆先兌克免,” as shown in Figure 5. This is a crucial step of our new template generation.

The flowchart of the automatic template generation process","paragraphs":["As we mentioned in Section 2.1, the automatically-generated templates might not be suitable for suggesting corrections. To overcome this drawback, we use existing vocabulary, instead of n-gram character sequences, as the candidate for a template. There are 145,608 words in the MOE dictionary (Ministry of Education, 2007). We treat them as the seeds of the templates. In our experiment, we focus on 4,998 high-frequency characters that were compiled on the basis of a 1998 survey (National Languages Committee, 1998).","Our system generates templates by checking each high-frequency character and finding all of the words that contain the character. Then, the system replaces the character in each   Improving the Template Generation for 133 Chinese Character Error Detection with Confusion Sets word with a character in the corresponding confusion set. The correct-wrong word pair undergoes a simple statistical test. If it passes the test, it will be kept as a template; otherwise, it will be discarded. The statistical test is based on the frequency of each word in the pairs appearing in a large corpus. To prevent the process from generating controversial templates, our system also conducts a close test. The close test checks whether the new template will cause a false alarm on our old test data. The template that generates conflicting templates will also be discarded. The close test threshold is set to 0, which means any template that might cause a false alarm will not be used. A template generation example is shown in Figure 7. "]},{"title":"Figure 7. A template generation example, where two templates are generated for an input character “官”.","paragraphs":["The statistical test in our system is not a rigid test. We tune the threshold of relatively high frequency based on two formulae. One is adopted from the chi-square test, and the other one is from our observation. The first test is a simplified (n=1) chi-square test used in a previous work (Hung & Wu, 2008):","2 2 ()OE X","E− = , (1) where E is the frequency of a correct word and O is the frequency of a wrong word. To avoid further disputation, we assume that E>O in our study. The chi-square test provides a threshold mechanism to decide whether a correct-wrong pair is a proper template or not. In this study, we suggest the test should be like Equations (2) and (3). , Cfreq Wfreq Cfreq AverageFreq>> (2) 1 () n i Cvocabulary i Threshold n","= = ∑ , (3)   134 Yong-Zhi Chen et al. where Cfeq is the frequency of the correct word, Wfeq is the frequency of the wrong word, and AverageFreq is the average of the frequencies of all correct words.","If the frequency of the correct word is higher than the threshold and if the square root of the frequency of the correct word is higher than the frequency of the wrong word, then the pair passes the test.","We have found that the templates that do not pass the test are also the ones that will cause false alarms; for example, the pairs “未來”-“為來,” “已經”-“以經,” and “但是”-“但事”. When the context is different, these templates do not always give correct detection results and cause false alarms."]},{"title":"2.4 Word Segmentation","paragraphs":["As in the examples above, short templates with only two characters could cause false alarms. The reason is that, when we treat words as bi-gram character sequences, many word boundaries may be unclear. For example, as shown in Figure 8, the template “擁有”-“雍有” can be used to detect and correct the first sentence, “一個人可雍有很多快樂”, in which one of the word pair appears, but the template “擁有”-“以有” cause a false alarm in the second sentence, “一個人可以有很多快樂”. We find that this failure can be avoided by using correct word segmentation. The character “以” should be a part of the previous word “可以”. If we have enough confidence in the word segmentation, then the characters in a segmented word should not be candidates for character error detection. "]},{"title":"Figure 8.
