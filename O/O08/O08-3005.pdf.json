Introduction","paragraphs":["Many existing cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) systems [Ballesteros and Croft 1997; Hull and Grefenstette 1996] encounter great difficulties in dealing with unknown term translation since these systems rely mostly on general-purpose bilingual dictionaries, which usually lack translations of abbreviations and proper names. Moreover, according to the report in a previous work [Cheng et al. 2004], even for frequent Web queries, about 64% of them are not covered in an English-Chinese lexicon with about 120K entries (provided by Linguistic Data Consortium). However, several automatic translation extraction methods based on parallel [Brown et al. 1993; Melamed 2000; Nie et al. 1999; Smadja et al. 1996] or comparable corpora [Rapp 1999; Fung and Yee 1998] eventually suffer from the problems of insufficient parallel texts and the shortage of translation accuracy of comparable corpora in various subject domains.","The Web has been expanded with an enormous amount of multilingual hypertext resources in diverse subjects. Recently, a number of studies in natural language processing (NLP) have concentrated on the use of Web resources to complement insufficient text corpora [Cao and Li 2002; Kilgarriff and Grefenstette 2003]. To automatically collect huge amounts of parallel corpora from the Web in various domains, some researchers have developed feasible techniques of utilizing similar file names, text length, and link structures to extract parallel text pages from bilingual Web sites [Nie et al. 1999; Resnik 1999; Yang and Li 2003]. On the other hand, Lu et al. [2002] made the first attempt of mining unknown term translations from Web anchor texts. Both Cheng et al. [2004] and Zhang and Vines [2004] have explored language-mixed search-result pages for extracting translations of frequent unknown queries. Although these approaches have successfully enhanced the performance of frequent unknown query translation, they still suffer from the problems of data sparseness and indirect association errors in finding translations of infrequent unknown query terms, particularly for abbreviations and proper names [Melamed 2000].","In this paper, we focus on dealing with two kinds of translation of unknown query terms, including proper names and abbreviations. According to the report in Davis and Ogden [1998], about 50% of unknown terms in queries are proper names. Most methods handling translations of proper names are based on name transliteration techniques [Knight and Graehl 1998; Lin and Chen 2002; Lin et al. 2003; Li et al. 2004]. One major drawback of these methods is that they do not consider semantic information. Lam et al. [2004] proposed a named entity matching model, which considers both semantic and phonetic information, and applied it in mining unknown named entity translations from online daily Web news. Huang et al. [2005] also presented a method to extract key phrase translations from the language-mixed search-result pages with phonetic, semantic and frequency-distance features. As for abbreviation translation, less attention has been put on this research topic in the past few years.   Improving Translation of Queries with 93 Infrequent Unknown Abbreviations and Proper Names","Different from the above works, our major goal is to solve the problems of query translation to help users access English/Chinese information in cross-lingual Web searches. In this paper, therefore, we concentrate our attention on the challenge of dealing with the translations of infrequent unknown abbreviations and transliterated names in Web search queries, i.e., these unknown queries that appear infrequently in Web query logs. We present two new methods to effectively extract translations of these two kinds of infrequent unknown queries. First, we propose a search-result-based abbreviation translation method for handling bidirectional translation of abbreviations in Chinese/English. Second, a new two-stage hybrid translation extraction method, which combines Cheng et al.’s [2004] search-result-based term translation extraction method and a new Web-based transliteration method, is proposed to extract Chinese/English translations for infrequent unknown English/Chinese proper names. In addition, to train an effective transliteration model, we also present a Web-based unsupervised learning algorithm to automatically collect large amounts of diverse English-Chinese transliteration pairs from the Web. For application, we provide a real prototype website1","for users to translate unknown terms in practice. Our experimental results show that the proposed new methods can make great improvements in extracting infrequent unknown term translation.","The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the problems of unknown term translation and our search-result-based term translation extraction approach. Section 3 evaluates the proposed approach. Section 4 provides a simple description and comparison with the related work. Section 5 gives our conclusions."]},{"title":"2. Search-Result-Based Unknown Term Translation 2.1 Problems","paragraphs":["Cheng et al.’s search-result-based term translation extraction method (refer to Section 2.3) is effective in extracting translations for frequent unknown query terms. However, for a lot of infrequent abbreviations and proper names, their translations are still difficult to extract. For example, while submitting an English abbreviation “AMIA” to LiveTrans2",", an incorrect Chinese translation “系列” (series) is obtained. The reason might be that some abbreviations are semantically ambiguous and co-occur relatively infrequently with the correct Chinese translations of their full names (or original forms). However, we observe that for an English abbreviation, its full name may co-occur more frequently with its corresponding Chinese translation. Thus, to effectively extract correct translation for an infrequent abbreviation, our idea is to first identify its full name in search results, and then extract correct translation of its  1 http://ws.csie.ncku.edu.tw/~jhlin/cgi-bin/index.htm 2 http://livetrans.iis.sinica.edu.tw/: This website is developed based on the search-result-based term translation extraction method by Web Knowledge Discovery lab of Academia Sinica, Taiwan.   94 Wen-Hsiang Lu et al. full name, using the search-result-based term translation extraction method mentioned above. Generally, it should be more feasible to extract the correct translation of an abbreviation via its full name. For example, if we can extract the full name of the abbreviation “AMIA”, “American Medical Informatics Association”, then we can get its correct Chinese translation “美國醫學資訊協會” via LiveTrans.","On the other hand, an English proper name might have multiple Chinese transliterated names which often vary with different translators due to phonetic variation and the lack of standard transliteration rules [Gao et al. 2004]. In other words, there may be several Chinese transliterated names corresponding to an English name. For example, the name “Disney” has various Chinese transliterated names, including “迪士尼”, “迪斯尼”, “迪斯奈”, “狄斯奈”, and “狄士尼”; the name “Hussein” also has several different Chinese transliterated names, including “海珊”, “哈珊”, and “侯塞因”. Obviously, it will be helpful for query translation in cross-lingual Web search if we can collect all possible transliterated names from the Web for each unknown proper name. However, it is a real challenge to find all the various transliterated names. Thus, we consider integrating name transliteration techniques into the process of translation extraction for infrequent unknown proper names. Our idea is that we first extract high-frequency terms from the search-result pages as transliteration candidates, and then filter out impossible candidates by using a name transliteration model. In fact, it is still challenging to build an effective transliteration model while lacking sufficient transliteration pairs for training. Therefore, we propose a Web-based unsupervised learning algorithm to automatically collect large amounts of English-Chinese transliteration pairs from Web search results."]},{"title":"2.2 Overview of the Proposed Approach","paragraphs":["Figure 1 demonstrates the process of our search-result-based query translation method. First, an unknown term is determined by a general-purpose dictionary. Then, an unknown term is recognized as an abbreviated term using our search-result-based abbreviation translation extraction methods. If the unknown term does not belong to an abbreviated term, we have to examine whether the unknown term is a transliteration based on our two-stage hybrid translation extraction method. To deal with unknown term translation, we employ the search-result-based term translation extraction method (described in Section 2.3) to handle translation of frequent (popular) unknown query terms, and propose two new infrequent unknown translation methods, namely the search-result-based abbreviation translation extraction method (Section 2.4) and two-stage hybrid translation extraction method (Section 2.5), to solve the problems of translation of abbreviated terms (i.e., abbreviations) and transliterated terms (i.e., proper names). To recognize the abbreviated terms in queries, we   Improving Translation of Queries with 95 Infrequent Unknown Abbreviations and Proper Names collected an abbreviation list containing about 4K entries from the Wikipedia3","website and then generated some pre-defined abbreviation patterns like those used in Park and Byrd (2001).

(1) Chi-square Test Method On the basis of co-occurrence analysis, chi-square test (χ2) is adopted to estimate semantic similarity between the source term E and the target translation candidate C. The similarity measure is defined as:  3 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_acronyms_and_initialisms   96 Wen-Hsiang Lu et al. 2","2","()","(, C) ,","()()()()Nadbc","SE ab ac bd cdχ ××−× = +×+×+ ×+ (1) where a, b, c and d are the numbers of pages retrieved from search engines by submitting Boolean queries: “E and C”, “E and not C”, “not E and C”, and “not E and not C”, respectively; N is the total number of pages, i.e., N = a + b + c + d. (2) Context-Vector Analysis Method Due to the property of Chinese-English mixed texts often appearing in Chinese pages, the source term E and the target translation candidate C may share common contextual terms in the search-result pages. The similarity between E and C is computed based on their context feature vectors Ecv and Ccv in the vector-space model. The conventional tf-idf weighting scheme for each feature term ti in Ecv and Ccv, Ecv = <we1, we2, ..., wem>, and Ccv = <wc1, wc2, ..., wcm>, is used and defined as:","(, )","log( ),","max ( , )i i t","j j ft p N w ft p n=× (2) where f(ti, p) is the frequency of term ti in the search-result page p, N is the total number of Web pages, and n is the number of the pages containing ti.

In the following, we describe two new proposed methods exploiting search results to extract full names for English and Chinese abbreviations, respectively."]},{"title":"2.4.1 Extracting Full Names for English Abbreviations","paragraphs":["To deal with the full names for a given English abbreviation, we designed an efficient process of identifying full names, which consists of three major steps based on the hybrid text mining approach proposed by Park and Byrd [2001]. First, we use the contextual terms around an abbreviated term in the search results to extract possible full name candidates. Second, we use occurrence frequency and Part-of-Speech (POS) information of full name candidates to filter out some impossible candidates. Finally, we propose a simple adaptive co-occurrence model   Improving Translation of Queries with 97 Infrequent Unknown Abbreviations and Proper Names which utilizes several different augmenting and decaying factors in selecting the best full name candidate. More details are described in the following. (1) Identifying Full Name Candidates To solve the problem of identifying full names without sufficient texts [Park and Byrd 2001], we take advantage of Web search results as a corpus. Our idea is to take the given abbreviated term as a search term to fetch the top 200 search result snippets from Google. To extract possible full name candidates by exploring the search result snippets, we utilize contextual information of the abbreviated term in the snippets. These full name candidates must appear in the same snippets with the abbreviated term, and should have a minimum word length between |A|×2 and |A|+5, where |A| is the length of characters of the abbreviated term. In addition, to select more reliable full name candidates, we put a constraint on the identification process in which the first character of the first word of each full name candidate should match the first character of the abbreviated term. (2) Filtering Impossible Full Name Candidates To reduce computation time while extracting many full name candidates, we first select the top 20 frequent full name candidates and then filter out some impossible candidates whose first word or last word are prepositions, be-verbs, modal verbs, conjunctions, or pronouns [Park and Byrd 2001]. (3) Selecting Best Full Name Candidate To select the best full name candidates, we propose an adaptive co-occurrence model by employing mutual information as well as four augmenting or decaying factors to compute the similarity between an abbreviated term A and its full name candidates FC. (A) Mutual Information: In this step, mutual information is used to compute the similarity between an abbreviated term A and its full name candidate FC. Mutual information is defined as follows: (, )","(, ) (, )log( ) () ( )C CC C PAF MI A F P A F","PA PF=× × . (4) Here P(A, FC) is the probability of co-occurrence of A and FC. P(A) and P(FC) are the probabilities of occurrence of A and FC in the Web, respectively. We can get the occurrence frequencies from search engines by submitting queries: “A”, “FC”, and “A and FC”, respectively. (B) Syntactic Cues: To augment the identification of full names, we utilize the information of orthographic and syntactic structure. NSC indicates the number of abbreviation-full-name pairs appearing in the same snippets. Several frequent patterns of abbreviation-full-name pair are used as the syntactic cues [Park and Byrd 2001], including:   98 Wen-Hsiang Lu et al. y abbreviation (full name) y full name (abbreviation) y abbreviation, or full name y full name, or abbreviation y full name, abbreviation for short y abbreviation ... stands/short/acronym ...full name (C) Similarity of Character: To further determine correct full names, we add another augmenting factor to estimate the similarity between an abbreviated term and its full name candidates by adopting a fast and simple character matching method. We use two kinds of character matching: (1) first-letter matching is used to compute the total number NF of matching the first letter of each word in the full name candidate FC with each character in the abbreviated terms, and (2) non-first-letter matching is used to computer the total number NNF of matching the non-first letters of each word in the FC with each character in A.

Therefore, we designed a method slightly different from the method of extracting English full names described above. Our Chinese full name extraction method consists of three major steps. First, the possible full name candidates are extracted by using the PAT-tree-based keyword extraction method proposed by Chien [1997]. Second, we use the character similarity between an abbreviated term and its full name candidates to filter out some impossible candidates. Finally, to select the correct Chinese full name, we use the adaptive co-occurrence model (Equation (8)) but slightly modify the decaying factors. The following description will explain the different points in more details. (1) Identifying Full Name Candidates To identify the possible full name candidates for a given Chinese abbreviated term A, we adopt a PAT-tree-based keyword extraction method [Chien 1997] to extract Chinese phrases in the search results related to the abbreviated term A as full name candidates. In addition, to select more reliable full name candidates, we put a length constraint on the candidates. These candidates should have more than (|A| +2) characters, where |A| is the number of characters of A. (2) Filtering Impossible Full Name Candidates According to our observations, the Chinese full name candidates extracted by the PAT-tree-based keyword extraction method generally have higher reliability. Thus, we just use Equations (5) and (6) with a threshold of character similarity to filter out some impossible candidates. (3) Selecting Best Full Name Candidate Like the above method of selecting the best English full name candidates, we still use the proposed adaptive co-occurrence model (Equation (8)) to select the best Chinese full name candidates. Please note, though, that the processing of augmenting/decaying factors is a little different. For example, we remove the decaying factor of stopword number since most stopwords seldom appear in Chinese full names. Some different points will be described below.   100 Wen-Hsiang Lu et al. (A) Syntactic Cues: We also manually choose several syntactic patterns of Chinese abbreviation- full name pairs as the augmenting factor: y abbreviation (full name) y full name (abbreviation) y abbreviation, 或 full name y full name, 或 abbreviation y abbreviation ... 代表/簡稱/縮寫 ...full name Here the Chinese cues ”或”, “代表”, “簡稱”, “縮寫” correspond to the English words “or”, “present”, “short”, and “acronym”, respectively. (B) Similarity of Character: First, we use the Chinese POS tagger to segment full name candidates. Then, we take character similarity (Equation (5) and (6)) as an augmenting factor. (C) Difference of Length: Due to the fact that there is no space delimitation between Chinese words, we adopt a Chinese POS tagger4","to do word segmentation for full name candidates. Then, we use the number NLD to represent the difference between character length |A| of the abbreviated term A and word length |FC| of the corresponding full name candidate FC; this is considered a decaying factor (Equation (7)). (D) Adaptive Co-occurrence Model: We adopt the same adaptive co-occurrence model (Equation (8)) with two augmenting factors and one decaying factor to compute the similarity between A and FC. The augmenting factors are the same as Equation (9), but the decaying factor in Equation (10) is modified adaptively by removing the stopword number as:"]},{"title":"()","paragraphs":["3Decay LDFNβ=+ .

We simplify their syllabification techniques to generate a few simple heuristic rules of segmenting an English name into a sequence of syllables. Each English syllable is regarded as an English transliteration unit (ETU) in this work and has at most one corresponding character of the Chinese transliterated name. Initially, we used only five rules for English syllable segmentation listed below:","• a, e, i, o, u are vowels, and y is also regarded as a vowel if it appears behind a consonant. All other letters are consonants. • Separate two consecutive vowels except the following cases: ai, au, ee, ea, ie, oa, oo, ou, etc.","• Separate two consecutive consonants except the following cases: bh, ch, gh, ph, th, wh, ck, cz, zh, zk, ng, sc,ll, tt, etc. • l, m, n, r are combined with the prior vowel only if they are not followed by a vowel. • A consonant and a following vowel are regarded as an ETU. For example, “Nokia” (諾基亞) is segmented into three ETUs “no”, “ki”, and “a”, and “Epson” 愛普生( ) is segmented into three ETUs “e”, “p”, and “son”. Currently, although some English names may be segmented incorrectly, it is easy to manually update new rules to improve English syllable segmentation. (B) Web-based Transliteration Model: To avoid double errors of converting English phonetic representation to Chinese Pinyin and from Pinyin to Chinese characters, in this work, we adopted direct orthographic mapping for name transliteration. We use the probability P(ei, ci) to estimate the possibility of the mapping between an ETU ei and a Chinese character ci.

Different from existing methods, our full name extraction method is very promising even for infrequent abbreviated terms by utilizing search results from Web search engines. However, some errors still result from the problem of data sparseness.

For example, for the infrequent English abbreviated queries from the Dreamer query log, the search-result-based abbreviation translation extraction method achieve the top-1 inclusion rate of 48% (see Table 3) but the search-result-based translation extraction method achieve the top-1 inclusion rate of 0%. Given the example query “ISS”, the search-result-based term translation extraction method cannot obtain the correct Chinese translation “國際太空站” among the top five extracted candidates. However, our search-result-based abbreviation translation extraction method can extract the correct full name “International Space Station”, and then extract correct Chinese translation “國際太空 站” via the full name “International Space Station”. As mentioned in Section 2.1, the reason might be that the abbreviated terms are semantically more ambiguous and co-occur relatively infrequently with the correct translations of their full names. (3) Linear Combination Results To further improve the performance of our search-result-based abbreviation translation extraction method, we intuitively intend to combine our method and Cheng et al.’s method.

Therefore, we consider adding the information of term occurrence frequency in the query log into the process of unknown term translation. For a query with frequent Chinese proper names in the query log, we can use the previous search-result-based term translation extraction method to translate it. On the other hand, for queries with infrequent Chinese transliterated terms, we can use the proposed two-stage hybrid translation extraction method to translate them.","However, utilizing Web search results to translate unknown terms would lead to only partial representative candidates, which are the most popular ones.

Related Work","paragraphs":["In previous works on identifying full names of abbreviations, AFP (Acronym Finding Program) [Taghva and Gilbreth 1995] used free texts to find English abbreviations and their full names. Park and Byrd [2001] used contextual information around abbreviations to extract potential full name candidates based on their pre-defined rules. However, these methods might suffer from the problem of insufficient texts. Our proposed method exploiting search results can extract English full names for abbreviations in various domains, and then effectively   114 Wen-Hsiang Lu et al. extract correct Chinese translations via their full names.","Also, Leah et al. [2000] tried to find full name candidates from a small number of Web pages, and they used lots of syntax rules to select full name candidates of English acronyms. Instead of using many syntax rules, we propose an adaptive co-occurrence model to select the best full name candidates based on the co-occurrence relation and the integration of several augmenting and decaying factors.","For name transliteration between Latin-alphabet languages and some Asian languages with different writing forms, such as English and Chinese, researchers have proposed phoneme-based mapping techniques [Knight and Graehl 1998; Lin and Chen 2002; Meng et al. 2001]. Lin et al. [2003] proposed a statistical transliteration model and apply the model to extract English proper names and their Chinese transliterated names in a parallel corpus with high average precision and recall rates. However, Li et al. [2004] pointed out that the transliteration precision of the phoneme-based approaches could be limited by two main constraints. First, Latin-alphabet foreign names from different origins have different phonic rules, such as French and English. Second, transforming English words to Chinese characters will need two steps: transforming from phonemic representation to Chinese Pinyin and from Pinyin to Chinese characters. Two cascaded transforming steps may cause double errors. To avoid this problem, we propose a Web-based mixed-syllable-mapping transliteration model for dealing with online English-Chinese name transliteration based on the concept of direct orthographic mapping.","Both Cheng et al. [2004] and Zhang and Vines [2004] have exploited language-mixed search-result pages for extracting translations of frequent unknown queries. Moreover, Huang et al. [2005] takes advantage of cross-language query expansion to retrieve more relevant search-result pages and then extract translations by combining with phonetic, semantic and frequency-distance features. However, these methods haven’t solved the problems of translation extraction for infrequent unknown abbreviations and proper names. Currently, our search-result-based methods presented in this paper can effectively mitigate such kinds of translation problems."]},{"title":"5. Conclusions","paragraphs":["In this paper we presented two new search-result-based methods to extract unknown term translation based on the previous method proposed by Cheng et al., including the search-result-based abbreviation translation extraction method and the two-stage hybrid translation extraction method.

In the future, we are investigating to integrate the cross-language query expansion techniques proposed by Huang et al. into our search-result-based abbreviation translation extraction method.","As for the two-stage hybrid translation extraction method, we will continuously collect larger amounts of English-Chinese transliterated name pairs via our proposed Web-based unsupervised learning algorithm to build a more reliable transliteration model. In the future, referring to the methods proposed by both Lam et al. [2004] and Huang et al.
