Introduction","paragraphs":["Building knowledge base is a time consuming work. The CKIP Chinese Lexical Knowledge Base has about 80 thousand lexical entries and their senses are defined in terms of the E-HowNet format. E-HowNet is a lexical knowledge and common sense knowledge representation system. It was extended from HowNet [1] to encode concepts. Based on the framework of E-HowNet, we intend to establish an automatic semantic composition mechanism to derive sense of compounds and phrases from lexical senses [2][3]. Determinative-Measure compounds (abbreviated as DM) are most common compounds in Chinese. Because a determinative and a measure normally coin a compound with unlimited versatility, the CKIP group does not define the E-HowNet representations for all DM compounds. Although the demonstrative, numerals, and measures may be listed exhaustively, their combination is inexhaustible. However their constructions are regular [4]. Therefore, an automatic identification schema in regular expression [4] and a semantic composition method under the framework of E-HowNet for DM compounds were developed.  In this paper, we take DMs as an example to demonstrate how the E-HowNet semantic composition mechanism works in deriving the sense representations for all DM compounds. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The section 2 presents the background knowledge of DM compounds and sense representation in E-HowNet. We’ll describe our method in the section 3 and discuss the experiment result in the section 4 before we make conclusion in the section 5. "]},{"title":"2. Background","paragraphs":["There are numerous studies on determinatives as well as measures, especially on the types of measures. 1 Tai [5] asserts that in the literature on general grammar as well as Chinese grammar, classifiers and measures words are often treated together under one single framework of analysis. Chao [6] treats classifiers as one kind of measures. In his definition, a measure is a bound morpheme which forms a DM compound with the determinatives enumerated below. He also divides determinatives word into four subclasses: i. Demonstrative determinatives, e.g. 這” this”, that”那”... ii. Specifying determinatives, e.g. 每”every”, 各” each”... iii. Numeral determinatives, e.g. 二”two”, 百分之三”three percentage”, 四百五十” four hundred and fifty”... iv. Quantitative determinatives, e.g. 一” one”, 滿” full”, 許多” many”... Measures are divided into nine classes by Chao [6]. Classifiers are defined as ‘individual measures’, which is one of the nine kinds of measures. i. classifiers, e.g. 本”a (book)”,  1 Chao [6] and Li and Thompson [7] detect measures and classifiers. He [8] traces the diachronic names of measures and mentions related literature on measures. The dictionary of measures pressed by Mandarin Daily News Association and CKIP [9] lists all the possible measures in Mandarin Chinese. ii. classifier associated with V-O constructions, e.g. 手 “hand”, iii. group measures, e.g. 對”pair”, iv. partitive measures, e.g. 些”some”, v. container measures, e.g. 盒“box”, vi. temporary measures, e.g. 身”body”, vii. Standard measures, e.g. 公尺”meter”, viii. quasi-measure, e.g. 國”country”, ix. Measures with verb, e.g. 次”number of times”. As we mentioned in the section of introduction, Chao considers that determinatives are listable and measures are largely listable, so D and M can be defined by enumeration, and that DM compounds have unlimited versatility. However, Li and Thompson [7] blend classifiers with measures. They conclude not only does a measure word generally not take a classifier, but any measure word can be a classifier. In Tai’s opinion [5], in order to better understand the nature of categorization in a classifier system, it is not only desirable but also necessary to differentiate classifiers from measure words. These studies on the distinction between classifiers and measures are not very clear-cut. In this paper, we adopt the CKIP DM rule patterns and Part-of-Speeches for morpho-syntactic analysis, and therefore inherit the definition of determinative-measure compounds (DMs) in [10]. Mo et al. define a DM as the composition of one or more determinatives together with an optional measure. It is used to determine the reference or the quantity of the noun phrase that co-occurs with it. We use the definition of Mo et al. to apply to NLP and somewhat different from traditional linguistics definitions. 2.1 Regular Expression Approach for Identifying DMs Due to the infinite of the number of possible DMs, Mo et al. [10] and Li et al. [4] propose to identify DMs by regular expression before parsing as part of their morphological module in NLP. For example, when the DM compound is the composition of one determinative, e.g. for numerals in (1), roughly rules (2a), (2b) or (2c) will be first applied, and then rules (2d), (2e) or (2f) will be applied to compose complex numeral structures, and finally rules (2g) will generate the pos Neu of numeral structures. From the processes of regular expression, the numerals 534 and 319 in (1) is identified and tagged as Neu. 2  (1) 鼓勵534人完成319鄉之旅 guli wubaisanshisi ren wancheng sanbaiyishijiu xiang zhi lu encourage 534 persons to accomplish the travel around 319 villages  2 The symbol “Neu” stands for Numeral Determinatives. Generation rules for numerals are partially listed in (2). (2) a. NO1 = {○,一,二,兩,三,四,五,六,七,八,九,十,廿,卅,百,千,萬,億,兆,零, 幾}; b. NO2 = {壹,貳,參,肆,伍,陸,柒,捌,玖,拾,佰,仟,萬,億,兆,零,幾}; c. NO3 = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,百,千,萬,億,兆}; d. IN1 -> { NO1*, NO3*} ; e. IN2 -> NO2* ; f. IN3 -> {IN1,IN2} {多,餘,來,幾} ({萬,億,兆}) ; g. Neu -> {IN1,IN2,IN3 } ;  Regular expression approach is also applied to deal with ordinal numbers, decimals, fractional numbers and DM compounds for times, locations etc.. The detailed regular expressions can be found in [4]. Rule patterns in regular expression only provide a way to represent and to identify morphological structures of DM compounds, but do not derive the senses of complex DM compounds.  2.2 Lexical Sense Representation in E-HowNet Core senses of natural language are compositions of relations and entities. Lexical senses are processing units for sense composition. Conventional linguistic theories classify words into content words and function words. Content words denote entities and function words without too much content sense mainly serve grammatical function which links relations between entities/events. In E-HowNet, the senses of function words are represented by semantic roles/relations [11]. For example, ‘because’ is a function word. Its E-HowNet definition is shown in (1). (1) because|因為 def: reason={}; which means reason(x)={y} where x is the dependent head and y is the dependent daughter of ‘因為’. In following sentence (2), we’ll show how the lexical concepts are combined into the sense representation of the sentence. (2) Because of raining, clothes are all wet. 因為下雨,衣服都濕了 In the above sentence, ‘濕 wet’, ‘衣服 clothes’ and ‘下雨 rain’ are content words while ‘都 all’, ‘了 Le’ and ‘因為 because’ are function words. The difference of their representation is that function words start with a relation but content words have under-specified relations. If a content word plays a dependent daughter of a head concept, the relation between the head concept and this content word will be established after parsing process. Suppose that the following dependent structure and semantic relations are derived after parsing the sentence (2). (3) S(reason:VP(Head:Cb:因為|dummy:VA:下雨)|theme:NP(Head:Na:衣服) | quantity: Da:都 | Head:Vh:濕|particle:Ta:了)。 After feature-unification process, the following semantic composition result (4) is derived. The sense representations of dependent daughters became the feature attributes of the sentential head ‘wet|濕’. (4) def:{wet|濕: theme={clothing|衣物}, aspect={Vachieve|達成}, manner={complete|整}, reason={rain|下雨}} In (3), function word ‘因為 because’ links the relation of ‘reason’ between head concept ‘濕 wet’ and ‘下雨 rain’. The result of composition is expressed as reason(wet|濕)={rain|下雨}, since for simplicity the dependent head of a relation is normally omitted. Therefore reason(wet|濕)={rain|下雨} is expressed as reason={rain|下雨}; theme(wet|濕)={clothing|衣 物} is expressed as theme={clothing|衣物} and so on.  2.3 The sense representation for determinatives and measures in E-HowNet The sense of a DM compound is determined by its morphemes and the set of component morphemes are determinatives and measures which are exhaustively listable. Therefore in order to apply semantic composition mechanism to derive the senses of DM compounds, we need to establish the sense representations for all morphemes of determinatives and measures first. Determinatives and measure words are both modifiers of nouns/verbs and their semantic relation with head nouns/verbs are well established. We thus defined them by a semantic relation and its value like (5) and (6) bellowed.  (5) The definition of determinatives in E-HowNet this 這 def: quantifier={definite|定指} first 首 def: ordinal={1} one 一 def: quantity={1}  We find some measure words contain content sense which need to be expressed, but for some measure words, such as classifiers, their content senses are not important and could be neglect. So we divided measure words into two types: with or without content sense, their sense representations are exemplified below:  (6) The definition of measure words in E-HowNet a) Measure words with content sense bowl 碗 def: container={bowl|碗} meter 米 def: length={meter|公尺} month 月 def: time={month|月}  b) Measure words without content sense 本 copy def:{null} 間 room def:{null} 樣 kind def:{null}"]},{"title":"3. Semantic Composition for DM Compounds","paragraphs":["To derive sense representations for all DM compounds, we study how to combine the E-HowNet representations of determinative and measure words into a DM compound representation, and make rules for automatic composition accordingly. Basically, a DM compound is a composition of some optional determinatives and an optional measure. It is used as a modifier to describe the quantity, frequency, container, length...etc. of an entity. The major semantic roles played by determinatives and measures are listed in the Table 1. The basic feature unification processes [12]: If a morpheme B is a dependency daughter of morpheme A, i.e. B is a modifier or an argument of A, then unify the semantic representation of A and B by the following steps. Step 1: Identify semantic relation between A and B to derive relation(A)={B}. Note: the possible semantic relations are shown in Table 1. Step 2: Unify the semantic representation of A and B by insert relation(A)={B} as a sub-feature of A. It seems that a feature unification process can derive the sense representation of a DM compound, as exemplified in (7) and (8), once its morpheme sense representations and semantic head are known.

First of all we have to clarify the dependent relation between the determinative and the measure of a DM in order to make a right feature unification process. In principle, a dependent head will take semantic representation of its dependent daughters as its features. Usually determinatives are modifiers of measures, such as 這碗, 一碗, 這一碗. For instance, the example (9) has the dependent relations of NP(quantifier:DM(quantifier:Neu:一|container:Nfa:碗)|Head:Nab:麵)  Figure 1. The dependent relations of 一碗麵”a bowl of noddle”. After feature unification process, the semantic representation of “一 def: quantity={1}” becomes the feature of its dependent head “碗 def: container={bowl|碗} and derives the feature representation of “one bowl 一碗 def: container={bowl| 碗 :quantity={1}}”. Similarly, “one bowl 一碗” is the dependent daughter of “noodle|麵 def:{noodle|麵}”. After unification process, we derive the result of (9). (9)one bowl of noodle|一碗麵 def:{noodle|麵:container={bowl|碗:quantity={1}}}  The above feature unification process written in term of rule is expressed as (10).  (10) Determinative + Measure (D+M) ̆def: semantic-role(M) = {Sense-representation(M): Representation(D)} The rule (10) says that the sense representation of a DM compound with a determinative D and a measure M is a unification of the feature representation of D as a feature of the sense representation of M as exemplified in (9). However a DM compound with a null sense measure word, such as ‘this copy|這本’ , ‘ a copy|一本’, or without measure word, such as ‘this three|這三’, will be exceptions, since the measure word cannot be the semantic head of DM compound. The dependent head of determinatives become the head noun of the NP containing the DM and the sense representation of a DM is a coordinate conjunction of the feature representations of its morphemes of determinatives only.  For instance, in (8), ‘copy’ has weak content sense; we thus regard it as a null-sense measure word and only retain the feature representation of the determinative as the definition of “this copy|這本”. The unification rule for DM with null-sense measure is expressed as (11).  (11) Determinative + {Null-sense Measure} (D+M) ̆def: Representation(D);  If a DM has more than one determinative, we can consider the consecutive determinatives as one D and the feature representation of D is a coordinate conjunction of the features of all its determinatives. For instance, “this one|這一” and “this one|這一本” both are expressed as “quantifier={definite|定指}; quantity={1}”. Omissions of numeral determinative are occurred very often while the numeral quantity is “1”. For instance, “這本” in fact means “this one|這一本”. Therefore the definition of (8) should be modified as: 這本 def: quantifier={definite|定指}; quantity={1}; The following derivation rules cover the cases of omissions of numeral determinative.  (12) If both numeral and quantitative determinatives do not occur in a DM, then the feature quantity={1} is the default value of the DM.  Another major complication is that senses of morphemes are ambiguous. The feature unification process may produce many sense representations for a DM compound. Therefore sense disambiguation is needed and the detail discussions will be in the section 3.1.  Members of every type of determinatives and measures are exhaustively listable except numeral determinatives. Also the formats of numerals are various. For example, “5020” is equal to “五零二零” and “五千零二十” and “五千二十”. So we have to unify the numeral representation into a standard form. All numerals are composition of basic numeral as shown in the regular expressions (2). However their senses are not possible to define one by one. We take a simple approach. For all numeral, their E-HowNet sense representations are expressed as themselves. For example, 5020 is expresses as quantity={5020} and will not further define what is the sense of 5020. Furthermore all non-Arabic forms will be convert into Arabic expression, e.g. “五千零二十” is defined as quantity={5020}.  The other problem is that the morphological structures of some DMs are not regular patterns. Take “兩個半 two and half” as an example. “半 half” is not a measure word. So we collect those word like “多 many, 半 half, 幾 many, 上 up, 大 big, 來 more” for modify the quantity definition. So we first remove the word “半” and define the “兩個” as quantity={2}. Because the word “半” means quantity={0.5}, we define the E-HowNet definition for “兩個 半” as quantity={2.5}. For other modifiers such as “多 many, 幾 many, 餘 more, 來 more”, we use a function over() to represent the sense of “more”, such as “十多個 more than 10” is represented as quantity={over(10)}  The appendix A shows the determinatives and measures used and their E-HowNet definition in our method. Now we have the basic principles for compositing semantics of DM under the framework of E-HowNet. Below steps is how we process DMs and derive their E-HowNet definitions from an input sentence. I. Input: a Chinese sentence. II. Apply regular expression rules for DM to identify all possible DM candidates in the input sentence. III. Segment DM into a sequence of determinatives and measure words. IV. Normalize numerals into Arabic form if necessary V. Apply feature unification rules (10-12) to derive candidates of E-HowNet representations for every DM. VI. Disambiguate candidates for each DM if necessary. VII. Output: DM Compounds in E-HowNet representation. For an input Chinese sentence, we use the regular expression rules created by Li et al. [2006] to identify all possible DMs in the input sentence. Then, for every DM compound, we segment it into a sequence of determinatives and measures. If any numeral exists in the DM, every numeral is converted into decimal number in Arabic form. For every DM, we follow the feature unification principles to composite semantics of DM in E-HowNet representations and produce possible ambiguous candidates. The final step of sense disambiguation is described in the following section.  3.1 Sense Disambiguation Multiple senses will be derived for a DM compound due to ambiguous senses of its morpheme components. For instance, the measure word ”頭 head” has either the sense of {頭|head}, such as “滿頭白髮 full head of white hairs” or the null sense in ”一頭牛 a cow”. Some DMs are inherent sense ambiguous and some are pseudo ambiguous. For instances, the above example “一頭” is inherent ambiguous, since it could mean “full head” as in the example of “一頭白髮 full head of white hairs” or could mean “one + classifier” as in the example of ”一頭牛 a cow”. For inherent ambiguous DMs, the sense derivation step will produce ambiguous sense representations and leave the final sense disambiguation until seeing collocation context, in particular seeing dependent heads. Some ambiguous representations are improbable sense combination. The improbable sense combinations should be eliminated during or after feature unification of D and M. For instance, although the determiner “一” has ambiguous senses of “one”, “first”, and “whole”, but “一公尺” has only one sense of “one meter”, so the other sense combinations should be eliminated. The way we tackle the problem is that first we find all the ambiguous Ds and Ms by looking their definitions shown in the appendix A. We then manually design content and context dependent rules to eliminate the improbable combinations for each ambiguous D or M types. For instance, according to the appendix A, “頭” has 3 different E-HowNet representations while functions as determinant or measure, i.e. “def:{null}”, “def:{head| 頭 }”, and “def:ordinal={1}”. We write 3 content or context dependent rules below to disambiguate its senses. (13) 頭”head”, Nfa, E-howNet: “def:{null}” : while E-HowNet of head word is “動 物({animate|生物}” and it’s subclass. (14) 頭“head“, Nff, E-howNet: “def:{頭}” : while pre-determinant is 一(Neqa)”one” or 滿”full” or 全”all” or 整”total”. (15) 頭”first”, Nes, E-howNet: “def:ordinal={1}” : while this word is being a demonstrative determinatives which is a leading morpheme of the compound. The disambiguation rules are shown in appendix B. In each rule, the first part is the word and its part-of-speech. Then the E-HowNet definition of this sense is shown, and followed by the condition constraints for this sense. If there is still ambiguities remained after using the disambiguation rule, we choice the most frequent sense as the result. "]},{"title":"4. Experiment and Discussion","paragraphs":["We want to know how good is our candidate production, and how good is our disambiguation rule. We randomly select 40628 sentences (7536 DM words) from Sinica Treebank as our development set and 16070 sentences (3753 DM words) as our testing set. We use development set for designing disambiguation rules and semantic composition rules. Finally, we derive 36 contextual dependent rules as our disambiguation rules. We randomly select 1000 DM words from testing set. We evaluate the composition quality of DMs with E-HowNet representation before disambiguation. For 1000 DM words, the semantic composition rules produce 1226 candidates of E-HowNet representation from 939 words. The program fails to produce E-HowNet representations for the rest of 61 words because of undefined morphemes. There are 162 words out of the 939 words having ambiguous senses. The result shows that the quality of candidates is pretty good. Table 2 gives some examples of the result. For testing the correctness of our candidates, we manually check the format of 1226 candidates. Only 5 candidates out of 1226 are wrong or meaningless representations. After disambiguation processes, the resulting 1000 DM words in E-HowNet representation are judged manually. There are 880 correct E-HowNet representations for 1000 DM words in both sense and format. It is an acceptable result. Among 120 wrong answers, 57 errors are due to undefined morpheme, 28 errors are unique sense but wrong answer and the number of sense disambiguation errors is 36. Therefore accuracy of sense disambiguation is (162-36)/162=0.778. Table 2. The result of semantic composition for DM compounds.

A. Unknown domain error: 七棒”7th batter”, 七局”7 th inning” Because there is no text related to baseball domain in development set, we get poor performance in dealing with the text about baseball. The way to resolve this problem is to increase the coverage of disambiguation rules for the baseball domain. B. Undefined senses and morphemes: 每三個“each three” We do not define the sense of 每 ”each” and we only define 每 ”all”, so we have to add the sense of “each” in E-HowNet representation about 每. 有三位 ”there are three persons”, 同一個 ”the same” Because 有 “have” and 同 ”the same” do not appear in our determinative list, it is not possible to composite their E-HowNet definitions. C. Sense ambiguities: In parsed sentence: NP(property:DM:上半場”first half ”|Head:DM:二十分”twenty minutes or twenty points”) . The E-HowNet representation of 二十分”twenty minutes or twenty points” can be defined as “def:role={分數:quantity={20}}” or “def:time={分 鐘:quantity={20}}”. More context information is needed to resolve this kind of sense ambiguity. For unknown domain error and undefined rule, the solution is to expand the disambiguation rule set and sense definitions for morphemes. For sense ambiguities, we need more information to disambiguate the true sense."]},{"title":"5. Conclusion","paragraphs":["E-HowNet is a lexical sense representational framework and intends to achieve sense representation for all compounds, phrases, and sentences through automatic semantic composition processing. In this paper, we take DMs as an example to demonstrate how the semantic composition mechanism works in E-HowNet to derive the sense representations for all DM compounds. We analyze morphological structures of DMs and derive their morphological rules in terms of regular expression. Then we define the sense of all determinatives and measure words in E-HowNet definition exhaustively. We make some simple composition rules to produce candidate sense representations for DMs. Then we review development set to write some disambiguation rules. We use these heuristic rules to find the final E-HowNet representation and reach 88% accuracy. The major target of E-HowNet is to achieve semantic composition. For this purpose, we defined word senses of CKIP lexicon in E-HowNet representation. Then we try to automate semantic composition for phrases and sentences. However there are many unknown or compound words without sense definitions in the target sentences. DM compounds are occurring most frequently and without sense definitions. Therefore our first step is to derive the senses of DM words. In the future, we will use similar methods to handle general compounds and to improve sense disambiguation and semantic relation identification processing. We intend to achieve semantic compositions for phrases and sentences in the future and we had shown the potential in this paper."]},{"title":"Acknowledgement:","paragraphs":["This research was supported in part by the National Science Council under a Center Excellence Grant NSC 96-2752-E-001-001-PAE and Grant NSC9 6 -2 22 1 -E -0 0 1-009."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["[1] Zhendong Don & Qiang Dong, 2006, HowNet and the Computation of Meaning.

The previous word usually are 這 ”this” or 那 ”that” or 另”another”. e.g.All Nfi, def:frequency={}, while part-of-speech of head word is Verb, i.e. E-HowNet representation of head word is {event|事件} and it’s subclass. Except POS V_2 and VG. All Nfi,def:{null}, while part-of-speech of head word is Noun, i.e. E-HowNet of head word is {object|物體} and it’s subclass. e.g.部, 股...,Nfh,def:location={ }, if part-of-speech of head word is Na or previous word is 這”this” or 那”that” or 每”every”, do not use this definition. 部,股...,Nfa,def:{null}, otherwise use this definition. e.g. 盤 ,Nfe,def:container={plate| 盤 },while head word is food, i.e. E-HowNet representation of head word is {edible|食物} and it’s subclass. 盤,Nfb,def:{null},otherwise use this one. e.g. 分 ,Nfg, def:role={ 分 }, while head word is 錢 “money”, i.e. E-HowNet representation of head word is {money|貨幣} and it’s subclass. 分,Nfg, def:size={ 分 }, while head word is 地 “land”, i.e. E-HowNet representation of head word is {land|陸地} and it’s subclass. 分,Nfa, def:{null}, while part-of-speech of head word is Na or Nv. For example: 一分耕耘;十分力氣;五分熟. e.g.點,Nfh;Nfd,def:{null}, while part-of-speech of head word is Nab. If part-of-speech of head word is V, Naa or Nad, do not use this definition. collocation-based rule e.g.分,Nfh,def:role={score|分數:quantity={D4,D15}}, while the sentence also contains the words 考 ”give an exam” (E-HowNet representation is {exam|考試}) or 得 ”get” (E-HowNet representation is {obtain|得到}) or 失”lose” (E-HowNet representation is {lose|失去}), then use this definition. e.g.分,Nfg,def:time={minute|分鐘}, if the sentence contains the word 時”hour” or 鐘 頭”hour”. e.g. 兩 ,Nfg,def:weight={ 兩 }, if the sentence contains the word 重 ”weight” or 重 量”weight”. 兩,Nfg,def:role={money|貨幣}, if the sentence contains the word 銀”sliver” or 錢”money” or 黃金”gold” pre-determinant-based rule e.g.頭, Nff,def:{head|頭}, while pre-determinant is 一(Neqa)”one” or 滿”full” or 全”all” or 整”total”. e.g.腳, Nff,def:{leg|腳}, while pre-determinant is 一(Neqa)”one” or 滿”full” or 全 “all” or 整”total” and part-of-speech of head word is not Na. 腳, Nfi,def:frequency={}, while part-of-speech combination is V+D4,D15+腳. e.g.點,Nfg, def:time={ 點 }, while part-of-speech of pre-determinant is D4 or D15(1~24) and part-of-speech of previous word is not D1 or previous word is not 有”have”. e.g.輪,Nfg,def:time={輪}, while pre-determinant is 第 ” a function word placed in front of a cardinal number to form an ordinal number” or 首”first”. determinative-based rule e.g.一、二...1、2...兩..., Neu, def:ordinal={}, the determinant of word is 第, 民國, 公元, 西元, 年號, 一九 XX or 12XX, (four digits number). 一、二...1、2...兩..., Neu,def:quantity={}, otherwise use this definition. e.g.頭,Nes,def:ordinal={1},the word 頭”head” is determinant word. e.g.兩,Neu,def:quantity={}, the word 兩”a unit of weight equal to 50 grams” is determinant word. measure word based rule e.g.一,Neqa,def:quantity={all|全}, the part-of-speech of the measure word behind 一 is Nff, or the suffix of the measure word is 子, (for example,櫃子” cabinet”, 瓶 子”bottle”)or 籮筐” large basket”.
