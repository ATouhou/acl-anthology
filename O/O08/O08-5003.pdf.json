The question focus is detected to form a query for the information retrieval system and the question polarity is detected to retain relevant sentences which have the same polarity as the question. For answer passage retrieval, three components are introduced. Relevant sentences retrieved are further identified as to whether the focus (Focus Detection) is in a scope of opinion (Opinion Scope Identification) or not, and, if yes, whether the polarity of the scope and the polarity of the question (Polarity Detection) match with each other. The best model achieves an F-measure of 40.59% by adopting partial match for relevance detection at the level of meaningful unit. With relevance issues removed, the F-measure of the best model boosts up to 84.96%. Keywords: Opinion Extraction, Question Answering, Question Type, Answer Passage Retrieval"]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["Most of the state-of-the-art Question Answering (QA) systems serve the needs of answering factual questions such as “When was James Dean born?” and “Who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991?” However, in addition to facts, people would also like to know about others’ opinions, thoughts, and feelings toward some specific topics, groups, and events.

Traditional QA approaches for factual questions are not effective enough to retrieve answers for opinion questions [Stoyanov et al. 2005], so an opinion QA system is essential.","Most of the research on QA systems has been developed for factual questions, and the association of subjective information with question answering has not yet been studied much. As for subjective information, Wiebe [2000] proposed a method to identify strong clues of subjectivity of adjectives. Riloff et al. [2003] presented a subjectivity classifier using lists of subjective nouns learned by bootstrapping algorithms. Riloff and Wiebe [2003] proposed a bootstrapping process to learn linguistically rich extraction patterns for subjective expressions. Kim and Hovy [2004] presented a system to determine word sentiments and combined sentiments within a sentence. Pang, Lee, and Vaithyanathan [2002] classified documents not by topic, but by the overall sentiment, and then determined the polarity of a review. Wiebe et al. [2002] proposed a method for opinion summarization. Wilson et al. [2005] presented a phrase-level sentiment analysis to automatically identify the contextual polarity. Ku et al. [2006] proposed a method to automatically mine and organize opinions from heterogeneous information sources.","Some research has gone from opinion analysis in texts toward that in QA systems. Cardie et al. [2003] took advantage of opinion summarization to support Multi-Perspective Question Answering (MPQA) system which aims to extract opinion-oriented information of a question. Yu and Hatzivassiloglou [2003] separated opinions from facts at both document and sentence levels. They intended to cluster opinion sentences from the same perspective together and summarize them as answers to opinion questions. Kim and Hovy [2005] identified opinion holders, which are frequently asked in opinion questions.","This paper deals with two major problems in opinion QA systems, question analysis and answer passage retrieval. Several issues, including how to separate opinion questions from factual ones, how to define question types for opinion questions, how to correctly classify opinion questions into corresponding types, how to present answers for different types of opinion questions, and how to retrieve answer passages for opinion questions are discussed. In this paper, the unit of a passage is a sentence, though a passage can sometimes refer to a set of sentences, such as a paragraph.

The question (Question Q) is initially submitted into a part of speech tagger (POS Tagger), then the question is analyzed in three aspects by two-layered classification (Two-Layered Classification), including the question focus (Q Focus), the question polarity (Q Polarity), and the opinion question type (Opinion Q Type). The question focus defines the main concept of the question, while the question polarity refers to the positive, neutral, or negative tendency of the opinionated question. The former two attributes are further applied in answer passage retrieval (Answer Passage Retrieval). The question focus is the query for an information retrieval (IR) system to retrieve relevant sentences. The question polarity, which is the opinion polarity of the question, is utilized to screen out relevant sentences with different polarities to the question. For example, the polarity of the question “Who would like to use a Civil ID card?” should be positive, and non-supportive evidence should not be extracted for further processing. With answer passages retrieved, answer extraction extracts text spans as answers according to the opinion question types, and outputs answers to users. This paper focuses on the retrieved answer passages and the opinion type of the question for answer extraction. Answer extraction is not included in our discussion and is left as a future work.

Experimental Corpus Preparation","paragraphs":["The experimental corpus comes from four sources, TREC1",", NTCIR2",", the Internet Polls, and OPQ. TREC and NTCIR are two of the three major information retrieval evaluation forums in the world. Their evaluation tracks are in natural language processing and information retrieval domains such as large-scale information retrieval, question answering, genomics, cross language processing, and so on. We collected 500 factual questions from the main task of QA Track in TREC-11. Since the documents for answer extraction are in Chinese, the English questions were translated into Chinese manually for the experiments. A total of 1,577 factual questions are obtained from the developing question set of the CLQA task in NTCIR-5. Questions from public opinion polls in three public media websites – say, China Times, Era, and TVBS, are crawled. OPQ is developed for this research, and it contains both factual and opinion questions. To construct the question corpus OPQ, annotators are given titles and descriptions of six opinion topics selected from NTCIR-2 and NTCIR-3. Annotators freely ask any three factual questions and seven opinion questions for each topic. Duplicated questions are dropped and a total of 1,011 questions are collected. Within these 1,011 questions in OPQ, 304 are factual questions and the other 707 are opinion questions.","In total, we collected 2,443 factual questions and 1,289 opinion questions from four different sources.

Opinionated questions are generally related to holders, targets, and opinions. Holders are the named entities who express opinions, while targets are the objects these opinions are related to. Opinions are comments that holders express toward targets. We categorize the challenges in question analysis into three parts: holders, opinions and concepts.    1 http://trec.nist.gov/ 2 http://research.nii.ac.jp/ntcir/index-en.html   Question Analysis and Answer Passage Retrieval for 311 Opinion Question Answering Systems (a) Challenging issues for holders (1) To automatically identify named entities expressing opinions is imperative.","(2) The opinion holders may be a group. For example, answers to the question “How do Americans feel about the affair of the U.S. president Clinton?”, consist of opinions from any American.","(3) The classification of opinion holders may be necessary. To answer questions like “What kind of people support the abolishment of the Joint College Entrance Examination?”, QA systems have to find people having opinions toward the examination and classify them into the correct category, such as students, teachers, scholars, parents, and so on. (b) Challenging issues for opinions","(4) Knowing whether questions themselves contain subjective information and deciding their opinion polarities is necessary. The question “Who disagrees with the idea of surrogate mothers?” points out a negative attitude, and the answer to this question is expected to be a list of persons or organizations that have negative opinions toward the idea of surrogate mothers.","(5) The comparison and the summarization of positive and negative opinions may be required. In the question “Is using a civil ID card more advantageous or disadvantageous?”, opinions expressing advantages and disadvantages have to be contrasted and scored to represent answers as “More advantageous” or “More disadvantageous” with evidence listed to users. (c) Challenging issues for concepts","(6) It is essential to understand the concepts of opinions and perform the expansion of concepts to extract correct answers. In the question “Is a civil ID card secure?” it is vital to know the definition and conditions of being secure. For example, keeping the public’s privacy, ensuring the system’s security, and protecting fingerprint obtainment are possible security points.","(7) We may have to expand the concept of target. For instance, in the question “What do Taiwanese think about the substitute program for the Joint College Entrance Examination?”, the system has to know what the substitute program is, and seek for text spans which hold opinions towards it.","Among the 707 opinion questions from OPQ corpus, answers of 160 opinion questions are found in the NTCIR corpus.

Among these types, holder, target, and attitude types are related to the opinionated factors of questions, while reason, majority, and yes/no types concern the answer format of opinionated questions.  (1) Holder (HD) Definition: Asking who the expresser of the specific opinion is. Example: Who supports the civil ID card? Answer: Entities and the corresponding evidence.

We use See5 [Quinlan 2000] to train the Q-Classifier. Seven features are employed. The feature pretype (PTY) denotes types in factual QA systems such as SELECTION, YESNO, METHOD, REASON, PERSON, LOCATION, PERSONDEF, DATE, QUANTITY, DEFINITION, OBJECT, and MISC and they are extracted via a conventional QA system [Lin 2004]. For example, the value of pretype in “Who is Tom Cruise married to?” is PERSON.","The other six features are operator (OPR), positive (POS), negative (NEG), totalow (TOW), totalscore (TSR), and maxscore (MSR). A public available sentiment dictionary [Ku   314 Lun-Wei Ku et al. et al. 2006], which contains 2,655 positive opinion keywords, 7,767 negative opinion keywords, and 150 opinion operators, is used to tell if there are any positive (negative) opinion keywords and operators in questions. Each opinion keyword has a score expressing the degree of tendency. The feature operator (OPR) includes words of actions for expressing opinions. For example, say, think, and believe can be hints for extracting opinions. A total of 151 operators are manually collected. The features positive (POS) and negative (NEG) denote the numbers of positive opinion words and negative opinion words in one question, respectively. The feature totalow (TOW) is the total number of opinion operators, positive opinion keywords, and negative opinion keywords in a question. The feature totalscore (TSR) is the overall opinion score of the whole question, while the feature maxscore (MSR) is the absolute maximum opinion score of opinion keywords in a question.","Section 3 mentions 2,443 factual questions and 1,289 opinion questions are collected from four different sources. To keep the quantities of factual and opinion questions balanced, 1,289 factual questions are randomly selected from the 2,443 questions.

A topic dependent feature is only meaningful in questions of some topics, while general features may appear in questions of all kinds of topics. If a feature is topic dependent (e.g., human cloning and Clinton), it is dropped from the feature set. Only general features (e.g., is or is not, whether, and reason) are kept.

In the question “Who approves of the Joint College Entrance Examination?”, “approve” is a positive operator, and “the Joint College Entrance Examination” is a neutral question focus.

It may be a complete sentence, a sentence fragment, or a meaningful unit (MU) based on different criteria. A meaningful unit denotes a complete concept in one sentence. It is very common that many concepts are expressed within one sentence in Chinese documents. Therefore, identifying the complete concept denoted as MU in sentences is necessary for the processing of relevant opinions. As mentioned, a Chinese sentence is composed of several sentence fragments of which one or many can form a meaningful unit, which expresses a complete concept. This paper employs linking elements [Li and Thompson 1981] such as “because”, “when”, etc. to compose MUs from a sentence. For example, in S (in Chinese), “因此” (thus) is a linking element which links sf2, sf3, and sf4 together, and sf2 is a subordinate clause of the operator “表 示” (indicate) in sf1. Therefore, sf1, sf2, sf3, and sf4 form a MU in this case.

In another extreme case (i.e., exact match), only the fragment containing the complete question focus is regarded as relevant. In other words, exact match filters the fragments without the sentence focus out from the retrieved sentences. Partial match is weaker than exact match and is stronger than the lenient criterion. Those fragments which contain a part of the question focus are regarded as relevant.","There are three criteria for focus detection and opinion scope identification, respectively; thus, a total of 9 combinations are considered.

Polarity detection tries to identify those scopes bearing the same polarity as the question. How to determine the opinion polarity is an important issue. Two approaches are adopted. The opinion word approach employs a sentiment dictionary NTUSD3",", which contains 2,812 positive words and 8,276 negative words, to detect whether words in this dictionary appear in a certain scope. The score of an opinion scope is the sum of the scores of these words [Ku and Chen 2007].","People sometimes imply their feelings or beliefs toward a particular target or event by actions. For example, people may not say “Objection!” to disagree an event, but they may try to abolish or terminate it as possible as they could. On the contrary, people may not say “I love it!” to show their delight with an event, but they may try to fight for it or legalize it. In both circumstances, what people take in action expresses their opinions. Action words are those which indicate a person’s willing of doing or not doing some behaviors. For example, carry out, seek, and follow are words showing willingness to do something, and we name these words as do’s; substitute, stop, and boycott are words showing unwillingness to do something, and we name these words as don’ts.

Applying exact match is more helpful than applying partial match in the aspect of expelling noise.   322 Lun-Wei Ku et al."]},{"title":"5.7 Experiments on Relevance Effects","paragraphs":["The previous experiments were done on sentences reported by the Okapi IR system. These retrieved sentences are not all relevant to the questions. This section will discuss how the relevance affects answer passage retrieval. Recall that the experimental corpus is annotated with Rel2T (relevant or irrelevant to the topic), Rel2Q (relevant or irrelevant to the question), CorrectMU (text spans containing answers to the question).","Assume meaningful units are taken as the opinion scope. Tables 8 and 9 show how relevance influences the performance of answer passage retrieval using the opinion word and action word approaches, respectively."]},{"title":"Table 8.

Relevance Effects on Answer Passage Retrieval Using Action Words.","paragraphs":["Rel Degree → Rel2T Rel2Q CorrectMU Focus Detection ↓ Exact Match 36.88% 36.92% 48.99% Partial Match 41.90% 50.37% 72.84% Lenient 37.04% 53.06% 84.96%","Rel2T shows the performance of using answer passages relevant to the six topics, that is, the original relevant documents from NTCIR CLIR task. Rel2Q shows the performance of using answer passages relevant to the questions, while CorrectMU shows the performance of using correct opinion fragments, which are relevant to the question focus, to decide opinion polarities. Rel2T is similar to the relevant sentence retrieval, which was shown to be tough in the TREC novelty track (Soboroff and Harman, 2003). From Rel2T to Rel2Q and CorrectMU, the best strategy for matching the question focus switches from partial match to lenient. This is reasonable, since the contents of Rel2Q and CorrectMU are already relevant to the question focus. In Rel2Q, doing focus detection doesn’t benefit or harm much (50.37% vs. 53.06%). It shows that the question focus will appear exactly or partially in the relevant sentences. However, focus detection lowers the performance in CorrectMU (72.84% vs. 84.96%). It tells that the question focus and the correct meaningful units may appear in different positions within the sentence. For example, the first meaningful unit talks about the question focus,   Question Analysis and Answer Passage Retrieval for 323 Opinion Question Answering Systems while the third meaningful unit really answers the question but omits the question focus since it is mentioned earlier. From Rel2T to Rel2Q, the F-measure does not increase as much as that from Rel2Q to CorrectMU. This result shows that finding the correct fragments of passages to judge the opinion polarity is very crucial to answer passage retrieval. The F-measure of CorrectMU shows the performance of judging opinion polarities without the relevant issue. Using either the opinion word approach or the action word approach achieves an F-measure greater than 80%. As a whole, including action words is better than using opinion words only."]},{"title":"6. Conclusion","paragraphs":["This paper proposes some important techniques for opinion question answering. For question classification, a two-layered framework including two classifiers is proposed. General questions are divided into factual and opinion questions, and then opinion questions themselves are classified into one of the six opinion question types defined in this paper. With both factual and opinion features for a decision tree model, the classifier achieves a precision rate of 87.8% for general question classification. With heuristic rules and the Pearson correlation coefficient as the distance measurement, the classifier achieves a precision rate of 92.5% for opinion question classification.","For opinion answer passage retrieval, we are concerned not only with the relevance but also with the sentiment. Considering both opinion words and action words is better than considering opinion words only. Taking meaningful units as the opinion scope is better than taking sentences. Under the action word approach, the best model achieves an F-measure of 40.59% using partial match at the level of meaningful unit. With relevance issues removed, the F-measure of the best model boosts up to 84.96%. Although understanding the meaning of the question focus is important for the relevance detection, some foci are quite challenging in the experiments. Query expansion and concept ontology will be explored in the future."]},{"title":"Acknowledgement","paragraphs":["Research of this paper was partially supported by Google Research Award, and National Science Council, Taiwan, under the contract NSC95-2221-E-002-265-MY3."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Cardie, C., J.
