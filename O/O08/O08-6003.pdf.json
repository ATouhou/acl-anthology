Introduction","paragraphs":["In many daily information processing tasks, merging two classified information sources to create a larger taxonomy with abundant information is in great demand. For example, an e-commerce service provider may merge various catalogs from other vendors into its local catalog to provide customers with versatile contents. A Web user may also want to integrate different blog catalogs from Web 2.0 portals to organize a personal information management library. In these examples, people may need an efficient automatic integration approach to process the huge amount of information.","In recent years, the taxonomy integration problem has obtained much attention in many research studies (e.g. Agrawal & Srikan, 2001; Sarawagi, Chakrabarti, & Godbole, 2003;  * Dept. of Computer Sci. and Eng., Yuan Ze University, 135 Yuan-Tung Rd., Chungli, 320, Taiwan.

Zhang & Lee, 2004a; Zhang & Lee, 2004b; Zhu, Yang, & Lam, 2004; Chen, Ho, & Yang, 2005; Wu, Tsai, & Hsu, 2005; Ho, Chen, & Yang, 2006; Chen, Ho, & Yang, 2007; Cheng & Wei, 2008; Wu, Tsai, Lee, & Hsu, 2008). As pointed out in these studies, the integration work is more subtle than traditional classification work because the integration accuracy can be further improved with different kinds of implicit information embedded in the source or destination taxonomy. A taxonomy, or catalog, usually contains a set of objects divided into several categories according to some classified characteristics. In the taxonomy integration problem, the objects in a taxonomy, the source taxonomy S, are integrated into another taxonomy, the destination taxonomy D. As shown in earlier research, this problem is more than a traditional document classification problem because different kinds of implicit information in the source taxonomy are explored to greatly help integrate source documents into the destination taxonomy. For example, a Naive Bayes classification approach (Agrawal & Srikan, 2001) with the classification relationship information implicitly existing in the source catalog can achieve integration accuracy improvement. Several SVM (Support Vector Machines) approaches (Chen, Ho, & Yang, 2005) can also have similar improvement with other implicit source information.","The implicit source information studied in previous enhanced approaches generally includes the following features: (1) co-occurrence relationships of source objects (Agrawal & Srikan, 2001; Zhu, Yang, & Lam, 2004; Chen, Ho, & Yang, 2005), (2) latent source-destination mappings (Sarawagi, Chakrabarti, & Godbole, 2003; Zhang & Lee, 2004b; Cheng & Wei, 2008), (3) inter-category centroid information (Zhang & Lee, 2004a), and (4) parent-children relationships in the source hierarchy (Wu, Tsai, & Hsu, 2005; Ho, Chen, & Yang, 2006; Wu, Tsai, Lee, & Hsu, 2008). In our survey, however, the semantic information embedded in the source taxonomy has not been discussed. Since different applications have shown that the semantic information can benefit the task performance (Krikos, Stamou, Kokosis, Ntoulas, & Christodoulakis, 2005; Hsu, Tsai, & Chen, 2006), such information should be able to achieve similar improvements for taxonomy integration. In addition, we further study the hierarchical taxonomy integration problem because many taxonomies, such as Web catalogs, existing in the real world are hierarchical.","In this paper, we propose an enhanced integration approach by exploiting the implicit semantic information in the source taxonomy with a semantic feature expansion (SFE) mechanism. The basic idea behind SFE is that some semantically related terms can be found to represent a source category, and these representative terms can be further viewed as the additional common category labels for all documents in the category. Augmented with these additional semantic category labels, the source documents should be more precisely integrated into the correct destination category. The semantic expanding scheme, however, needs to consider the polysemy situation to avoid introducing many topic-irrelevant features. Therefore,   Hierarchical Taxonomy Integration Using 423 Semantic Feature Expansion on Category-Specific Terms SFE employs an efficient correlation coefficient method to select representative semantically-related terms.","To study the effectiveness of SFE, we implemented it based on a hierarchical taxonomy integration approach (EHCI) proposed in Ho et al. (2006) and Chen et al. (2007) with the Maximum Entropy (ME) model classifiers. We have conducted experiments with real-world Web catalogs from Yahoo! and Google, and measured the integration performance with precision, recall, and F1 measures. The results show that the SFE mechanism consistently can improve the integration performance of the EHCI approach.","The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the problem definition and Section 3 reviews previous related research. Section 4 elaborates the proposed semantic feature expansion approach and the hierarchical integration process. Section 5 presents the experimental results, and discusses the factors that influence the experiments. Section 6 concludes the paper and discusses some future directions of our work."]},{"title":"2. Problem Statement","paragraphs":["Following the definitions in Ho et al. (2006), we assume that two homogeneous hierarchical taxonomies, the source taxonomy S and the destination taxonomy D, participate in the integration process. The taxonomies are said to be homogeneous if the topics of the two taxonomies are similar. In addition, the taxonomies under consideration are required to overlap with a significant number of common documents. For example, in our experimental data sets, 20.6% of the total documents (436/2117) in the Autos directory of Yahoo! also appear in the corresponding Google directory.","The source taxonomy S has a set of m categories, or directories, S1, S2, ..., Sm. These categories may have subcategories, such as S1,1 and S2,1. Similarly, the destination catalog D has a set of n categories.

For illustration, we assume that the source category S1,1 has a significant number of overlapped documents with the destination categories D1,1 and D2,2. This means that the documents appearing in S1,1 should have similar descriptive information as the documents in D1,1 and D2,2. Therefore, a non-overlapped document 1","xd in category S1,1 should be intensively integrated into both two destination categories D1,1 and D2,2."]},{"title":"3. Previous Work 3.1 Integration Techniques","paragraphs":["In previous studies, different sorts of implicit information embedded in the source taxonomy are explored to help the integration process. These implicit source features can be mainly categorized into four types: (1) co-occurrence relationships of source objects, (2) latent source-destination mappings, (3) inter-category centroid information, and (4) parent-children relationships in the source hierarchy. The co-occurrence relationships of source objects are first studied to enhance a Naive Bayes classifier based on the concept that if two documents are in the same source category, they are more likely to be in the same destination category (Agrawal & Srikan, 2001). The enhanced Naïve Bayes classifier (ENB) is shown to have more than 14% accuracy improvement on average. The work in Chen et al. (2005) also has the similar concept in its iterative pseudo relevance feedback approach. As reported in Chen et al. (2005), the enhanced SVM classifiers consistently achieve improvement.","Latent source-destination mappings are explored in Sarawagi et al. (2003) and Zhang and Lee (2004b). The cross-training (CT) approach (Sarawagi, Chakrabarti, & Godbole, 2003) extracts the mappings from the first semi-supervised classification phase using the source documents as the training sets. Then, the destination documents are augmented with the latent mappings for the second semi-supervised classification phase to complete the integration. The co-bootstrapping (CB) approach (Zhang & Lee, 2004b) exploits the predicted source-destination mappings to repeatedly refine the classifiers. The experimental results show that both CT and CB outperform ENB (Sarawagi, Chakrabarti, & Godbole, 2003; Zhang & Lee, 2004b).","In Zhang and Lee (2004a), a cluster shrinkage (CS) approach, in which the feature weights of all objects in a document category are shrunk toward the category centroid, is proposed. Therefore, the cluster-binding relationships among all documents of a category are strengthened. The experimental results show that the CS-enhanced Transductive SVMs give   Hierarchical Taxonomy Integration Using 425 Semantic Feature Expansion on Category-Specific Terms significant improvement to the original T-SVMs and consistently outperform ENB.","In Wu et al. (2005) and Ho et al. (2006), the parent-children information embedded in hierarchical taxonomies is intentionally extracted. Based on the hierarchical characteristics, Wu et al. extend the CS and CB approach to improve the integration performance. In Ho et al. (2006), an enhanced approach called EHCI is proposed to further extract the hierarchical relationships as a conceptual thesaurus. Their results show that the implicit hierarchical information can be effectively used to boost the accuracy performance.","The semantic information embedded in the source taxonomy has not been discussed in past studies. This observation motivates us to study the embedded taxonomical semantic information and its effectiveness."]},{"title":"3.2 Overview of the Maximum Entropy Model Classifiers","paragraphs":["In our proposed SFE scheme, we use the Maximum Entropy (ME) model classifiers to perform the main integration task.

The clustering-based approach has the advantage in handling manifold taxonomies which may even have small overlaps and in performing integration without a priori training work. Therefore, the application of the clustering-based approach is much more general. The effectiveness of the clustering-based approach, however, depends on the clustering parameters. For inexperienced users, finding optimal clustering parameters will be very challenging.","Although the classification-based approach is more appropriate for handling taxonomies which have significant overlaps, it cannot handle the subtle relationships embedded in categories. For example, CatRelate uses five types of hierarchical relationships in a taxonomy to help catalog integration (Zhu, Yang, & Lam, 2004), and an integration scheme called EHCI uses a hierarchical weighting mechanism to strengthen the integration effectiveness (Ho, Chen, & Yang, 2006; Chen, Ho, & Yang, 2007). Nonetheless, CatRelate only discusses the hierarchical relationships on a category basis with a set of simple rules. It may suffer from complicated hierarchical relationships when handling large taxonomies. In contrast, EHCI’s hierarchical weighting mechanism considers the influences of category labels of more comprehensive neighboring levels on a document basis. The experimental results reported in Ho et al. (2006) and Chen et al. (2007) also show that EHCI is effective for handling large taxonomies. Therefore, we use EHCI as our baseline to study the effectiveness of the proposed SFE approach. The following gives a brief overview for EHCI.

Conclusion","paragraphs":["In recent years, the taxonomy integration problem has been progressively studied for integrating two homogeneous hierarchical taxonomies. Many types of implicit information embedded in the source taxonomy are explored to improve the integration performance. The semantic information embedded in the source taxonomy, however, has not been discussed in previous research.","In this paper, an enhanced integration approach (SFE) is proposed to exploit the semantic information of the hypernyms of the category-specific terms. Augmented with these additional semantic category features, the source documents can be more precisely integrated into the correct destination category in the experiments. The experimental results show that SFE-ME can achieve the best macro-averaged F1 score and the best micro-averaged F1 score. The results also show that the SFE scheme can get precision and recall enhancements in a significant portion of all cases.","There are still some issues left for future study. For example, the effectiveness of SFE on other classification schemes, such as SVM and NB, may need to be investigated to decide which one has the best integration performance. In addition, deciding the optimal parameter configuration is a classical classification problem which is also important to the taxonomy integration problem. Although mining more valuable implicit information can be a tough challenge, we believe that the integration performance can be further improved with appropriate assistance of more effective auxiliary information and advanced classifiers."]},{"title":"Acknowledgement","paragraphs":["This work was supported in part by National Science Council of R.O.C. under grant NSC 96-2422-H-006-002 and NSC 96-2221-E-155-067.
