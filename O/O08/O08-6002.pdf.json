Such corpora are only useful if their annotations are consistent. Most large-scale annotation efforts take special measures to reconcile inter-annotator disagreement. To date, however, nobody has investigated how to automatically determine exemplars in which the annotators agree but are wrong. In this paper, we use OntoNotes, a large-scale corpus of semantic annotations, including word senses, predicate-argument structure, ontology linking, and coreference. To determine the mistaken agreements in word sense annotation, we employ word sense disambiguation (WSD) to select a set of suspicious candidates for human evaluation. Experiments are conducted from three aspects (precision, cost-effectiveness ratio, and entropy) to examine the performance of WSD. The experimental results show that WSD is most effective in identifying erroneous annotations for highly-ambiguous words, while a baseline is better for other cases. The two methods can be combined to improve the cleanup process. This procedure allows us to find approximately 2% of the remaining erroneous agreements in the OntoNotes corpus. A similar procedure can be easily defined to check other annotated corpora.  * Department of Information Management, Yuan-Ze University, Chung-Li, Taiwan, R.O.C.

Introduction","paragraphs":["Word sense annotated corpora are useful resources for many text mining applications, such as thesaurus construction (Tseng, 2002; Yeh, 2004; 2008), paraphrase extraction (Zhao et al., 2008; Bhaget & Ravichandran, 2008), opinion mining (Ku & Chen, 2007; Kim & Hovy, 2007), and medical information extraction (Wu et al., 2005; Yu et al., 2008). Various machine learning algorithms can then be trained on these corpora to improve the applications’ effectiveness. Lately, many such corpora have been developed in different languages, including SemCor (Miller et al., 1993), LDC-DSO (Ng & Lee, 1996), Hinoki (Kasahara et al., 2004), and the sense annotated corpora with the help of Web users (Chklovski & Mihalcea, 2002). The SENSEVAL1","(Kilgarriff & Palmer, 2000; Kilgarriff, 2001; Mihalcea & Edmonds, 2004) and SemEval-20072","evaluations have also created large amounts of sense tagged data for word sense disambiguation (WSD) competitions.","The OntoNotes (Pradhan et al., 2007a; Hovy et al., 2006) project has created a multilingual corpus of large-scale semantic annotations, including word senses, predicate-argument structure, ontology linking, and coreference3",". In word sense creation, sense creators generate sense definitions by grouping fine-grained sense distinctions obtained from WordNet and dictionaries into more coarse-grained senses. There are two reasons for using this grouping instead of using WordNet senses directly. First, people have trouble distinguishing many of the WordNet-level distinctions in real text and make inconsistent choices; thus, the use of coarse-grained senses can improve inter-annotator agreement (ITA) (Palmer et al., 2004; 2006). Second, improved ITA enables machines to more accurately learn to perform sense tagging automatically. Sense grouping in OntoNotes has been calibrated to ensure that ITA averages at least 90%. Table 1 shows the OntoNotes sense tags and definitions for the word arm (noun sense). The OntoNotes sense tags have been used for many applications, including the SemEval-2007 evaluation (Pradhan et al., 2007b), sense merging (Snow et al., 2007), sense pool verification (Yu et al., 2007), and class imbalance problems (Zhu & Hovy, 2007).    1 http://www.senseval.org 2 http://nlp.cs.swarthmore.edu/semeval 3 Year 1 and Year 2 of the OntoNotes corpus has been released by Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) (http://www.ldc.upenn.edu) in 2007 and 2008, respectively.

First, all sentences containing the target word along with its sense distinctions are presented independently to two annotators for sense annotation. If the two annotators agree on the same sense for the target word in a given sentence, then their selection is stored in the corpus. Otherwise, this sentence is double-checked by the adjudicator for the final decision. The major problem of the above annotation scheme is that only the instances where the two annotators disagree are double-checked, while those showing agreement are stored directly without any adjudication. Therefore, if the annotators happen to agree but are both wrong, the corpus becomes polluted by the erroneous annotations. Table 2 shows an actual occurrence of an erroneous instance (sentence) for the target word management. In this example sentence, the actual sense of the target word is management.01, but both of our annotators made a decision of management.02.

Therefore, a cleanup procedure is necessary to produce a high-quality corpus. It is, however, impractical for human experts to evaluate the whole corpus for cleanup. Given that we are focusing on word senses, this study proposes the use of WSD to facilitate the corpus cleanup process. WSD has shown promising accuracy in recent SENSEVAL and SemEval-2007 evaluations.","The rest of this work is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the corpus cleanup procedure.

Word Sense Disambiguation","paragraphs":["This study takes a supervised learning approach to build a WSD system from the OntoNotes corpus. The feature set used herein is similar to several state-of-the-art WSD systems (Lee & Ng, 2002; Ando, 2006; Tratz et al., 2007; Cai et al., 2007; Agirre & Lopez de Lacalle, 2007; Specia et al., 2007), which is further integrated into a Naïve Bayes classifier (Lee & Ng, 2002; Mihalcea, 2007). In addition, a new feature, predicate-argument structure, provided by the OntoNotes corpus is integrated as well. The feature set includes: Part-of-Speech (POS) tags: This feature includes the POS tags in the positions (P-3, P-2, P-1, P0, P1, P2, P3), relative to the POS tag of the target word. For instance, the POS sequence of the constituent “...mediator in an attempt to break the...” is “NN NN IN DT TO VB DT”. Local Collocations: This feature includes single words and multi-word n-grams. The single words include (W-3, W-2, W-1, W0, W1, W2, W3), relative to the target word W0. Similarly, the multi-word n-grams include (W-2,-1, W-1,1, W1,2, W-3,-2,-1, W-2,-1,1, W-1,1,2, W1,2,3). For instance, the multi-word n-grams of the above example constituent include {in_an, an_to, to_break, mediator_in_an, in_an_to, an_to_break, to_break_the}. Bag-of-Words: This feature can be considered as a global feature, consisting of 5 words prior to and after the target word, without regard to position. Predicate-Argument Structure: The predicate-argument structure captures the semantic relations between the predicates and their arguments within a sentence. Consider the following example sentence.  [Arg0 The New York arm of the London-based firm] auctioned off [Arg1 the estate of John T. Dorrance Jr., the Campbell's Soup Co. heir,] [ArgM-TMP last week].  The argument label Arg0 is usually assigned to the agent, causer, and experiencer, while Arg1 is usually assigned to the patient. The ArgM-TMP represents a temporal modifier (Babko-Malaya, 2006; Palmer et al., 2005). The predicate-argument structure of the above sentence is illustrated in Figure 2. The semantic relations can be either direct or indirect. A direct relation is used to model a verb-noun (VN), whereas an indirect relation is used to model a noun-noun (NN) relation. Additionally, an NN-relation can be built from the   410 Liang-Chih Yu et al. combination of two VN-relations with the same predicate. Table 3 presents some examples. For instance, NN1 can be built by combining VN1 and VN2. Therefore, the two features, VN1 and NN3, can be used to disambiguate the noun arm 4",". "]},{"title":"Figure 2.

In each test set, the instances with disagreement among the annotators were excluded, since they have already been double-checked by the adjudicator. A baseline system was also implemented using the principle of most frequent sense (MFS), where each word sense distribution was retrieved from the OntoNotes corpus.

An adjudicator who is a linguistic expert then evaluated the suspicious set, and agreed in 42 instances with the WSD systems, indicating about 6% (42/687) truly erroneous annotations.

To improve performance, we conducted experiments to analyze the effect of word entropy with respect to WSD performance on identifying erroneous annotations.","For the SemEval 35 nouns used in this experiment, some words are very ambiguous and some words are not. This property of ambiguity may affect the performance of WSD systems in identifying erroneous annotation. To this end, this experiment used entropy to measure the ambiguity of words (Melamed, 1997). The entropy of a word can be computed by the word sense distribution, defined as:","2() ( )log ( ), i ii","ws WH WPwsPws ∈=−"]},{"title":"∑","paragraphs":["(1) where ()H W denotes the entropy of a word W, and P( i"]},{"title":"ws","paragraphs":[") denotes the probability of a word sense.

The major reason is that the sense distribution of unambiguous words is often skewed, thus, WSD systems built from such imbalanced data tend to suffer from the over-fitting problem; that is, they tend to over-fit the predominant sense class and ignore small sense classes (Zhu & Hovy, 2007).

The incorrect sense annotations found in this study can be used for SemEval-2007 to improve the accuracy of WSD evaluation.","The absence of related work on (semi-) automatically determining cases of erroneous agreement among annotators in a corpus is rather surprising. Variants of the method described here, replacing WSD for whatever procedure is appropriate for the phenomenon annotated in the corpus (sentiment recognition for a sentiment corpus, etc.), are easy to implement and may produce useful results for corpora in current use.
