This approach was applied to transcribe Chinese text into Taiwanese phonetic symbols. By augmenting the text with speech and using automatic speech recognition with a sausage searching net constructed from multiple pronunciations of text, we are able to reduce the error rate of phonetic transcription. Using a pronunciation lexicon with multiple pronunciations for each item, a transcription error rate of 12.74% was achieved. Further improvement can be achieved by adapting the pronunciation lexicon with pronunciation variation (PV) rules derived manually from corrected transcription in a speech corpus. The PV rules can be categorized into two kinds: knowledge-based and data-driven rules. By incorporating the PV rules, an error rate of 10.56% could be achieved. Although this technique was developed for Taiwanese speech, it could easily be adapted to other Chinese spoken languages or dialects.

Introduction","paragraphs":["Automatic phonetic transcription is gaining popularity in the speech processing field, especially in speech recognition, text-to-speech, and speech database construction [Haeb-Umbach et al. 1995; Wu et al. 1999; Lamel et al. 2002; Evermann et al. 2004; Nanjo et al. 2004; Nouza et al. 2004; Sarada et al. 2004; Siohan et al. 2004; Soltau et al. 2005; Kim et al. 2005]. It is traditionally performed using two different approaches: an acoustic feature input method and a text input method. The former is the speech recognition task, or more specifically, the phoneme recognition task. The latter is the grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) task. Both tasks, including phoneme recognition and G2P remain unsolved technology problems. The state-of-the-art speaker-independent (SI) phone recognition accuracy in a large vocabulary task is currently less than 80%, far from human expectations. Although the accuracy of G2P tasks seems much better, it relies on a “perfect” pronunciation lexicon and cannot effectively deal with pronunciation variation issues.","This problem becomes non-trivial when the target text is the Chinese text (漢字). The Chinese writing system is widely used in China and in East/South Asian areas including Taiwan, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Although the same Chinese character is used in different areas, the pronunciation may be very different. Therefore, they are mutually unintelligible and considered different languages rather than dialects by most linguists.","In this paper, we chose Buddhist Sutra (written collections of Buddhist teachings) as the target text processed in this research. Buddhism is a major religion in Taiwan (23% of the population) [IIP 2003]. The Buddhist Sutra, translated into Chinese text in a terse ancient style (古文) , is commonly read in Taiwanese (Min-nan). Due to a lack of proper education, most people are not capable of correctly pronouncing all of the text. Besides, no qualified pronunciation lexicon exists and very few appropriately computational linguistic research projects have been conducted to support developing a G2P system.","Taiwanese uses Chinese characters as a part of the written form, with its own phonetic system differing greatly from Mandarin. This is in contrast to the case of Mandarin, where the problem of multiple pronunciations (MP) is less severe. A Chinese character in Taiwanese can commonly have a classic literate pronunciation (known as Wen-du-in, or “文讀音” in Chinese) and a colloquial pronunciation (known as Bai-du-in, or “白讀音” in Chinese) [Liang et al. 2004a]. In addition to MPs, Taiwanese also have pronunciation variation (PV) due to sub-dialectical accents, such as Tainan and Taipei accents. We use the term MPs to stress the fact that variation may cause more deterioration in phonetic transcription [Cremelie et al. 1999; Hain 2005; Raux 2004].","The traditional approach to transcribing Chinese Buddhist Sutra text is human dictation. A master monk or nun reads the text aloud, sentence by sentence. Then, some phonetic experts   Data Driven Approaches to Phonetic Transcription with Integration of 235 Automatic Speech Recognition and Grapheme-to-Phoneme for Spoken Buddhist Sutra transcribe the text manually. The manual transcription process is tedious and prone to errors. An example is given in Table 1 as follows [Chen 2006; Tripitaka et al. 2005]."]},{"title":"Table 1.

Owing to the fact that human experts capable of phonetically transcribing the Sutra in Taiwanese are difficult to find, the first phonetically transcribed Sutra in Taiwanese did not appear until 2004 [Sik 2004a, 2004b]. As shown in Figure 1, our task is to discover which of them is actually pronounced when the Sutra text is segmented into a series of sentences and recorded by a senior master nun. Then, the output of transcription is formed in ForPA or Tongyong Pinin [Lyu et al. 2004]. These two phonetic symbol systems are well-designed in ASCII code and suitable for any learners with common understanding of the English phonetic system. This architecture is much easier for a person to use to record his/her reading of the text than acquiring a transcribing expert. For marginalized languages with serious MPs and PV problems, this technique is very useful."]},{"title":"Figure 1.

All the searching nets, including the sausage net, were constructed according to a multiple pronunciation lexicon and described in the next section.

The lexicon contains about 123,000 words in Chinese/Taiwanese text with Mandarin/Taiwanese pronunciations. It is a combination of two lexica: Formosa Mandarin-Taiwanese Bi-lingual lexicon and Gang's Taiwanese lexicon [Liang et al. 2004a; Liang et al. 2004b; Lyu et al. 2004]. The former is derived from a Mandarin lexicon; thus, many commonly used Taiwanese terms are missing due to the fundamental difference between these two languages. The latter contains more widely used Taiwanese expressions from samples of radio talk shows. Some examples of the lexicon are shown in Table 4, containing 65,007 entries using the Wen-du-in pronunciation and 58,431 entries using the Bai-du-in pronunciation. There are a total of 123,438 pronunciation entries. For all 65,007 Wen-du-in pronunciation entries, there are 6,890 entries for one-syllable words, 39,840 entries for two-syllable words, and so on. The lexicon as described above is a general-purpose lexicon. It could be used for a wide range of applications and tends to have a higher number of multiple pronunciations.","We used two kinds of searching nets in these experiments, according to the lexicon.

One reason is because many of the Chinese characters used in ancient times are no longer used in modern times. Thus, even the Unicode Standard, which contains more than thirty thousand Chinese characters, does not contain them. The Formosa Lexicon has much fewer distinct characters, and the missing character problem is inevitable. When a missing character is encountered, we use all possible syllables as its multiple pronunciations. One example is illustrated in Figure 4, where the sausage searching net is constructed for the Chinese character string “C0C1C2”. It is assumed that the character C0 is a missing character.

Since global lexicon modification by experts would take considerable effort and not necessarily benefit, we adopted alternative rule-based methods. By rule-based pronunciation variations, we mean that phonetic units will be changed by speakers according to some underlying rules. Usually, a rule could be notated as the form “BS̆” for canonical pronunciation B (base-form) being substituted with the actual pronunciation S (surface-form) [Saraclar et al. 2004]. Briefly speaking, some rule-derived variant pronunciations are added directly into the searching net to enhance the poor pronunciation coverage of an imperfect pronunciation lexicon.","An example is shown in Figure 5, where the number of pronunciations for the Chinese character “母” was increased from 4 to 5 by incorporating some specific pronunciation rules as “/ɤ/ → /o/”. It could be shown that, as long as the pronunciation rules could be well designed, the phonetic transcription performance would be effectively improved.","Generally speaking, the pronunciation-variation (PV) rules can be categorized into two kinds: knowledge-based and data-driven rules. The knowledge-based rules were derived from the knowledge established by phoneticians. On the other hand, the data-driven PV rules rely on the availability of transcribed speech corpora.

The number of triphone units in Taiwanese is about 1200.","As with the other members of the Chinese language family, there are about three types of pronunciation variations in Taiwanese. These could be summarized as follows and are shown in Table 5:","1. Variation between Bai-du-in and Wen-du-in: The variations may vary due to using classic literate pronunciation (known as Wen-du-in) or a colloquial pronunciation (known as Bai-du-in). This point has been discussed previously in Section 1. For example, the Chinese character “生” (to give birth) might be pronounced as /siŋ/ in Wen-du-in and /sẽ/ or / sĩ / in Bai-du-in. All of these are acceptable.","2. Variation between sub-dialectal regions: Some variations were referred to as dialectal differences; For instance, the initials /z/ is substituted with /l/ or /g/ depending on the sub-dialect of Taiwanese. Such a rule was denoted as “zl̆/g”.","3. Variation due to personal pronunciation errors: Some kinds of variations are considered personal pronunciation errors. Owing to the lack of some phonemes in the mainstream language (such as Mandarin in Taiwan), some pronunciation may disappear in younger generations. One of these phonemes is /g/, where the phenomenon is denoted as “g ̆{}”.","Table 5 can be considered as a knowledge source to select the pronunciation variation rules. The knowledge-based PV rules, which were derived by more than one linguist, were sometimes contradictory with each other. This made them difficult to choose between at times in implementation. Such a difficulty leads to a need for another approach. One of them is a data-driven approach from large-scale real data. Since a little manually transcribed speech data was available, we could use statistical computational measures to extract the PV rules from real data.

The Experiment Results and Discussion","paragraphs":["In training or estimating SI-HMM models for the acoustic part, we use continuous Gaussian-mixture HMM models with feature vectors of 12-dimensional MFCC with 1-dimensional energy, plus the first, second, and third derivatives computed using a 20-ms frame width and 10-ms frame shift. Context-dependent intra-syllabic tri-phone models were built using a decision-tree state tying procedure. As the testing data is speaker dependent, adaptation with some manually transcribed data must be useful in automatic phonetic   Data Driven Approaches to Phonetic Transcription with Integration of 247 Automatic Speech Recognition and Grapheme-to-Phoneme for Spoken Buddhist Sutra transcription. Maximum Likelihood Linear Regression (MLLR) is then used to adapt speaker independent models using 31-utterance adaptation speech data. Most of the training and recognition are carried out by using the HTK tools [Young et al. 2008].","With the two searching nets (Total-Syl-Net, General-Sau-Net) and acoustic models (SI with adaptation), the recognition results measured as the syllable error rate (SER) are shown in Figure 6. In addition, we also show the result of only language, called grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P), with unigram. "]},{"title":"Figure 6. Syllable error rate (SER) under uni-gram, and General-Sau-Net, SI w/ adaptation. See text in subsection 3.2 for notations.","paragraphs":["Through observation of the experimental results, we can see that neither G2P with unigram nor Total-Syl-Net with adaptation model can reach acceptable performance. Therefore, it is necessary to integrate the linguistic and acoustic parts. General-Sau-Net could surpass Total-Syl-Net. For example, under the same speaker adaptation models, the result was 12.74% better with General-Sau-Net than other results in Figure 6. Thus, if the speaker independent model could be adapted using some phonetically transcribed speech data, the adapted speaker independent model under General-Sau-Net would be suitable for the phonetic annotation task. In multiple pronunciation problems, by our speech data observation, we could see that some errors result from pronunciation variations. Therefore, we hypothesized that the performance would get better by adaptation of the Formosa Lexicon Sausage net, i.e. adaptation of the Formosa lexicon, described in the Section 4.","We adapted the Formosa (general-purpose) pronunciation lexicon according to different pronunciation variation rule sets.

We could observe that it is truly helpful to decrease the SER by increasing the searching net coverage via the PV rules. The evidence is that the lowest error rate (10.56%) was achieved by utilizing the first 52 variation rules, which were selected by the Mutual-Information (MI) measure. Similar improvement would also be observed in the best SER (11.81% and 11%) achieved using the Joint-Probability (JP) and Conditional-Probability (CP) measures when the complexities of the JP and CP measure are 2.68 and 2.55, respectively. "]},{"title":"Figure 7. The recognition result (Syllable error rate) v.s. the number of ranked rules sorted according to different measures, including mutual-information (MI), joint-probability (JP), and conditional-probability (CP) as well as the Baseline criterion.","paragraphs":["It is interesting to point out that, in Figure 7, choosing different statistical measures was found to influence the achievable lowest SER and also the speed of decrease in SER. In these experiments, we found that MI was the best in terms of the rate of decrease in SER or the achievable lowest SER. Although the JP-based measure could make the error rate converge more quickly than the CP-based measure, the performance also degraded quickly. This is because the CP-based measure score was normalized by the base-form count in contrast to the   Data Driven Approaches to Phonetic Transcription with Integration of 249 Automatic Speech Recognition and Grapheme-to-Phoneme for Spoken Buddhist Sutra JP-based measure. However, the insignificant and harmless PV-rules might get the higher conditional probability sometimes due to few base-form observations. The PV-rules for the CP-based measure might not increase the perplexity but still lead to the slowest convergence among the three measures. In the MI-based measure, the formula could avoid slow convergence using the Joint-Probability as a weight when the base-form had few variations. Observing the confusion table, the surface-form would have lower correlation with these base-forms if many base-forms would transform into the same surface-form. So, we proposed that the mutual information between the base and surface-forms should be used to calculate the base and surface-form correlation using the normalization of their count. Consequently, the error rate of the MI rank converges most quickly and the performance of the MI measure in error reduction was also better than JP and CP measures, respectively.","Another interesting point was that the SER will possibly increase if too many PV rules are applied. For example, the lowest SER is achieved by applying 52 rules when MI was adopted as the ranking measure. However, after applying more rules, the SER increased! It even became worse than that in the baseline experiments. This means that some “bad” pronunciation variation rules may lead to a performance reduction. Take the Joint-Probability (JP) measure for example. The optimal performance was achieved when 17 ranked rules were applied, but when the number of rules further increased, the performance degraded. It was similar when MI or CP was used. Therefore, it is important to determine “good” rules and choose them so that the optimal performance could be achieved as soon as possible.","Extending the searching net can enhance the SER performance, but the extension must be limited to a suitable range. This point can be observed from the perplexity of the searching net in Figure 8. Regardless what measures we use, the differences in the perplexity values from the best results among the three measures were always slight. For example, in Figure 8, the perplexity of the best JP measure result was 2.68 when the perplexity of best MI measure result was 2.62. That means too many rules may lead to more real pronunciation coverage, but the performance may improve slightly or even decrease progressively. The perplexity is a good measure to evaluate the searching net in obtaining the best results.","Finally, in Figure 9, the error rate of General-Sau-Net is 12.74%. However, some errors resulted from pronunciation variations caused by a speaker's accent. Therefore, through incorporating variation rules into General-Sau-Net with different statistic measures, the best error rates can be reduced to 11.81%, 11%, and 10.56% with respect to JP-, CP-, and MI-based measures, respectively.    250 Min-Siong Liang et al.

Conclusions","paragraphs":["We have proposed a new approach to address the phonetic transcription of Chinese text into Taiwanese pronunciation. Considering the fact that there are very few linguistic resources for Taiwanese, we used speech recognition techniques to deal with multiple pronunciation variations, which is a very common phenomenon in Taiwanese but hard to deal with using traditional text-based approaches. A general-purpose lexicon (called the Formosa lexicon), and a speaker-adapted HMM model were used to achieve a syllable error rate, 12.74%. In order to enhance the performance, the trivial adaptation of a general-purpose sausage net with pronunciation variation rules was used instead of global pronunciation lexicon modification.","In pronunciation variation rule (PV-rules) selection, the data-driven variation rules, which were derived using three statistical measures, were used to extend more possible pronunciations. Although the knowledge-based rules were also derived from a knowledge source, the rules were difficult to implement and dependent on the specific language. Thus, we selected data-driven rules with context-dependent triphones as the general solution to the PV problem. In the data-driven measure, the mutual-information-based (MI) rank outperformed the Joint-Probability rank and Conditional-Probability rank. Compared with baseline experiment result error rate of 12.74%, the lowest error rate of the MI-based measures had an error reduction rate of 17.11%, which was the best among the three statistical measures proposed in this paper. The error rate of the MI rank converged most quickly and the best performance of MI-based measure appeared in the first 52 ranks.","The experimental results from data-driven measures could possibly provide the evidence to help choose the corresponding knowledge-based PV rules. Of course, some of the pronunciation variation rules were certainly language-dependent (i.e. the phonological and phonetic processes differ between languages) [Kanokphara et al. 2003]. However, the major points to be emphasized are that the proposed technique to model pronunciation variation for transcription was rather language-independent.","The recognition of tones was still an unsolved problem in this research. This is another issue for further research. In Taiwanese, there are 7 tone classes, which could be used to distinguish the meanings of words. In addition, the complex tone sandhi would also be accompanied with tone recognition. If more speech and text was gathered, the analysis and statistics of pronunciation information for pronunciation probability would be the next step. We will construct a human interaction system to help more Taiwanese publications be presented. This technology may also be used as a language-learning tool.","Although the proposed technique was developed for Taiwanese speech, it could also be easily adapted for application in other similar “minority” Chinese spoken languages, such as Hakka, Wu, Yue, Xiang, Gan, and Min, or other non-Han family languages which also use   252 Min-Siong Liang et al. Chinese characters as the written language form.","In summary, the proposed semi-automatic transcription of Chinese text into a Taiwanese pronunciation system reached a 12.74% error rate in the baseline experiment. Further improvement using pronunciation variation rules produced a 17.11% error rate reduction."]},{"title":"Reference","paragraphs":["Chen C.
