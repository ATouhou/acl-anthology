However, significant performance degradation is often observed when queries contain words that do not appear in the dictionary. This is called the Out of Vocabulary (OOV) problem. In recent years, Web mining has been shown to be one of the effective approaches for solving this problem. However, the questions of how to extract Multiword Lexical Units (MLUs) from the Web content and how to select the correct translations from the extracted candidate MLUs are still two difficult problems in Web mining based automated translation approaches. Most statistical approaches to MLU extraction rely on statistical information extracted from huge corpora. In the case of using Web mining techniques for automated translations, these approaches do not perform well because the size of the corpus is usually too small and statistical approaches that rely on a large sample can become unreliable. In this paper, we present a new Chinese term measurement and a new Chinese MLU extraction process that work well on small corpora. We also present our approach to the selection of MLUs in a more accurate manner. Our experiments show marked improvement in translation accuracy over other commonly used approaches.

INTRODUCTION","paragraphs":["As more and more documents written in various languages become available on the Internet, users increasingly wish to explore documents that were written in either their native language  ∗ Faculty of Information Technology, School of Software Engineering and Data Communications, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD 4001, Australia E-mail: {c.lu,yue.xu,s.geva}@qut.edu.au   62 Chengye Lu et al.  or some language other than English. Cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) systems allow users to retrieve documents written in more than one language through queries written in a different language. This is a helpful end-user feature. Obviously, translation is needed in the CLIR process; either translating the query into the document language, or translating the documents into the query language. The common approach is to translate the query into the document language using a dictionary. Dictionary-based translation has been adopted in cross-language information retrieval because bilingual dictionaries are widely available, dictionary-based approaches are easy to implement, and the efficiency of word translation with a dictionary is high. However, due to the vocabulary limitation of dictionaries, very often the translations of some words in a query cannot be found in a dictionary. This problem is called the Out of Vocabulary (OOV) problem. Very often, the OOV terms are proper names or newly created words. Even using the best dictionary, the OOV problem is unavoidable. As input queries are usually short, query expansion does not provide enough information to help recover the missing words. Furthermore, in many cases, it is exactly the OOV terms that are the crucial words in the query. For example, a query “SARS, CHINA” may be entered by a user in order to find information about SARS in China. However, SARS is a newly created term and may not be included in a dictionary published only a few years ago. If the word SARS is left out of the translated query, it is most likely that the user will be unable to find any relevant documents. Moreover, a phrase cannot always be translated by translating each individual word in the phrase. For example, an idiom is a phrase and should not be translated by combining translations of the individual words because the correct translation may be a specific word which is not the combination of individual word translations of the original phrase.","Another problem with the dictionary-based translation approach is the translation disambiguation problem. The problem is more serious for a language which does not have word boundaries, such as Chinese. Translation disambiguation refers to finding the most appropriate translation from several choices in the dictionary. For example, the English word STRING has over 20 different translations in Chinese, according to the Kingsoft online dictionary (www.kingsoft.com). One approach is to select the most likely translation [Eijk 1993] – usually the first one offered by a dictionary. However, even if the choices are ordered based on some criteria and the most likely a-priori translation is picked, in general, such an approach has a low probability of success. Another solution is to use all possible translations in the query with the OR operator. However, while this approach is likely to include the correct translation, it also introduces noise into the query. This can lead to the retrieval of many irrelevant documents which is, of course, undesirable. [Jang et al. 1999] and [Gao et al. 2001] report that this approach has precision that is 50% lower than the precision that is obtained by human translation.   Web-Based Query Translation for English-Chinese CLIR 63 ","In this paper, we present a Web-based approach to term extraction and translation selection. Specifically, we introduce a statistics-based approach to extracting terms and a translation disambiguation technique to improve the precision of the translations. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: in Section 2, we present the existing approaches to query translation; in Section 3 we present our approach. Experimental evaluation and results discussion are presented in Section 4 and Section 5, respectively. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section 6."]},{"title":"2. PREVIOUS WORK 2.1 Translation","paragraphs":["Dictionary-based query translation is one of the conventional approaches in CLIR. The appearance of OOV terms is one of the main difficulties arising with this approach. In very early years, OOV terms were not translated at all, leaving out the original terms in the translated query. This approach may significantly limit retrieval performance. In this section, several existing approaches to OOV translation are reviewed."]},{"title":"2.1.1 Transliteration","paragraphs":["Proper names, such as personal names and place names, are a major source of OOV terms because many dictionaries do not include such terms. It is common for foreign names to be translated word-by-word based on phonetic pronunciations. In this manner, a name in one language will be pronounced similarly in another language – this is called transliteration. Such translation is usually done by a human when a new proper name is introduced from one language to another language.","Some researchers [Paola et al. 2003; Yan et al. 2003] have applied the rule of transliteration to automatically translate proper names. Basically, the transliteration will first convert words in one language into phonetic symbols, then convert the phonetic symbols into another language. Some researchers have found that transliteration is quite useful in proper name translation [Paola et al. 2003; Yan et al. 2003]. However, transliteration is useful in only a few language pairs. When dealing with language pairs for which there are many phonemes in one language that are not present in the other, such as Chinese and English, the problem is exacerbated. There are even more problems when translating English to Chinese. First, as there is no standard for name translation in Chinese, different communities may translate a name in different ways. For example, the word “Disney” is translated as “迪斯尼” in mainland China but is translated as“迪士尼” in Taiwan. Both are pronounced similarly in Chinese, but use different Chinese characters. Even a human interpreter would have difficulty in unambiguously choosing which character should be used. Second, at times, the Chinese   64 Chengye Lu et al.  translation only uses some of the phonemes of the English names. For example, the translation of “American” is “美国” which only uses the second syllable of “American”. Finally, the translation of a name is not limited to only using translation but also to transliteration. Sometimes, the translation of a proper name may even use a mixed form of translation and transliteration. For example, the translation of “New Zealand” in mainland China is “新西兰”, where “新” is the translation of “New” and “西兰” is the transliteration of “Zealand”."]},{"title":"2.1.2 Parallel Text Mining","paragraphs":["Parallel text is a text in one language together with its translation in another language. The typical way to use parallel texts is to generate translation equivalence automatically, without using a dictionary. It has been used in several studies [Eijk 1993; Kupiec 1993; Smadja et al. 1996; Nie et al. 1999] on multilingual related tasks such as machine translation or CLIR.","The idea of parallel text mining is straightforward. Since parallel texts are texts in two languages, it should be possible to identify corresponding sentences in two languages. When the corresponding sentences have been correctly identified, it is possible to learn the correspondence translation of each term in the sentence using statistical information since the term’s translation will always appear in the corresponding sentences. Therefore, an OOV term can be translated by mining parallel corpora. Many researchers have also reported that parallel text mining based translation can significantly improve the CLIR performance [Eijk 1993; Kupiec 1993; Smadja et al. 1996; Nie et al. 1999].","In the very early stages, parallel text based translation approaches were word-by-word based and only domain specific noun terms were translated. In general, these approaches [Eijk 1993; Kupiec 1993] first align the sentences in each corpus, then noun phrases are identified by a part-of-speech tagger. Finally, noun terms are mapped using simple frequency calculations. In such translation models, phrases, especially verb phrases, are very hard to translate. As phrases in one language may have different word order in another language, phrases cannot be translated on a word-by-word basis. This problem in parallel text based translation is called the collocation problem.","Some later approaches [Smadja et al. 1996; Nie et al. 1999] started to use more complex strategies such as statistical association measurement or probabilistic translation models to solve the collocation problem. Smadja et al. [Smadja et al. 1996] proposed an approach that can translate word pairs and phrases. In particular, they used a statistical association measure of the Dice coefficient to deal with the problem of collocation translation. Nie et al. [Nie et al. 1999] proposed an approach based on a probabilistic model that demonstrates another approach to solving the collocation problem. Using parallel texts, their translation model can return p(t|S), which is the probability of having the term t of the target language in the translation of the source sentence S. As the probability model does not consider the order and   Web-Based Query Translation for English-Chinese CLIR 65  the position of words, collocation is no longer a problem.","Some of the advantages of the parallel text based approaches include the very high accuracy of translation without using bilingual dictionaries and the extraction of multiple transitions with equivalent meaning that can be used for query expansion. However, the sources of parallel corpora tend to be limited to some particular domain and language pairs. Currently, large-scale parallel corpora are available only in the form of government proceedings, e.g. Canadian parliamentary proceedings in English and French, or Hong Kong government proceedings in Chinese and English. Obviously, such corpora are not suitable for translating newly created terms or domain-specific terms that are outside the domains of the corpora. As a result, current studies of parallel text based translation are focusing on constructing large-scale parallel corpora in various domains from the Web."]},{"title":"2.1.3 Web Mining","paragraphs":["Web mining for automated translation is based on the observation that there are a large number of Web pages on the Internet that contain parallel text in several languages. Investigation has found that when a new English term, such as a new technical term or a proper name, is introduced into Chinese, the Chinese translation to this term and the original English term very often appear together in literature publications in an attempt to avoid misunderstanding. Some earlier studies have already addressed the problem of extracting useful information from the Internet using Web search engines such as Google and Yahoo. These search engines search for English terms on pages in a certain language, e.g., Chinese or Japanese. The results of Web search engines are normally a long, ordered list of document titles and summaries to help users locate information. Mining the result lists can help find translations to the unknown query terms. Some studies [Cheng et al. 2004; Zhang et al. 2004] have shown that such approaches are rather effective for proper name translation. Generally, Web-based translation extraction approaches consist of three steps:","1. Web document retrieval: use a Web search engine to find the documents in the target language that contain the OOV term in the original language and collect the text (i.e. the summaries) in the result pages returned from the Web search engine.","2. Term extraction: extract the meaningful terms in the summaries where the OOV term appears and record the terms and their frequency in the summaries. As a term in one language could be translated to a phrase or even a sentence, the major difficulty in term extraction is the identification of correct MLUs in the summaries (refer to Section 2.2 for the definition of MLUs).","3. Translation selection: select the appropriate translation from the extracted words. As the previous steps may produce a long list of terms, translation selection has to find the correct translation from the extracted terms.   66 Chengye Lu et al. ","The existing term extraction techniques in the second step fall into two main categories: approaches that are based on lexical analysis or dictionary-based word segmentation, and approaches that are based on co-occurrence statistics. When translating Chinese text into English, Chinese terms should be correctly detected first. As there are no word boundaries in Chinese text, the mining system has to perform segmentation of the Chinese sentences to find the candidate words. The quality of the segmentation greatly influences the quality of the term extraction because incorrect segmentation of the Chinese text may break the correct translation of an English term into two or more words so that the correct word is lost. The translation selection in the third step also suffers from the problem that selection of the most frequent word or the longest word, which is the more popular techniques, does not always produce a correct translation. The term extraction and translation selection problems will be further addressed in subsequent sections."]},{"title":"2.2 Term Extraction","paragraphs":["Term extraction is mainly the task of finding MLUs in the corpus. The concept of MLU is important for applications that exploit language properties, such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), information retrieval and machine translation. An MLU is a group of words that always occur together to convey a specific meaning. For example, compound nouns like Disneyland, phrasal verbs like take into account, adverbial locutions like as soon as possible, and idioms like cutting edge are MLUs. In most cases, it is necessary to extract MLUs rather than individual words from a corpus because the meaning of an MLU is not always the combination of individual words in the MLU. The meaning of the MLU ‘cutting edge’ is not the combination of the meaning of individual words, ‘cutting’ and ‘edge’.","Finding MLUs from the summaries returned by a search engine is important in Web mining based automated translation. If only words are extracted from the summaries, the following process may not be able to find the correct translation since the translation might be a phrase rather than a word. For Chinese text, a word consisting of several characters is not explicitly delimited since Chinese text contains sequences of Chinese characters without spaces between them. Chinese word segmentation is the process of marking word boundaries. The Chinese word segmentation is actually similar to the extraction of MLUs in English documents as the MLU extraction in English documents also needs to mark the lexical boundaries between MLUs. Therefore, term extraction in Chinese documents can be considered as Chinese word segmentation. Many existing systems use lexicon-based or dictionary-based segmentation techniques to determine word boundaries in Chinese text. However, in the case of Web mining for automated translation, as an OOV term is an unknown term to the system, the dictionary-based segmenters usually cannot correctly identify the OOV terms in the sentence. Therefore, the translation of an OOV term cannot be found in   Web-Based Query Translation for English-Chinese CLIR 67  a later process. Some researchers have suggested approaches that are based on co-occurrence statistics model for Chinese word segmentation to avoid this problem [Chen et al. 2000; Maeda et al. 2000; Gao et al. 2001; Pirkola et al. 2001]."]},{"title":"2.2.1 Mutual Information and its Variations","paragraphs":["One of the most popular statistics-based extraction approaches is to use mutual information","[Chien 1997; Silva et al. 1999]. Mutual information is defined as:","(,) (,) 22()() () ()(, ) log logp xy Nf xy","p xpy f xf yMI x y == , (1) The mutual information measurement quantifies the distance between the joint distribution of terms X and Y and the product of their marginal distributions. When using mutual information in Chinese segmentation, x, y are two Chinese characters; f(x), f(y), f(x,y) are the frequencies that x appears, y appears, and x and y appear together, respectively; N is the size of the corpus. A string XY will be judged as a term if the MI value is greater than a predefined threshold.","Chien [Chien 1997] suggests a variation of the mutual information measurement called significance estimation to extract Chinese keywords from corpora. The significance estimation of a Chinese string is defined as: () () () () ()fc SE c f afbfc = +−"]},{"title":",","paragraphs":["(2) where c is a Chinese string with n characters; a and b are the two longest composed substrings of c with length n-1; f is the function to calculate the frequency of a string. Two thresholds are predefined: THF and THSE. This approach identifies a Chinese string as an MLU by the following steps. For the whole string c, if f(c)>THF, c is considered a Chinese term. For the two (n-1)-substrings a and b of c, if SE(c)>=THSE, both a and b are not a Chinese term. If SE(c)<THSE, and f(a)>>f(b) or f(b)>>f(a) , a or b is a Chinese term, respectively. Then, for each a and b, the method is recursively applied to determine whether their substrings are terms."]},{"title":"2.2.2 Local Maxima Based Approaches","paragraphs":["All mutual information based approaches require tuning the thresholds for generic use. Silva and Lopes suggest an approach called Local Maxima to extract MLU from corpora without using any predefined threshold [Silva et al. 1999]. The equation used in Local Maxima is known as SCP and is defined as follows:","2 1 1","111 1 () () ( ... ) ( ... ) n","iinn i fs SCP s f wwfw w −","+− = ="]},{"title":"∑","paragraphs":[", (3)   68 Chengye Lu et al.  where S is an n-gram string and w1,...,wi is the substring of S. A string is judged as an MLU if the SCP value is greater than or equal to the SCP value of all the substrings of S and also greater than or equal to the SCP value of its antecedent and successor. The antecedent of S is an (n-1)-gram substring of S. The successor of S is a string where S is its antecedent.","Although Local Maxima should be a language-independent approach, Jenq-Haur Wang et al. [Cheng et al. 2004] found that it does not work well in Chinese word extraction. They introduced context dependency (CD) used together with the Local Maxima. The new approach is called SCPCD. The rank for a string uses the function: 1 1","111 1 () () () ( ... ) ( ... ) n","iinn i LC s RC s SCPCD s freqw w freqw w −","+− = ="]},{"title":"∑","paragraphs":[", (4) where S is the input string, w1..wi is the substring of S, and LC() and RC() are functions to calculate the number of unique left or right adjacent characters of S.

The main reason is that Chinese terms are required to be extracted from search engine result pages. However, search engine results are usually partial sentences, which makes the traditional Chinese word segmentation hard to apply in this situation.","Current statistics-based approaches still have weaknesses. Web pages returned from a search engine are used for search engine based OOV term translation. In most cases, only a few hundred of the top result snippets on the result pages are used for translation extraction. Consequently, the corpus size for search engine based approaches is quite small. In a small collection, the frequencies of strings very often are too low to be used in the approaches reviewed. In Section 3.2, we will describe our approach to addressing this difficulty in detail."]},{"title":"3. Web-Based Query Translation","paragraphs":["Our approach is based on earlier work by Chen [Chen et al. 2000] and Zhang [Zhang et al. 2004]. Both approaches submit English queries (usually an English term) to a Web search engine and the top returned results (i.e., summaries in Chinese) are segmented into a word list. Each of the words in the list is then assigned a rank calculated from term frequency. The word with the highest rank in the word list is selected as the translation of the English term. However, observations have shown that the correct translation does not always have the highest frequency, even though it very often has a high frequency. The most appropriate translation is not necessarily the term with the highest rank. As in previous work, we adopted the same idea of finding the OOV term’s translation   Web-Based Query Translation for English-Chinese CLIR 69  through a Web search engine. However, our approach differs in term ranking and selection strategy. The aim of our approach is to find the most appropriate translation from the word list regardless of term frequency, which is the basic measurement used in previous work. Our approach combines translation disambiguation technology and Web-based translation extraction technology. Web-based translation extraction usually returns a list of words in a target language. As those words are all extracted from the result snippets returned by the Web search engine, it is reasonable to assume that these words are relevant to the English terms that were submitted to the Web search engine. If we assume all these words are potential translations of the English terms, we can apply the translation disambiguation technique to select the most appropriate word as the translation of the English terms.","Our translation extraction approach contains three major modules: collecting Web document summaries, word extraction, and translation selection. For easier understanding, we will use an example of finding the translation to the term “Stealth Fighter” to demonstrate our approach."]},{"title":"3.1 Collecting Web Document Summaries","paragraphs":["First, we collect the top 100 document summaries returned from Google that contain both English and Chinese words.

Therefore, we need to filter out the documents that are written in English only. The documents that contain both the English terms and Chinese characters are kept. Also, all the html tags are removed, and only the plain text is kept.","Second, from the document summaries returned by the search engine, we collect the sentences in the target language; for example, we can collect three Chinese sentences from the three sample document summaries in Figure 1.

Together with the term extraction approach, we also describe a bottom-up term extraction algorithm that can help to increase the extraction quality."]},{"title":"3.2.1 Frequency Change Measurement","paragraphs":["The approaches mentioned in Section 2 use a top-down approach that starts with examining the whole sentence and then examining substrings of the sentence to extract MLUs until the substring becomes empty. We propose using a bottom-up approach that starts with examining the first character and then examining super strings. Our approach is based on the following observations for small document collections:  Observation 1: In a small collection of Chinese text, such as a collection of Web pages returned from a search engine, the frequencies of the characters in an MLU are similar. This is due to the nature of the sample: in a small collection of text, there are a small number of MLUs and the characters appearing in one MLU may not appear in other MLUs. We also found that some different MLUs with similar meanings very often share similar characters and those characters are unlikely to be used in other unrelated MLUs. For example, 戰機 (Fighter Aircraft) and 戰 鬥機 have the same meaning in Chinese. They share similar Chinese characters. Therefore, although the term frequency is low in a small collection, the individual characters of the term might still be relatively high and also have similar frequencies. The high frequency can help in term extraction.  Observation 2: When a correct Chinese term is extended with an additional character, the frequency of the extended term very often drops significantly. ","According to Observation 1, the frequencies of a term and each character in the term should be similar. We propose to use the root mean square error (RMSE) given in Equation (5) to measure the similarity between the character frequencies.","21 1 () n","in i x xσ ==−"]},{"title":"∑","paragraphs":[". (5) For a given Chinese character sequence with n characters, xi is the frequency of each character in the sequence and x is the average frequency of all the characters in the sequence. Although the frequency of a string is low in small corpora, the frequencies of Chinese characters still have relatively high values. According to Observation 1, if a given sequence is an MLU, the characters in the sequence should have a similar frequency, in other words, σ should be small.   72 Chengye Lu et al.  If the frequencies of all the characters in a Chinese sequence are equal, then σ = 0. Since σ represents the average frequency deviation from the mean of individual characters in the sequence, according to Observation 1, in an MLU, the longer substring of that MLU will have smaller average frequency error.","According to Observation 1, an MLU can be identified by Equation 5. However, as Equation 5 only measures the frequency similarity between individual characters, any character combinations may be identified as MLUs if their frequencies are similar, even when they are not occurring together. To avoid this problem, we introduce sequence frequency f(S) into the formula. With this addition, if the characters are not occurring together, they will not be considered as a sequence, causing f(S) = 0. Thus, any character combination can be identified if it appears as a sequence in the corpus.","Finally, we combine the sequence frequency and the RMSE measurement.

The only difference between the human segmented sentence and the automatic segmented sentence is that “隱形戰機” (Stealth Fighter) is segmented into two words “隱形” (Stealth) and “戰機” (Fighter) by the proposed method. However, this is still an acceptable segmentation because those two words are meaningful words in Chinese and have the same meaning as the combination of the two words."]},{"title":"3.2.2 A Bottom-Up Term Extraction Strategy","paragraphs":["As mentioned in Section 3.1, the top-down strategy is to first check whether the whole sentence is an MLU, then reduce the sentence size by 1 and recursively check sub-sequences.   74 Chengye Lu et al.  It is reported that over 90% of meaningful Chinese terms consist of less than 4 characters [Wu 2004], and, on average, the number of characters in a sentence is much larger than 4. Obviously, a whole sentence is unlikely to be an MLU. Therefore, checking the whole sentence for an MLU is unnecessary. In this section, we describe a bottom-up strategy that extracts terms starting from the first character in the sentence. The basic idea is to determine the boundary of a term in a sentence by examining the frequency change (i.e., the change of the R value defined in Equation (6)) when the size of the term is increasing. If the R value of a term with size n+1 drops compared with its largest sub term with size n, the sub term with size n is extracted as an MLU. For example, in Table 1, there is a big drop between the R value of the third term “靈活度” (2.00) and its super term “靈活度極” (1.07). Therefore, “靈活度” is considered as an MLU. The following algorithm describes the bottom-up term extraction strategy:  Algorithm BUTE(s) Input: s=a1a2....an is a Chinese sentence with n Chinese characters Output: M, a set of MLUs Check each character in s, if it is a stop character such as 是(is, are),的(of) ,了..., remove it from s.

However, when using the bottom-up strategy, some longer terms might be missed when the longer term contains several shorter terms. As shown in our example, “隱形戰機” (Stealth Fighter) consists of two terms “隱形” and “戰機”. When using bottom-up strategy, “隱形戰機” would not be extracted because the composite term has been segmented into two terms. To avoid this problem, we set up a fixed number ω which specifies the maximum number of characters to be examined before reducing the size of the checkable sequence. The modified algorithm is given below:     Web-Based Query Translation for English-Chinese CLIR 75  Algorithm BUTE-M(s) Input: s=a1a2....an is a Chinese sentence with n Chinese characters Output: M, a set of MLUs Check each character in s, if it is a stop character such as 是,了,的..., remove it from s.

Only when ω characters have been examined will the first identified MLU be removed from the next valid checkable sequence, otherwise the current sequence is still being checked for a possible MLU even if it contains an extracted MLU. Therefore, not only will the terms “隱形” and “戰機” be extracted, but also the longer term “隱形戰機” (Stealth Fighter) will be extracted."]},{"title":"3.3 Translation Selection","paragraphs":["At this point, we have a list of translation candidates for the query term. The final step is to find the correct translation from the candidate list.","As we have described in another paper [Lu et al. 2007], the traditional translation selection approaches select the translation based on word frequency and word length [Chen et al. 2003; Zhang et al. 2004]. We have proposed an approach to determining the most appropriate translation from the extracted word list using the documents in the collection dataset regardless of term frequency. Using this approach, even a low-frequency word might be selected. Our experiments in that paper show that in some cases, the most appropriate translation can be a word with low frequency.","First, we retrieve the documents that contain each candidate translation from the collection. Then, we calculate the frequency of each candidate translation in the collection.   76 Chengye Lu et al.  For instance, suppose we have an English query with three terms A,B,C and A1,A2..., B1,B2..., and C1,C2... are the candidate translations for A, B, and C, respectively, and the frequency of A1, A2, ..., B1, B2, ..., C1,C2... in the collection is f(A1), f(A2),... f(B1), f(B2)..., and so on. Second, we retrieve the documents that contain all the possible combinations of the candidate translations and calculate the frequencies. For example, the frequency of combination A1B1C1 is f(A1B1C1), A1B2C1 is f(A1B2C1), and A1B2C3 is f(A1B2C3)... and so on. Finally, we calculate the co-occurrence of all the possible combinations using the following equation:","1 123 123 2 123 ( ... )","(...)log ( ) ( ) ( )...

These approaches rely on predefined thresholds to determine the lexicon boundaries. Those thresholds can only be adjusted experimentally. Therefore, they can be optimized in fixed corpora. However, in OOV term translation, the corpus is dynamic. It is almost impossible to optimize thresholds for general use. As a result, the output quality is not guaranteed.","In addition, Mutual Information based approaches seem unsuitable in Chinese term extraction. As there are no word boundaries between Chinese words, the calculation of MI values in Chinese is based on Chinese characters but not words as in English. On average, a high school graduate in the U.S. has a vocabulary of 27,600 words [Salovesh 1996]. Unless stemming or lemmatizing is used, the number of English word variations in a corpus is much greater. In contrast, the cardinality of the commonly used Chinese character set is under 3000. Due to the small set of Chinese characters, Chinese characters have much higher frequencies than English words. This means that one Chinese character could be used in many MLUs while an English word will have a much lower probability of being used in Multiple MLUs. As a result, an English MLU will have much higher MI value than a Chinese MLU. The subtle difference in MI values between MLUs and non-MLUs in Chinese makes the thresholds hard to tune for general use.","Some filtering techniques are used in SE to minimize the affect of thresholds. In our experiment, there is a 17.2% improvement in translation accuracy. Obviously, the improvement comes from the higher quality of extracted terms.

The translation of “Autumn Struggle”, “Wang Dan”, “Masako” and “Renault” are all 2-character Chinese terms. SCPCD can extract the translation with no problem while SCP always has difficulty with them. As over 90% of the Chinese terms are short terms, this is a problem for SCP in Chinese term extraction. Conversely, SCPCD has difficulty in extracting long terms. Overall, the two Local Maxima based approaches have similar performance. However, since most of the translation of OOV terms are long terms in our experiment, SCP’s performance is a little better than that of SCPCD.

As a result, our approach performs better than Local Maxima based approaches in small corpora.

In analyzing the result summaries, we found that the Chinese character “王” (“Wang”) is a very high-frequency character in the summaries.

By removing all 62 queries, the Mono’s average precision becomes 0.3026 and the IgnoreOOV’s average precision becomes 0.2581 which is about 85.3% of the Mono’s precision. This is a reasonable result and indicates that our disambiguation technique works well to find the correct translations. The reason that we cannot get 100% precision is mainly due to the limited coverage of the dictionary introducing inappropriate translations. By “inappropriate translation”, we mean that the translation is a valid translation in some other context but not in the current query context. In query 24: for “space station, Mir”, 儲存信息暫存器 (Memory Information Register) is the only translation returned from the dictionary. However, it should be translated to 和平號太空站 here. In this case, when a dictionary only returns one translation, it is difficult to tell if it is suitable in the context. As the dictionary only gives one translation, we have no opportunity to correct this translation error using a disambiguation technique. Some translations from the dictionary are inappropriate in some given contexts because the translations are different in different regions. For example, the query “mad cow disease” is translated to 瘋牛病 in the dictionary which is used in mainland China and Hong Kong. However, in the NTCIR collection which is obtained from Taiwan, “mad cow disease” is translated to 狂牛症 or to 狂牛病. We also find the same problem in query 24 “syndrome”. Its translation is 症候群 in Taiwan. The translations given in the dictionary, though, are 併發症狀 and 綜合症狀, which are used in Hong Kong and mainland China.

This indicates that just choosing the longest and highest frequency terms as the translation of OOV terms results in performance that is actually lower than looking them up the dictionary. The performance is quite close to the performance of looking up terms in a dictionary without translation disambiguation technology reported by other researchers. However, some of our results show that this approach is quite useful in looking up proper names. As there is no standard for name translation in Chinese, it is quite common that a person’s name might be translated into different forms with similar pronunciation (akin to phonetic form). Different people may choose different translations due to their custom. As our test collection contains articles from four different news agents, if we only choose one of the translations, we may not retrieve all the relevant documents.","For example, in query 12, the precision of SimpleSelect is 0.3528 and the precision of Mono is 0.0508 which means SimpleSelect’s performance is vastly superior to Mono. This is a notable performance boost. The English OOV term in query 12 is Jennifer Capriati (the name of a tennis player). The human translation is 卡普莉雅蒂. The translations from our approach are 卡普裏亞蒂, 卡普莉雅蒂, 卡普裏雅蒂 and 雅蒂. They are all correct translations. It is clear that we miss many relevant documents when we only use the translation 卡普莉雅蒂. When we take a deep look into the collection, actually three out of four news agents have sports news. Those three news agents use three different translations for Jennifer Capriati. These translations are 卡普莉雅蒂 in the mhn, 凱普莉雅蒂 in the ude and 卡普莉亞蒂 in the udn. Obviously, our translated query takes advantage of adding 雅蒂. Since we use a character-based index for our collection, the documents containing 雅蒂 will include the documents that contain both 卡普莉雅蒂 and 凱普莉雅蒂. Therefore, although we cannot find the correct translation 凱普莉雅蒂, we can still retrieve the documents that contain 凱普 莉雅蒂 by using 雅蒂. Although using part of the translation might improve the retrieval performance, it also   84 Chengye Lu et al.  introduces noise information and the noise information may make it harder for the search engine to find the relevant documents. For example, America Online is translated as 美國線上 in Taiwan but 美國在線 in mainland China. If we only choose 美國 (American) as the translation, we lose the information of the term.

There are 71 OOV terms over 100 queries. 50 of the OOV terms’ translations can be found using our proposed approach. And 43 of the translations are equivalent to the human translation. It is about 70% in precision.","There are many reasons for not being able to get 100% precision. The first reason is the different translation customs that we described earlier. Since we cannot control from where the Web search engine gets the documents and to whom the Web search engine returns documents, we cannot guarantee the translation will be suitable for the collection. For example, we may be able to find the translation for an OOV term from the Internet, but this translation may be used only in Hong Kong and is not suitable for a collection from Taiwan. The translation of the term “Kursk” is a good example. Our Web translation extraction method only returns one translation 庫爾斯克 as the translation of “Kursk”. This result shows that most of the documents over the Internet use 庫爾斯克 as the translation of “Kursk”. However, the NTCIR5 collection uses 科斯克 as its translation. This kind of inappropriate translation is very hard to avoid even by human interpreters. Another good example is the translation of “National Council of Timorese Resistance”. We believe 帝汶抵抗全國委員會 (from our Web translation extraction system) and 東帝汶人抗爭國家委員會 (from NTCIR human translation) are both correct. The difference of the two translations comes from the different customs of translation. However, when using the two translations as two queries, our IR system cannot retrieve any documents. This means that the documents in the NTCIR5   Web-Based Query Translation for English-Chinese CLIR 85  collection use a different translation for “National Council of Timorese Resistance”. Actually the translation in the NTCIR5 collection is: 東帝汶全國反抗會議.","Another reason that we cannot get 100% precision is that our Web translation extraction system does not consider the query context. As we described before, we only put the OOV terms into a Web search engine. This may lead to a situation where we get a translation suitable for other context. For instance, in query 36, we are looking for some articles about the use of a robot for remote operation in a medical context. “Remote operation” is an OOV term in this query. Our Web translation extraction method returns the term 遠程操作服務 as its translation. Disregarding the query context, this is a correct translation. However, this translation is only correct when it is used in computer science. If we do not consider the query context, 27 of the translations are correct with about 87% precision. This result is close to the disambiguated queries of dictionary translations which is 85%."]},{"title":"6. Conclusion and Future Work","paragraphs":["In this paper, first, we reviewed some existing popular OOV translation approaches. Then, we described an approach to tackling the OOV problem in English-Chinese information retrieval. As the first step of this approach, we proposed a bottom-up term extraction approach suitable for small corpora for generating candidate translations for query OOV terms. This method introduces a new measurement of a Chinese string based on frequency and RMSE, together with a Chinese MLU extraction process based on the change to a new string measurement that does not rely on any predefined thresholds. The method considers a Chinese string as a term based on the change of R’s value when the size of the string increases rather than based on the absolute value of R. Our experiments show that this approach is effective for translation extraction of unknown query terms.","We also proposed a simple translation selection approach to improve translation accuracy. Our experimental results show that OOV terms can significantly affect the performance of CLIR systems. Using the translation extraction method proposed in this paper, the overall performance can be boosted by almost 174% relative to the case of not processing OOV terms. With our proposed translation selection approach, the accuracy of OOV term translation can be improved by up to 85%. The overall performance shows about 200% improvement relative to the case of not processing OOV terms. Also, it is about 120% relative to our implementation of previous approaches.","Although our proposed approach shows impressive accuracy for OOV term translation, there is still some work to be done in the future. First, our experiments were conducted using a relatively small scale test set from NTCIR5 and NTCIR6 along with CLIR task queries which only have 108 OOV terms. It is necessary to test our approach to a larger-scale test set such as a test set that has over 1000 OOV terms. Second, inappropriate translation is still a problem in   86 Chengye Lu et al.  query translation. The main reasons include the limited size of the dictionary, different customs of translation, and ignoring query context. Some work should be done to minimize these problems. Our experiments provide hints for some possible approaches. If we have a large amount of resources, we may be able to find all the possible translations. For translation selection, if some of the translations hit a similar number of documents, we may keep all of them as correct translations. It may be useful to include more results from the Google search for instance or combining different translation result together. We will validate these ideas in the future."]},{"title":"REFERENCES","paragraphs":["\"The List of common use Chinese Characters\", Ministry of Education of the People's Republic","of China.","Chen, A. and F.
