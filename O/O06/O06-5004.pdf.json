In order to test this hypothesis, we examine the corpora of State of the Union Addresses from 1945 to 2006.

Introduction","paragraphs":["In the latter half of the twentieth century, American presidents have had the enviable task of shaping the way Americans think about themselves by delivering a State of the Union address near the beginning of each calendar year. This speech is broadcast live across the nation on major television and radio channels. In the address, the president emphasizes his accomplishments to date and sets out a new agenda for the year. Topics touched upon may include both foreign and domestic policy, and run the gamut from justification for war to a  ∗ Graduate Institute of Linguistics & Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures, National Taiwan University, 1 Roosevelt Road, Section 4, Taipei 106, Taiwan Phone: +886-2-2366-1381 ext. 307 Fax: +886-2-2363-5358 E-mail: kathleenahrens@yahoo.com   378 Kathleen Ahrens  fervent plea to pass an education bill. The complete text of the address appears the following day in major newspapers and in on-line news resources.","Thus, these addresses constitute a narrow, but influential media genre, since subsequent discourse in the news media often reports on the proposals put forth by the president in his own terminology [Barrett 2004]. This terminology reflects the ideology of the ruling political party, and it is this ideology that is used to exercise power “through the manufacture of consent” [Fairclough 2001]. Moreover, as Van Dijk [1993] notes, “More control over more properties of text and context, involving more people, is thus generally (though not always) associated with more influence, and hence with hegemony” (p. 257). Thus, a linguistic analysis of presidential speeches has the potential to shed light on how the president views (and wants the country to view) economic, political, and social issues of the day.","Recent advances in corpus linguistics have facilitated the collection and analysis of presidential speeches. Kowal et al. [1997], for example, created a specially marked-up corpus of Inaugural Addresses by hand in order to look at the interaction between literacy and orality in presidential speeches, while Charteris-Black [2004, 2005], who looked only at the text, was able to examine the use of metaphor as well as rhetorical devices used by U.S. presidents based on the corpora of U.S. presidential speeches found on-line.","Lim [2002] also used the corpora of U.S. inaugural addresses, as well as the annual messages (State of the Union addresses), in order to identify rhetorical change in presidential speeches. He argued that presidential speeches have become more anti-intellectual, as well as more abstract, democratic, assertive, and conversational, according to changes that can be seen in the categories of words that occur in speeches over time. He also found that words related to cognitive processes and states have decreased since Hoover, while interjections have increased, indicating a decline in the difficulty of presidential rhetoric. In addition, words having to do with ‘kinship’, which Lim suggests reflects democratic rhetoric, have increased substantially since Franklin Roosevelt, as have words relating to ‘children’ and ‘youth’ since Carter. While Lim’s paper suggests that frequency of lexical use is a way of judging what is important to the president and to the public, to date there has been no systematic analysis of changes in lexical use within the scope of presidential speeches. Thus, it is the goal of this paper to demonstrate that by combining presidential speeches into a corpus, subtle changes in language use over time can be determined by examining the frequency of occurrence of key words as well as their associated collocations [Stubbs 1996].","In order to examine this issue, we will explore language use pertaining to ‘people’ in all of the State of the Union addresses (SUO corpus) from 1945 to 2006 by analyzing the tokens:   Using a Small Corpus to Test Linguistic Hypotheses: 379 Evaluating ‘People’ in the State of the Union Addresses  humankind, mankind, man, men, woman, women, mother, father and parent.1","We will demonstrate that while there has clearly been shift away from using man, men, and mankind to refer to all human beings, other aspects of gender, such as parenthood, are still stereotyped by American presidents."]},{"title":"2. Methodology for Corpus Creation","paragraphs":["The State of the Union (SOU) corpus was downloaded one speech at a time from the C-Span website (c-span.org). All State of the Union speeches from 1945-2006 (excluding Nixon’s five SOU speeches from 1970-1974) were directly downloaded to text files (Table 1). Nixon’s speeches were printed out from Adobe files, manually typed into a document file, and then saved to a text file. These five files were then checked by two additional readers for accuracy and any errors or omissions were corrected. Each file was then imported into Microsoft Word and the president’s words in the speech were highlighted and counted with the word-count feature. In most cases, this meant that the heading was omitted (i.e. “President Harry S. Truman’s Address Before a Joint Session of Congress”). In other cases, information about where and when the speech was given, or who introduced the President also had to be omitted from the word count. In the case of Bush Jr., indications of “(Applause.)” had to be deleted as well.2","In short, every effort was made to include the words used by the president himself in the word count.3","In addition, it is important to note that these speeches were given orally from a prepared text. The version that being examined here is the version that was provided for the written, historical record and the content may therefore vary slightly from the actual words that the president spoke.  1 1945 was chosen as the start date because C-span starts their database with Truman’s 1945 address to Congress. 1945 is also significant because the Second World War came to a close in that year. 1947 was also considered as a starting date, since that was the first year the SOU address was broadcast on television. However, since all the other presidents have their complete SOU corpus included in the study (complete to date for Bush Jr.), 1945 was selected as the starting year so that Truman’s corpus would also be complete. 2 “Bush Sr.” refers to George H. W. Bush, and “Bush Jr.” refers for George W. Bush, following the usage in Charteris-Black [2005]. 3 It is important to note that Microsoft Word counts the dash punctuation mark as one word when it is written as two short hyphens close together with a space on either side or as one short hyphen with a space on either side (i.e. as “ -- ” or as “ - ”). When it is written as a long, unbroken line, as in “—” the program does not count it as a word. In addition, in some speeches, only a short hyphen is used without a space on either side, which the word count program then interprets as a hyphenated word. Ideally, for the most precise word count possible, each speech should be re-edited for uniformity among the various types of dash marks used. However, such editing carries the risk of altering the intent of the original and was not carried out for this study.   380 Kathleen Ahrens ","The total and average word counts for each president are given in Table 1 for the Democratic and Republican presidents. Since some presidents gave more than one SOU address in a given year (i.e. Bush gave two addresses in 2001, one on 2/27 and one on 9/20), there are a total of 65 speeches in this corpora.4",""]},{"title":"Table 1.

Socio-Cultural Background","paragraphs":["This paper hypothesizes that the language used by politicians became more inclusive from the middle of the 20th","century to the beginning of the 21st","century. In particular, social gains from the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibited employment discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or gender, should become apparent.6","However, many doors to women were still closed, even after this law went into effect. For example, the state law of Virginia prohibited women from being admitted to the College of Arts and Sciences of the University of Virginia as late as 1970.7","Due to increasing demand for equal access to education at all levels, Title IX was passed, and signed into law in 1972 by Nixon. Title IX prohibits institutions that receive federal funding from practicing gender discrimination in educational programs or activities. It took two years for regulations to be drawn up for Title IX, and in 1974 they were published, with Ford signing them into law in 1975. Thus, there is a societal and legislative shift during the decade from 1964-1974. Since the corpus under consideration here identifies all uses by date and speaker, it is possible to contrast critical legislative and legal events with the occurrence of relevant terms or changing use of terms in the presidential lexicon and ask the question: How soon after this legislation was discriminatory language use dropped from presidential parlance?","In particular, we hypothesize that there should be a marked decrease in the use of mankind to refer to all humankind, as well as a decline in the use of man to refer to all people. In addition, references to women should go beyond motherhood and include the contributions that women make to society. Lastly, use of mother(s) and father(s) should demonstrate the variety of roles that each parent plays in the family and society. These changes would reflect the advances American women have made over the past half a century and would indicate that women’s contributions are being recognized at the highest levels of power in the government."]},{"title":"4.

In addition, the fact that Bush Jr. never uses man to refer to ‘human being’ contrasts with his usage of mankind as discussed above, and distinguishes himself from the rhetoric of Bush Sr. and Reagan who use both man and mankind to refer to men and women.","Thus, from the data so far, results are mixed.

Bush Sr. also talks about how the world is growing “stronger, more united, more attractive to men on both sides of the Iron Curtain...” These two usages are the only instances of men being used to stand for both men and women in Bush Sr.’s corpora; however, he also uses man to stand for all humans three times as well. Although this could be considered a continued insensitivity to issues related to language and gender; from another point of view, his percentage of usage of the gender-encompassing reading is in sharp contrast to the percentage of usage to presidents prior to 1970. In fact, the overall percentage of usage of man or men to stand for all humans showed a large decrease in percentage of usage post-1970 as compared with the period prior to 1970.","Bush Jr.’s use of men deserves special note because he uses it to refer to ‘evil-doers,’ as in example (12). ","(12) This conviction leads us into the world to help the afflicted, and defend the peace, and confound the designs of evil men. [Bush 2003]  10 Truman did refer to men and women who have suffered in the Second World War in his first SOU address when he said, “Our debt to the heroic men and valiant women in the service of our country...”   388 Kathleen Ahrens  Although Bush Jr. is careful to talk about America’s servicemen and servicewomen, he terms propagators of acts of terror as ‘men’ and does not use gender-inclusive language that can be found elsewhere in his speeches. Although we sincerely hope that it is the case that terrorist masterminds will not in the future include women among their ranks, it is interesting to compare Bush’s language with that of Eisenhower, Truman, Kennedy, and Johnson, as it is apparent in their speeches that they did not foresee women joining the ranks of lawyers, politicians and soldiers.11","","The data used to provide Figure 5 also shows that the use of the word men occurs alone 128 times in the total corpus (referring to both human beings and soldiers, lawyers, politicians, etc.) Women by contrast, occurs alone only 32 times (i.e. when it does not co-occur with men). Comparisons of woman and man (23 tokens versus 137 tokens) and she and he (68 tokens versus 294 tokens) substantiate this approximately five to one ratio between male terms and female terms.","In addition, when women are mentioned, they are not mentioned as politicians or business leaders or doctors. Truman talks about working women (1 time), Carter emphasizes legal rights for women (3 times), Reagan talks about legal and economic equity for women (6 times), and women as mothers (1 time) and workers (1 time). Bush Sr. talks about pregnant women and working women (1 time each). Clinton talks about taking better care of women and children (7 times) and equity for working women (2 times). Bush Jr. talks about rights for women at home and abroad (6 times), and protecting women and children from terrorist acts (2 times) and respecting women (1 time). In short, women are talked about much less frequently than men, even in recent years, and when they are talked about they are not thanked for their contributions to the society as the Founding Fathers, senators, lawyers, and soldiers are (although later presidents (Reagan and on) do thank the men and women serving in the armed forces). Women as a group are not held up for emulation, they are only mentioned in reference to having their economic and political lot improved.","This finding can be corroborated by contrasting modification of specific men and women. Eight specific men are modified by ‘good’ (twice), ‘great’ (once), ‘good and honest’ (once), ‘prudent’ (once), ‘evil’ (once, for Saddam Hussein), ‘reasonable’ (once), ‘very wise’ (once), and ‘brave young’ (once). Women, when occurring alone, are modified as follows: Tired, decent cleaning woman (once), young woman (once), battered women (once), elderly women (once), and pregnant women (three times). Thus, it seems while there has been advances in recognizing the fact that women serve alongside men in the Armed Forces, and that ‘man’ is not a gender-inclusive term, still women face an uphill battle to have their deeds and accomplishments recognized – to be held up as the standard bearer for others to follow.  11 Note, for example, the recent news about female suicide bombers in the fall of 2005.   Using a Small Corpus to Test Linguistic Hypotheses: 389 Evaluating ‘People’ in the State of the Union Addresses ","Lastly, the role of motherhood has traditionally been the contribution that women were supposed to play to society. Yet Figures 7 and 8 show that the presidents before Reagan rarely discussed mother(s) or parent(s). When presidents talk about father(s) it is to mention the Founding Fathers or fathers who went away to war (in terms of the children who are left without a father)."]},{"title":"0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100","paragraphs":["Tr","uman Eisenhow er Kenn edy John son","Nixon Ford Carter Reaga n Bush Sr. Clinton Bush Jr."]},{"title":"Mother(s) Father(s) Parent(s) Figure 7.

While the sample size is admittedly small, it demonstrates that the fathers are still primarily considered the providers and the mothers are primarily nurturers.

This, in turn, will allow corresponding legislative and social events to be contrasted with the linguistic terminology used by politicians.","In this paper, we hypothesized that the language used by politicians would become more inclusive from 1945 to 2006. In some aspects, it certainly did. There was a marked decline in the use of man to refer to all people, with a similar decrease in the term mankind to refer to all humankind, although its usage still occurs even today. However, references to women did not emphasize the contributions that women have made to society. In the eyes of the presidents, they are still struggling for equal pay and equal rights.
