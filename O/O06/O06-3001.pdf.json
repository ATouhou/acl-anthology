[Chomsky 1965] defined the function of strict subcategorization features as appointing a set of constraints that dominate the selection of verbs and other arguments in deep structure. Subcategorization of verbs, as well as categorization of all words in a language, is often implemented by means of functional distributions, which constitute different environments or distributional patterns accessible for a verb or word. Such a distribution or environment is called a subcategorization frame (SCF), and is usually combined with both syntactic and semantic information. Therefore, verb subcategorization involves much more information than verb classification, which usually only classifies verbs into groups. SCFs, on the other hand,  1 This research is sponsored by the Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 60373101 and 60375019), and High-Tech Research and Development Program (Grant No. 2002AA117010-09). * School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150001, China E-mail: {hxw, tjzhao}@mtlab.hit.edu.cn   102 Xiwu Han and Tiejun Zhao specify the category of the main anchor (verb hereby), the number of arguments, each argument's category and position with respect to the anchor, and other information, such as feature equations or node expansions2",".","Recently, large subcategorized verbal lexicons have been shown to be crucially important for many tasks in natural language processing, such as probabilistic parsing [Korhonen 2001] and verb classifications [Schulte im Walde 2002; Korhonen 2003]. Since Brent reported his findings [Brent 1993], a considerable amount of research has focused on large-scale automatic acquisition of subcategorization frames and achieved some success, not only in English but also in many other languages, including German [Schulte im Walde 2002], Spanish [Chrupala 2003], Czech [Sarkar and Zeman 2000], Portuguese [Gamallo et al. 2002], and Chinese [Han et al. 2004ab]. However, the relevant results are still far from sufficiently accurate and indicate that most of the existing methods are not yet practical.","This is especially true for the Chinese subcategorization acquisition system, which has achieved a precision rate of 60.6%±2.39% and a recall rate of 51.3%±2.45% [Han et al. 2004b]. Detailed analysis of the system and acquisition results shows that besides the imperfect hypothesis generator, there are sources of both linguistic and statistical errors. Linguistic errors mainly result from the Zipfian distributions of syntactic patterns, and statistical errors derive mostly from the inappropriate assumption of independence among SCFs that verbs enter. Hence, the statistical filter of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) performs badly with respect to lower-frequency SCF hypotheses. In this paper, the independence assumption is eliminated on the basis of diathesis alternations reported by [Han 2004], and a two-fold filtering method is introduced, which first filters the hypotheses by means of a comparatively higher threshold and secondly, filters the left-out ones by means of a much lower threshold with diathesis alternatives of those accepted SCFs seeded as heuristic information.","Experimental evaluation of the acquisition results of 48 Chinese verbs showed that the acquisition performance was improved remarkably, with the precision rate increased to 76.94% and the recall rate to 83.83%, making the acquired lexicon much more practical for further manual proofreading and other NLP uses. Although cross-lingual comparison may lack concrete significance, at the present time, these figures represent the best overall performance achieved in both Chinese subcategorization acquisition and in similar researches focusing on other languages.","Section 2 introduces and analyzes the present Chinese SCF acquisition system and, in particular, its MLE filter.

Subcategorization Acquisition and MLE Filtering","paragraphs":["In the system proposed by [Han et al. 2004b], there are, generally, 4 steps in the auto-acquisition process of Chinese subcategorization. First, the corpus is processed with a cascaded HMM parser; second, all possible local patterns for verbs are abstracted; third, the verb patterns are classified into SCF hypotheses according to the predefined set; fourth, the hypotheses are checked statistically with an MLE filter. The actual application program consists of 6 parts, described in the following paragraphs.","a. Segmenting and tagging: The raw corpus is segmented into words and tagged with POS’s by the comprehensive segmenting and tagging processor developed by MTLAB of the Computer Department in the Harbin Institute of Technology. The advantage of the POS definition is that it describes some subsets of nouns and verbs in Chinese.","b. Parsing: The tagged sentences are parsed with a cascaded HMM parser3",", developed by MTLAB of HIT, but only intermediate portion of the parsing results is used, which means that only the syntactic skeletons make difference and, thus, that the negative effects of some errors in the deep structures can be avoided. The training set of the parser consists of 20,000 sentences from the Chinese Tree Bank4","[Zhao 2002].","c. Error-driven correction: Some key errors occurring in the former two parts are corrected according to manually obtained error-driven rules, which generally concern words or POS in the corpus.","d. Pattern abstraction: Verbs with the largest governing ranges are regarded as predicates; then, local patterns, previous phrases and syntactic tags are abstracted and generalized as argument types (see Table 1), and isolated parts are combined, generalized or omitted according to basic phrase rules presented in [Zhao 2002].","e. Hypothesis generation: Based on linguistic restraining rules e.g., no more than two nominal phrases (NP) may occur in a series and no more than three in one pattern; and no positional phrase (PP), temporal complement (TP) or quantifier complement (MP) may occur with a nominal phrase before any predicate [Han et al. 2004a] (see also Table 2), the patterns are coordinated and classified into the predefined SCF groups.   3 When evaluated on an auto-tagged open corpus, the parser’s phrase precision rate was 62.3%, and the phrase recall rate was 60.9% [Meng 2003]. 4 A sample of the tree bank or relevant introduction could be found at http://mtlab.hit.edu.cn.   104 Xiwu Han and Tiejun Zhao"]},{"title":"Table 1.

Hypothesis filtering: According to the statistical reliability of each type of SCF hypothesis and the linguistic principle that arguments occur more frequently with predicates than adjuncts do, the hypotheses are filtered by means of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), which has been shown to work better than other methods, such as the binomial hypothesis test (BHT), log likelihood ratio (LLR), and T-test [Korhonen 2001; Han et al. 2004b].

Since the governing range of “证明” is larger than that of the verb “zhui1wen4 追问” (ask), the other verb in this sentence, the program abstracts its local pattern BVP[vg LE] and previous phrase BNP, generalizes BNP and NDE as NP, combines the second NP with the isolated part “在/p” in PP, and returns (d). Then, the hypothesis generator returns (e) as the possible SCF in which the verb may occur. Actually, in the corpus, 621 hypothesis tokens are generated, and among them, 92 ones are of same argument structures with (e); and thus, (e) can pass the MLE hypothesis test, so we obtain one SCF for “zheng4ming2 证明” as (f).","Due to noises that accumulate during segmenting, tagging, and parsing of the corpus, even though error-driven correction is implemented, the hypothesis generator does not perform as efficiently as hoped. Experimental results show that its imperfect performance accounts for about 12% of the falsely accepted SCFs and 15% of the unrecalled ones. However, detailed analysis of a considerable amount of data indicates that a larger source of  5 {01000} projects to the Chinese syntactic morphemes {“zhe0 着”, “le0 了”, “guo4 过”, “mei2 没”, “bu4 不”}, where 1 means that the SCF may occur with the respective morpheme, while 0 means that it may not [Han et al. 2004a]. 6 Note that not all of the errors in this example have been corrected, but this does not affect further procession. Also, NDE refers to phrases ending with “de4 的”, BVP to basic verbal phrases [Zhao 2002], and LE to the Chinese syntactic morpheme “le0 了” [Han et al. 2004a].   106 Xiwu Han and Tiejun Zhao errors is the MLE filter.","The MLE method is closely related to the general distributional situation of the corpus. First, from the applied corpus a training set is drawn randomly; it must be large enough to ensure a similar SCF frequency distribution. Then, the frequency of a subcategorization frame scfi occurring with a verb v is recorded and used to estimate the possible probability p(scfi |v). Thirdly, an empirical threshold is determined, which ensures that a maximum value of the F measure will result for the training set. Finally, the threshold is used to filter out those SCF hypotheses with lower frequencies from the total set. Therefore, the statistical foundation of this filtering method is the assumption of independence among the SCFs that a verb enters, which can be probabilistically expressed in two formulas as follows: ,, ,( | ,)0ijiji jpscfscfv∀ ∀≠ =, (1) 1 (|)1 n i i pscf v = ="]},{"title":"∑","paragraphs":[".

Diathesis Alternations","paragraphs":["Much linguistic research focusing on child language acquisition has revealed that many children are able to create grammatical sentences previously unseen by them according to what they have learned, which implies that the widely-used independence assumption in the field of NLP may not be very appropriate, at least for syntactic patterns. If this assumption is removed, a possible heuristic could be the information of diathesis alternations, which is also another convincing anti-proof. Diathesis alternations are generally regarded as alternative ways, in which verbs express their arguments. Examples are as follows:  a. He broke the glass. b. The glass broke. c. Ta1 chi1 le0 pin2guo3. (他 吃 了 苹果。)","d. Ta1 ba3 pin2guo3 chi1 le07",". (他 把 苹果 吃 了。)   7 Sentences c and d generally mean He ate an apple.   Two-Fold Filtering for Chinese Subcategorization Acquisition with 107 Diathesis Alternations Used as Heuristic Information Here, the English verb break takes the causative-inchoative alternation as shown in sentences a and b, while sentences c and d indicate that the Chinese verb chi1 (吃, eat) may enter the ba-object-raising alternation where the object is shifted forward by the syntactic morpheme ba3 (把) to the location between the subject and the predicate, as illustrated in Figure 1.

Otherwise, if there are diathesis alternations among some of the SCFs that a verb enters, then formulas (1) and (2) must be modified as illustrated in formulas (3) and (4).

Two-Fold Filtering Method","paragraphs":["We can see from Section 3 that Han’s diathesis alternations may well play a useful role as heuristic information for Chinese subcategorization acquisition. However, determining where and how to seed the heuristic remains difficult. [Korhonen 1998] applied diathesis alternations in Briscoe and Carroll’s system to improve the performance of their BHT filter. Although the precision rate increased from 61.22% to 69.42% and the recall rate from 44.70% to 50.81%, the results were still not very accurate for possible practical NLP uses. Korhonen generated her one-way diathesis alternations from the ANLT dictionary, calculated the alternating   Two-Fold Filtering for Chinese Subcategorization Acquisition with 109 Diathesis Alternations Used as Heuristic Information probability p(scfj|scfi) according to the number of common verbs that took the alternation (scfi →scfj), and used formulas (7) and (8), where w is an empirical weight, to revise the observed p(scfi|v): if p(scfi|scfj, v) > 0, p(scfi|v) = p(scfi|v) – w(p(scfi|v)p(scfj| scfi)); (7) ","if p(scfi|v) > 0 and p(scfj|v) = 0, p(scfi|v) = p(scfi|v) + w(p(scfi|v)p(scfj|scfi)). (8)9"," Following the revision, a BHT filter with a confidence rate of 95% was used to check the SCF hypotheses.","This method removes the assumption of independence among SCF types but establishes another assumption of independence between p(scfj|scfi) and certain verbs, which means that all verbs take each diathesis alternation with the same probability. Nevertheless, linguistic knowledge tells us that verbs often enter different diathesis alternations and can be classified accordingly. Consider the following examples:  e. He broke the glass. / The glass broke. f. The police dispersed the crowd. / The crowd dispersed. g. Mum cut the bread. / *The bread cut. h. Ta1 chi1 le0 pin2guo3.(他吃了苹果。) / Ta1 ba3 pin2guo3 chi1 le0.(他把苹果吃了。) i. Ta1 xie3 le0 ben3 shu1.(她写了本书。)10","/ *Ta1 ba3 shu1 xie3 le0.(她把书写了。)  Both of the English verbs “break” and “disperse” can take the causative-inchoative alternation and, hence, may be classified together, while the verb “cut” does not take this alternation. Also, the Chinese verb “chi1 吃” can take the ba-object-raising alternation, while the verb “xie3 写”(write) cannot. Therefore, this newly established assumption does not hold either, and the probabilistic sum of p(scfi|v) need not and cannot be normalized.","For dealing with this problem, our basic principle is that enough exploitation should be made on the observable data, yet no more than what can be observed. If both sentences in e, f or h are observed in the corpus, and if the SCF type of the first one has a high enough frequency to pass the MLE testing, while that of the second type does not, then both SCF  9 For the sake of consistency in this paper and for the convenience to understand, the formats of","formulas here are different from those of [Korhonen 1998], but they are actually the same. 10 The Chinese sentence means She wrote a book.   110 Xiwu Han and Tiejun Zhao types should be taken into consideration. Otherwise, the one with lower frequency might be falsely rejected. On the other hand, if the first sentence in i or g has a satisfactory SCF type frequency, while the SCF type of the second sentence does not occur in the input corpus, then the SCF type of the sentence may well be rejected.","Based on the above methodology, we formed our two-fold filtering method, which is, in fact, derived from the simple MLE filter and based on formulas (5) and (6). In our method, two filters are employed. First, a common MLE filter is used, except that it employs a threshold θ1 that is much higher than usual, and those SCF hypotheses that satisfy the requirement are accepted. Then, all of the rest hypotheses are checked by another MLE filter that is seeded with diathesis alternations as heuristic information and equipped with a much lower threshold θ2. Any hypothesis scfi left out by the first filter will be accepted if its probability exceeds θ2, which means that p(scfi|scfj, v) > 0, and if it is an alternative of any SCF type accepted by the first filter, which means that the verb v almost surely enters scfj. The algorithm can be briefly expressed as shown in Table 5."]},{"title":"Table 5. Two-fold filtering algorithm","paragraphs":["For hypotheses of a given verb v, if p(scfi|v) > θ1, scfi is accepted; else if p(scfi|v) > θ2, p(scfi|scfj, v) > 0, and p(scfj|v) > θ1, scfi is accepted for v."]},{"title":"5.

Thirty of them were of multiple syntactic patterns, while the rest were syntactically simple.","In the experiment, SCF hypotheses for the 48 verbs were generated from a corpus of the People’s Daily from January to June of 1998 as described in Section 2. The resulting minimum number of SCF tokens for a verb was 86, and the maximum was 3200. The thresholds were experientially set as follows: θ1= 0.017, which is much larger than the 0.008 threshold used by [Han et al. 2004b]; θ2= 0.0004, which generally means a hypothesis would have a chance to check its diathesis alternations if it occurs even just one time in a token set no larger than 2,500.
