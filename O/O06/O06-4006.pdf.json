Introduction","paragraphs":["Machine translation (MT) evaluation activities have accompanied MT research and system development. The ALPAC report [ALPAC 1966], which has greatly influenced machine translation research activities, is the first historical MT evaluation activity. With new developments in natural language processing technology coming in the 1990s, the black-box evaluation has been instantiated by the methodology of DARPA [Doyon et al. 1998], which measures fluency, accuracy, and informativeness on a 5-point scale. The ISLE Project takes an approach that focuses on how an MT system serves the follow-on human processing rather than on what it is unlikely to do well [ISLE 2000].","Since manual evaluation is labor-intensive and time-consuming, many researchers are making efforts towards reliable automatic MT evaluation methods. A problem is that the methods cannot be characterized by precision and recall as in other natural language  ∗ Southeast University, Nanjing, China 210096 Tel: +86-512-68880263 E-mail: jyao@suda.edu.cn + School of Computer Science and Technology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China, 2150006 ∗∗ South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510641, China   298 Jianmin Yao et al. processing activities such as POS tagging or phrase identification. A new quality system is necessary.","This paper aims for performance analysis and better illustration of machine translation evaluation, which can help developers know about the improvement in the quality of their system, and help users easily distinguish between MT systems. Section 2 reviews related research in the MT field and its evaluation. Section 3 studies the metrics and experiments for comparison of MT evaluation methods. Section 4 proposes an algorithm for visualizing the MT system quality, and draws a dendrogram for the systems by clustering. A conclusion is given in the last section."]},{"title":"2. Related Work","paragraphs":["MT evaluation had not been a very powerful aid in machine translation research until automatic evaluation methods were broadly studied. Now, different heuristics are employed for automatic MT evaluation. This section gives a brief review of the main automatic MT evaluation methods and studies on the performance of these methods."]},{"title":"2.1 Automatic Evaluation Methods","paragraphs":["Some automatic methods focus on specific syntactic features for translation evaluation. [Jones and Galliers 1993] utilizes linguistic information such as the balance of parse trees, N-grams, semantic co-occurrence, and other information as indicators of translation quality. A balanced tree was a negative indicator of Englishness, probably because English is right-branching. Other factors are also utilized in translation evaluation for their indication of the language quality. [Brew and Thompson. 1994], whose criteria involve word frequency, POS tagging distribution and other text features, compares human rankings and automatic measures to decide the translation quality. These linguistic features are extracted as a reflection of the overall translation quality.","Another type of evaluation method involves comparison of the translation result with human translations. [Keiji et al. 2001] evaluates the translation output by measuring the similarity between the translation output and translation answer candidates from a parallel corpus. [Yasuhiro et al. 2001] uses multiple edit distances to automatically rank machine translation output by translation examples. While the IBM BLEU method [Papineni et al. 2001] and the NIST MT evaluation [NIST 2002] compare MT output with expert reference translations in terms of the statistics of word N-grams. [Melamed et al. 2003] adopts the maximum matching size of the translation and the reference as the similarity measure for the score. [Niben and Och 2000] scores a sentence on the basis of scores of translations in a database with the smallest edit distance. [Yokoyama et al. 1999] proposes a two-way MT based evaluation method, which compares output Japanese sentences with the original   Performance Analysis and Visualization of Machine Translation Evaluation 299 Japanese sentence for word identification, the correctness of the modification, the syntactic dependency and the parataxis.","Another path of MT evaluation is based on test suites. A weighted average of the scores for separate grammatical points is taken as the score of the system. The typological test covers vocabulary size, lexical capacity, phrase, syntactic correctness, etc. [Yu 1993] designs a test suite consisting of sentences with various test points. [Guessoum and Zantout 2001] proposes a semi-automatic evaluation method of the grammatical coverage machine translation systems via a database of unfolded grammatical structures. [Koh et al. 2001] describes their test suite constructed on the basis of fine-grained classification of linguistic phenomena."]},{"title":"2.2 Performance of an Automatic Evaluation Method","paragraphs":["The ISLE has made some efforts to develop a specification of performance for the MT evaluation methods [ISLE 2000]. A list of the desiderata demands that at least the measure: 1) must be easy to define, clear, and intuitive; 2) must correlate well with human judgments under all conditions, genres, domains, etc.; 3) must be ‘tight’, exhibiting as little variance as possible across evaluators, or for equivalent inputs; 4) must be cheap to prepare; 5) must be cheap to apply; 7) should be automated, if possible. These criteria give a broad coverage of the characteristics of the evaluation methods, but further work is needed to measure them in a consistent and objective way.","[Popescu-Belis 1999] argues that the MT evaluation metrics should have its upper limit, lower limit, and should be monotonic in quality measure. The above measures are qualitative attributives of MT evaluation methods. If it can further be automated, it will help the researchers find a much easier and consistent way to compare different systems.","Only recently, researchers began quantitative studies. Some recent works include [Forner and White 2001] on the correlation between intelligibility and fidelity and noun compound translation. [Papineni et al. 2001] and [Melamed et al. 2003] study the correlation between human scoring and automatic evaluation results. After DARPA took the BLEU method as the evaluation method for MT systems, the correlation between human and machine translation evaluation has become a standard criterion of MT quality scoring, though many researchers are arguing against its efficacy.","On the whole, methodological study of automatic evaluation methods has just started and needs to be further deepened. This paper is an attempt to refine the correlation measures and justify their usage in machine translation evaluation. The following section aims for a proposal of some criteria of the performance of MT evaluation measures, which will give linguists a better understanding of the MT evaluation task and its results.   300 Jianmin Yao et al."]},{"title":"3.

For a test with higher discriminability, a better system should be scored higher, and vice-versa. The MT evaluation result should be fine-grained so that even small changes in the translation quality could be correctly shown. The discriminability of a test can be calculated on the basis of the MT evaluation result, as   Performance Analysis and Visualization of Machine Translation Evaluation 301 follows: ()/()HLDX X HL=− −.

"]},{"title":"3.1.3 Difficulty","paragraphs":["The difficulty refers to the degree of the difficulty of the test, which has a great influence on the test result. The difficulty of the test changes the distribution, discriminability, and dispersion of the scores. For example, if the test is so difficult that none of the systems outputs the right answer, one cannot distinguish between systems via the MT evaluation result. This is also the case if the test is too easy. The difficulty of the test questions can be calculated as ()/()PXLHL=− −. (4) In the equation, X is the average score of the systems, while H/L is the highest/lowest possible score for the test. The difficulty of the test question is closely interrelated with the discriminability, efficacy, and other characteristics of the evaluation. According to education measurement theory, a difficulty of around 0.5 is helpful for discriminating the systems to be scored [Wang 2001].","In the section above, a proposal of performance metrics for MT evaluation measures and the proposal’s test suite has been given. These metrics help in analyzing the efficacy of the evaluation methods. The next section gives some experimental examples of the evaluation performance, which verifies the metrics mentioned above."]},{"title":"3.2 Experiments on MT Evaluation Performance 3.2.1 Test of Consistency, Discriminability and Difficulty","paragraphs":["Since the MT evaluation performance metrics proposed in section 3.1 are language-independent, they can be applied to evaluation results in any language. The open source of human evaluation results in [Darwin 2001] on eight English-to-Japanese MT systems is taken for analysis in this section. The authors of this paper do research on the open source evaluation results for two reasons: it is available to any researcher, and thus is easier to duplicate the experiment and analysis; also, the open source data is appropriate in data size and reliability and saves time for more manual work. In the experiment in [Darwin 2001], two evaluators score 8 systems on a 5-point scale showing intelligibility and accuracy. The experimental setup and details are listed in the appendix following this paper. Based on the measures proposed in the last section, this paper’s authors make an analysis of the   302 Jianmin Yao et al. characteristics of the MT evaluation results.","The first experiment is to test the consistency between MT evaluation results from different measures (accuracy and intelligibility), different evaluators, and different test suites. According to equation (1) and (2), based on the data in Table A1 and A2 in the appendix, one gets the correlation coefficients in Table 1, which shows the correlation coefficients for the MT evaluation results.","In Table 1, rows 1 and 2 show a consistency between MT evaluation results by metrics of intelligibility and accuracy. Rows 3 to 5 show consistency between two human evaluators A and B. Rows 6 to 8 show consistency between MT evaluation results by the same evaluator A on different parts of the 300 hundred sentences."]},{"title":"Table1.

Correlation with a human evaluation also reflects the reliability of the automatic evaluation result. As seen in Table 1, all correlation coefficients are higher than 0.9, which is a strong hint of consistency. First, the correlation coefficient between intelligibility and accuracy are 0.998 and 1.000, respectively. This reminds researchers that the two metrics have quite similar scores, and a researcher may just measure one and know the other by regression analysis. Second, the coefficient is also high for correlation between different evaluators and different parts of the test suite, which shows that scores from both evaluators and from different sentences agree with each other on the whole. This is also the case for automatic measures. From previous study, one knows that some automatic evaluation methods are highly correlated with human evaluation, for example, a correlation of around 0.99 for BLEU and NIST [NIST 2002]. GTM (General Text Matching) claims a 0.8 level which is better than BLEU on the same test suite   Performance Analysis and Visualization of Machine Translation Evaluation 303 [Melamed et al. 2003]. The difference between [Melamed et al. 2003] and [NIST 2003] gives researchers a strong signal that consistency is a key factor, but not the only one, in MT evaluation performance.","Another key issue seen from Table 1 is that rows 6 to 8 have a lower correlation coefficient than the rows above. It reminds the researchers that different metrics, such as intelligibility and accuracy, different evaluator A and B, as in the experiments, have a higher correlation coefficient than the same evaluator on different test suites with the same MT evaluation measure of intelligibility. Thus, the difficulty and size of the test suite is another key factor in MT evaluation. The following is further analysis of the influence of test suites."]},{"title":"3.2.2 Influence of the Test Suite","paragraphs":["For the different parts of the test suite, the researchers have the discriminability and difficulty of intelligibility calculated using equations (3) and (4), which can give one a hint of the reason for their influence on the MT evaluation results."]},{"title":"Table 2. Discriminability and difficulty of test suites with intelligibility by different evaluators.

Since all evaluation tasks need better discriminability capability, the evaluator needs to pick out proper test sentences for the evaluation task. Taking evaluator A as an example, the difficulty of different parts of the test suites are 0.50 for sentences 1-100, 0.56 for sentences 101-200, and 0.43 for sentences 201-300. The different difficulty levels led to different correlation coefficients between different parts of the test suites. For example, sentences 101-200 and 201-300 differ greatly in difficulty, and the difference in correlation coefficients is also lower in Table 1 (only 0.945). Another factor found in Table 2 is that the results of evaluators A and B have different discriminability, the former about 0.23, and the latter 0.32. That means their evaluation score has a different distribution style. In fact, this   304 Jianmin Yao et al. phenomenon has a vital influence on the correlation coefficient of two evaluation results, which is highly related to the evaluation result.","The above study of the evaluation performance is made on a public-available Japanese test suite. One does have to notice that the evaluation performance measures are language-independent, which ensures the applicability of the method to the Chinese language, or other language pairs. To study other performance measures, a test on a Chinese suite is made below.","As described above, besides the difficulty and discriminability, another key factor for the test suite is the size. The larger the size of the test suite, the more stable and reliable the MT evaluation result becomes. Taking the popular automatic evaluation methods of BLEU and GTM as example, the influence of the size of the test suite, i.e. the number of sentences it contains, is tested using the 863 National High-tech Program MT evaluation corpus. This corpus is widely used for the evaluation of MT systems in mainland China. The corpus contains 1019 sentences. An experiment was carried out on the BLEU and GTM methods to test the influence of the size of a test suite for an English-to-Chinese translation system. The result is shown in Figure 1.","When the test suite is small, i.e. there is small number of sentences in the test suite, the MT evaluation score fluctuates violently. While when the test suite contains more than 80 sentences, the fluctuation becomes less violent and goes flat after 400 sentences. Figure 1 shows that the two methods have similar tendencies, which shows that they have similar demands of the test suite size. 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 102 203 304 405 506 607 708 809 910 1011 GTM BLEU "]},{"title":"Figure 1.

In BLEU and NIST evaluation, one can see that the scores go up with the increasing number of reference translations. Compared to the character model, the word model scores saturate faster with an increasing number of references, which means it has a lower demand for references. This is also the case for the BLEU models. A possible reason for this phenomenon is that a word is not easy to be matched in extra-translation reference, while new characters come out even after a big number of references.

The MT evaluation performance analysis can help a lot in designing test suites for different MT evaluation methods. The visualization method, on the one hand, gives an intuitive representation of the quality difference of MT systems; on the other hand, it is an easy way to assemble of the different evaluation results."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["The research project is supported by the High-Tech Research and Development Program of Jiangsu Province China (Contract No. GB2005020, BK2006539), the Natural Science Foundation for Higher Education in Jiangsu Province (Contract No. 06KJB520095), Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (Contract No. 108B6040600)."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["ALPAC, “Languages and machines: computers in translation and linguistics,” A report by the Automatic Language Processing Advisory Committee, National Research Council.
