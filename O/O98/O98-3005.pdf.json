Introduction","paragraphs":["With the rapid growth of the Internet in recent years, the World Wide Web (WWW) has become a powerful medium for human communication and dissemination of information. Because more online information is disseminated through this giant media, the Web forms a very large knowledge resource. The explosive growth of the WWW has involved more than 10 million documents. Some search engines and information discovery systems have been introduced to help users locate relevant information. However, one *Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C. E-mail: hh_chen@csie.ntu.edu.tw 75 of the problems in cyberspace is that it is very difficult to know how to contact an entity, which is a concrete object that can send and receive information. For communication purposes, we usually want to know a person's or a company's E-mail address, or his/her home page URL. White pages, which are E-mail directories or URL directories in this case, can help users find such information. There are two major difficulties in building Internet white pages and people searching services. First, it is hard to set up such a white page manually because the WWW is a very large database and is created dynamically. Second, the approaches adopted by current search engines are not suitable for searching the e-mail addresses and home page URLs of people and organizations.","Current search engines only index the contents (words) of a web page with the page's URL. When a page contains many proper names, the search engine will index all the proper nouns with this page's URL. However, only one of these proper nouns or none is the owner of the page. Example 1(a) shows the appearance of a portion of a web page (http://www.ntu.edu.tw/TANet/public.html). Totally, there are 42 public universities and colleges listed in this page. The traditional search engines will index all of these 42 proper nouns with the page's URL, but none of the home pages of these proper nouns is this page.

Some anchor tags are provided for users to browse their home pages. For example, the URL of the home page of National Taiwan University ( ) is http://www.ntu.edu.tw/, which is described by the HTML anchor tag. Considering the context and HTML tags, these proper nouns and the associated anchor tags can be extracted from the web page. For example, 'National Tsing Hua University' (' ') should be related to the URL http://www.nthu.edu.tw/. On the contrary, the traditional search engines will index this school and others with the web page's URL (http://www.ntu.edu.tw/TANet/public.html). In terms of accuracy, the approach adopted by the current search engines is not suitable for such a task of finding White Page Construction from Web Pages 77 people and organizations. Additionally, most of the anchors and the contents in a web page are not proper nouns. Such anchors and words should not be extracted and indexed for people searching.","Furthermore, some proper nouns may appear in the non-anchor part of a web page. If there are URLs of web pages and e-mail addresses on the same page, the relationships between the proper nouns and the information should be identified. Example 2 shows such a case. In contrast to the anchor part, no explicit HTML tags indicate the relationship between the proper nouns and e-mail addresses. Example 2 - ( ) ...... : : E-mail: yucs@ccms.ntu.edu.tw Tel: 3627734 ext 219 : E-mail: giraffe@ccms.ntu.edu.tw edward@ccms.ntu.edu.tw Tel: 3627734 ext 241 3627734 ext 241 : E-mail: popo@ccms.ntu.edu.tw kevins@ccms.ntu.edu.tw Tel: 3627734 ext 241 3627734 ext 241 ......","How to identify the proper nouns in a web page is a critical problem for building white pages. Fortunately, a very large portion of the WWW is composed of natural language documents, which can be regarded as a text corpus. Corpus analysis techniques in natural language processing [CL, 1993] can be employed to extract knowledge from the WWW. And using the semantics of the content and HTML tags, the information (URLs and e-mail addresses) can be related to proper nouns. This paper will propose a method to construct white pages for Internet/Intranet users automatically. It extracts information, including proper nouns, E-mail addresses and home page URLs, from WWW documents, and finds the relationships among these data. The problems to be tackled are as follows:","(1) Proper nouns, which are always unknown words, have to be identified and classified from a WWW corpus. Personal names and organization names are the requested entities for people finding on the Internet. Those proper nouns that denote organizations are usually hierarchical. Such relationships must be distinguished.","(2) There may be more than one proper noun, more than one E-mail address, and more 78 H. H. Chen, G. W. Bian","than one URL in a WWW document. Thus, we have to find a mapping from a set of","E-mail addresses (or URLs) to a set of proper nouns.","The extraction method proposed in this paper was tested on the web pages in Taiwan. Section 2 introduces WWW documents and the semantics of the HTML annotation. The hierarchical nature and the related HTML tagging (1996) are discussed. Section 3 gives an overview of our white page constructor. Section 4 presents the identification algorithms for proper nouns. Here, we focus on personal names and organization names. Section 5 touches on the algorithms for mapping between proper nouns and related information. Section 6 discusses the experiments, and Section 7 offers some conclusions."]},{"title":"2. WWW Documents","paragraphs":["The first step in constructing white pages is to find out where proper nouns, E-mail addresses and URLs are located in WWW documents. Web documents are different from a traditional text corpus in that they are HTML (HyperText Markup Language) files. The tagging information provides some clues, but it also introduces some noise. How to use the information is a very important issue in applications on the Internet, e.g., cross-language information retrieval [Bian and Chen, 1997]. In plain text, each sentence always has a sentence terminator, such as a full stop, question mark or exclamation mark. These symbols split each document into several processing units. In HTML files, these punctuation marks do not always appear. Quasi-sentences are defined according to some HTML tags shown below: "]},{"title":"Title (TITLE) Headings (H1, H2, , H6) Address (ADDRESS) Unordered Lists (UL, LI) Ordered Lists (OL, LI) Definition Lists (DL, DT, DD) Tables (TABLE, TD, TH, TR)","paragraphs":["Furthermore, some punctuation symbols like '|' and ':' have the same effects. In contrast to the above sentence delimiters, the font style elements may introduce noise. Bold (B), italic (I), superscripts (SUP), subscripts (SUB) and font (FONT) can be used to emphasize some points in texts. However, these elements produce many unknown words because a word is split into several parts by HTML tags. Example 3 illustrates the word 'Font' associated with various font style tags. Thus, these tags should be treated as meta-information and hidden from processing. White Page Construction from Web Pages 79 Example 3. <I><B><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR=\"#FF0000\">F</FONT> <FONT COLOR=\"#0000FF\">o</FONT> <FONT COLOR=\"#FF8000\">n</FONT>t</FONT></B></I>","Links denoted by anchors (A) in WWW documents are possible sources of proper nouns and related information. The WWW documents shown in Appendix A shows their typical features. The first example is the home page of National Taiwan University (NTU, http://www.ntu.edu.tw/). The entity that we are interested in is 'National Taiwan University' (' '), which is an organization name and is shown in the title area. The second example (http://www.ntu.edu.tw/NTULink/) follows from 'NTU Link' on the NTU home page. An underline shows a link to other home pages in the web page. The interesting entities are Office of Academic Affairs (' '), Office of Student Affairs (' '), and Office of Business Affairs (' '); University Library (' '); Computer and Information Network Center (' '); Population Studies Center (' '). Those units that do not have any links are not considered. For example, the home pages for Accounting Office (' ') and Military Instructors' Office (' ') have not yet been constructed now, so that they are not listed in the final white pages. Following the link for 'Colleges, Schools, Departments, Graduate Institutes and Affiliated Organizations', we can retrieve more information. All these units form a hierarchical structure in National Taiwan University. A link in the HTML file may be represented as follows: <a href=\"argument\"> text </a> When \"text\" is a proper noun, its home page URL can be described by \"argument\". Consider an example on the 'NTU Link' web page. The link to 'Office of the Dean of Academic Affairs' (' ') is shown below:"]},{"title":"<a href=\"/Campus/announce/index.html#academic\"> / Office of the Dean of Academic Affairs</a>","paragraphs":["If the proper noun and its URL are put into white pages directly, this entry may be ambiguous. This is because many universities have similar organizations. Therefore we should keep the hierarchical path of the web page to disambiguate the meaning of a proper noun. Further, the relative URLs have to be changed into absolute ones to keep all of the URL information. Because the URL associated with the link 'Office of the Dean of Academic Affairs' ( ) is a relative URL 80 H. H. Chen, G. W. Bian (/Campus/announce/index.html#academic) and the web page's URL is http://www.ntu.edu.tw/NTULink/, the absolute URL of this organization is represented as http://www.ntu.edu.tw/Campus/announce/index.html#academic. In addition, the host name (www.ntu.edu.tw) in the hierarchical path of this URL shows that this organization is part of National Taiwan University. The complete organization name will be 'Office of the Dean of Academic Affairs in National Taiwan University' (' '). Therefore, similar organizations and personal names can be disambiguated with the host names of their absolute URLs to find their home pages' URLs on the global Internet.","Besides the linking anchor field, proper nouns may appear in other portions of a WWW document. Dealing with these objects is more complex because no explicit HTML tags indicate the URLs of these objects. An additional algorithm is needed to associate URLs and E-mail addresses with suitable proper nouns. Different kinds of clues, such as the spelling method, adjacency principle and HTML tags (e.g., title, headings, address, and font style elements), are employed."]},{"title":"3. System Overview","paragraphs":["We periodically collect web pages from the Internet/Intranet using a spider. The white page constructor first analyzes these HTML files. Basic processing units (sentences or quasi-sentences) and HTML meta-information are gathered. Because a Chinese sentence (or quasi sentence) is composed of a sequence of characters without word boundaries [Chen and Lee, 1996], a Chinese segmentation system identifies the word tokens. Then, a proper noun identification system (see Section 4) extracts personal names and organization names. During processing, the information in the anchor parts is placed in the anchor set (AS). Other information, i.e., that appearing in non-anchor parts, is placed in one of the content sets (CSes) which correspond to different types of information. In the current implementation, there are three content sets: CS_Proper-Noun, CS_E-Mail and CS_HTTP. They record proper nouns, E-mail addresses and URLs, respectively. For the anchor set, the remaining task is simple. We just relate the proper noun found in an anchor to the corresponding URL or E-mail address. For the content sets, a mapping algorithm (see Section 5) is proposed to associates URLs and/or E-mail addresses with a suitable proper noun. Algorithm 1 shows the information extraction part of the white page constructor. White Page Construction from Web Pages 81 Algorithm 1.

Several methods [Boguraev and Pustejovsky, 1996; Mani, et al., 1993; McDonald, 1993; Paik, et al., 1993] have been proposed to identify English proper nouns. For research related to Chinese, Chang et al. [1992] and Wang et al. [1992] touched on Chinese personal names; Sproat et al. [1994] considered Chinese personal names and transliterations of foreign words; Chen and Lee [1996] identified Chinese personal names, Chinese transliterated personal names and organization names. The name identification module is based on our previous design. The methods are described below. 4.1"]},{"title":"Identification of Personal names","paragraphs":["A Chinese personal name is composed of surname and given name parts. Most Chinese surnames are single characters (model (a)), and some rare ones have two characters (model (b)). A married woman may place her husband's surname before her surname (model (c)). Thus there are three possible types of surnames, i.e., single character, two characters and two surnames together. Most names have two characters, and some rare ones are single characters. Theoretically, every character can be considered as a names rather than a fixed set. Thus, the length of Chinese personal names ranges from 2 to 6 characters. The baseline models for identification are shown as follows. Model (a) Single character surname: "]},{"title":"#C &C  #C &C  #C &C Threshold  #C &C Threshold and #C &C  #C &C Threshold","paragraphs":["Model (b) Two characters surname: (3) C11C12 is two-character surname and"]},{"title":"#C &C  #C &C Threshold","paragraphs":["Model (c) Two surnames together: White Page Construction from Web Pages 83 "]},{"title":"#C &C  #C &C  #C &C  #C &C Threshold ","paragraphs":["#C &C  #C &C Threshold and #C &C  #C &C Threshold"]},{"title":"where C","paragraphs":["1"]},{"title":", C","paragraphs":["11"]},{"title":", and C","paragraphs":["12"]},{"title":"are the characters forming a surname, C","paragraphs":["2"]},{"title":"and C","paragraphs":["3"]},{"title":"are the characters which are considered as names, # C","paragraphs":["i"]},{"title":"is the frequency of C","paragraphs":["i"]},{"title":"being a surname or a name, & C","paragraphs":["i"]},{"title":"is the frequency of C","paragraphs":["i"]},{"title":"being contained in the other words.","paragraphs":["For different types of surnames, the different models are adopted. Because the two-character surnames are always indicated as surnames, Model (b) neglects the score of the surname part. Models (a) and (c) have two score functions. They solve the problem of very high scores of surnames. The above three models can be extended to single-character names by ignoring the last character C3 in each formula for training and testing. When a candidate cannot pass the thresholds, its last character is cut off and the remaining string is tried again. The frequencies of characters being surnames or names are trained from a large-scale Chinese name corpus of 219,738 Chinese personal names and 661,512 characters. The frequencies of characters being other words are trained from an NTU balanced corpus to compute the variation of characters. In total, this corpus has 113,647 words and 191,173 characters. Thresholds are trained using the Chinese name corpus. We calculate the scores of all Chinese personal names in the corpus using the above formulas. The scores for each formula are sorted, and then the one that is less than 99% of the personal names is considered to be a threshold for this formula. That is, 99% of the training data can pass the threshold.","Chinese personal names are not always composed of single characters. For example, the name part ' ' (Cong-ming) of the sentence ' ' (Chen Cong-ming yishu feichang gauming; Chen Cong-ming has find command of the medical art) is a word. How to tell that a word is a content word or a name is indispensable. Mutual information [Church and Hanks, 1990], which provides a measure of word association, is employed to differentiate between a name and a content word. We check the string that can serve as a name or a content word with its surrounding words. When they have a strong relationship, it has high probability of being a content 84 H. H. Chen, G. W. Bian word rather than a name. In the example ' , ' (Chen jashi qingbai jue buhui fanfa ; Chen has a clean family background and will never violate the law ), the two words ' ' (jashi) and ' ' (qingbai) have high mutual information, so that ' ' (Chen jashi) is not a personal name in this example. Three newspaper corpora (total size about 2.6 million words) are used to train the word association.","Punctuation marks play an important role in identification. Personal names usually appear at the head or the tail of a sentence. A candidate is given an extra bonus when it is found in one of these two places. Gender has a special role in Chinese personal names. A married woman may place her husband's surname before her surname. That forms the personal name of model (c). Gender information helps us to disambiguate the type of personal name.","The last clue is the paragraph information. A personal name may appear more than once in a paragraph. This phenomenon is useful during identification. We use a cache to store identified candidates and reset the cache before next paragraph is processed. Consider the examples ' ' (Jiao Renhe biaoshi ; Jiao Renhe expressed ) and ' ' (Jiao Renhe mishuzhang ...; Jiao Renhe Chief Secretary ...). Two candidates ' ' (Jiao Ren) and ' ' (Jiao Renhe) are proposed and stored in the cache, but the personal name is finally identified as ' ' (Jiao Renhe). For details, the reader is referred to a previous paper [Chen and Lee, 1996]. 4.2"]},{"title":"Organization Names","paragraphs":["The structure of organization names is more complex than that of personal names. Basically, a complete organization name can be divided into two parts, i.e., name and keyword. Many words can serve as names, but only some fixed words can be regarded as keywords. Thus, keywords are important clue used to extract organization names. However, there are still several difficult problems. First, a keyword is usually a common content word. It is not easy to differentiate between a keyword and a content word. This problem results in ambiguities in POS tagging and word sense. Second, a keyword may appear in an abbreviated form. Third, a keyword may be omitted completely. Fourth, some organization names are very long, so it is hard to decide on the left boundary. The following examples illustrate these problems.","(1) Ambiguity of keywords: (1.1) Ambiguity of word senses and POS tagging: (xuehui; Association or Learn) White Page Construction from Web Pages 85 (1.2) Ambiguity of POS tagging (verb or noun): (iaocha zhongxin; center of investigation), (yanjiu zhongxin; center of research), (kaifa kongsi; company of development), (kaifa zhongxin; center of development), (fazhan xiehui; development association), (guihua xiaozu; planning group), (yanxishe; research club), (pinglunshe; discussion club), (famingshe; invention club), (lianyihui; social gathering)","(2) Abbreviated keywords: (' '): tougu (touziguwengongsi); Security Investment","Consulting (' '): huzhuan (hulizhuankexuexiao); college of nursing (' '): zhuanxiao (zhuankexuexiao); college for professional training (' ') gongzhuan (gongyezhuankexuexiao); college of","technology : shangzhuan; college of commerce : yizhuan; college of arts (' '): shixiao (shiyanxiaoxue); experimental primary school","(3) Keyword omitted: (hongji; Acer), (youxunkeji, D-Link Tech.), (youlizixun; Ulead Inc.)","(4) Long organization names: (guoli taiwan gongye jishuxueyuan; National Taiwan Institute of Technology), (guojia dizhen gongcheng yanjiu zhongxin; National Center for Research on Earthquake Engineering), (shijian sheji guanli xueyuan; Shih Chien College of Design and Management), (taibei shi daan qu wanfang shequ fazhan xiehui; Taipei Daan District Wanfang Community Development Association)","Our previous work [Chen and Lee, 1996] only touched on the fourth problem. Keywords, which are good indicators, play a role similar to that of surnames. They show not only the possibility of an occurrence of an organization name, but also its right boundary. A prefix is a good marker for a possible left boundary, for example, ' ' (National), ' ' (Provincial), and ' ' (Private), and so on. The name part of an organization may consist of single characters or words. Parts of speech, such as transitive verbs, adjectives, numerals and classifiers, are also useful for determining the left boundary. The name part of an organization cannot cross these critical parts of speech. For example, ' ' (company) in ' ' (three company ) is not a keyword 86 H. H. Chen, G. W. Bian due to the critical parts of speech. Because a tagger is not involved before identification, the part of speech of a word is determined wholly based on its lexical probability.","Although our previous experiment has shown that these critical parts of speech are useful in determining the left boundary of an organization name in a newspaper text, the ambiguity of parts-of-speech (as verb or noun) decreases the performance for the specific task - identification of organization names in an unrestricted domain. For example, the identification system will miss or give an incorrect left boundary for organization names containing ' ' (diaocha; investigation), ' ' (yanjiu; research), ' ' (kaifa; development), ' ' (fazhan; development), ' ' (guihua; plan), ' ' (yanxi; study), ' ' (pinglun; critique), ' ' (sheji; design), ' ' (guanli; management), ' ' (faming; invention), and so on. To resolve this problem in proper noun extraction, a refined method is proposed to deal with such organization names. The experiments described in Section 6 will illustrate the performance of the baseline and refined methods."]},{"title":"5.

Of these, the numbers of personal names and organization names were 255 and 746, respectively. That is, 83.87% of the anchors were irrelevant and should be screened out for the task of finding people. The precision and the recall rates were 82.89% and 74.12% for the identification of personal names, respectively.","However, the precision and the recall rates for the identification of organization names were much lower than those obtained in our previous work. The major errors resulted from the strategy discussed in Section 4.2, i.e., \"parts of speech such as transitive verbs, adjectives, numerals and classifiers are also useful to determine the left boundary, White Page Construction from Web Pages 91 and the name part of an organization cannot cross these critical parts of speech.\" Many of the organization names may contain ' ' (diaocha; investigation), ' ' (yanjiu; research), ' ' (kaifa; development), ' ' (fazhan; development), ' ' (guihua; plan), ' ' (yanxi; study), ' ' (pinglun; critique), ' ' (sheji; design), ' ' (guanli; management), ' ' (faming; invention), and so on. All of these words can be nouns or transitive verbs. The identification system misses or gives the incorrect left boundary for such an organization name. The following examples illustrate this problem. (gonggong zhengce yantao xuehui; Public Policy Workshop Association), (kexue guanli xuehui; Science Management Association), (zhongyang yanjiuyuan diaocha yanjiu kongzuoshi; Office of Survey Research at Academia Sinica), (dianyin yanjiushe; Movie Club), (jiche yanxishe; Motorcycle Club), (nuqingnian lianyihui; Youth Women's Christian Association), (wutaisheji gongzuoshi; Studio of Stage Design), (taibei shi daan shequ fazhan xiehui; Taipei Daan District Wanfang Community Development Association), (shijian sheji guanli xueyuan; Shih Chien College of Design and Management), (taibei yingshi kaifa gongsi; Taipei Movie, Video and Television Development Company), (taiwan daxue tuiguang jiaoyu zhongxin; Center of Extended Education, National Taiwan University), (shuichan shiyansuo; Fishery Research Institute), (taida xiaoyuan guihua xiaozu; Campus Planning Group, National Taiwan University), (lingdao gongguan gongsi; Lingdao Public Relation Company), (bianji weiyuanhui; Editing Committee), (diaocha weiyuanhui; Investigation Committee), (wunichuzhi yanjiusuo; Mud Disposal Research Institute), (jiaoda yingyong yishu yanjiusuo; Institute of Applied Arts, National Chiao Tung University), (shengwu jishu kaifa zhongxin; Development Center for Biotechnology), (zhonghua shixun fazhan xiehui; Telecommunication Development Association of Republic of China), (nongye shiyansuo; Agriculture Research Institute), (kaituo wenjiaojijinghui; Kaituo Cultural and Educational Foundation), (guoji fanyishe; International Translation Agency).","To resolve this problem, a refined method was used to allow these words to serve as the name parts of organization names. The performance of the refined method is shown in Table 1(c). With this heuristic rule, the precision was 65.15% and the recall was 92 H. H. Chen, G. W. Bian 74.79% in the anchor part. Appendix B presents some extracted examples in the anchor part. The refined method achieved a precision rate of 61.38% and a recall rate of 68.74% for the content part.","In the content part of the 703 web pages, there were 1,732 proper names and 3,029 organization names. Only one of these proper nouns or none was the owner of the web page. That is, at least 85.23% of these names were unrelated to the owners of the web pages. Totally, 64 E-mail addresses and 16 HTTP URLs were extracted in the non-anchor part. Because the patterns of the E-mail addresses and HTTP URLs were well-formed, all of them were found. These addresses and URLs were related to none or one of 6,735 proper nouns (3,343 personal names and 3,392 organization names). With the mapping heuristics, 18 E-mail addresses were assigned to the correct personal names or organization names; 5 E-mail addresses were assigned incorrectly; and the others were not assigned. The mapping algorithm achieved an accuracy rate of 78.26%. We found that the Pinyin spelling similarity provided a very good criterion to relate the E-mail addresses to the proper nouns, even when they were not the nearest pairs. Some experimental data and results are shown in Appendix C.","Table 2 summarizes the overall results of information extraction for proper nouns. 97.52% of the information was extracted from the anchor set. The number of home page URLs and E-mail addresses extracted in the content part was much smaller than that in the anchor part. This reflects the characteristics of web pages. When designing web pages, people often include URLs and E-mail addresses within the linking anchors for users' navigation instead of giving the information in the content. Because the HTML anchor tags explicitly give the information about the linking text, the overall performance will depend on the identification of proper nouns in the anchors of the web pages."]},{"title":"Table 2.","paragraphs":["The Overall Results of Information Extraction for People Finding","Information Extraction # (no. of correct items) % (Percentage) From Anchor Set 747","(189 for people and 558 for organizations) 97.52%","From Content Set 19 2.48% Total 766 100%","The major errors resulted from conjunctions and compounds in the organization names.

Further, some famous historical books and names of years were very similar to the personal names. On the other hand, some famous ancient personal names could not be identified, because the name parts of these names were rarely used in the training corpus of contemporary personal names. In addition, nicknames and some transliterated names were missed. This is because a nickname does not lead with a surname, and most of the characters used in Japanese names are different from those in transliterated English names. Some examples are listed below.

Concluding Remarks","paragraphs":["This paper has proposed a computer-aided information extraction method to construct white pages for Internet/Intranet users or to build databases for finding people and organizations on the Internet. The traditional approach used by current search engines indexes proper nouns with incorrect URLs of web pages in the task of finding people and organizations. In our system, proper nouns are identified using some heuristic rules and the corpus-based analysis method of natural language processing. Considering the semantics of content and HTML tags, these proper nouns and their related information are extracted from web pages. Using identification of proper nouns, the number of indexing terms on a web page using the proposed method is smaller than that using search engines. Finding people and organizations in the database of the extracted results is more precise than in the current search engines. The results here show that much interesting information can be automatically extracted from the WWW. However, complete identification of conjunctions and compounds in organization names needs further investigation. Furthermore, other types of information, e.g., addresses, phone numbers, and so on, will be considered in the future."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Bian, G.W. and Chen, H.H. \"An MT Meta-Server for Information Retrieval on WWW\", Working Notes of the AAAI Spring Symposium on Natural Language Processing for the World Wide Web, Palo Alto, California, USA, March, 1997, pp.10-16.","Boguraev, B. and Pustejovsky, J.
