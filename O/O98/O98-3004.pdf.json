Our method involves determining the distributional differences in syntactic patterns, deducing the semantic features from the syntactic phenomena, and testing the semantic features in new syntactic frames. We determine the distributional differences in syntactic patterns through the following five steps: First, we search for all instances of the verb in the corpus. Second, we classify each of these instances into its type of syntactic function. Third, we classify each of these instances into its argument structure type. Fourth, we determine the aspectual type that is associated with each verb. Lastly, we determine each verb's sentential type. Once the distributional differences have been determined, then the relevant semantic features are postulated. Our goal is to tease out the lexical semantic features as the explanation, and as the motivation of the syntactic contrasts."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["Radical Lexicalism maintains that all grammatical behaviors are manifestations of lexical features [Karttunen 1986]. Since most lexical attributes are semantic and/or conceptual in nature, taking this lexicon-driven approach to language means that many syntactic properties can be predicted from lexical semantic attributes [Jackendoff 1976, Levin 1985, Dowty 1991, Pustejovsky 1993]. In terms of Natural Language Processing (NLP), surface syntactic structures can be systematically predicted from their lexical semantic representation. From this perspective, the automatic acquisition of lexical knowledge for NLP may be possible, since the relation between syntactic patterns and lexical semantics is predictable to some extent. Dorr & Jones [1996], for example, demonstrate that semantic information can be derived from syntactic cues when the syntactic cues are first divided into distinct groupings that correlate with different word senses. * Academia Sinica, Nankang, Taipei 115, Taiwan, R.O.C.

The identification of the relevant components of meaning is essential if this approach is to be successful.[Levin 1993:14]","paragraphs":["Our paper will focus on the last point above. We propose using the distributional differences in the syntactic patterns of near-synonyms1","to deduce the relevant components of verbal semantics. In particular, we want to identify the semantic features that differentiate verbal syntactic behaviors. Our strong hypothesis is that all lexical semantic features can be identified this way. In contrast, salient semantic features deduced from a shared verb class may or may not be predictive of verbal features because they may simply be descriptions of the meaning. Our method is as follows: 1) Determine distributional differences in syntactic patterns 2) Deduce the semantic features from the syntactic phenomena 3) Test the semantic features in new syntactic frames","How will we determine the distributional differences in syntactic patterns? Our corpus-based approach calls for us to search, sort, and classify all relevant data according to the four following criteria: First, we will classify each of these instances according to the syntactic functions of the verbs themselves (i.e. predicate, complement, adverbial, determinal, nominal). Second, we can classify the corpus data in terms of argument type that the verbs take (i.e. NP subject, VP subject, sentential subject, NP object, NP double-object, sentential object). Third, we determine the aspectual types each verb is associated with (i.e. aspectual markers, aspectual adverbs, resultative complements). Lastly, we examine the sentential modes that each verb occurs in (i.e. passive, imperative, evaluative, declarative, interrogative). 1. According to Lyons (1995: 60), synonyms are expressions with the same meaning, whereas near-synonyms are expressions that are more or less similar, but not identical, in meaning. In this respect, many of the expressions listed as synonymous in dictionaries, actually, are near-synonyms. 62 M. C. Tsai et al","This process is time-consuming. However, because we are dealing with near-synonyms, we expect there to be many shared syntactic behaviors that can be ignored for the purpose of this study. This will facilitate the identification of (sometimes unexpected) grammatical contrasts that instantiates deeper lexical semantic contrasts of the near-synonym pairs. The crucial difference will be found in the small number of instances where they are in complementary distribution in terms of one of the above four types of syntactic information.2","In what follows we will present our 3 - step method-ology (i.e. determine syntactic difference, deduce semantic feature, test for reliability of semantic feature) for each of the 4 different types of syntactic information (i.e. syntactic functions (Section 2), argument structure (Section 3), aspectual type (Section 4), sentential type (Section 5). In the concluding section (Section 6), we discuss the advantages of this method as compared to an account that is based on differentiating semantic classes of verbs [Levin 1993]."]},{"title":"2.

It is obvious that an effect state occurs as a resultative complement, and represents the effect of another predicate. On the other hand, there seems to be a tendency against nominalized complex verbs in Chinese (e.g. all verb-resultative compounds cannot be nominalized). Thus, an effect state has the semantic implicature of a complex event and cannot be nominalized. 2.3"]},{"title":"Prediction/Verification","paragraphs":["After looking at near-synonyms to determine the semantic feature that differentiates them, we need to test our hypothesis.

Conclusion","paragraphs":["The notion that the syntactic behavior of verbs is semantically determined has been examined extensively, especially for English verbs (please see Levin 1993 for relevant references).

Levin summarizes this method:"]},{"title":"The assumption that the syntactic behavior of verbs is semantically determined gives rise to a powerful technique for investigating verb meaning that can be exploited in the development of a theory of lexical knowledge. If the distinctive behavior of verb classes with respect to diathesis alternations arises from their meaning, any class of verbs","paragraphs":["Towards a Representation of Verbal Semantics 71"]},{"title":"whose members pattern together with respect to diathesis alternation should be a semantically coherent class: its members should share at least some aspect of meaning. Once such a class is identified, its members can be examined to isolate the meaning components they have in common. Thus diathesis alternations can be used to provide a probe into the elements entering into the lexical representation of word meaning. [Levin 1993:14]","paragraphs":["However, this technique is not easily implemented in Mandarin, because extensive study of diathesis alternations has not been done in Mandarin. Perhaps one reason is because Mandarin allows both subject and object omission, which means that it is very difficult to get a handle on what is a relevant 'alternation.' The work that has been done on semantic interpretations of syntactic structures (and the verbs that may occur in these structures) in Mandarin, such as in the case of pre-posed objects (such as BA and BEI), while interesting, is inconclusive because the wide variety of contexts and possible meanings defies a unified explanation. [Cf. Thompson 1973, Mei 1978, Bennett 1981, Ren 1991, Sun 1995, etc]","Moreover, the diathesis alternation technique does not allow for a very fine grained analysis of semantic features, because verbs may belong to more than one (seemingly unrelated) alternation class6",", and because different verb classes may share the same alternation7",". Thus, it is difficult to extract the common semantic feature that predict the difference between the classes. When we look at near-synonyms, on the other hand, we are able to set up a controlled study of lexical semantic contrasts and their grammatical effects8",". We hope that this fine-grained approach will aid us in identifying the semantic features or attributes that dictate the syntactic differences of verbs. 6. For example, according to Levin (1993), 'hit' belongs to verbs of throwing, verbs of contact by impact as well as verbs of existence, whereas 'cut' belongs to seven classes--verbs of cutting, verbs of separating and dissembling, verbs of creation and transformation, verbs of psychological state, verbs of bodily state and damage to the body, verbs of grooming and bodily care and meander verbs. 7. For example, 'hit' and 'cut' share the conative alternation. 8. Effectively, more larger scale experiment would be needed to deduce the semantic features for more verbs as well as to determine to what extent can this approach be generalized. 72 M. C.
