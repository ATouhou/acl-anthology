Introduction","paragraphs":["The Chinese aspect markers 1 have considered difficult for Chinese as a Foreign Language learners (Chao, 2002; Kao, 2006). Kao (2006) analyze the errors of the usage of the perfective le and of the imperfective zhe based on the corpus consisting of inter-language of Chinese produced by Chinese as a Foreign Language (for short, CFL) students abroad. Based on his study, he suggests that the interaction between aspect markers and different types of events, the comparison of the similar aspect markers and their individual characteristics should be introduced and emphasized in CFL instruction. In this study, we develop a curriculum for three Chinese aspect markers: the perfective le, the progressive zai and the durative zhe. In order to eliminate the negative effect of grammar translation and possibly insufficiency of pedagogical grammar, we use the generalizations  1 Chinese aspect markers include the perfective aspect markers le, the imperfective markers zai and zhe, the experiential guo, and verbal reduplication (Li & Thompson, 1981). In this study, we focus on the perfective marker le, and the imperfective markers zai and zhe. 266    from linguistic research on these three aspect markers, e.g. Li & Thompson, 1981; Lin, 2002; Liu, 1997; Pan, 1996; Smith, 1997; Wu & Kuo, 2003; Wu, 2003, 2005, 2007; Xiao & McEnery, 2004; Yeh, 1993, and implement the generalizations with computer animations, an instruction method along the lines proposed in Form Focused Instruction (Ellis, 1985). According to Wu (2003, 2007), zai as a progressive marker goes with an event ongoing at an instant and le as a perfective marker presents a completed event or a terminated event. Both of zai and le can go with accomplishment 2 and activity3 events. Thus, the comparison between them in terms of accomplishment events is stated as the following sentences (1). (1) a. Tā zài xiě yì fēng xìn. she PROG write one CL letter “She is writing a letter.” b. Tā xiě (wán) le yì fēng xìn. she write (finish) PFV one CL letter “She finished writing a letter.” In (1), we can tell the difference between zai and le in terms of interacting with Accomplishment. For example, xiě yì fēng xìn ‘to write a letter’ gets an ongoing reading with zai in (1a) while it receives a completed meaning with le in (1b). As for Activity, the comparison between zai and le was presented in (2). As we can see, păobù ‘running’ gets an ongoing reading with zai in (2a) while it acquires a completed meaning with le in (2b). (2) a. Tā zài păobù. he PROG running “He is running.” b. Tā păo le yí ge xiăoshí de bù. he run PFV one CL hour of steps. “He ran for one hour.” Also, in our curriculum, we included the contrast between zhe and le. zhe as the durative aspect marker signals the durative nature of a situation (e.g. Xiao & McEnery, 2004). When it comes to Activity such as the positional verb, 4 zhe selects the stative reading to signal its durative posture (e.g. Li & Thompson, 2005; Xia & McEnery, 2004). For example, dai ‘to put on; to wear’ receives a stative meaning with zhe in (3a). In contrast, it gets a completed meaning with le in (3b).  2 According to Smith (1997), accomplishment events include a process and a change of state, an accomplishment event is compatible with both durational phrases and completive phrases. For example, xie zhe wu feng xin ‘to write these five letters’ is classified as Accomplishment because it contains both a process and a natural final endpoint. 3 Smith (1997) proposed that activity events only include a process but without a change of state; that is, they have no national final points. Since it has no natural final endpoint, Activity requires a durational phrase to signal the final endpoint. For example, Tā kàn le yíge xiăoshí de diăn yǐng ‘He saw a movie for one hour.’ yíge xiăoshí ‘one hour’ terminates the activity event kàn diànyǐng ‘to see the movie.’ 4 Positional verbs like chuan/dai ‘to put on; wear’, na ‘take; hold’, fang ‘put’ and gua ‘hang’ refer to verbs that indicate where something has been put or placed (e.g. Xiao & McEnery, 2004). 267    (3) a. Tā dài zhe yì dǐng màozi. she wear DUR one CL hat “She is wearing a hat.” b. Tā dài le yì dǐng màozi. she wear PFV one CL hat. “She wore a hat.” On the other hand, zhe can go with posture verbs 5 in addition to positional verbs and receive a stative reading as shown in (4). In (4a), the posture verb such as zuo ‘to sit’ acquires a stative meaning from the durative marker zhe. In addition, the V zhe such as that in (4a) can be used to provide a temporal background in the V zhe V construction (Wu & Kuo, 2003). For example, zuo ‘to sit’ in (4b) serves as a background of the main event he kafei ‘to drink coffee’. (4) a. Tā zuò zhe. she sit DUR “She is sitting.” b. Tā zuò zhe hē kāfēi. she sit DUR drink coffee “She is drinking coffee, while sitting. Furthermore, locative inversion in Chinese can take either le or zhe. However, the semantics of zhe differs from that of le. (5a), a locative inversion sentence with zhe, focuses on the lasting of the state part of the positional verb fang ‘to put’, while (5b), with le, focuses on the completion of the dynamic part of the same verb. (5) a. Zhuōshàng fang zhe yì pán cài. table put DUR one CL dish “A dish of vegetables is on the table.” b. Zhuōshàng fang le yì pán cài. table put PFV one CL dish “A dish of vegetables was put on the table.” We also include in our curriculum the comparison among the three aspect markers zhe, zai, and le, Take the positional verb chaun ‘to put on; to wear’ as the example, shown in (6). zhe signifies the stative meaning in (6a), zai the progressive (ongoing) meaning in (6b) and le the completed meaning in (6c). (6 ) a. Tā chuān zhe wàitào. she wear DUR coat “She is wearing a coat.” b. Tā zài chuān wàitào.  5 Posture verbs refer to verbs indicating posture or physical disposition at a location such as zhan‘stand’, zuo ‘sit’, tang ‘lie’, dun ‘squat’, pa ‘crouch’ and ting ‘stop; park (a car)’ and they either denote an activity or the state resulting from the activity, refer to verbs indicating posture or physical disposition at a location. 268    she PROG wear coat “She is putting on a coat.” c. Tā chuān le wàitào. she wear PFV coat “She wore a coat.” So far, we have addressed the interactions of the aspect markers le, zai, and zhe with event types. As far as second language learning is concerned, there have been studies devoted to computer-based L2 grammar instruction, such as McEnery, Baker & Wilson, 1995; Nagata, 1996; Rachel, 1995; etc. These studies show that computer-based L2 grammar instruction is more effective than traditional instruction. Ragan, Boyce, Redwine, Savenye, and McMichael (1993) also find that multimedia instruction reduces learning time by 30% compared to traditional instruction. In the study, we focus on CFL learners’ acquisition of aspect markers le, zai, and zhe. These aspect markers are too abstract to comprehend for CFL learners, even expressed in English translation. For example, Ta dai zhe maozhi “She is wearing a hat” and Ta zai dai maozhi “She is putting on a hat.” CFL beginners may be confused why zai changed the verb from ‘to wear’ to ‘to put on,’ and have difficulty in distinguishing these two expressions. We predict that the animation can present the slight difference among the interaction of these aspect markers with event types and then improve CFL beginners’ comprehension of the aspect markers. However, few studies, if any, investigate the effect on the computer-based grammar instruction with animation representing the semantics of the target sentences. Hence, we address the following issue in this paper: Is a computer-based multimedia program of grammar instruction (hereafter the interactive multimedia program) more effective than a Chinese computer-based grammar translation program (hereafter the computer-based grammar program) on CFL beginners’ learning of aspect markers le, zai, and zhe? The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present methodology including participants, instruments, data collection and data analysis. In Section 3 we report results and discussion. Results are presented with various analyses following each of these descriptive sections. Discussion included the effect of the interactive multimedia program vs. the computer-based grammar program. Finally, Section 4 concluded this study."]},{"title":"2. Methodology","paragraphs":["This study chose a quantitative method to investigate the effect of interactive multimedia program on Chinese Aspect Marker le, zai, and zhe learning. Based on the purpose of the study, we examined if the interactive multimedia program is more efficient and effective than the computer-based grammar program on the learning of Chinese aspect markers. The participants were 35 CFL beginners and they were divided into two groups. One is the control group and the other the experimental group. The control group studied le, zai, and zhe 269    through the computer-based grammar program and the experimental group learned through the interactive multimedia program. Both of the interactive multimedia program and the computer-based grammar program were digitalized based on our designed curriculum which included seven lessons and exercises for each lesson. The major difference between the interactive multimedia program and the computer-based grammar program lies in the presentation of the semantics of le, zai, and zhe with events. The interactive multimedia program presented the semantics of the target sentences with animation while the computer-based grammar program with English corresponding sentences. The following Figure 1 shows the research design.  Figure 1. The research design In addition to these two programs, a pretest, an immediate posttest, and a delayed posttest were used in the study. Performance of the experimental group who used the interactive multimedia program was compared with that of the control group who learned through the computer-based grammar program after learning an average twenty minutes of a three-day period learning. The result of the pre-test, immediate posttest, and the one-month delayed posttest were analyzed, using T-test to determine the effect of the interactive multimedia program."]},{"title":"2.1 Participants","paragraphs":["Thirty-five participants for this study were selected respectively from the population of CFL beginners in National Chiayi University, National Chung-Cheng University, Chung-Yuan University and Feng-Chia University. 6 Twenty-one of them were female and fourteen were male. Their ages ranged from eighteen to fifty-five year-old. They came from various countries.

Participants from English speaking countries such as the U. S. A., India and Philippine and other countries Indonesia, Thailand and Switzerland were assigned to the control group. Thus, the control group and the experimental group consisted of 16 students and 19 students respectively. The homogeneity between these two groups was established by the pretest.8 We calculated the average scores of the pretest of these two groups respectively out of a maximum score of 100 and get the mean score of the control group 68.75, and that of the experimental group 76.00, as shown in Table 2.

There are ten sentences for each lesson, and totally seven lessons. We present the comparison of zai and le from Lesson 1 to Lesson 4, that of zhe and le in Lesson 5, V1 zhe V2 structure in Lesson 6 and the comparison among zhe, zai, and le in Lesson 7, see Appendix I. The patterns of target sentences in every unit were based on the representative literature (Li & Thompson, 2005; Lin, 2002; Liu, 1997; Pan, 1996; Smith, 1997 Wu & Kuo, 2003; Wu, 2003, 2007; Xiao & McEnery, 2004; Yeh, 1993). Words in the CFL program came from the Mandarin 800 Words for Beginner provided by the Steering Committee for the Test of Proficiency-Hanyu (SC-TOP).9 In order to establish content validity of the CFL program designed in our study, we invited two linguistics scholars and two senior Mandarin teachers whose inputs and feedback were useful. They were invited to review the CFL program, including the following interactive multimedia program and the computer-based grammar program. They judged the appropriateness of target sentences and their presentation. Thanks to their help, the content validity of the CFL program can be built."]},{"title":"2.2.1.1 The Interactive Multimedia Program","paragraphs":["We digitalized the CFL program as above mentioned as the interactive multimedia program based on Concise Narrated Animation10 (Mayer, 2001). In the program, the semantics of the target sentences were expressed by animation11 and their syntactic structures were visual and audio narrated.12 For example, in terms of the comparison between zai, and le of Lesson one, the animation expressed the progressing meaning of zai sentences and the completive meaning of le sentences; the words and voices showed their syntactic structure in Chinese Traditional Character and Hanyu Pinyin, and their pronunciation. Besides, each lesson was followed by an interactive exercise which offered learners to do the drills. Each interactive exercise contained five to six items and most of these items were from  9 According to The Steering Committee for the Test of Proficiency-Huayu (SC-TOP), those who have learned Chinese more than half a year are familiar with these 800 words, shown on the following website http://www.sc-top.org.tw/download/800Words_Beginners.pdf . 10 Concise Narrated Animation (CNA), a simple principle to present multimedia, ignores the unneeded materials and shows the most important part of ready-to-learn knowledge. 11 All of the animation in the program is designed by the graduate and undergraduates in Department of E-learning Design and Management in National Chiayi University. 12 Please see the website http://web.ncyu.edu.tw/~wujs/le_zhe_zai/index.swf for the interactive multimedia program. 272    the target sentences of the program and they were designed based on two content objectives: (i) Users are able to comprehend the interpretation of the interaction of zai, zhe, and le with their compatible events. (ii) Users are able to know the collocation of these three aspect markers with events. For example, through doing the exercise ‘Look at the animation and move zai and le’, the users are expected to comprehend the semantics and the syntactic structure of zai and le, shown as Figure 2.

An example of the exercise in the grammar program"]},{"title":"2.2.2 Pretest and Posttest","paragraphs":["The pretest consisted of three parts for 25 questions, as shown in Appendix II. Most of these questions came from the target sentences in our CFL program and the content validity was established as a result of the review of the scholars and senior teaching CFL teachers as previously mentioned. Regarding the first part including 10 questions, the participants put words in an appropriate order. Its purpose was to test CFL beginners’ comprehension of the syntactic structures of le, zai, and zhe. As to the second part of 10 questions, the participants choose a sentence that can best describe the clip 14 given for each question. It was to assess their understanding of the semantics of the target aspect markers le, zai, and zhe. In the third part including 5 questions, the participants produce a sentence by using the words provided based on the given clip. Through their production, we evaluated their comprehension of target aspect markers. Concerning the posttest, it was formed by shifting the questions in the pretest. In order to ensure item analyses and reliability of the pretest and the posttest, we conducted a pilot study. The pilot study was given to 21 CFL learners who study Mandarin in Taiwan. They are 16 females and 5 males. The amount of time they have studied Mandarin ranged from three months to one and half a year. Their age is from 19 to 35 year-old. Most of them learned le and zai while a few of them learned zhe. They were asked to spend 20 minutes on our pretest without any discussion based on what they saw on the computer screen which showed questions one by one.  14 Some of the clips were directed and performed by us, and the others were retrieved from the website","http://www.youtube.com/. 274    After the test, the score of each participant was calculated by the percentage of correct answer out of a maximum score of 100. Then, item difficulty (P) and item discrimination (D) indexes were examined. The mean item difficulty15 0.63 and the mean item discrimination16 0.36 indicate both the pretest and the posttest are moderate for difficulty and good for discrimination. Regarding the reliability of the pretest, it was established by the Cronbach’s alpha. 17 The Cronbach’s alpha 0.77 of the test showed that both of the pretest and the posttest are reliable of testing comprehension of the target aspect markers le, zai and zhe."]},{"title":"2.3 Procedure","paragraphs":["Before the experiment, all participants were given the pretest online18 for 20 minutes.

After the pretest, participants were divided into two groups randomly. The experimental group consisted of 19 participants and the control group 16. For an average twenty minutes of a three-day period, the experimental group studied le, zai and zhe through the multimedia program and the control group learned these markers through the computer-based grammar program. After a three-day learning period, all participants were informed to take the 20-minute immediate posttest online 19 and a questionnaire that surveyed learner perceptions and perceived effects as well. Also, the one-month delayed posttest online was given to all of the participants. 20 "]},{"title":"2.4 Data analysis","paragraphs":["After the data collection, the pretest was calculated, using the percentage of correct answers out of a maximum 100. Moreover, an independent T-test was used to establish the homogeneity between the control group and the experimental group before the experiment. The result showed that there was no significant difference between these two groups before using their programs as a self-learning tool. As to the immediate posttest and the delayed posttest after the experiment, it was also computed by using the percentage of correct answers out of a maximum 100. For Research Question, we examined if the multimedia program involved in the experimental group is more effective than the computer-based grammar program in the control group in terms of the semantics and the syntactic behavior of the target aspect markers le, zai and zhe. We used independent T-test to examine if any significant difference between these two groups.  15 In practice, item difficulty is classified as “easy” if the index is 85% or above; “moderate” if it is between 51% and 84%; and “hard” if it is 50% or below. 16 Generally speaking, item discrimination is identified as “good” if the index is above 30%; “fair” if it is between 10% ad 30%; “poor” if it is below 10%. 17 The reliability of a test refers to the extent to which the test is likely to produce consistent scores. In practice, the acceptable range is from 0.70 to 0.80. 18 Please go to the website http://web.ncyu.edu.tw/~wujs/pretest.html for the pretest. 19 As to the immediate posttest online, please click on http://web.ncyu.edu.tw/~wujs/posttest.html. 20 The questions in the one-month delayed posttest are the same as those in the immediate posttest. 275    Further, in order to increase the precision of group mean estimate and built a convincing result for this study, Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) was used to reanalyze the data.21  In addition, the questionnaires collected from the participants showed their perceptions and perceived effects toward the programs."]},{"title":"3. Results and Discussion","paragraphs":["In this section, we answered Research Question: In contrast with the computer-based grammar program, is the interactive multimedia program designed in the study more effective on helping CFL beginners with comprehension of the aspect markers le, zai and zhe ? First, an independent T-test was performed to compare performances between the interactive multimedia group and the computer-based grammar group. There was a detailed descriptive statistics in Table 3. Table 3. Independent T-test results between two groups Group N M SD t Experimental 19 91.79 9.84 3.326** Control 16 78.25 14.16 Note. Maximum score = 100, **p = < .01 In Table 3, the figure indicated that there was a significant difference between the mean scores of 19 experimental subjects (M = 91.79) and 16 control subjects (M=78.25, t=3.326, p=.002). The result revealed that the interactive multimedia group as a self-learning tool on 19 experimental subjects significantly outperformed the computer-based grammar program on 16 control subjects. That is to say, the answer to Research Question is positive. The multimedia program with animation for presenting the target sentences is more effective than the computer-based grammar program with English explanation. Then, a paired T-test was used to examine performances of members within each group. The paired T-test results of 19 experimental subjects in Table 4 indicated that there was a significant difference (t=-7.414 , p=.000) between the mean scores of the pretest (M=76.00) and the posttest (M=91.79).

Next, the paired T-test was employed to examine the retention phenomenon within each group. We compared the mean scores of the posttest to that of the delayed posttest within each group. The following Table 6 indicated there was no significant difference (t=-1.099, p=.286) between the posttest and the delayed posttest in the experimental group. As for the control group, Table 7 also showed no significant difference (t=-1.013, p=.327) between the posttest and the delayed posttest. As above suggested, the retention phenomenon existed in the two groups. Table 6.

As we can see from the Table 8, the calculated value of F=7.83 is significant (p < .05). The figure indicated that there was a significant difference between the multimedia group and the computer-based grammar group. As a result of the adjusted mean (M = 72.69) score of the pretest, the mean score of the posttest was changed to 90.24 from 91.79 in the experimental group and to 80.09 from 78.25 in the control group based on Table 9 for the mean scores of the posttest evaluated at the covariate and Table 10 for the mean scores of the posttest. More specifically, in case of ANOVA, the significant difference existed between the experimental group and the control group. 277    Table 8. An ANCOVA Summary Table of these two groups.

For the interactive multimedia program, most students including the older participants were satisfied with it and expressed their interest in learning the abstract aspect markers through the animation expressing the semantics of the target sentences. For example, they are looking forward to the next program for the intermediate level CFL learners. Also, they identified that the comparison among le, zai, and zhe interacting with events helped them to comprehend their usage. One suggested that adding more target sentences interacting with le, zai, and zhe to the multimedia program and more test items to the interactive exercises can make them learn more about aspect markers. On the contrary, as to the computer-based program, a few of the learners got benefit from it as a result of the curriculum comparing the usage of the target aspect markers interacting with events. However, some of them claimed that the animation or picture if adding to the English 278    corresponding sentences of the target sentences increase their understanding of these aspect markers."]},{"title":"3. Conclusion","paragraphs":["The results of the present study were summarized by pointing out that the significant effectiveness on the learning of three aspect markers le, zai, and zhe through the interactive multimedia program in contrast with the computer-based grammar program. The animation presenting the semantics of the target aspect markers interacting with events in the interactive multimedia program is the key point that makes the experimental group outperformed significantly the control group, in which the meaning of target sentences were expressed by English translation. The animation can express the abstract concept of aspect markers instead of English grammar translation or explanation which exist in most of the CFL textbooks. For pedagogical implication, the study provides contribution to the computer-based assisted teaching or learning tool in the classroom. Nevertheless, the present study is not without limitations, as discussed below. The first limitation concerns the assessment of participants’ language level. Only acquiring their language background from questionnaire or their CFL teachers cannot assess their actual level. The amount of time that the participants studied Chinese varies, also the familiarity with these three aspect markers. In addition, participants from 3 different institutes may receive different input and teaching methods which provide participants various bases in acquiring these three aspect markers, In this case, the generalization of the results is limited. Next, the target sentences in the program adopted from the representative literature is limited. Learners using the program may learn small parts of target sentences with le, zai, and zhe which may not be proved very practical in our daily conversation although they learned their different usage. Therefore, the content of the program in our study is limited to cover all kinds of usages concerning about target aspect markers. Regarding the future studies, we look forward to the multimedia program of aspect markers for intermediate-level CFL learners and predict its effectiveness. In order to include more practical usage of aspect markers, we will refer corpus data for the target sentences. Further, the CFL learners’ proficiency will be assessed based on the approved proficiency test, such as Test of Proficiency-Huayu in Taiwan. Reference Ellis, Rod. (1985).
