Therefore, it is important for natural language processing systems to extract new words in progression with time.

This paper proposes a scheme of word extraction in which histogram equalization for feature normalization is used. Through this scheme, the mismatch of the feature distributions due to different corpus sizes or changes of domain can be compensated for appropriately such that unknown word extraction becomes more reliable and applicable to novice domains. The scheme was initially evaluated on the corpora announced in SIGHAN2. 68.43% and 71.40% F-measures for word identification, which correspond to 66.72%/32.94% and 75.99%/58.39% recall rates for IV/OOV, respectively, were achieved for the CKIP and the CUHK test sets, respectively, using four combined features with equalization.

Introduction","paragraphs":["With the evolution of human lives and the accelerated spread of information, new words are created quickly as new things emerge every day. It is then necessary for natural language processing systems to identify and learn new words to progress with time. Chinese word segmentation systems, for example, typically utilize large dictionaries collected over a long period of time. No matter the size of the vocabulary for the dictionaries, it is hardly possible for them to include all of the words or phrases that have been invented so far in the extensive knowledge domains, not to mention to predict in advance new terms to appear in the future. Therefore, it is more practical for Chinese word segmentation systems to use dynamic dictionaries that can be updated quickly and frequently with the new words found in the corpora of the desired domains. Hence, unknown word extraction is actually essential for quite a few natural language processing systems. It is also useful for exploring hot or new terms for desired knowledge domains or internet communities.","The approaches to unknown word extraction can be roughly divided into two categories, rule-based approaches and statistical approaches. For rule-based approaches, semantic rules for specific types of words, such as the names of humans, places, and organizations, normally are specially designed (Sun et al., 1994). For statistical approaches, statistical features in corpora typically have been computed and used for the decision in the threshold test. Occurrence frequency, for example, is a widely used feature (Lu et al., 2004). In such approaches, the threshold is often obtained heuristically and might depend highly on the corpus. In addition, statistical approaches and rule-based approaches can be combined. Some approaches have used statistical features obtained from the corpus and have designed rules for various types of unknown words based on these features, through which even the unknown words with low occurrence frequency can be extracted (Chen et al., 2002). For most of the approaches, the decision rules are obtained from the training corpus heuristically, and perhaps cannot be applied to the testing domain. Therefore, use of machine learning approaches with more general features is suggested in order to obtain the decision boundary by learning automatically. Liang, for example, proposed a tri-syllable filter for screening the word candidates and the artificial neural network with statistical features for the final decision (Liang et al., 2000). Nevertheless, the trained artificial neural network is not shown to be able to be applied to novice domains. Besides, Goh et al. made use of the character features (the POS and position) in support vector machine to extract new words (Goh et al., 2003).","To reduce the dependency of the word extraction scheme on the training corpus so that use in diverse or novice domains becomes possible, this paper utilizes the machine learning   Histogram Equalization on Statistical Approaches for 43 Chinese Unknown Word Extraction approaches to combine the statistical features. Histogram equalization for statistical features was further introduced to compensate for the mismatch between the training and testing corpora that might come from the difference in corpus size or the change of the domain. It is then unnecessary to retrain the model parameters, and the extraction approach becomes more general for new domains. This scheme was first evaluated on SIGHAN2 corpora for traditional Chinese provided by Chinese Knowledge Information Processing Group (CKIP) and City University of Hong Kong (CUHK). When combing four heterogeneous statistical features, DLG, AV, Link, and PreC, and applying histogram equalization for DLG, the F-measures of 68.43% and 71.40% for within-domain CKIP corpus and cross-domain CUHK corpus, respectively, can be achieved. This scheme was finally used to explore unknown words in a novice domain of a news event. When compared with the words extracted by two word segmentation systems provided by CKIP and Institute of Computing Technology Chinese Academy of Science (ICTCAS), it was found that this approach is complementary with the other two. Such terms as “海角七號\"(Cape No. 7, the name of a film), “蠟筆小 新\"(Crayon Shinchan, the name of a figure in a cartoon), “金融海嘯\"(Financial Tsunami), and so on, with prominent statistical characteristics but less structure in semantics, can be extracted successfully by the proposed approach only. These terms are hard to identify using rule-based approaches because it is difficult to draw semantic rules from such terms. Without using semantic rules, however, this extraction approach seems less robust for extracting the names of humans, places, or organizations with prominent structure. This, however, could be overcome by integrating the proposed scheme with the rule-based approaches."]},{"title":"2. Statistical Features","paragraphs":["Every sentence in a Chinese corpus contains a sequence of characters. If every combination of adjacent characters in a sentence must be considered as a word candidate, there would be huge number of word candidates where a large portion would be redundant. Therefore, every combination of adjacent characters, denoted as “character group” in this paper, needs to be screened first so the total number of word candidates can be reduced to a manageable size and the statistics could be computed. The occurrence count for each character group, i.e. the character n-gram, is computed and used as one of the screening criteria. Those character groups with length less than eight and with occurrence count more than or equal to five are accepted as word candidates.

In Equation 2, L(X) is the entropy of the corpus containing the word candidate Ti, while L(X[@→ Ti]) is the entropy of the corpus with Ti replaced by the token \"@\". Therefore, DLG(Ti) indicates the entropy reduction due to the elimination of the word candidate Ti in the corpus, or equivalently the information gain of the corpus contributed by including the word candidate Ti.

The access variety for a character group is evaluated by counting the number of different characters in its left or right context. If the access variety is high, it implies the character group is often used independently in diverse contexts and tends to be a word. On the contrary, low access variety implies that the character   Histogram Equalization on Statistical Approaches for 45 Chinese Unknown Word Extraction group is often used together with specific characters, and thus tends to be a part of a word instead of being a word itself.

Since such prefix characters are of high frequency, their combinations with other words (e.g. “在台北”, “在拍 攝” or “在學校”) might also be of high frequency. This induces quite a few false alarms when only occurrence count is used for word extraction.

In other words, the higher the independence of the prefix character, the less probable that the candidate is a word."]},{"title":"2.6 Normalization","paragraphs":["As the statistical features defined above are computed from the corpus, the dynamic range of the features for the training and the testing corpora might be different when the corpus is obtained from different domains and has a different size.

Word Extraction Method 3.1 Distribution of Statistical Features","paragraphs":["Since the statistical features in this paper are obtained from the corpora, both the dynamic range and the distribution for the features might change. Although a normalization formula is introduced in Section 2.6 to deal with the problem, it is probably not sufficient for compensating for the mismatch of the feature distributions between the training and testing corpora, which often leads to performance degradation when the statistical approach is applied to new domains. In this section, we analyze how the histograms for the statistical features   Histogram Equalization on Statistical Approaches for 47 Chinese Unknown Word Extraction might differ between various domains.","The SIGHAN2 corpora, provided by CKIP and CUHK, respectively, are used for analysis here. First, the CKIP corpus was randomly and equally divided into two sets, named as the CKIP_Train set for training and the CKIP_Test set for testing, respectively. CKIP_Test can be regarded as the within-domain test set. The corpus provided by CUHK is used as the cross-domain test set, and named as CUHK_Test set. The histograms of DLG feature for the CKIP_Train and CKIP_Test sets are depicted in Figure 1(a), while those for the CKIP_Train and CUHK_Test sets are shown in Figure 1(b). In Figure 1(a), it could be observed that, for corpora in the same domain with compatible sizes, the dynamic ranges of the DLG feature are very close, while the distributions still differ a little. It can also be noticed that, in Figure 1(b), the histograms for CUHK_Test set and the CKIP_Train set differ more prominently. Not only the dynamic ranges but also the shapes of the distributions differ for the two sets. If the classifier is trained with the CKIP_Train set and tested with the CUHK_Test set, the DLG feature appears useless without being further calibrated. More sophisticated normalization schemes will be discussed in the following section.

Xs: the feature value obtained from the source domain. Xd: the feature value for the destination domain. Note that the source domain denotes the testing domain, while the destination domain denotes the training domain. This is because the classifier was trained with the training corpus, so the features for the testing corpus should be transformed back to the training domain to match the distribution of the training data as much as possible. MSW is a linear normalization scheme according to the distance between the feature value and the mean measured with the standard deviation. When the shapes of the distributions differ largely between the source and the destination domains, such a mismatch cannot be compensated for simply by linear shift or scaling, and MSW might not be effective enough.","Another normalization scheme, histogram equalization, denoted as HEQ here, was first introduced in image processing community and used for enhancing the contrast of an image (Hummel et al., 1977; Efford 2000). As HEQ is a common technique for adjusting the statistics of the features via transformation, it can be used to compensate for the mismatch between different domains. This technique was successfully applied to such areas as speech or music processing for compensating for the mismatch of statistical features between the training and the testing domains (Ángel de la Torre et al., 2005; Gallardo-Antolín et al. 2010). The transfer function of histogram equalization is described as follows. Xd = P(Xs).( XMAX – XMIN ) + XMIN (8) Xs: the input feature from source domain. Xd: the output feature of destination domain. P(X): the cumulative distribution function in the source domain. PEQ(X): equalized cumulative distribution function in the destination domain. XMAX: the maximum value for the feature. XMIN: the minimum value for the feature.   Histogram Equalization on Statistical Approaches for 49 Chinese Unknown Word Extraction Figure 2 illustrates how histogram equalization is performed. P(X) is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of feature X in the source domain, as denoted by the solid curve, while PEQ(X) is the equalized cumulative distribution function in the destination domain, as denoted by the dashed line. The transfer function between the input feature Xs and the output feature Xd has to make the equality, P(Xs) = PEQ(Xd), hold, which leads to Equation 8. Since the heuristic cumulative distribution function of the output feature, PEQ(Xd), is desired to be linear, the corresponding probability density function, i.e. the histogram, needs to be uniform (equalized). Both HEQ and MSW have monotonic transfer functions, but the transfer function for HEQ could be nonlinear, and its output features in the destination domain will fall into the same dynamic range from XMIN to XMAX as the input features in the source domain.","When applying HEQ to word extraction, the cumulative distribution functions of the features for the training and testing domains need to be computed first, and are here denoted as PTRAIN(X) and PTEST(X), respectively. In the training phase, the features obtained from the training domain (with CDF PTRAIN(X)) need to be transformed to the equalized domain according to Equation 8 so as to obtain the features for training. That is, the classifier is trained with the equalized features. In the classification phase, the features obtained from the testing domain (with CDF PTEST(X)) also need to be transformed to the equalized domain, and the classifier then performs classification for equalized features.","It should be noted that, for either MSW or HEQ, such statistics as mean, standard deviation, and CDF need to be computed first so the transformation of the features can be performed accordingly. This imposes an extra limitation to batch mode for the statistical approaches since the testing corpus for computing statistics needs to be collected beforehand."]},{"title":"3.3 Classifier Based on Multilayer Perceptrons","paragraphs":["The structures and rules for word formation in the Chinese language are so sophisticated that it is quite difficult to perform word identification based on a single feature.

If multiple decision features with complementary characteristics could be combined appropriately, better performance could be obtained in general. In this paper, a classifier based on multilayer perceptrons (MLP) is used for word verification. MLP is a machine learning approach based on nonlinear regression. In order to minimize the square errors, the gradient descent algorithm is applied, and the connection weights in the network are updated iteratively according to the errors propagated backwards till the estimation error converges. Figure 3 is the proposed word verification scheme for combining multiple features with an advanced normalization scheme. In this paper, the MLP classifier contains 3 layers of neurons and is trained 50000 times iteratively. The hidden layer contains five neurons, while the number of neurons for the input layer depends on how many features are used for training and testing. For every word candidate, the features LogC, AV, Link, PreC, and DLG, were computed with Equations 1 through 5 and normalized with Equation 6. The feature DLG was further processed with the advanced normalization scheme, HEQ or MSW, because of the significant difference between the histograms for the training and the testing data. In the selection module, features were combined to form the input vector x of the MLP classifier, whose output y is between 0 and 1. Through a threshold test on the output y, it can finally be decided whether the word candidate is accepted as a word. This word verification scheme, together with the screening process for word candidates as proposed in Section 2, can be used as a preprocessing stage for such NLP tasks as chunking or word segmentation to explore new terms quickly and efficiently for novice domains, such as news events or emerging communities.

That is, no information regarding to the local context of a candidate is tracked or used in word verification. The details of the experimental corpora are depicted in Table 1."]},{"title":"Table 1. Details of experimental corpora.","paragraphs":["First, the basic experiments of word verification were conducted using at least four types of features based on the architecture in Figure 3, but the advanced normalization scheme, MSW or HEQ, was not applied in this test. Here, CKIP_Train was used for training while CKIP_Train, CKIP_Test, and CUHK_Test were used for testing, respectively, and the results were shown in Table 2. In Table 2, ALL denotes all of the five features defined in Section 2 were used, while the others denote one of the five features was excluded. “No_LogC,” for example, means that the feature LogC was excluded, so the other four features were used as the input features. It can be seen in Table 2 that nearly optimal F-measures of 60.09%, 60.03%, and 63.03% can be achieved for the three corpora, respectively, through combining the four features DLG, AV, Link, and PreC where logC is excluded (No_LogC). This implies the feature LogC appears to be redundant and relatively replaceable. This is partly because the occurrence count is included in the more informative feature, Link, defined by Eq. 4. Therefore, in later experiments, the feature LogC was not used. We can also find in Table 2 that the recall rates for OOV words were worse than the In-Vocabulary (IV) words for CKIP_Test and CUHK_Test sets. This is because the classifier is trained by IV words and non-words in CKIP_Train. We hope the word detector trained with more IV words can achieve more sufficient training and grasp the major stochastic characteristics of IV words such that it could detect novel terms with similar stochastic characteristics in novice domains.

As can be seen in this figure, after applying HEQ for the feature DLG, the optimum F-measure rises significantly from 60.03% to 68.43%, but there is hardly any improvement achievable by applying MSW. The reason is probably that the dynamic ranges of DLG for the training and testing domains, as depicted in Figure 1(a), are almost the same, so MSW, which simply shifts and scales the features, becomes unhelpful.

This is similar to the robustness issue, where the robustness approaches for compensating for the mismatch between two environments usually incur the side effect of degrading the performance if the mismatch does not exist. In addition, for PreC, the histograms are very sparse and jerky with many zeros in bins, since many word candidates might share the independence of a prefix character. Therefore, it is not easy to model the cumulative distribution functions smoothly so HEQ can be well applied, and the results are not shown here.","Further, the same experiments were conducted for cross-domain testing data. That is, the CKIP_Train corpus was used for training while the CUHK_Test corpus was used for testing. The experimental results are shown in Figure 5. As can be observed in this figure, both MSW and HEQ can help improve the verification performance, but apparently the improvement for HEQ is more prominent. When comparing Figure 5 with Figure 4, it can be observed that the trend of MSW for the cross-domain test differs from that for the within-domain test. This is because, in Figure 1(b), the values of the cross-domain features become significantly smaller, which leads to rejections and degrades the verification performance. Such a problem can be alleviated slightly by MSW, which shifts the values, though the improvement is limited.

Unknown Word Extraction for Novice Domain","paragraphs":["In this section, the word extraction scheme was applied to a novice domain. First, the corpus of the novice domain was collected from a news website in 2009 using the keyword of a news event, “八八水災” (the flood on August 8th","). This corpus was used for test and denoted as UKW_Test. From 32,207 sentences in the corpus, 81,447 word candidates were extracted in accordance with the screening criteria in Section 2. Statistical features for these candidates were then computed and used as the input for the classifier trained with the corpus CKIP_Train. The system architecture is similar to that in Figure 3, but the threshold test for each candidate is not applied here. Instead, the classifier outputs between 0 and 1 for all the candidates sorted so as to obtain the 10,000 out of 81,447 candidates with the highest scores. The 10,000 candidates then were regarded as those words accepted by the classifier, while the other 71,477 candidates were regarded as rejected."]},{"title":"5.1 Labeling the Ground Truths","paragraphs":["The main problem in applying word extraction in a novice domain is that there is no consensus about the definition of words for the Chinese language; therefore, it is difficult to decide the ground truth for every candidate. The CKIP corpus and CUHK corpus, for example, have different criteria for word defined by the organizations. Table 4 displays some sentences in which the definitions of some words are different. As can be observed in this table, “奶粉 錢\"(fee for milk) is regarded as a word in the CUHK corpus, but segmented into “奶 粉”(milk) and “錢” (fee) in the CKIP corpus. Since such discrepancies exist, our strategy for labeling the ground truths here is to use two word segmentation systems to segment the test corpus, and accept a word candidate as a word if a consensus between the two systems can be reached. Those terms with discrepancy between the two systems then are inspected manually and labeled. Here, the two systems used in this paper are the web services of word segmentation provided by CKIP and ICTCAS, respectively."]},{"title":"Table 4.

Each of the 81,447 word candidates obtained previously was checked to see if it was included in the vocabulary set. For CKIP and ICTCAS systems there were 11,290 and 10,642 candidates included in the two vocabulary sets, respectively, as depicted in Figure 6(a). This means 11,290 candidates were accepted as words by the CKIP system while 10,642 candidates were accepted by the ICTCAS system. The intersection of the two sets, containing 9,802 word candidates, were confirmed as words and used to label the basic ground truths since each of them was agreed upon by both systems. After the ground truths were labeled, the 10,000 words previously extracted with our approach can be compared with the 9,802 words in the intersection, i.e. the set of referenced answers. When the two sets were compared, it could be found 6,577 words were successfully identified in our approach, which corresponds to 67.09% recall rate provided the 9,802 words are used as target. The other 3,423 extracted words were accepted by our approach but not contained in the referenced answers. After manual inspection, 1,179 out of the 3,423 extracted words were labeled as acceptable answers while the others (2,224) were regarded as non-words, as shown in Figure 6(b). As a consequence, totally 7,756 (6,577 + 1,179) out of the 10,000 extracted words are either equal to the referenced answers or regarded acceptable, which corresponds to 77.56% precision rate.

This does not matter, however, since our concern here is how many extra terms outside the training corpus each system can extract and how they differ. In addition, for our approach, the number of extracted words can be controlled by adjusting the verification threshold, and set as 10,000 here because this is compatible with the number of words obtained by the CKIP/ICTCAS systems and manageable for laborious manual inspection. If more unknown words are desired, this can also be accomplished by simply lowering the threshold so as to accept more words in word verification."]},{"title":"Table 5.

This implies that there are quite a few words for which consensus among the approaches cannot be reached. Some examples in the mutually exclusive results for these approaches are shown in Table 6 for illustration. Table 6(a), for example, lists some words that were extracted by our approach but not by the other two. As can be seen in Table 6(a), some hot or novice words, such as “海 角七號” (Cape No. 7, the name of a film), “蠟筆小新” (Crayon Shinchan, the name of a figure in a cartoon), “金融海嘯”(Financial Tsunami), “批踢踢”(PTT, the name of a web site), can be successfully extracted only by our approach.

Conclusion","paragraphs":["This paper proposes a more reliable word extraction scheme by combining multiple statistical features based on machine learning approaches. Since the formation and the structure for Chinese words are sophisticated, it is generally not robust enough to extract words simply according to single feature. This paper combined four features of the word candidates with diverse statistical characteristics to achieve the optimal performance, including the DLG that conveys the information for entropy gain with respect to the corpus, the AV for the usage context, the Link for the evidences of the internal structure, and the PreC for the independence of the prefix character. This scheme was initially verified on the CKIP corpus announced in SIGHAN2, and the performance of F-measure at 60.03% was achieved for within-domain test.","This scheme was further applied to the study of statistical mismatch problem between the training the testing domains. The difference of corpus size and the change of domain might lead to difference of dynamic range or distribution for the features, which inevitably degrades the verification performance. Histogram equalization proposed in this paper can compensate for the mismatch of DLG features effectively; thus, it is unnecessary to rebuild the training data for every desired testing domain or to worry about the incompatibility of the feature distributions due to different sizes of corpora. When this scheme of word extraction was evaluated on the within-domain test corpus provided by CKIP and cross-domain test corpus by CUHK, the F-measures can be improved from 60.03% and 63.03% to 68.43% and 71.40%, respectively, by equalization.","Finally, this scheme was used to explore a novice domain for a news event of the flood in Taiwan on Aug. 8th","2009. We proposed a strategy of labeling the ground truths for novice domains according to the consensus between two word segmentation systems. Experimental results show that this scheme can successfully identify some pronouns with prominent statistical tendency but without apparent semantic structure, which cannot be reliably identified with rule-based approaches. This scheme, however, is less robust for extracting those terms whose patterns are static with prominent semantic structure, since it is based on the statistical features instead of the semantic rules. Due to the functional complementation, it is promising to integrate this scheme with other rule-based approaches."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Sun, M.S., Huang, C.
