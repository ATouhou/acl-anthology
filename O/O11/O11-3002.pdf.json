Introduction 1.1 Motivation","paragraphs":["Anaphora is an instance of an expression referring to the preceding utterances. Effective anaphora resolution enhances understanding of a text and facilitates many applications of natural language processing. The resolution involves anaphor recognition and referent recognition. In Chinese texts, anaphors can be missing or be present as pronouns, demonstratives and definite descriptions. Common pronouns are like “他” (“he, him”), “她” (“she, her”), “它” (“it”), “我們” (“we, us”), “他們” (“they, them”); demonstratives are “這” (“this”), ”那” (“that”) and definite description are like the pattern “這+[quantifier ]+noun phrase.” Without concerning zero anaphora, about 54% of the explicit anaphors are pronouns, 40% are definite descriptions, and 6% are demonstratives in a corpus containing 20 news articles.","Essentially, the challenges involved with Chinese anaphora resolution are attributed to the complexities of Chinese sentence structures. It is known that although a Chinese sentence  ∗ College of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C. E-mail: tliang@cs.nctu.edu.tw; sunrise0406.iit97g@g2.nctu.edu.tw   16 Tyne Liang and Jyun-Hua Cheng features the subject-verb-object order, the sentence may be formed by a series of verbs or by pronoun or subject dropping, thus making sentence parsing difficult. Moreover, there is no blank space between adjacent words in Chinese sentences, making word or noun phrase identification difficult. Unlike most previous research projects focusing on non-abstract anaphora resolution, this paper addresses the definite anaphora in Chinese written texts and presents empirical parser-free approaches to resolve abstract anaphors, like ”這項方案” (“this plan”). The resolution is based on the linking between anaphors and their referents in multiple aspects of contextual, semantic and surface features. Among them, semantic features are extracted with the help of three outer resources, namely, Tongyici Cilin1","(TYCC for short), CKIP Lexicon2",", and Google search results3",". Additionally, the features extracted from different discourse units are investigated and the best feature set is verified at referent identification. In the experiments, both SVM-based and salience models are implemented for model comparison. Experimental results show that the features extracted from clauses are more useful than those extracted from sentences for anaphora resolution. Besides, the presented salience-based model outperforms the SVM-based model regardless of whether the best set of extracted features is employed or not."]},{"title":"1.2 Abstract Definite Anaphora","paragraphs":["In Chinese texts, a definite anaphor contains a demonstrative (tagged as “Nep” by CKIP Chinese word segmentation system4","(CKIP tagger for short)) followed with an optional quantifier (tagged as “Nf”) and a noun phrase. Lexicons with Nep-tag are like ”這, 此, 其, 那, 什麼, 其中, 個中, 甚, 啥, 哪, 斯, 甚麼”. Such anaphora is similar to the definite description anaphora in English texts in which the anaphors are composed of the definite article “the” followed by a noun phrase. In fact, there is no definite article in Chinese, so we may treat the definite noun “the+noun phrase” and demonstrative noun “this or that+noun phrase” to be the same in Chinese texts. In this paper, we focus on the “這+[quantifier]+ abstract-type noun phrase” anaphor since it is frequently expressed in Chinese texts. The abstract noun phrases are defined and categorized according to CKIP Lexicon. Table 1 shows some target anaphor instances we identified from our corpus.","Abstract definite anaphora can be expressed in two ways. One is direct anaphora in which both the referent and the anaphor contain the same head noun. For example, both anaphor ”這項方案” (this plan”) and its referent ”學生停車方案” (“student parking plan”)  1 TongyiciCilin extended version: http://ir.hit.edu.cn/demo/ltp/Sharing_Plan.htm 2 CKIP (Chinese Knowledge Information Processing Group) Lexicon:","http://www.aclclp.org.tw/use_ckip_c.php 3 Google: http://www.google.com.tw 4 CKIP Chinese word segmentation system: http://ckipsvr.iis.sinica.edu.tw/   Resolving Abstract Definite Anaphora in Chinese Texts 17 contain the head noun “方案”. The other is indirect anaphora in which the anaphor “這項方 案” and its referent “課後輔導” (“after-school assistance”) do not contain the same head noun and their resolution has to be done by considering their linking in contextual, syntactic and semantic structures. More challenges associated with indirect anaphora resolution come from the boundary identification for those referents crossing multiple clauses or sentences. For example, “這項方案” refers to “學校計劃將強制要求所有過重學生放學後都要留下來,參 加二小時的體能訓練,直到學期結束。” (“The school will require all overweight students to remain after school to participate in two hours of physical training until the end of the term”). Besides, it is observed that Chinese texts are usually not written with accurate usage of punctuation marks; thus identifying such types of referents in Chinese texts is harder than in English texts."]},{"title":"Table 1.

Related Work","paragraphs":["In general, abstract anaphora can be resolved using pattern rules, statistical or hybrid approaches. For example, Byron (2002) presented PHORA to resolve pronouns referring to abstract entities in a dialogue corpus. The resolution is based on the semantic constraints imposed on verbs, predicate noun phrases and predicative adjectives in sentences. Later   18 Tyne Liang and Jyun-Hua Cheng Navarretta (2004) extended these semantic constraints with dialogue structures to resolve inter-sentential pronominal anaphors in Danish texts. Beside the rule-based approaches, Strube and Muller (2003) presented a decision tree resolution to identify both NP-type and non-NP antecedents with the employment of 23 features including NP and coreference features. The supervised learning method is also found in (Yang et al., 2006) for pronoun resolution by taking into account the coreferential information of a candidate. In addition, some researches have tried to resolve indirect nominal anaphora via web search (Bunescu, 2003), WordNet (Poesio et al., 2002), or statistical models like multi-layer perceptrons (Poesio et al., 2004).","In contrast to the prevalent discussion on English anaphora, effective approaches to tackle Chinese abstract anaphora have not been widely discussed. Either parsing-tree based or machine based approaches have been primarily presented to resolve noun-phrase type references (Yeh & Chen, 2004; Zhao & Ng, 2007; Wu & Liang, 2008, 2009, 2011; Kong & Zhou, 2010). Nevertheless, it is observed that the average length of the referents includes more than one clause in a corpus like the news reports we extracted from Academia Sinica Balanced Corpus5","(ASBC for short). Hence, this paper is motivated to present some feasible methods to facilitate such type referent identification."]},{"title":"3. Corpus Preparation 3.1 Corpus Tagging","paragraphs":["The corpus we used for developing the resolution approach is extracted from ASBC, a corpus used for modern Chinese text processing research. For each extracted text, we manually tagged the target anaphors and filter out those “這” without a following noun phrase. For example, we would not use“這是” (“this is”), “這可能是” (“this might be”),...etc. We did not tag those ”這” if that functioned as discourse-new or cataphor.","The corpus contained 885 texts and out of which there were 24062 sentences and 82783 clauses identified by any of punctuation marks ( “。?!;”) and (”。?!;,”) respectively. Each clause was tagged with a sentence number si and a clause serial number cj. Each clause was also manually tagged with < anai> or < refi> if an anaphor i or a referent for anaphor i was found in that clause. There were total 1538 definite abstract anaphor instances occurring in the corpus. Followings are three tagged examples in which referents were shown in italic form and anaphors were shown with underlines.

There are some observations from our tagged corpus. First, there might be multiple referents for a tagged abstract anaphor. In our corpus, 25% of the anaphor instances referred to more than one referent. 59% of the tagged referents contained more than one clause. 52% of the referents occurred in three clauses away from their anaphors and more referents occurred in the preceding sentences than the ones in the same sentences. Besides, 90% of the addressed anaphors and their referents were far away in three sentences. In this paper, the tagged referents were should be in consecutive clauses if they are referred to the same anaphor."]},{"title":"3.2 The Target Referent","paragraphs":["Table 2 lists the statistical data of tagged anaphors and their referents.

The referent identifier is implemented with a statistical model and a salience model for model comparison. All referents are searched backward from the target anaphors. For identification comparison, we implemented both SVM-based (LIBSVM6",") and salience-based approaches on different discourse units, namely, single-clause, bi-clauses, and single sentence. Both models are incorporated with feature extraction which yields an optimal set of features and feature weights by running PyGene7",", a genetic algorithm tool in Python.

This is because the salience-based model is aimed at selecting the candidate that is the most relevant to the corresponding anaphor while the statistical model picks the relevant one only. On the other hand, clause-level approaches turn out to yield higher accuracy than sentence-level approaches.
