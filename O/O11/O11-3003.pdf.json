Introduction","paragraphs":["Natural language processing (NLP) is a well-known research area in computer science and has been successfully applied to handle and analyze modern textual material in the past decades.  ∗ Department of Computer Science, National Chengchi University, Taiwan E-mail: chaolin@nccu.edu.tw + National Chengchi University, Taiwan E-mail: gtqf1908@gmail.com # Institute of Chinese Studies, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong E-mail: gtqf1908@gmail.com ‡ Department of Chinese Literature, National Chengchi University, Taiwan § Department of History, National Chengchi University, Taiwan   28 Chao-Lin Liu et al. Whether we can extend the applications of current NLP techniques to historical Chinese text and in the humanistic context","(e.g., Xiang & Unsworth, 2006; Hsiang, 2011a; Hsiang, 2011b; Yu, 2012) is a challenge. Word senses and grammar have changed over time, and people have assigned different meanings to the same symbols, phrases, and word patterns.","We explored the applications of NLP techniques to support the study of historical issues, based on the textual material from three data sources. These include the Database for the Study of Modern Chinese Thoughts and Literature (DSMCTL),1","the Database of Government Officials of the Republic of China (DGOROC),2","and the Dream of the Red Chamber (DRC).3"," DSMCTL is a very large database that contains more than 120 million Chinese characters about Chinese history between 1830 and 1930. DGOROC includes government announcements starting from 1912 to the present. DRC is a famous Chinese novel that was composed in the Qing dynasty. These data sources offer great chances for researchers to study Chinese history and literature, and, due to the huge amount of content, computing technology is expected to provide meaningful help.","In this paper, we report how we employed NLP techniques to support historical studies. Chinese text did not contain punctuation until modern days, so we had to face not only the well-known Chinese segmentation problem but also the problem of missing sentence boundaries. In recent attempts, we applied the PAT Tree method (Chien, 1999) to extract frequent Chinese strings from the corpora, and we discovered that the distribution over the frequencies of these strings conforms to Zipf’s law (Zipf, 1949).","We investigated the issue of how the Qing government attempted to convert from an","imperial monarchy to a constitutional monarchy between 1905 and 1911, using the emperor’s","memorials (奏摺, zou4 zhe2) 4","about the preparation of constitutional monarchy.5","To this end,","we selected the keywords from the frequent strings with human inspection, and we applied  1 中國近現代思想及文學史專業數據庫 (zhong1 guo2 jin4 xian4 dai4 si1 xiang3 ji2 wen2 xue2 shi3 zhuan1 ye4 shu4 ju4 ku4): http://dsmctl.nccu.edu.tw/d_about_e.html, a joint research project between the National Chengchi University (Taiwan) and the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Hong Kong), led by Guantao Jin and Qingfeng Liu 2 中華民國政府官職資料庫 (zhong1 hua2 min2 guo2 zheng4 fu3 guan1 zhi2 zi1 liao4 ku4): http://gpost.ssic.nccu.edu.tw/.

We analyzed the co-occurrences, i.e., collocations, of the keywords over the years of interest, using the documents recorded in the diplomatic documents of the late Qing dynasty.6","","Detailed observations and discussions of this historical research are reported in two other papers (Jin et al., 2011; Jin et al., 2012) that will be presented in the Third Conference of Digital Archives and Digital Humanities.","While we have applied NLP techniques to support historical studies, we have also experienced some challenging problems at the lexical, syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic levels. For instance, what are the most appropriate computational functions that support a certain research need? Are the current databases good enough? We elaborate on these challenges based on our experience with the three data sources, i.e., DSMCTL, DGOROC, and DRC.","No one may expect that NLP techniques will replace the major role of historians in historical studies, but the techniques should be able to work with historians to make their studies more efficient and more effective. Empirical experience reported in this paper and the literature have demonstrated the potential of NLP techniques. With the help of computing technology, historians can delegate some search work and basic analysis to computers and spend more time on higher-level philosophical issues than before."]},{"title":"2. Zipf’s Law Applicability","paragraphs":["The Database for the Study of Modern Chinese Thoughts and Literature contains six genres of text material that were published between 1830 and 1930. Except for the first category, most of them were collected from the late Qing dynasty: modern periodicals, personal publications of the literati, diplomatic documents, newspapers, official documents, and translated works by western commissioners. Currently, the database contains more than 120 million simplified Chinese characters.7","  6 清季外交史料 (qing1 ji4 wai4 jiao1 shi3 liao4): http://zh.wikisource.org/zh-hant/清季外交史料選輯 7 DSMCTL was first built in a project led by Guantao Jin and Qingfeng Liu while they were with the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Due to budget constraints, the historical documents were sent to China, where the simplified Chinese was used, to be scanned and entered into computers. Hence, the earliest version of DSMCTL was in simplified Chinese. A traditional Chinese version of DSMCTL is still under development.   30 Chao-Lin Liu et al.","For modern Chinese information processing with NLP techniques, researchers rely on good machine readable lexicons and good methods to segment Chinese strings into Chinese words. Both of these infrastructural facilities are missing for the processing of non-modern Chinese text. Hence, we bootstrapped our work by computing frequent Chinese strings with the PAT Tree technique in the documents, and we asked historians to select relevant words from the frequent strings.","Table 1 shows the statistics about five collections in the DSMCTL database: Constitution","(清末立憲檔案), Diplomacy (清季外交史料), Min_Bow (民報),8","Nations (海國圖志),9","and","New_People (新民叢報).10","They contain about 11 million characters, about one tenth of the","whole DSMCTL database. We refer to strings that occurred more than 10 times11","in a","collection as pseudowords. Many of these pseudowords have specific meanings, but not all of","them do.","We ranked the pseudowords based on their frequencies, i.e., the most and the second most frequent pseudowords were ranked first and second, respectively. Then, we computed the logarithmic values of the ranks and frequencies, resulting in the curves in Figure 1. The curves in Figure 1 indicate that the pseudowords in the Chinese historical documents, like documents written in modern English and Chinese languages (Ha et al., 2003; Xiao, 2008), conform to Zipf’s law quite well (Zipf, 1949).    8 民報 (min2 bao4): http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/民報 9 海國圖志 (hai3 guo2 tu2 zhi4): http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/海國圖志 10 新民叢報 (sin1 min2 cong2 bao4): http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/新民叢報 11 The selection of 10 as the threshold was by the historians.

Temporal Analysis of Important Collocations","paragraphs":["A collocation is formed by two keywords that appeared “close” to each other in a statement. A collocation carries more specific semantic information than an individual keyword. The occurrence of the keyword “Chinese labor” (“华工,” hua2 gong1) could have referred to anything about Chinese labor, e.g., limiting (“限制,” xian4 zhi4) or protecting (“保护,” bao3 hu4) the Chinese labor, while a collocation “protect the Chinese labor” (“保护” and “华工”) provides more specific meaning than the individual keywords.","Nevertheless, given that there were neither word boundaries nor sentence boundaries in pre-modern Chinese documents. We chose to define “close” based only on the “distance” between two keywords.","A keyword was considered to be collocated with another if the keywords were less than 30 characters apart. Our computer programs were flexible in setting the window size for “closeness”. We defined the collocation window as the span of characters around a keyword that are considered “close”. We ran experiments where the sizes of the collocation windows were set to 10, 20, and 30 characters. A collocation window of 30 characters will consider 30 characters on the left and on the right side of a keyword. The historians observed the computed collocations and preferred the size of 30.","We analyzed the statistics of collocations in the documents about the concept of “Chinese People” (“華人,” hua2 ren2) in Diplomacy (cf. Table 1). We identified the keywords with the procedure that we applied to find individual keywords in Constitution that we explained in the previous section. Historians then chose the keywords of interest and we ran  14 筹备: chou2 bei4, preparation; 自治: zi4 zhi4, self-governance 15 http://www.google.com/trends/   Some Chances and Challenges in 35 Applying Language Technologies to Historical Studies in Chinese the computer programs to do the temporal analysis of the important collocations. This procedure is similar to the procedure that we used to obtain Figure 3; the only difference was whether the target of analysis was keywords or collocations.","Curves in Figure 4 show that the annual percentages of four collocations varied over the years between 1875 and 1909. Significantly large annual percentages again coincided with historical events of the given years. In 1894, the United States of America (USA) (“美国” (mei3 guo2) in the chart) and the Qing government signed a treaty to limit Chinese laborers (“华工”) entering the USA.16","In 1905, Chinese societies started to boycott American’s products, mostly because the USA would extend the treaty signed in 1894.17","Initially, the Qing dynasty was trying to protect only the Chinese laborers.

Discussion","paragraphs":["In this section, we discuss some technical problems related to using computing techniques to support historical studies in Chinese."]},{"title":"6.1 Lexical Ambiguity, Pragmatics, and Term Identity","paragraphs":["We have illustrated three possible applications of textual analysis for historical studies in previous sections. The applications were based on the frequencies of keywords in the collections. In NLP, we can refer to the frequencies of keywords as term frequencies. In addition, we relied on the “time stamps” of the documents, where the “time stamps” are the recorded times of the documents. Based on our dependence on the terms frequencies and time stamps, we obtained and presented the figures that we discussed in Sections 3 and 4.","In these examples, we presume that the frequencies reflect the importance of the concepts that are represented by the terms and collocations, and the results of our work are quite convincing. Nevertheless, we have to watch for the problems of lexical ambiguity and pragmatics that are hidden under the term frequencies.","For instance, frequently cited events of the past may induce confusion about the significance of term frequencies. Tu et al. (2011) discovered that, although “張公藝” (zhang1 gong1 yi4) was a Chinese name that appeared frequently in collections in the Taiwan History Digital Library (THDL), “張公藝” referred to a person who actually lived in the Tang dynasty"]},{"title":"Table 2.

The documents in THDL referred to“張公藝” because of a story that was well-known in the Qing dynasty (1644AD-1912AD). That the term frequency of “張公藝” is high in THDL does not imply that “張公藝” himself was an important person in Taiwan in the Qing dynasty.","Lexical ambiguity may make the term frequencies less reliable. Yu (2012) accentuates this issue with “民主” (min2 zhu3). In modern Chinese, “民主” is the word for “democracy”. Nevertheless, it could represent the emperor (民之主, min2 zhi1 zhu3), the American president, and the Republic (in 民主國, min2 zhu3 guo2) in non-modern Chinese text.","The first author of this paper examined the DGOROC, and found that “陳建中” was a very common name in the database. Hence, finding the actual identities of names is an important issue, in addition to computing the term frequencies. Distinguishing persons of the same name in modern databases requires extraordinary sources of private information.","Although differentiating persons with the same names is not easy, identifying names in Chinese text is not an easy task for the research of Named Entity Recognition (often referred to as NER (Wu et al., 2006)) in the first place. For instance, it may not be easy to extract names from Chinese text like “中央高層正醞釀安排令計畫接任中組部長”19","(zhong1 yang1 gao1 ceng2 zheng4 yun4 niang4 an1 pai2 ling4 ji4 hua4 jie1 ren4 zhong1 zu3 bu4 zhang3) if we do not know “令計劃” (ling4 ji4 hua4) is a name.20",""]},{"title":"6.2 Word Segmentation and Sentence Division","paragraphs":["In Section 6.1, we discuss the interpretation of a given term. In Chinese, however, we also have to define the concept of “term”. If we cannot define terms precisely, then we have no grounds for defining collocations. It is known that Chinese words are not separated by spaces like in alphabetic languages, and the task of separating Chinese words in Chinese text is generally called word segmentation (e.g., Ma & Chen, 2005; Jiang et al., 2006; Tseng et al., 2005). It is less known, however, that pre-modern Chinese text does not have punctuation, and readers also have to figure out the divisions of sentences (Huang, 2008).","Clearly, if we could not divide sentences and segment words correctly, we would not be able to acquire correct term frequencies. This may happen when we process text like “五行者 金主義木主仁水主智火主禮土主信” (wu3 xing2 zhe3 jin1 zhu3 yi4 mu4 zhu3 ren2 shui3 zhu3 zhi4 huo3 zhu3 li3 tu3 zhu3 xin4). We would have to add punctuation to divide this  18 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_Dynasty 19 Source: http://www.cbfcn.com/news_detail.aspx?strnew=1154 20 In fact, “令路線” (ling4 lu4 xian4), “令政策” (ling4 zheng4 ce4), “令完成” (ling4 wan2 cheng2), and “ 令方針” (ling4 fang1 jhen1) are also Chinese names (although they are quite unusual) : http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/令計劃   38 Chao-Lin Liu et al. string: “五行者,金主義,木主仁,水主智,火主禮,土主信”. After this step, we know that “智火” is not a term in the original string, although “智火” can be a meaningful term in modern Chinese.21","Given the divided string, we still have to face the word segmentation problem. In this example, each character in “金主義” represents a specific meaning. We cannot interpret “主義” in “金主義” as we would interpret “主義” (-ism) in “帝國主義” (di4 guo2 zhu3 yi4; imperialism) or “資本主義” (zi1 ben3 zhu3 yi4; capitalism) in modern Chinese. Similarly, we have to know that “金主” is not a term in the original string, although “金主” (a wealthy person) is a meaningful term in modern Chinese.","An actual problem took place when we used the DSMCTL to investigate whether energy conservation was a concern in the Qing dynasty (Chou et al., 2012). Without a Chinese segmenter for pre-modern Chinese, we found many occurrences of “能源” (neng2 yuan2) in the database, but, most of the time, “能源” was just a sub-string of “不能源源而來” (bu4 neng2 yuan2 yuan2 er2 lai2) when people talked about something that could not come indefinitely.22",""]},{"title":"6.3 Trends: Informative or Deceptive","paragraphs":["In Sections 3 and 4, we briefly introduced applications of temporal trends of keywords (Figure 3) and trends of collocations (Figure 4) that were more thoroughly discussed in Jin et al.

Chinese people encountered western culture more directly and more frequently starting from late 1500s. Transliteration and translation are important ways for people to use Chinese words to convey and understand western concepts and entities.","To study the interactions between the Chinese and western cultures in pre-modern times, getting to know the Chinese transliterations and translations is an important step. For instance, “president” was transliterated into “伯理璽” (bo2 li3 si2), “伯理喜頓” (bo2 li3 si2 dun4), “伯 理璽天德” (bo2 li3 si2 tian1 de2), and “伯力錫天德” (bo2 li3 si2 tian1 de2). Some Chinese characters were selected based on the pronunciations of “president”, and some were selected to show respect to the position of “president.” “Pacific Ocean” was translated into “大海” (da4 hai3), “大東洋” (da4 dong1 yang1), and “太洋海” (tai4 yang1 hai3), and transliterated into “卑西溢湖” (bei4 si1 yi1 hu2) and “比西非益海” (bi3 si1 fei1 yi4 hai3). The translations show people’s knowledge about the size and position of the Pacific Ocean. “Politics” was transliterated into “薄利第加” (bo2 li4 di4 jia1) and “波立特” (po2 li4 te4); both were transliterations.","Historians may spend their lifetimes identifying the translated and transliterated terms in historical documents. If one could provide researchers the Chinese terms for the western concepts and entities, the researchers would be able to investigate and understand how Chinese faced the West hundreds years ago.","Therefore, we imagine that it would be useful if computing technologies could help historical researchers identify transliterated and translated terms in historical documents. It may be not easy to use human experts to annotate a database that has 120 million characters,   Some Chances and Challenges in 43 Applying Language Technologies to Historical Studies in Chinese such as DSMCTL."]},{"title":"6.5 Advanced NLP Techniques: Trend Analysis","paragraphs":["An anonymous reviewer of the manuscript of this paper pointed out that applications of advanced NLP techniques will strengthen the values of the collected statistics. For instance, one may classify the keywords into types and conduct temporal analysis on keywords of the same type. This may give us a trend analysis similar to the analysis of emotion trend reported in Yang et al. (2007). It is also possible to treat the network of keywords as a social network. The nodes can be verbs, nouns, and names, and links show strengths of associativity. Networks like this may shed light on historical events that were difficult to see by simply studying the historical documents."]},{"title":"6.6 Time Stamps, Missing Data, and Fundamental Changes in DGOROC","paragraphs":["The DGOROC database 23","provides information about the appointments of government officials of the Republic of China in Taiwan. This database was constructed and verified with human labor. Information was copied from hard copies of official documents, entered into text files, and was verified for quality assurance. It contains more than 850 thousand records dated from 1912, and is useful for studying modern history and relevant applications about Taiwan and China (e.g., Liu & Lai, 2011).","Since the data came from a real and changing government, there can be barriers that were difficult to overcome simply by computing technology. For instance, the current government in Taiwan was not in a really stable condition until she moved to Taiwan in 1949. Hence, the database is relatively more complete for records after circa 1949.","It should not be surprising that a government tries and evolves to serve the nation in the fast changing world. For instance, there was no “Ministry of Education” before 1928, although there must have been some government agents to handle national education policies before 1928. Hence, a researcher will have to know the names of the agents that were responsible for education to study the national education policies circa 1928. In this case, a simple keyword search service may not help very much.","Although the data collected after 1949 was more complete in DGOROC, the government may change the rules for whether or not to announce some types of assignments. For instance, there are departments in the Ministry of Education, and the department heads may change their appointments from a department to another, but this type of switch is not publicly  23 The first author gained experience with DGOROC while serving as the project leader for maintaining DGOROC between February and August 2011. The comments about DGOROC in this section are of the first author.   44 Chao-Lin Liu et al. announced in recent years.","The appointments of lower ranks of government officials may not be announced at real time. The announcement of such appointments may be delayed so that a larger group of appointments would be announced at the same time. If the time stamps of events for a certain study matter, then this kind of delay may be troublesome.","Despite these remaining challenges in DGOROC, we consider this database unique and important. By incorporating information available from other database maintenance agents of the central government and from national libraries, the database will offer researchers a great information source for studying modern history of Taiwan."]},{"title":"7. Concluding Remarks","paragraphs":["We delineate our experience in using three sources of historical documents in Chinese: the database of Chinese historical documents that contain more than 120 million simplified Chinese characters, the Database of Government Officials of the Republic of China, and the Dream of the Red Chamber. Techniques for natural language processing were employed to analyze the contents of the documents to facilitate the studies of historical events. The exploration showed that NLP techniques are instrumental for the studies of non-modern Chinese historical documents. Our experience also suggested that advanced NLP techniques and more complete data collection are necessary for supporting research work in more precise ways."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["The work was supported in part by the funding from the National Science Council in Taiwan under the contracts NSC-99-2221-E-004-007 and NSC-100-2221-E-004-014.
