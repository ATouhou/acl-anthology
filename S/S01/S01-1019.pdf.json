The system uses WordNet relations aggressively, both in identifying examples of words with similar lexical constraints and matching those examples to the context. 1 Introduction The ability of natural language understanding systems to determine the meaning of words in context has long been suggested as a necessary precursor to a deep understanding of the context (Ide and Veronis, 1998; Wilks, 1988). Competitions such as SENSEV AL (Kilgarriff anp Palmer, 2000) and SENSEV AL-2 (SENSEV AL-2, 2001) model the determination of word meaning as a choice of one or more items from a fixed sense inventory, comparing a gold standard based on human judgment to the performance of computational word sense disambiguation systems.","Statistically based systems that train on tagged data have regularly performed best on these tasks (Kilgarriff and Rosenzweig, 2000). The difficulty with these supervised systems is their insatiable need for reliable annotated data, frequently called the \"data acquisition bottleneck.\"","The systems described here avoid the data acquisition bottleneck by using only a sense repository, or more specifically the examples and relationships contained in the sense repository.","WordNet version 1.7 (Miller 1990; Fellbaum 1998; WordNet, 2001) was chosen as the sense repository for the English Lexical Sample task (where systems disambiguate a single word or collocation in context) and the English All Word 79 task (where systems disambiguate all content words) of the SENSEV AL-2 competition. WordNet defmes a word sense (or synset) as a collection of words that can express the sense, a definition of the sense (called a gloss), zero or more examples of the use of the word sense, and a set of tuples that defme relations between synsets or synset words. 2 General Approach This paper describes three systems that were entered in SENSEVAL-2 competition, IITl, IIT2, and IIT3. liT 1 and IIT2 were entered in both the English All Word task and the English Lexical Sample task. IIT3 was entered in the English All Word task only. All three systems use the same unsupervised approach to determine the sense of a target word:","1. for each syntactically plausible sense, fmd","the set of WordNet examples that appear in","that synset or a related synset.","2. for each example, compare the example to","the context, scoring the quality of the match.","3. choose the sense whose synset is","responsible for the inclusion of the highest","scoring example.","Hereafter, target words identify the words to be disambiguated (so identified by the SENSEV AL-2 task). The context identifies the text surrounding and including a target word. 2.1 Collecting Examples of a Sense The systems first collect a set of example sentences and phrases from WordNet for each synset matching a target word (or its canonical or collocational form). The set includes examples from the synset itself as well as those of related synsets. Table 1 lists the relations available in WordNet 1.7. The application of direct relations includes only the examples of the related synset (or synsets of related words).

That is, for the hypernym relation, examples from all ancestor synsets are included.","Table 2 lists the examples identified for the synset for faithful - steadfast in affection or allegiance. WordNet 1.7 displays the synset as:","faithful (vs. unfaithful) => firm, loyal, truehearted, fast(postnominal) =>true Also See-> constant#3; true#!; trustworthy#!,","trusty#!","This faithful synset contributes 3 examples, the see also relation contributes examples for constant, true, and trustworthy, the similarity relation contributes the examples from the firm synset and the antonym relation contributes the unfaithfUl example. 2.2 Comparing Examples to the Context Each example is compared to the context. Consider the first example in Table 2, a man constant in adherence to his ideals. Since each example contains a word being defmed, the systems consider that this word matches the target word, so constant is assumed to match faithfUl. Call this word the example anchor.","The remaining words of the example are compared to the words surrounding the target word. The comparison begins with the word to"]},{"title":"80","paragraphs":["Synset","Words Example","constant a man constant in adherence to his ideals a constant lover constant as the northern star","faithful . !years of faithful service _faithful employees we do not doubt that England has a faithful !patriot in the Lord Chancellor","firm, loyal, \"the true-hearted soldier ... ofTippecanoe\"-","truehearted, Campaign song fur William Henry Harrison;","fast a firm ally loyal supporters fast friends","true true believers bonded together against all who disagreed with them the story is true \"it is undesirable to believe a proposition when there is no ground whatever for supposing it true\" - B.

So the order of comparison of the example words is man, in, a, adherence, to, his, ideals.","Each example word is compared to the unmatched context words in a similar sequence. So, for example, the example word man would first be compared to the word immediately to the left of the context word followed by the word to its left, and so on, until a match is found.","Word matches also use the WordNet relations as described in Table I. Under parent relations, two words match if they have a common ancestor. Other transitive closure relations generate a match if either word appears in the other's transitive closure. The words also match if there is a direct relation between the words. 2.3 Scoring the Match","Once the words of an example have been ma!ched to the context, the result is scored. The score for all systems is computed as: Characteristic Description Distance Magnitude of the difference in the word","position of the matching example and","context words relative to the position of","the example and qontext anchors Direction 1 if the example words adjacent to a Change word match context words both","occurring before or after its matching","context word, 0 otherwise.

In IITI, di is not considered, so a penalty calculation is independent of the word position in the example. In IIT2, di reduces penalties for wi further away from the example anchor.","If an example anchor alignment with the context word is the only open-class match for an example, the example receives a zero score.","Haynes (200 1) describes these calculations in more detail.","A sense of a target word receives the maximum score of the examples related to that sense. The systems suggest the sense(s) with the highest score, with multiple senses in the response in the event of ties. (If a tie occurs because the same example was included for two senses, the other senses are eliminated, the common example is dropped from the example set of the remaining senses, and the sense scores are recomputed.) If no sense receives a score greater than zero, the first sense is chosen.","IIT 1 and IIT2 match a context word independent of other sense assignment decisions.

This makes a compelling argument for the use of these WordNet examples to assist in a computational disambiguating process.","The examples for rare word senses could be used to provide corpus-based statistical methods with additional evidence. Such an approach should help address the knowledge acquisition bottleneck.","The implementation and results presented here","do not seem to justify this optimism. There are","several reasons, though, why the method should","not be dismissed without further investigation:","• The example sets were empty for a number of the candidate word senses. When this occurred, the system constructed a pseudo example by appending the WordNet gloss to the target word. This was sufficient for most collocation senses and some non collocation senses such as call as in calling a square dance (where the gloss includes square and dance, one of which is highly likely to occur in any use of the sense). Others such as day as in sidereal day or turn off (gloss cause to feel intense dislike or distaste) competed at a disadvantage.","• The pattern matching and scoring methods were never tuned against any corpus data. This allowed the algorithm to have few competitors in the class of untrained systems, but scoring methods relied on intuition-founded heuristics. Such tuning should improve precision and recall.","• The approach was developed to be used in tandem with statistical approaches. Further research is required before its additive value can be fully assessed. IIT3 would have done better to be based on IIT2 and an approach maximizing the scores for a sentence should do even better.","• The best-matching example was chosen regardless of how bad a match was involved. The system also defaulted to the first sense encountered when all examples had a zero score. Using threshold score values may well provide substantial precision improvements (at the expense of recall).","• Semantic annotation of the WordNet examples should improve the results.","In addition, the following programming errors","affected the precision and recall results:","• The generated answers for many adjective senses (those with similarity relations)were incorrectly formatted and were therefore always scored as incorrect. For example, in the IITl entry for the English Lexical Sample, 7.1% of all annotations were incorrectly formatted. Scoring only the answers that were correctly formatted raises the course-grained precision for liT 1"]},{"title":"82","paragraphs":["to 36.7% and fme-grained precision to 26.1 %, competitive with the course-grained performance of the best non-corpus system.","• No annotations were generated for target words preceded by the word to. This results in recall j precision as seen in Table 4 and Table 5.","• In a few rare cases, the system identified the incorrect example word as the example anchor. One such occurrence was the synset art, fine art and the example a fine collection of art. The system considered it an example of the fine art collocation and chose fine as the anchor. 5 Conclusion The approach presented here does not appear to be sufficient for a stand-alone word sense disambiguation solution. Whether this method can be combined with other methods to improve their results requires further investigation. References","Christiane Fellbaum, ed. (1998) WordNet: An Electronic Lexical Database.
