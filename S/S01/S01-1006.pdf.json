About 10,000 words are manually disambiguated according to Estonian WordN et word senses. Language-specific problems and lexicon features are discussed."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["We got interested in word sense disambiguation (WSD) for two reasons. First, already a couple of years ago it was evident that WSD is beco ming one of the new \"hot\" topics in computatio nal linguistics and language engineering as our knowledge of how to handle semantic parame ters of texts and semantic features of words in texts increased. The second reason was purely practical. Since 1996 we have been involved in a large project of building a semantic database of Estonian; participating in the Euro WordNet project has been a part of it (but a very impor tant part, of course). The main source of buil ding this database have been different corpora of Estonian, and in working with corpora the question of whether we are dealing with diffe rent meanings of a word in case of its concrete occurrences or not arises constantly. So we got interested in the possibility to use some objec tive methods here.","Our task was all-words task. This choice is explained with our \"practical\" interests explai ned above.","A large amount of work was done to provide training data where disambiguation was done manually. The same kind of work had to be done with test data, of course. The description of this work is given below. Let us note already here that this work appeared to be very useful and informative for us as builders of Estonian WordNet (EstWN).","And let us stress that this was our first at tempt of WSD at all."]},{"title":"2 Corpora and lexicon","paragraphs":["The test and training texts come from Corpus of the Estonian Literary Language (CELL), the 1980-s. We used this part of the corpus, that was morphologically disambiguated, initially for the syntactic analysis.","The morphological analysis was made with ESTMORF (Kaalep, 1997). Lemma and word class in the output of the program are relevant to our task, but it is impossible to get them without morphological disambiguation, because of frequent homonymy among word forms.","All training texts and most of test texts (5 of 6 total) are fiction. One of the test texts is from newspaper. Six training and six test files provided for the task contain about 2000 tokens each. More information about the texts used in the task is in Table 1. Table 1: Statistics on training and test corpora Corpus Training Test Total words 12162 11440 Words to disambiguate 5854 5650 of them being verbs 2431 2191 nouns 3423 3459 2.1 Lexicon The Estonian part of EuroWordNet1 served as the lexicon. Like other wordnets, Est WN is a lexical-semantic database, the basic unit of which is concept. Concepts are represented as synonym sets ( synsets) that are linked to each other by semantic relations. The description of 1 http:/ jwww.hum. uva.nl;-ewn/ Est WN is given in the final document of Eu roWordNet (Vider et al., 1999).","Est WN is supposed to cover the Estonian base vocabulary in its initial version. The base vocabulary will be determined by statistical analysis of the reference corpus. Even so it is not always easy (nor appropriate) to stop enco ding words with frequencies below a certain th reshold. For this reason we expect Est WN to cover more than just the base vocabulary.","Still the Est WN is rather small, there were 9436 synsets, 13277 words and 16961 senses (li terals) in it when the disambiguation was done. That makes about 1.28 senses per word as ave rage.","Most of synsets are connected with hypero nym-hyponym relations building corresponding hierarchies. 2.2 Procedure Four linguists disambiguated the texts, each text was disambiguated by two persons. Only nouns and verbs were disambiguated, as ente ring adjectives into Est WN is in the very begin ning. The sense number was marked according to sense number in EstWN. If the word was mis sing from the Est WN, \"0\" was marked as sense number, and if the word was in EstWN, but missed the appropriate sense,"]},{"title":"\"+","paragraphs":["1\" was mar ked.","If inconsistencies were met, they were discus sed until agreement was achieved. On about 28% of the cases the disambiguators had diffe rent opinions.","One of the problems that the disambiguators ran into concerned dividing words into diffe rent senses in Est WN. It turned out as over differentiation-word meaning marked as too specific, or over-generalisation--word meanmg marked as too general. 2.3 How much the lexicon covers Not all senses found in Est WN are represented in texts. Maximum number of senses per word found in texts is 13. This is more than app ropriate senses in lexicon (see Table 3), but we must remeber about the \"+1\" that disambigua tors had, if they found that there are not enough meanings in Est WN. Table 2 describes distri bution of senses in usage and Table 3 shows the top of lemmas according to number of senses."]},{"title":"26","paragraphs":["Table 2: Distribution of lemmas according 1 number of senses in texts Corpus Training Tesi Total number of lemmas 2340 226E Number of lemmas not in 819 94E lexicon Number of lemmas with 1 2040 2003 sense in texts Lemmas with 2 senses lll 215 183 texts Lemmas with 3 senses Ill 51 50 texts Lemmas with 4 senses in 17 17 texts Lemmas with more than 4 17 15 senses in texts Table 3: Comparison of richest words in sense POS No of senses Lemma No of senses","in text in lexicon verb 13 saama 12 verb 10 pidama 12 noun 10 asi 11 verb 9 olema 9 verb 9 kiiima 23 verb 7 votma 7 verb 7 panema 11 verb 7 nagema 7 verb 7 min em a 17 verb 7 leidma 8 noun 7 elu 7","It would be the best, if all words to disambi guate were in the lexicon with all their possibl~ meanings. Apparently this presumption is not met.","The number of compounds in Estonian is in definite. It is quite easy for a writer to in vent new compounds that are not in any dic tionary, but nevertheless are easily understood by readers. That is one reason, why there are so many sense numbers \"0\" in the texts. About 46% of words that are not in EstWN, are com pounds.","Another remarkable class of words not in lexicon are proper names, as there are no pro per names in EstWN. There are 17.5% of words proper names.","If we will postpone phrasal verbs and some strange words that contain hyphens (about 7"]},{"title":"%) ,","paragraphs":["it leaves us with about half thousand words to check why they are not in EstWN.","But why are there missing senses (tagged with \"+1\")? The reason is simply historical: such words were included into EstWN as sy nonyms of some base vocabulary word and the other senses of them are not considered yet. 2.4 Phrases and multi-word units The initial format of text was as it came from ESTMORF and semantic disambiguation: every word on separate line, followed by an adi tional line of morphological analysis and sense number, with multi-word phrase marked if word was part of it. The task to convert into Senseval XML format seemed trivial at first, but phrases turned out to be problematic. Unfortunately enough, all the story about phrases is concer ning the training corpus only, because in test corpus the multi-word phrases were unmarked.","Estonian is a flective language with a free word order and that makes it complicated to figure out all phrases. The elements of a ph rase can be scattered around the sentence in an unpredictable order.","In the initial texts, the disambiguators mar ked down the whole phrase on the line where the phrase occured. They were not told to mark it on each line, where the non-disambiguatable parts of the phrase were, and it happened that the phrase was not marked on the line, where the head of the phrase was. The algorithm of calculating head or satellite took into account the part of speech and the form. For verb phra ses, if both components were verbs, declinable form of verb infinitive was marked as satellite. For noun phrases, substantive makes head and adjective satellite. If both words are substanti ves, head is the second one ... well, mostly.","However, it is known that expressions tend to contain frozen forms, including inflectional en dings. For example, one may not say \"*Human Right\" or \"*Humans Right\". \"Human Rights\" is the only correct expression and should be ad ded into thesauri in such form. Phrasal verbs like \"ax a maksma\" (to pay off) and idiomatic verbal expressions like \"end tiikkideks naerma\" (to laugh oneself into pieces) represent a situa tion that is different from the occasion desc ribed above: the verb part may inflect freely, but the other word(s) are frozen forms.

There were significant inconsistencies in opinions of these people, who disambiguated the texts. This shows us the most problematic entries in EstWN, the need to reconsider the borders of meaning of some concepts. By now, the last version of EstWN contains 9524 synsets, 13344 words and 17076 senses.","For an inflectional language like Estonian, morphological analysis is extremely important and morphological and semantic disabiguation can help each other."]},{"title":"References H.-J.","paragraphs":["Kaalep. 1997.
