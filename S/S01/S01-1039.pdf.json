They have also experimented with using meronyms/holonyms in addition to hy ponyms/hypernyms but report that it does not improve the results.","Our main object was not to focus on the homonymous words only (lexical sample), but to try to disambiguate all nouns and verbs in the text. The Estonian WordNet (EstWN) also contains adjectives but they are not linked by hyponym/hypernym relations. The word sense disambiguation could also try to describe a unique sense for adverbs but in our case such words have not yet been included in the the saurus.","As far as we know this is the first attempt on automatic Estonian word sense disambiguation. 1.1 Input The input text for our system must be mor phologically analyzed, meaning that each word is provided with its lemma and morphological reading. Taking those two into account we can localize the senses that correspond to the word in EstWN hyponym/hypernym tree (Vider et aL 1999). It must be mentioned that although 159 the morphological description in the input can be quite detailed, we only use the information on whether the word is a noun or a verb.","A simple morphological analysis that only looks at the word-form and not its context can result in very ambiguous output. On average 45% of the words are morphologically ambigu ous in Estonian texts (Kaalep, 1997). The am biguity can be greatly reduced by also apply ing the Estonian morphological disambiguator (Kaalep and Vaino, 1998) to the text before the word sense disambiguation. Since even then the words can in principle stay morphologically am biguous, our system doesn't require each word to have exactly one morphological reading as signed to it in the input text. 1.2 Output Similarly to the morphological analysis, we do not try to provide each word with exactly one sense. In case two (or more) senses have equal evaluation results then both of those prevail in the output. 1.3 Sense disambiguation algorithm We apply the exact same algorithm for both nouns and verbs. Nouns and verbs cannot be compared with each other since in terms of hy ponym/hypernym hierarchy they are located in different trees in the thesaurus. So the disam biguation is carried out in 2 runs, first nouns are disambiguated, then verbs, or vice versa.","A window is shifted on the text and as a word moves through the window its senses are com pared with the senses of other words in the win dow. The context is either made out of nouns or verbs depending on which part of speech is being disambiguated.","The basis of the comparison is the similar ity between the senses which is defined through the notion of conceptual distance, the distance between the nodes corresponding to the senses in Est WN tree. \\Vinners are the senses that minimize· the total distance between the word senses in the window, all the rest are removed from the list of candidates for the correct read ing. semyhe leaves the word ambiguous when there are more than one senses with equal re sult. This usually happens when the senses of the context vmrds are located in different hierar chies and hence can not be compared. Currently there are 108 different top nodes in EstVVN, 29 corresponding to nouns and 79 to verbs.","In addition, the work of the system can be modified via several options in the configuration file:","• The window-size can be changed, increas ing it makes the output less ambiguous since there is a higher possibility that the comparable senses end up in one window. On the other hand a bigger window may span across several sentences making the compared words possibly irrelevant to each other. For the moment we have used win dow of 5 words.","• Since we use no syntactic analysis before word sense disambiguation, the context of any word under observation is unstruc tured, the only syntactic information that we can use is therefore only the distance of the words from each other in terms of run ning texL A set of weights can be defined that is mapped to the distances, so that the similarity of the senses of the words that are far away from each other is less relevant for the total score.","• We can also take into account the average depth of the compared nodes in the tree - the bigger the depth the more reliable the score.","So far we haven't yet experimented with any of those options much."]},{"title":"2 Analysis of the results","paragraphs":["For the purposes of analyzing the quality of dis ambiguation, tests were made with 12 manu ally sense tagged texts. These text samples were mainly from fiction, in a part also from newspapers and they contained approximately 160 10,000 tokens that corresponded to either nouns or verbs.","Manual tagging naturally had to remove all the morphological ambiguity, therefore the re sults obtained on those texts should be bet ter than on the texts that have only been treated automatically before the word sense dis ambiguation. Words that occurred in the text but were not present in Est WN were marked as having 0 senses, approximately 30% of such words are proper names.","Manual tagging also recognized multi-word units, which in our case are mostly non contiguous verbal phrases that are hard to de tect automatically even if we had a complete list of such units.","Using semyhe, we set out to disambiguate all the nouns and verbs contained in the texts. Since semyhe can leave a word ambiguous, it makes sense to evaluate its work in terms of re call and precision. Table 1 lists semyhe results when the window of context words has size 5. The table also shows the results obtained with a random method which chooses exactly one sense for every word randomly (in this case recall and precision have equal values).","The row groups of the table refer respectively to the results with polysemous words and the overall results. Note that the words which were manually marked as having 0 senses were con sidered monosemous and so they are always cor rectly analyzed, with unique sense selected for every word. POS recall","..","random preCISIOn","polysem nouns 0.543 0.347 0.423 verbs 0.495 0.249 0.251 both 0.514 0.283 0.292","overall nouns 0.839 0.700 0.773 verbs 0.601 0.338 0.412 both 0.745 0.522 0.630 Table 1: semyhe results with 10,000 nouns and verbs","Figure 1 shows the distribution of words be tween cliff:'erent number of senses according to those texts. This shows the ambiguity that any automatic analysis has to cope with.","No,te that there is an unusually large num ber of words with 9 different senses. The main 15 20 senses nouns verbs----- bo~ 25 Figure 1: distribution of words in running text reason for this is the frequent word 'olema' (to be, to have). Fortunately the distribution of its senses is highly skewed, meaning that mostly this word is used in one or two senses. In cluding the sense frequency information in the disambiguation process could considerably im prove the results."]},{"title":"3 Proble1ns and solutions","paragraphs":["Several problems have been discovered concern ing the relatively simple approach described above.","The output of the morphological analyzer often contains valuable information for word sense disambiguation which we have currently ignored.","• in some cases the word-form used in the text can uniquely specify the sense of the word, although its lemma is ambiguous, e.g. the word 'palk' can either mean salary or log, tree trunk, but its genitive form is different in each meaning (either 'palga' or 'palgi'). By using only the lemma we ig nore this distinction that can be explic itly present in the text. The number of words behaving this way, though, is not very large.","• the modal verbs are explicitly marked in the output of the morphological disam biguator, when a verb is marked as such, 161 then the senses that don't correspond to the modal senses could be removed and the winning sense should be chosen from the prevailing ones, e.g. the word 'saama' has all together 12 senses in the thesaurus, but only 2 of them correspond to the modal use of the word (either can or may).","Right now the frequency information of the senses has not been used. Most probably there sults that could be obtained with the \"common est\" baseline (Kilgariff and Rosenzweig, 2000) would beat the results of semyhe. We think that even the frequency information that could be calculated using the 10,000 manually sense tagged words can be very useful for disam biguating purposes.","At the moment the input text contains no information about its syntactic structure, most importantly the verbal phrases and other multi word units are not marked as such, there fore the analyzer tries to disambiguate all the components of a multi-word unit separately, this of course results in an incorrect analysis. Also, having the information about the syntac tic structure of the sentences could help to re duce the number of possible senses to choose from. For example the word 'olema' that was already mentioned above has five more frequent senses:","1. be - copula, used with an adjective or a predicate noun 2. exist - have an existence, be extant","3. stay in place, be stationary or spend a cer tain length of time","4. be somewhere, occupy a certain area, oc cupy a certain position","5. have, have got, hold - have or possess, ei ther in a concrete or an abstract sense","The first sense is present in complementary clauses; senses 2, 3 and 4 appear in existen tial sentences and the last one in possessive sen tences. If the information about the nature of the sentence was present in the input text it would certainly help the disambiguation pro cess.","The output of semyhe stays often very am biguous. This either happens when the sense-nodes of the context words are located in dif ferent trees so that their similarity cannot be calculated; or when different nodes of one word have the same parent node and are equally dis tant from the rest of the sense-nodes so that the similarity measure for them will be equal. The second reason may not be a big problem considering WordNet's fine-grainedness and the fact that for some applications a detailed sense distinction is not needed. The disambiguation result in this case can be simply seen as the union of the prevailed senses. Often, though, this approach does not hold, e.g. it is crucial for translation that the senses of the word 'naine' which can either stand for woman, wife or gen erally female person, are fully disambiguated, although the senses stand for more or less the same thing."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["E.
