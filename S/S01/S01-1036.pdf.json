So we split the tem plate into three simpler templates. 2.5.2 Topical context A topical context includes features of the following templates for all open-class words within its window: â¢ in the English lexical sample task - word : an open-class word. â¢ in the Korean lexical sample task - morpheme : an open-class morpheme.","The window size of Â±1 sentences in the English lexical sample task and the window size of all sen tences in the Korean lexical sample task were em pirically chosen. 2.5.3 Bigram context In a bigrarn context, there can be features of the fol lowing templates for all word-pairs within its win dow: â¢ in the English lexical sample task","- (word;, wordj) word (i>j) the i-th word and j-th (word;, POSj) : the i-th word and j-th part-of-speech ( i > j) â¢ in the Korean lexical sample task","- (eojeol;, eojcolj) : the i-th eojeol and j-th eojeol (i>j)","\"Cnlike local and topical contexts, bigram contexts are composed of only bigrarn information surround ing the polysemous word.
