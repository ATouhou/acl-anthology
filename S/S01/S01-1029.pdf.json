The selectional preferences comprise probability distributions over WordN et nouns, and these distributions are conditioned on WordNet verb classes. The conditional distri butions are used directly to disambiguate the head nouns. We use prior distributions and Bayes rule to compute the highest probability verb class, given a noun class. We also use anaphora resolution and the 'one sense per dis course' heuristic to cover nouns and verbs not occurring in these relationships in the target text. The selectional preferences are acquired without recourse to sense tagged data so our system is unsupervised. 1 Introduction In the first SENSEVAL, we used automati cally acquired selectional preferences to disam biguate head nouns occurring in specific gram matical relationships (Carroll and McCarthy, 2000). The selectional preference models pro vided co-occurrence behaviour between Word Net synsets1 in the noun hyponym hierarchy and verbal predicates. Preference scores, based on mutual information, were attached to the classes in the models. These scores were condi tioned on the verbal context and the grammat ical relationship in which the nouns for training had occurred. The system performed compara- • This work was supported by UK EPSRC projects GR/153175 'PSET: Practical Simplification of English Text' and GR/N36462/93 'Robust Accurate Statistical Parsing (RASP)'.","1","We will hereafter refer to WordN et synsets as classes. bly to the other system using selectional prefer ences alone.","The work here is an extension of this earlier work, this time applied to the English all words task. We use probability distributions rather than mutual information to quantify the prefer ences. The preference models are modifications of the Tree Cut Models (TCMs) originally pro posed by Li and Abe (1995; 1998). A TCM is a set of classes cutting across the WordNet noun hypernym hierarchy which covers all the nouns of WordNet disjointly, i.e. the classes in the set are not hyponyms of one another. The set of classes is associated with a probability distri bution. In our work, we acquire TCMs condi tioned on a verb class, rather than a verb form. We then use Bayes rule to obtain probability estimates for verb classes conditioned on co occurring noun classes.","Using selectional preferences alone for disam biguation enables us to investigate the situa tions when they are useful, as well as cases when they are not. However, this means we loose out in cases where preferences do not provide the necessary information and other complemen tary information would help. Another disad vantage of using selectional preferences alone for disambiguation is that the preferences only ap ply to the grammatical slots for which they have been acquired. In addition, selectional prefer ences only help disambiguation for slots where there is a strong enough tie between predicate and argument. In this work, we use subject and object relationships, since these appear to work better than other relationships (Resnik, 1997; McCarthy, 2001), and we use argument heads, rather than the entire argument phrase.","Our basic system is restricted to using only selectional information, and no other source of disambiguating information. However, we ex-119 perimented with two methods of extending the coverage to include other grammatical contexts. The first of these methods is the 'one sense per discourse' heuristic (Gale et al., 1992). With this method a sense tag for a given word is applied to other occurrences of the same word within the discourse. The second method uses anaphora resolution to link pronouns to their antecedents. Using the anaphoric links we are able to use the preferences for a verb co occurring with a pronoun with the antecedent of that pronoun."]},{"title":"2 System Description","paragraphs":["There is a training phrase and a run-time dis ambiguation phase for our system. In the train ing phase a preprocessor and parser are used to obtain training data for selectional prefer ence acquisition. At run-time the preproces sor and parser are used for identifying predi cates and argument heads for application of the acquired selectional preferences for disambigua tion. Anaphora resolution is used at run-time to make links between antecedents of nouns, where the antecedents or the predicates may be in sub ject or object relationships. 2.1 Preprocessor and Parser The preprocessor consists of three modules ap plied in sequence: a tokeniser, a part-of-speech (PoS) tagger, and a lemmatiser. The tokeniser comprises a small set of manually-developed finite-state rules for identifying word and sen tence boundaries. The tagger (Elworthy, 1994) uses a bigram HMM augmented with a statisti cal unknown word guesser. \\Vhen applied to the training data for selectional preference acquisi tion it produces the single highest-ranked tag for each word; at run-time it returns multiple tags whose associated forward-backward proba bilities are incorporated into parse probabilities. The lemmatiser ( Minnen et al., 2001) reduces inflected verbs and nouns to their base forms.","The parser uses a 'shallow' unification-based grammar of English PoS tags, performs .disam biguation using a context-sensitive probabilistic model (Carroll and Briscoe, 1996), and recovers from extra-grammaticality by returning partial parses. The output of the parser is a set of grammatical relations specifying the syntactic dependency between each head and its depen dent( s), read off from the phrase structure tree that is returned from the disambiguation phase. For selectional preference acquisition we applied the analysis system to the 90 million words of the written portion of the British National Cor pus (BNC); both in the acquisition phase and at run-time we extracted from the analyser output only subject-verb and verb-direct object depen dencies2. Thus we did not use the SENSEVAL-2 Penn Treebank-style bracketings supplied for the test data. 2.2 Selectional Preferences A TCM provides a probability distribution over the noun hyponym hierarchy of WordN et. We acquire TCMs conditioned on \\VordN et verb classes to represent the selectional preferences of the verbs in that verb class. The noun fre quency data used for acquiring a TCM is that occurring with verbs from the target verb class. The verb members for training are taken from the class directly and all hyponym classes. How ever not all verbs in a verb class are used for training. We use verbs which have a frequency at or above 20 in the BNC, and belong to no more than 10 WordNet classes.","The noun data is used to populate the hy pernym hierarchy with frequencies, where the frequency count for any noun is divided by the number of noun classes it is a member of. A hyperonym class includes the frequency credit attributed to all its hyponyms.","A portion of two TCMs is shown in figure 1. The TCMs are similar as they both contain di rect objects occurring with the verb seize; the TCM for the class which includes clutch has a higher probability for the entity noun class compared to the class which also includes as sume and usurp. This example includes only classes at WordNet roots, although it is quite possible for the TCM to use more specific noun classes. The method for determining the gen eralisation level uses the minimum description length principle and is a modification of that proposed by Li and Abe (1995; 1998). In our modification, all internal nodes of WordNet have their synonyms placed at newly created leaves. Doing this ensures that all nouns are","2","In a previous evaluation of grammatical relation ac curacy, the analyser returned subject-verb and verb ··· direct object dependencies with 84-88% recall and pre cisio~ (Carroll et al., 1999). 120","money straw handle TCM for seize clutch party Figure 1: TCMs for the direct object slot of two verb classes which include the verb seize. covered by the probability distribution specified by the TCM. 2.3 Disambiguation The probability distributions enable us to get estimates for"]},{"title":"p(","paragraphs":["noun classiverb class) for dis ambiguation.

The algorithm resolves third person pronouns, reciprocals and reflexives, and its cited accuracy is 75% when evaluated on various texts taken from the World Wide \\Veb.","The algorithm places each discourse referent into a coreference class, where discourse refer ents in the same class are believed to refer to the same object. The classes have a salience value associated with them, and an antecedent for a pronoun is chosen from the class with the high est salience value. The salience value of a class is computed by assigning weights to the gram matical features of its discourse referents, and these grammatical features are obtained from the Briscoe and Carroll (1996) parser."]},{"title":"3 Evaluation","paragraphs":["VVe entered three systems for the SENSEVAL-2 English all words task:","s ussex-sel Selectional preferences were used alone.
