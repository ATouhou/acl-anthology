For instance, lamb can refer to an animal (as in The lamb squeezed through the gap) or to a food item (as in Sue had lamb for lunch). Polysemy is pervasive in human language and is a problem in almost all applications of NLP, ranging from Machine Translation (as word senses can translate differently) to Textual Entailment (as most lexical entailments are sense-specific).","The field has thus devoted a large amount of effort to the representation and modeling of word senses. The arguably most prominent effort is Word Sense Disambiguation, WSD (Navigli, 2009), an in-vitro task whose goal is to identify which, of a set of predefined senses, is the one used in a given context.","In work on WSD and other tasks related to polysemy, such as word sense induction, sense alternations are treated as word-specific. As a result, a model for the meaning of lamb that accounts for the relation between the animal and food senses cannot predict that the same relation holds between instances of chicken or salmon in the same type of contexts.","A large number of studies in linguistics and cognitive science show evidence that there are regularities in the way words vary in their meaning (Apresjan, 1974; Lakoff and Johnson, 1980; Copestake and Briscoe, 1995; Pustejovsky, 1995; Gentner et al., 2001; Murphy, 2002), due to general analogical processes such as regular polysemy, metonymy and metaphor. Most work in theoretical linguistics has focused on regular, systematic, or logical polysemy, which accounts for alternations like ANIMAL-FOOD. Sense alternations also arise from metaphorical use of words, as dark in dark glass-dark mood, and also from metonymy when, for instance, using the name of a place for a representative (as in Germany signed the treatise). Disregarding this evidence is empirically inadequate and leads to the well-known lexical bottleneck of current word sense models, which have serious problems in achieving high coverage (Navigli, 2009).","We believe that empirical computational semantics could profit from a model of polysemy1","which (a) is applicable across individual words, and thus capable of capturing general patterns and generalizing to new","1","Our work is mostly inspired in research on regular polysemy. However, given the fuzzy nature of “regularity” in meaning variation, we extend the focus of our attention to include other types of analogical sense construction processes. 151 words, and (b) is induced in an unsupervised fashion from corpus data. This is a long-term goal with many unsolved subproblems.","The current paper presents two contributions to-wards this goal. First, since we are working on a relatively unexplored area, we introduce a formal framework that can encompass different approaches (Section 2). Second, we implement a concrete instantiation of this framework, the unsupervised Centroid Attribute Model (Section 3), and evaluate it on a new task, namely, to detect which of a set of words instantiate a given type of polysemy (Sections 4 and 5). We finish with some conclusions and future work (Section 7)."]},{"title":"2 Formal framework","paragraphs":["In addition to introducing formal definitions for terms commonly found in the literature, our framework pro-vides novel terminology to deal with regular polysemy in a general fashion (cf. Table 1; capital letters designate sets and small letters elements of sets).2","For a lemma l like lamb, we want to know how well a meta alternation (such as ANIMAL-FOOD) explains a pair of its senses (such as the animal and food senses of lamb).3","This is formalized through the function score, which maps a meta alternation and two senses onto a score. As an example, let lambanm denote the ANIMAL sense of lamb, lambfod the FOOD sense, and lambhum the PERSON sense. Then, an appropriate model of meta alternations should predict that score(animal, food, lambanm, lambfod) is greater than score(animal, food, lambanm, lambhum).","Meta alternations are defined as unordered pairs of meta senses, or cross-word senses like ANIMAL. The meta senses M can be defined a priori or induced from data. They are equivalence classes of senses to which they are linked through the function meta. A sense s instantiates a meta sense m iff meta(s) = m. Functions inst and sns allow us to define meta senses and lemma-specific senses in terms of actual instances, or occurrences of words in context. 2","We re-use inst as a function that returns the set of instances for a sense: SL → ℘(IL) and assume that senses partition lemmas’ instances: ∀l : inst(l) = ⋃","s∈sns(l) inst(s). 3 Consistent with the theoretical literature, this paper focuses","on two-way polysemy.

Thus, comp ◦ repA = score."]},{"title":"3 The Centroid Attribute Model","paragraphs":["The Centroid Attribute Model (CAM) is a simple instantiation of the framework defined in Section 2, designed with two primary goals in mind. First, it is a data-driven model. Second, it does not require any manual sense disambiguation, a notorious bottleneck.","To achieve the first goal, CAM uses a distributional approach. It represents the relevant entities as co-occurrence vectors that can be acquired from a large corpus (Turney and Pantel, 2010). To achieve the second goal, CAM represents meta senses using monosemous words only, that is, words whose senses all correspond to one meta sense. 4","Examples are cattle and robin for the meta sense ANIMAL. We define the vector for a meta sense as thecentroid (average vector) of the monosemous words instantiating it. In turn, meta alternations are represented by the centroids of their meta senses’ vectors.","This strategy is not applicable to test lemmas, which instantiate some meta alternation and are by definition ambiguous. To deal with these without 4","10.8% of noun types in the corpus we use are monosemous and 2.3% are disemous, while, on a token level, 23.3% are monosemous and 20.2% disemous. 152","vecI : IL → Rk","instance vector computation","C : Rk×m → Rk","centroid computation","vecL : L → Rk","lemma (type) vector computation","repM : M → Rk","meta sense representation Table 3: Additional notation and signatures for CAM explicit sense disambiguation, CAM represents lemmas by their type vectors, i.e., the centroid of their instances, and compares their vectors (attributes) to those of the meta alternation – hence the name. CoreLex: A Semantic Inventory. CAM uses CoreLex (Buitelaar, 1998) as its meta sense inventory. CoreLex is a lexical resource that was designed specifically for the study of polysemy. It builds on WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), whose sense distinctions are too fine-grained to describe general sense alternations. CoreLex defines a layer of abstraction above WordNet consisting of 39 basic types, coarse-grained ontological classes (Table 2). These classes are linked to one or more Wordnet anchor nodes, which define a mapping from WordNet synsets onto basic types: A synset s maps onto a basic type b if b has an anchor node that dominates s and there is no other anchor node on the path from b and s.5","We adopt the WordNet synsets as S, the set of senses, and the CoreLex basic types as our set of meta senses M . The meta function (mapping word senses onto meta senses) is given directly by the anchor mapping defined in the previous paragraph. This means that the set of meta alternations is given by the set of pairs of basic types. Although basic types do not perfectly model meta senses, they constitute an approximation that allows us to model many prominent alternations such as ANIMAL-FOOD. Vectors for Meta Senses and Alternations. All representations used by CAM are co-occurrence vectors in Rk","(i.e., A := Rk","). Table 3 lists new concepts that CAM introduces to manipulate vector representations. vecI returns a vector for a lemma instance, vecL a (type) vector for a lemma, and C the centroid of a set of vectors.","We leave vecI and C unspecified: we will experiment with these functions in Section 4. CAM does fix 5 This is necessary because some classes have non-disjoint","anchor nodes: e.g., ANIMALs are a subset of LIVING BEINGs. the definitions forvecL and repA. First, vecL defines a lemma’s vector as the centroid of its instances: vecL(l) = C{vecI (i) | i ∈ inst(l)} (1) Before definingrepA, we specify a function repM that computes vector representations for meta senses m. In CAM, this vector is defined as the centroid of the vectors for all monosemous lemmas whose WordNet sense maps onto m: repM(m) = C{vecL(l) | meta(sns(l)) = {m}} (2) Now, repA can be defined simply as the centroid of the meta senses instantiating a: repA(m1, m2) = C{repM(m1), repM(m2)} (3) Predicting Meta Alternations. The final component of CAM is an instantiation of comp (cf. Table 1), i.e., the degree to which a sense pair (s1, s2) matches a meta alternation a. Since CAM does not represent these senses separately, we definecomp as comp(a, s1, s2) = sim(a, vecL(l)) so that {s1, s2} = sns(l) (4) The complete model, score, can now be stated as:","score(m, m′ , s, s′",") = sim(rep","A(m, m′ ), vec","L(l))","so that {s, s′ } = sns(l) (5) CAM thus assesses how well a meta alternation","a = (m, m′",") explains a lemma l by comparing the","centroid of the meta senses m, m′","to l’s centroid. Discussion. The central feature of CAM is that it avoids word sense disambiguation, although it still relies on a predefined sense inventory (WordNet, through CoreLex). Our use of monosemous words to represent meta senses and meta alternations goes beyond previous work which uses monosemous words to disambiguate polysemous words in context (Izquierdo et al., 2009; Navigli and Velardi, 2005).","Because of its focus on avoiding disambiguation, CAM simplifies the representation of meta alternations and polysemous words to single centroid vectors. In the future, we plan to induce word senses (Schütze, 1998; Pantel and Lin, 2002; Reisinger and Mooney, 2010), which will allow for more flexible and realistic models. 153 abs ABSTRACTION ent ENTITY loc LOCATION prt PART act ACT evt EVENT log GEO.

We let the model rank the lemmas through the score function (cf. Table (1) and Eq. (5)) and evaluate the ranked list using Average Precision. While an alternative would be to rank meta alternations for a given polysemous lemma, the method chosen here has the benefit of providing data on the performance of individual meta senses and meta alternations. 4.1 Data All modeling and data extraction was carried out on the written part of the British National Corpus (BNC; Burnage and Dunlop (1992)) parsed with the C&C tools (Clark and Curran, 2007). 6","For the evaluation, we focus on disemous words, words which instantiate exactly two meta senses according to WordNet. For each meta alternation (m, m′","), we evaluate CAM on a set of disemous targets (lemmas that instantiate (m, m′",")) and disemous distractors (lemmas that do not). We define three types of distractors: (1) distractors sharing m with the targets (but not m′","), (2) distractors sharing m′ with the targets (but not m), and (3) distractors sharing neither. In this way, we ensure that CAM cannot obtain good results by merely modeling the similarity of targets to either m or m′",", which would rather be a coarse-grained word sense modeling task.","To ensure that we have enough data, we evaluate CAM on all meta alternations with at least ten targets that occur at least 50 times in the corpus, discarding nouns that have fewer than 3 characters or contain non-alphabetical characters. The distractors are cho-6 The C&C tools were able to reliably parse about 40M words. sen so that they match targets in frequency. This leaves us with 60 meta alternations, shown in Table 5. For each meta alternation, we randomly select 40 lemmas as experimental items (10 targets and 10 distractors of each type) so that a total of 2,400 lemmas is used in the evaluation.7","Table 4 shows four targets and their distractors for the meta alternation ANIMAL-FOOD.8 4.2 Evaluation Measure and Baselines To measure success on this task, we use Average Precision (AP), an evaluation measure from IR that reaches its maximum value of 1 when all correct items are ranked at the top (Manning et al., 2008). It interpolates the precision values of the top-n prediction lists for all positions n in the list that contain a target. Let T = ⟨q1, . . . , qm⟩ be the list of targets, and let P = ⟨p1, . . . , pn⟩ be the list of predictions as ranked by the model. Let I(xi) = 1 if pi ∈ T , and zero otherwise.

The overall quality of a model is given by Mean Average Precision (MAP), the mean of the AP values for all meta alternations.","We consider two baselines: (1) A random baseline that ranks all lemmas in random order. This baseline is the same for all meta alternations, since the distribution is identical. We estimate it by sampling.

Definition of vector space. We instantiate the vecI function in three ways. All three are based on dependency-parsed spaces, following our intuition that topical similarity as provided by window-based spaces is insufficient for this task. The functions differ in the definition of the space’s dimensions, incorporating different assumptions about distributional differences among meta alternations.","The first option, gram, uses grammatical paths of lengths 1 to 3 as dimensions and thus characterizes lemmas and meta senses in terms of their grammatical context (Schulte im Walde, 2006), with a total of 2,528 paths. The second option, lex, uses words as dimensions, treating the dependency parse as a co-occurrence filter (Padó and Lapata, 2007), and captures topical distinctions. The third option, gramlex, uses lexicalized dependency paths like obj–see to mirror more fine-grained semantic properties (Grefenstette, 1994). Both lex and gramlex use the 10,000 most frequent items in the corpus. Vector elements. We use “raw” corpus co-occurrence frequencies as well as log-likelihood-transformed counts (Lowe, 2001) as elements of the co-occurrence vectors. Definition of centroid computation. There are three centroid computations in CAM: to combine instances into lemma (type) vectors (function vecL in Eq. (1)); to combine lemma vectors into meta sense vectors (function repM in Eq. (2)); and to combine meta sense vectors into meta alternation vectors (function repA in Eq. (3)).","For vecL, the obvious definition of the centroid function is as a micro-average, that is, a simple average over all instances. For repM and repA, there is a design choice: The centroid can be computed by micro-averaging as well, which assigns a larger weight to more frequent lemmas (repM) or meta senses (repA). Alternatively, it can be computed by macro-averaging, that is, by normalizing the individual vectors before averaging. This gives equal weight to the each lemma or meta sense, respectively. Macro-averaging in repA thus assumes that senses are equally distributed, which is an oversimplifica-tion, as word senses are known to present skewed distributions (McCarthy et al., 2004) and vectors for words with a predominant sense will be similar to the dominant meta sense vector. Micro-averaging partially models sense skewedness under the assumption that word frequency correlates with sense frequency. Similarity measure. As the vector similarity measure in Eq. (5), we use the standard cosine similarity (Lee, 1999). It ranges between −1 and 1, with 1 denoting maximum similarity. In the current model where the vectors do not contain negative counts, the range is [0; 1]."]},{"title":"5 Results Effect of Parameters","paragraphs":["The four parameters of Section 4.3 (three space types, macro-/micro-averaging for repM and repA, and log-likelihood transformation) correspond to 24 instantiations of CAM.","Figure 1 shows the influence of the four parameters. The only significant difference is tied to the use of lexicalized vector spaces (gramlex / lex are better than gram). The statistical significance of this difference was verified by a t-test (p < 0.01). This indicates that meta alternations can be characterized better through fine-grained semantic distinctions than by syntactic ones.","The choice of micro- vs. macro-average does not have a clear effect, and the large variation observed in Figure 1 suggests that the best setup is dependent on the specific meta sense or meta alternation being 155 MACRO MICRO0.35 0.37 0.39 repM MACRO MICRO0.35 0.37 0.39 repA gram gramlex lex0.35 0.37 0.39 space type ● False True0.35 0.37 0.39 LL transformation Figure 1: Effect of model parameters on performance. A data point is the mean AP (MAP) across all meta alternations for a specific setting. modeled. Focusing on meta alternations, whether the two intervening meta senses should be balanced or not can be expected to depend on the frequencies of the concepts denoted by each meta sense, which vary for each case. Indeed, for AGENT-HUMAN, the alternation which most benefits from the micro-averaging setting, the targets are much more similar to the HUMAN meta sense (which is approximately 8 times as frequent as AGENT) than to the AGENT meta sense. The latter contains anything that can have an effect on something, e.g. emulsifier, force, valium. The targets for AGENT-HUMAN, in contrast, contain words such as engineer, manipulator, operative, which alternate between an agentive role played by a person and the person herself.","While lacking in clear improvement, log-likelihood transformation tends to reduce variance, consistent with the effect previously found in selectional preference modeling (Erk et al., 2010). Overall Performance Although the performance of the CAM models is still far from perfect, all 24 models obtain MAP scores of 0.35 or above, while the random baseline is at 0.313, and the overall frequency baseline at 0.291. Thus, all models consistently outperform both baselines. A bootstrap resampling test (Efron and Tibshirani, 1994) confirmed that the difference to the frequency baseline is significant at p < 0.01 for all 24 models. The difference to the random baseline is significant at p < 0.01 for 23 models and at p < 0.05 for the remaining model. This shows that the models capture the meta alternations to some extent. The best model uses macro-averaging for repM and repA in a log-likelihood transformed gramlex space and achieves a MAP of 0.399.","Table 5 breaks down the performance of the best CAM model by meta alternation. It shows an encouraging picture: CAM outperforms the frequency baseline for 49 of the 60 meta alternations and both baselines for 44 (73.3%) of all alternations. The performance shows a high degree of variance, however, ranging from 0.22 to 0.71. Analysis by Meta Alternation Coherence Meta alternations vary greatly in their difficulty. Since CAM is an attribute similarity-based approach, we expect it to perform better on the alternations whose meta senses are ontologically more similar. We next test this hypothesis.","Let Dmi = {dij} be the set of distractors for the targets T = {tj} that share the meta sense mi, and DR = {d3j} the set of random distractors. We define the coherence κ of an alternation a of meta senses m1, m2 as the mean (ø) difference between the similarity of each target vector to a and the similarity of the corresponding distractors to a, or for-mally κ(a) = ø sim(repA(m1, m2), vecL(tj)) − sim(repA(m1, m2), vecL(dij)), for 1 ≤ i ≤ 3 and 1 ≤ j ≤ 10. That is, κ measures how much more similar, on average, the meta alternation vector is to the target vectors than to the distractor vectors. For a meta alternation with a higher κ, the targets should be easier to distinguish from the distractors.","Figure 2 plots AP by κ for all meta alternations. As we expect from the definition ofκ, AP is strongly correlated with κ. However, there is a marked Y shape, i.e., a divergence in behavior between high- κ and mid-AP alternations (upper right corner) and mid-κ and high-AP alternations (upper left corner).","In the first case, meta alternations perform worse than expected, and we find that this typically points to missing senses, that is, problems in the underlying lexical resource (WordNet, via CoreLex).

A pioneering study is Buitelaar (1998), who accounts for regular polysemy through the CoreLex resource (cf. Section 3). A similar effort is carried out by Tomuro (2001), but he represents regular polysemy at the level of senses. Recently, Utt and Padó (2011) explore the differences between between idiosyncratic and regular polysemy patterns building on CoreLex. Lapata (2000) focuses 157 on the default meaning arising from word combinations, as opposed to the polysemy of single words as in this study.","Meta alternations other than regular polysemy, such as metonymy, play a crucial role in Information Extraction. For instance, the meta alternation SOCIAL GROUP-GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION corresponds to an ambiguity between the LOCATION-ORGANIZATION Named Entity classes which is known to be a hard problem in Named Entity Recognition and Classification (Markert and Nissim, 2009). Metaphorical meta alternations have also received attention recently (Turney et al., 2011)","On a structural level, the prediction of meta alternations shows a clear correspondence to analogy prediction as approached in Turney (2006) (carpenter:wood is analogous to mason:stone, but not to photograph:camera). The framework defined in Section 2 conceptualizes our task in a way parallel to that of analogical reasoning, modeling not “first-order” semantic similarity, but “second-order” semantic relations. However, the two tasks cannot be approached with the same methods, as Turney’s model relies on contexts linking two nouns in corpus sentences (what does A do to B?). In contrast, we are interested in relations within words, namely between word senses. We cannot expect two different senses of the same noun to co-occur in the same sentence, as this is discouraged for pragmatic reasons (Gale et al., 1992).","A concept analogous to our notion of meta sense (i.e., senses beyond single words) has been used in previous work on class-based WSD (Yarowsky, 1992; Curran, 2005; Izquierdo et al., 2009), and indeed, the CAM might be used for class-based WSD as well. However, our emphasis lies rather on modeling polysemy across words (meta alternations), some-thing that is absent in WSD, class-based or not. The only exception, to our knowledge, is Ando (2006), who pools the labeled examples for all words from a dataset for learning, implicitly exploiting regularities in sense alternations.","Meta senses also bear a close resemblance to the notion of semantic class as used in lexical acquisition (Hindle, 1990; Merlo and Stevenson, 2001; Schulte im Walde, 2006; Joanis et al., 2008). However, in most of this research polysemy is ignored. A few exceptions use soft clustering for multiple as-signment of verbs to semantic classes (Pereira et al., 1993; Rooth et al., 1999; Korhonen et al., 2003), and Boleda et al.

All models significantly outperform the baselines when considered as a whole, and the best implementation outperforms the baselines for 73.3% of the tested alternations.","We have two next steps in mind. The first is to become independent of WordNet by unsupervised induction of (meta) senses and alternations from the data. This will allow for models that, unlike CAM, can go beyond “disemous” words. Other improvements on the model and evaluation will be to develop more informed baselines that capture semantic shifts, as well as to test alternate weighting schemes for the co-occurrence vectors (e.g. PMI) and to use larger corpora than the BNC.","The second step is to go beyond the limited in-vitro evaluation we have presented here by integrating alternation prediction into larger NLP tasks. Knowledge about alternations can play an important role in counteracting sparseness in many tasks that involve semantic compatibility, e.g., testing the applicability of lexical inference rules (Szpektor et al., 2008)."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["This research is partially funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (FFI2010-15006, TIN2009-14715-C04-04), the AGAUR (2010 BP-A00070), the German Research Foundation (SFB 732), and the EU (PASCAL2; FP7-ICT-216886).
