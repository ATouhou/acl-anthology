Yet, as may be seen from the results of our research, widespread clustering techniques, which cluster sentences directly, result in rather moderate performance when applied to short sentences, which are common in informal media.","In this paper we present and evaluate a novel sentence clustering scheme based on projecting sentences over term clusters. Section 2 briefly overviews common sentence clustering approaches. Our suggested clustering scheme is presented in Section 3. Section 4 describes an implementation of the scheme for a particular industrial task, followed by evaluation results in Section 5. Section 6 lists directions for future research."]},{"title":"2 Background","paragraphs":["Sentence clustering aims at grouping sentences with similar meanings into clusters. Commonly, vector similarity measures, such as cosine, are used to define the level of similarity over bag-of-words encod-ing of the sentences. Then, standard clustering algorithms can be applied to group sentences into clusters (see Steinbach et al. (2000) for an overview).","The most common practice is representing the sentences as vectors in term space and applying the K-means clustering algorithm (Shen et al. (2011); Pasquier (2010); Wang et al. (2009); Nomoto and Matsumoto (2001); Boros et al. (2001)). An alternative approach involves partitioning a sentence connectivity graph by means of a graph clustering algorithm (Erkan and Radev (2004); Zha (2002)).","The main challenge for any sentence clustering approach is language variability, where the same meaning can be phrased in various ways. The shorter the sentences are, the less effective becomes exact matching of their terms. Compare the following newspaper sentence ”The bank is phasing out the EZ Checking package, with no monthly fee charged for balances over $1,500, and is instead offering customers its Basic Banking account, which carries a fee” with two tweets regarding the same event: ”Whats wrong.. charging $$ for checking a/c” and ”Now they want a monthly fee!”. Though each of the tweets can be found similar to the long sentence by exact term matching, they do not share any single term. Yet, knowing that the words fee and charge are semantically related would allow discovering the similarity between the two tweets.","External resources can be utilized to provide such kind of knowledge, by which sentence representation can be enriched. Traditionally, WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) has been used for this purpose (Shehata (2009); Chen et al. (2003); Hotho et al. (2003); Hatzivassiloglou et al. (2001)). Yet, other resources 38 of semantically-related terms can be beneficial, such as WordNet::Similarity (Pedersen et al., 2004), statistical resources like that of Lin (1998) or DIRECT (Kotlerman et al., 2010), thesauri, Wikipedia (Hu et al., 2009), ontologies (Suchanek et al., 2007) etc."]},{"title":"3 Sentence Clustering via Term Clusters","paragraphs":["This section presents a generic sentence clustering scheme, which involves two consecutive steps: (1) generating relevant term clusters based on lexical semantic relatedness and (2) projecting the sentence set over these term clusters. Below we describe each of the two steps. 3.1 Step 1: Obtaining Term Clusters In order to obtain term clusters, a term connectivity graph is constructed for the given sentence set and is clustered as follows:","1. Create initially an undirected graph with","sentence-set terms as nodes and use lexical re-","sources to extract semantically-related terms","for each node.","2. Augment the graph nodes with the extracted","terms and connect semantically-related nodes","with edges. Then, partition the graph into term","clusters through a graph clustering algorithm.","Extracting and filtering related terms. In Section 2 we listed a number of lexical resources providing pairs of semantically-related terms. Within the suggested scheme, any combination of resources may be utilized.","Often resources contain terms, which are semantically-related only in certain contexts. E.g., the words visa and passport are semantically-related when talking about tourism, but cannot be considered related in the banking domain, where visa usually occurs in its credit card sense. In order to discard irrelevant terms, filtering procedures can be employed. E.g., a simple filtering applicable in most cases of sentence clustering in a specific domain would discard candidate related terms, which do not occur sufficiently frequently in a target-domain corpus. In the example above, this procedure would allow avoiding the insertion of passport as related to visa, when considering the banking domain.","Clustering the graph nodes. Once the term graph is constructed, a graph clustering algorithm is applied resulting in a partition of the graph nodes (terms) into clusters. The choice of a particular algorithm is a parameter of the scheme. Many clustering algorithms consider the graph’s edge weights. To address this trait, different edge weights can be assigned, reflecting the level of confidence that the two terms are indeed validly related and the reliability of the resource, which suggested the corresponding edge (e.g. WordNet synonyms are commonly considered more reliable than statistical thesauri).","3.2 Step 2: Projecting Sentences to Term Clusters To obtain sentence clusters, the given sentence set has to be projected in some manner over the term clusters obtained in Step 1. Our projection procedure resembles unsupervised text categorization (Gliozzo et al., 2005), with categories represented by term clusters that are not predefined but rather emerge from the analyzed data:","1. Represent term clusters and sentences as vec-","tors in term space and calculate the similarity","of each sentence with each of the term clusters.","2. Assign each sentence to the best-scoring term","cluster. (We focus on hard clustering, but the","procedure can be adapted for soft clustering).","Various metrics for feature weighting and vector comparison may be chosen. The top terms of term-cluster vectors can be regarded as labels for the corresponding sentence clusters.","Thus each sentence cluster corresponds to a single coherent cluster of related terms. This is contrasted with common clustering methods, where if sentence A shares a term with B, and B shares an-other term with C, then A and C might appear in the same cluster even if they have no related terms in common. This behavior turns out harmful for short sentences, where each incidental term is influential. Our scheme ensures that each cluster contains only sentences related to the underlying term cluster, resulting in more coherent clusters."]},{"title":"4 Application: Clustering Customer Interactions","paragraphs":["In industry there’s a prominent need to obtain business insights from customer interactions in a contact center or social media. Though the number of key 39 sentences to analyze is often relatively small, such as a couple hundred, manually analyzing just a handful of clusters is much preferable. This section describes our implementation of the scheme described in Section 3 for the task of clustering customer interactions, as well as the data used for evaluation. Results and analysis are presented in Section 5. 4.1 Data We apply our clustering approach over two real-life datasets. The first one consists of 155 sentences containing reasons of account cancelation, retrieved from automatic transcripts of contact center interactions of an Internet Service Provider (ISP). The second one contains 194 sentences crawled from Twitter, expressing reasons for customer dissatisfaction with a certain banking company. The sentences in both datasets were gathered automatically by a rule-based extraction algorithm. Each dataset is accompanied by a small corpus of call transcripts or tweets from the corresponding domain.1","The goal of clustering these sentences is to identify the prominent reasons of cancelation and dissatisfaction. To obtain the gold-standard (GS) annotation, sentences were manually grouped to clusters according to the reasons stated in them.","Table 1 presents examples of sentences from the ISP dataset. The sentences are short, with only one or two words expressing the actual reason stated in them. We see that exact term matching is not sufficient to group the related sentences. Moreover, traditional clustering algorithms are likely to mix related and unrelated sentences, due to matching nonessential terms (e.g. husband or summer). We note that such short and noisy sentences are common in informal media, which became a most important channel of information in industry. 4.2 Implementation of the Clustering Scheme Our proposed sentence clustering scheme presented in Section 3 includes a number of choices. Below we describe the choices we made in our current implementation.","Input sentences were tokenized, lemmatized and cleaned from stopwords in order to extract content-word terms. Candidate semantically-related terms","1","The bank dataset with the output of the tested methods will be made publicly available. he hasn’t been using it all summer long it’s been sitting idle for about it almost a year I’m getting married my husband has a computer yeah I bought a new laptop this summer so when I said faces my husband got laid off from work well I’m them going through financial difficulties Table 1: Example sentences expressing 3 reasons for cancelation: the customer (1) does not use the service, (2) acquired a computer, (3) cannot afford the service. were extracted for each of the terms, using WordNet synonyms and derivations, as well as DIRECT2",", a directional statistical resource learnt from a news corpus. Candidate terms that did not appear in the accompanying domain corpus were filtered out as described in Section 3.1.","Edges in the term graph were weighted with the number of resources supporting the corresponding edge. To cluster the graph we used the Chinese Whispers clustering tool3","(Biemann, 2006), whose algorithm does not require to pre-set the desired number of clusters and is reported to outperform other algorithms for several NLP tasks.","To generate the projection, sentences were represented as vectors of terms weighted by their frequency in each sentence. Terms of the term-cluster vectors were weighted by the number of sentences in which they occur. Similarity scores were calculated using the cosine measure. Clusters were labeled with the top terms appearing both in the underlying term cluster and in the cluster’s sentences."]},{"title":"5 Results and Analysis","paragraphs":["In this section we present the results of evaluating our projection approach, compared to the common K-means clustering method4","applied to: (A) Standard bag-of-words representation of sen-","tences;","2","Available for download at www.cs.biu.ac.il/ ñlp/downloads/DIRECT.html.

Due to space limitations and for more meaningful comparison we report here one value of K, which is equal to the number of clusters returned by projection (60 for the ISP and 65 for the bank dataset). For K = 20, 40 and 70 the performance was similar. 40","(B) Bag-of-words representation, where sentence’s words are augmented with semantically-related terms (following the common scheme of prior work, see Section 2).

Our initial analysis showed that our approach indeed produces more homogenous clusters than the baseline methods, as conjectured in Section 3.2. We consider it advantageous, since it’s easier for a human to merge clusters than to reveal sub-clusters. E.g., a GS cluster of 20 sentences referring to fees and charges is covered by three projection clusters labeled fee, charge and interest rate, with 9, 8 and 2 sentences correspondingly. On the other hand, K-means C method places 11 out of the 20 sentences in a messy cluster of 57 sentences (see Table 3), scattering the remaining 9 sentences over 7 other clusters.","In our current implementation fee, charge and interest rate were not detected by the lexical resources we used as semantically similar and thus were not","5","p=0.001 according to McNemar test (Dietterich, 1998). grouped in one term cluster. However, adding more resources may introduce additional noise. Such dependency on coverage and accuracy of resources is apparently a limitation of our approach. Yet, as our experiments indicate, using only two generic resources already yielded valuable results.","a.
