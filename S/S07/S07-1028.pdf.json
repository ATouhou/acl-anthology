A combination of kernel functions is used to represent two distinct information sources: (i) the global context where entities appear and (ii) their local contexts. The whole sentence where the entities appear (global context) is used to discover the presence of a relation between two entities. Windows of limited size around the entities (local contexts) provide use-ful clues to identify the roles played by the entities within a relation (e.g., agent and target of a gene in-teraction). In the task of detecting protein-protein interactions, we obtained state-of-the-art results on two biomedical data sets. In addition, promising results have been recently obtained for relations such as work for and org based in in the news domain1",".","In this paper, we investigate the use of the above approach to discover semantic relations between nominals. In addition to the original feature representation, we have integrated deep syntactic processing of the global context and semantic information for each candidate nominals using WordNet as external knowledge source. Each source of information is represented by kernel functions. A tree kernel (Moschitti, 2004) is used to exploit the deep syntactic processing obtained using the Charniak parser (Charniak, 2000). On the other hand, bag of synonyms and hypernyms is used to enhance the representation of the candidate nominals. The final system is based on five basic kernel functions (bag-of-words kernel, global context kernel, tree kernel, supersense kernel, bag of synonyms and hypernyms kernel) linearly combined and weighted under different conditions. The experiments were carried out using support vector machines (Vapnik, 1998) as classifier.","We present results on the Classification of Semantic Relations between Nominals task at SemEval-2007, in which sentences containing ordered pairs of marked nominals, possibly semantically related, have to be classified. On this task, we achieve an overall F1 of 71.8% (B category evaluation), largely outperforming all the baselines.","1","These results appear in a paper currently under revision. 141"]},{"title":"2 Kernel Methods for Relation Extraction","paragraphs":["In order to implement the approach based on syntactic and semantic information, we employed a linear weighted combination of kernels, using support vector machines as classifier. We designed two families of basic kernels: syntactic kernels and semantic kernels. These basic kernels are combined by exploit-ing the closure properties of kernels. We define our composite kernel KC (x1, x2) as follows","n","∑ i=1 wi Ki(x1, x2) √ Ki(x1, x1)Ki(x2, x2) , (1) where each basic kernel Ki is normalized and wi ∈ {0, 1} is the kernel weight. The normalization factor plays an important role in allowing us to integrate information from heterogeneous knowledge sources.","All basic kernels, but the tree kernel (see Section 2.1.3), are explicitly calculated as follows Ki(x1, x2) = ⟨φ(x1), φ(x2)⟩, (2) where φ(·) is the embedding vector. Even though the resulting feature space has high dimensionality, an efficient computation of Equation 2 can be carried out explicitly since the input representations defined below are extremely sparse. 2.1 Syntactic Kernels Syntactic kernels are defined over the whole sentence where the candidate nominals appear. 2.1.1 Global Context Kernel","Bunescu and Mooney (2005) and Giuliano et al. (2006) successfully exploited the fact that relations between named entities are generally expressed using only words that appear simultaneously in one of the following three contexts.","Fore-Between Tokens before and between the two","entities, e.g. “the head of [ORG], Dr. [P ER]”.","Between Only tokens between the two entities, e.g.","“[ORG] spokesman [P ER]”.","Between-After Tokens between and after the two","entities, e.g. “[P ER], a [ORG] professor”.","Here, we investigate whether this assumption is also correct for semantic relations between nominals. Our global context kernel operates on the contexts defined above, where each context is represented using a bag-of-words. More formally, given a) S1 S NP PRP I VP VBD found NP DT some NN candy PP IN in NP PRP$ my NN underwear . . b) S VP VBD found NP NNS agent PP IN in NP NN target Figure 1: A content-container relation test sentence parse tree (a) and the corresponding RT structure (b). a relation example R, we represent a context C as a row vector φC(R) = (tf(t1, C), tf(t2, C), . . . , tf(tl, C)) ∈ Rl",", (3) where the function tf (ti, C) records how many times a particular token ti is used in C. Note that this approach differs from the standard bag-of-words as punctuation and stop words are included in φC , while the nominals are not. To improve the classification performance, we have further extended φC to embed n-grams of (contiguous) tokens (up to n = 3). By substituting φC into Equation 2, we obtain the n-gram kernel Kn, which counts uni-grams, bigrams, . . . , n-grams that two patterns have in common2",". The Global Context kernel KGC (R1, R2) is then defined as KF B(R1, R2) + KB(R1, R2) + KBA(R1, R2), (4) where KF B, KB and KBA are n-gram kernels that operate on the Fore-Between, Between and Between-After patterns respectively. 2.1.2 Bag-of-Words Kernel","The bag-of-words kernel is defined as the previous kernel but it operates on the whole sentence.","2.1.3 Tree Kernel Tree kernels can trigger automatic feature selec-","tion and represent a viable alternative to the man-2 In the literature, it is also called n-spectrum kernel. 142 ual design of attribute-value syntactic features (Moschitti, 2004). A tree kernel KT (t1, t2) evaluates the similarity between two trees t1 and t2 in terms of the number of fragments they have in common. Let Nt be the set of nodes of a tree t and F = {f1, f2, . . . , f|F|} be the fragment space of t1 and t2. Then KT (t1, t2) =","P n i∈Nt","1","P n j∈Nt","2 ∆(ni, nj) , (5) where ∆(ni, nj ) =","∑|F|","k=1 Ik(ni) × IK (nj) and Ik(n) = 1 if k is rooted in n, 0 otherwise.","For this task, we defined an ad-hoc class of structured features (Moschitti et al., 2006), the Reduced Tree (RT), which can be derived from a sentence parse tree t by the following steps: (1) remove all the terminal nodes but those labeled as relation entities and those POS tagged as verbs, auxiliaries, prepositions, modals or adverbs; (2) remove all the in-ternal nodes not covering any remaining terminal; (3) replace the entity words with placeholders that indicate the direction in which the relation should hold. Figure 1 shows a parse tree and the resulting RT structure. 2.2 Semantic Kernels In (Giuliano et al., 2006), we used the local context kernel to infer semantic information on the candidate entities (i.e., roles played by the entities). As the task organizers provide the WordNet sense and role for each nominal, we directly use this information to enrich the feature space and do not include the local context kernel in the combination. 2.2.1 Bag of Synonyms and Hypernyms Kernel","By using the WordNet sense key provided, each nominal is represented by the bag of its synonyms and hypernyms (direct and inherited hypernyms). Formally, given a relation example R, each nominal N is represented as a row vector","φN (R) = (f(t1, N), f(t2, N), . . . , f(tl, N)) ∈ Rl , (6) where the binary function f (ti, N ) records if a particular lemma ti is contained into the bag of synonyms and hypernyms of N. The bag of synonyms and hypernyms kernel KS&H (R1, R2) is defined as Ktarget(R1, R2) + Kagent(R1, R2), (7) where Ktarget and Kagent are defined by substituting the embedding of the target and agent nominals into Equation 2 respectively. 2.2.2 Supersense Kernel","WordNet synsets are organized into 45 lexicographer files, based on syntactic category and logical groupings. E.g., noun.artifact is for nouns denoting man-made objects, noun.attribute for nouns denoting attributes for people and objects etc. The supersense kernel KSS(R1, R2) is a variant of the previous kernel that uses the names of the lexicographer files (i.e., the supersense) to index the feature space."]},{"title":"3 Experimental Setup and Results","paragraphs":["Sentences have been tokenized, lemmatized, and POS tagged with TextPro3",". We considered each relation as a different binary classification task, and each sentence in the data set is a positive or negative example for the relation. The direction of the relation is considered labelling the first argument of the relation as agent and the second as target.","All the experiments were performed using the SVM package SVMLight-TK4",", customized to embed our own kernels. We optimized the linear combination weights wi and regularization parameter c using 10-fold cross-validation on the training set. We set the cost-factor j to be the ratio between the number of negative and positive examples.","Table 1 shows the performance on the test set. We achieve an overall F1 of 71.8% (B category evalua-tion), largely outperforming all the baselines, rang-ing from 48.5% to 57.0%. The average training plus test running time for a relation is about 10 seconds on a Intel Pentium M755 2.0 GHz. Figure 2 shows the learning curves on the test set. For all relations but theme-tool, accurate classifiers can be learned using a small fraction of training."]},{"title":"4 Discussion and Conclusion","paragraphs":["Experimental results show that our kernel-based approach is appropriate also to detect semantic relations between nominals. However, differently from relation extraction between named entities, there is not a common kernel setup for all relations.

Surprisingly, the supersense kernel alone works quite well and obtains results comparable to the bag of synonyms and hypernyms kernel. This result is particularly interesting as a supersense tagger can easily provide a satisfactory accuracy (Ciaramita and Altun, 2006). On the other hand, obtaining an acceptable accuracy in word sense disambiguation (required for a realistic application of the bag of synonyms and hypernyms kernel) is impractical as a sufficient amount of training for at least all nouns is currently not available. Hence, the supersense could play a crucial role to improve the performance when approaching this task without the nominals disambiguated. To model the global context using the Fore-Between, Between and Between-After contexts did not produce a significant improvement with respect to the bag-of-words model. This is mainly due to the fact that examples have been collected from the Web using heuristic patterns/queries, most of which implying Between patterns/contexts (e.g., for the cause-effect relation “* comes from *”, “* out of *” etc.)."]},{"title":"5 Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["Claudio Giuliano, Alberto Lavelli and Lorenza Romano are supported by the X-Media project (http: //www.x-media-project.org), sponsored by the European Commission as part of the Information Society Technologies (IST) programme under EC grant number IST-FP6-026978."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Razvan Bunescu and Raymond J.
