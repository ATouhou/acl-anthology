However, in response to a personal name query, search engines return a long list of search results containing that contains Web pages about several namesakes. For example, when a user submits a personal name like “W illiam Cohen” as a query to the search engine Google3",", the returned results represent more than one person named “W illiam Cohen.” In the results, a computer science professor, an American politician, a surgeon, 1 http://tap.stanford.edu/PeopleSearch.pdf 2 http://www.alltheweb.com/ 3 http://www.google.com/ and others are not classified into separate clusters but mixed together.","Most of the previous works on disambiguating personal names in Web search results employ several kinds of agglomerative clustering approach as described in Section 2. However, in these approaches, a lot of clusters that contain only one element tend to be generated, depending on a certain criterion for merging similar clusters. In addition, in person search results from the World Wide Web (WWW), we can often observe that a small number of entities have a lot of search-result Web pages, while others have only one or two. In light of these facts, if a labeled Web page that describes a person is introduced, clustering for personal name disambiguation would be much more accurate. In the following, we refer to such a labeled Web page as the “ seed page.” Then, in order to disambiguate personal names in Web search results, we introduce semi-supervised clustering that uses the seed page to aid the clustering of unlabeled search-result Web pages. Our semi-supervised clustering approach is characterized by controlling the fluctuation of the centroid of a cluster."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["(Mann and Yarowsky, 2003) first extract biographical information, such as birthdates, birthplaces, occupations, and so on.

According to these tables, we found that, although agglomerative clustering outperforms our proposed semi-supervised clustering by 0.21 in the value of purity, our proposed semi-supervised clustering outperforms agglomerative clustering by 0.4 and 0.06 in the values of inverse purity and F-measure, respectively. This indicates that our proposed method tends to integrate search-result Web pages into a seed page and a small number of clusters are generated compared with agglomerative clustering. In terms of these facts, it is easier for a user to browse Web pages clustered based on each personal entity. On the other hand, the small values of purity indicate that irrelevant search-result Web pages are often contained in the generated clusters. Therefore, we can guess that irrelevant search-result Web pages are integrated into a seed page. In fact, we observed that more than 50 search-result Web pages could be grouped together with a seed page. 320","Table 2: Evaluation results in each document set","obtained using agglomerative clustering.

The value of F-measure obtained using seed page (a) (0.55) is comparable to that obtained using seed page (b) (0.60). In addition, we could observe that some Wikipedia articles are under updating. Therefore, if the Wikipedia articles are continuously updated, the reliability of Wikipedia as a source of seed pages will be promis-ing in the future. Moreover, observing the results of each person in detail, we found that the purity values are improved when we use a seed page that describes the person using more than about 200 words. On the other hand, in the case where a seed page describes a person with less than 150 words, or describes not only the target person but also some other persons, we could not obtain high purity values."]},{"title":"5 Conclusion","paragraphs":["In this paper, we described our participating system in the SemEval-2007 Web People Search Task (Artiles et al., 2007). Our system used a semi-supervised clustering which controls the fluctuation of the centroid of a cluster. The evaluation results showed that our proposed method achieves high scores in inverse purity, with the lower scores in purity. This fact indicates that our proposed method tends to integrate search-result Web pages into a seed page. This clustering result makes it easier for a user to browse the results of a person Web search. However, in the generated cluster with a seed page, irrelevant search-result Web pages are also contained. This problem can be solved by in-","Table 4: Evaluation results based on each seed page","obtained using our proposed semi-supervised clus-","tering.

In our experiment, we used the full contents of search-result Web pages and a seed page. We consider that this can cause lower scores in purity. Therefore, in future work, in order to improve the accuracy of clustering, we plan to conduct further experiments by introducing multiple seed pages and using parts of search-result Web pages and seed pages such as words around an ambiguous name."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Javier Artiles, Julio Gonzalo, and Satoshi Sekine. 2007.
