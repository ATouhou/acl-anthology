The run submitted is a supervised version based on two classification models: 1) We used logistic regression for determining the semantic relatedness between a pair of sentences, and 2) We employed support vector machines for identifying textual entailment degree between the two sentences. The be-haviour for the second subtask (textual entailment) obtained much better performance than the one evaluated at the first subtask (relatedness), ranking our approach in the 7th position of 18 teams that participated at the competition."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["The Compositional Distributional Semantic Models (CDSM) applied to sentences aim to approximate the meaning of those sentences with vectors summarizing their patterns of co-occurrence in corpora. In the Task 1 of SemEval 2014, the organizers aimed to evaluate the performance of this kind of models through the following two tasks: semantic relatedness and textual entailment. Semantic relatedness captures the degree of semantic similarity, in this case, between a pair of sentences, whereas textual entailment allows to determine the entailment relation holding between two sentences.","This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence.

A complete description of the task and the dataset used are given in Marelli et al. (2014a) and in Marelli et al. (2014b), respectively.","The remaining of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we describe the general model we used for comparing two sentences and the set of the features used for constructing the vectorial representation for each sentence. Section 3 shows how we integrate the features calculated in a single vector which fed a supervised classifier aiming to construct a classication model that solves the two aforementioned problems: semantic relatedness and textual entailment. In the same section we show the obtained results. Finally, in Section 4 we present our findings."]},{"title":"2 Description of the Distributional Semantic Model Used","paragraphs":["Given a sentence S = w1w2 · · · w|S|, with wi a sentence word, we have calculated different correlated terms (ti,j) or a numeric vector (Vi) for each word wi as follows:","1. {ti,j|relation(ti,j, wi)} such as “relation” is one the following dependency relations: “object”, “subject” or “property”.","2. {ti,j|ti,j = ck · · · ck+n} with n = 2, · · · , 5, and ck ∈ wi; these tokens are also known as n-grams of length n. 3. {ti,j|ti,j = ck · · · ck+((n−1)∗r)} with n = 145 2, · · · , 5, r = 2, · · · , 5, and ck ∈ wi; these tokens are also known as skip-grams of length n.","4. Vi is obtained by applying the Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) algorithm implemented in the R software environment for statistical comput-ing and graphics. Vi is basically a vector of values that represent relation of the word wi with it context, calculated by using a corpus constructed by us, by integrating information from Europarl, Project-Gutenberg and Open Office Thesaurus."]},{"title":"3 A Classification Model for Semantic Relatedness and Textual Entailment based on DSM","paragraphs":["Once each sentence has been represented by means of a vectorial representation of patterns, we constructed a single vector, −→u , for each pair of sentences with the aim of capturing the semantic relatedness on the basis of a training corpus.","The entries of this representation vector are calculated by obtaining the semantic similarity between each pair of sentences, using each of the DSM shown in the previous section. In order to calculate each entry, we have found the maximum similarity between each word of the first sentence with respect to the second sentence and, thereafter, we have added all these values, thus, −→u = {f","1, · · · , f9}.","Given a pair of sentences S1 = w1,1w2,1 · · · w|S1|,1 and S2 = w1,2w2,2 · · · w|S2|,2, such as each wi,k is represented according to the correlated terms or numeric vectors established at Section 2, the entry fi of −→u is calculated as: fl =","∑|S1| i=1 max{sim(wi,1, wj,2)}, with j = 1, · · · , |S2|.","The specific similarity measure (sim()) and the correlated term or numeric vector used for each fl is described as follows:","1. f1 : wi,k is the “object” of wi (as defined in 2), and sim() is the maximum similarity obtained by using the following six WordNet similarity metrics offered by NLTK: Leacock & Chodorow (Leacock and Chodorow, 1998), Lesk (Lesk, 1986), Wu & Palmer (Wu and Palmer, 1994), Resnik (Resnik, 1995), Lin (Lin, 1998), and Jiang & Conrath1","(Jiang and Conrath, 1997).","2. f2 : wi,k is the “subject” of wi, and sim() is the maximum similarity obtained by using the same six WordNet similarity metrics.","3. f3 : wi,k is the “property” of wi, and sim() is the maximum similarity obtained by using the same six WordNet similarity metrics.","4. f4 : wi,k is an n-gram containing wi, and sim() is the cosine similarity measure.","5. f5 : wi,k is an skip-gram containing wi, and sim() is the cosine similarity measure.","6. f6 : wi,k is numeric vector obtained with LSA, and sim() is the Rada Mihalcea semantic similarity measure (Mihalcea et al., 2006).","7. f7 : wi,k is numeric vector obtained with LSA, and sim() is the cosine similarity measure.","8. f8 : wi,k is numeric vector obtained with LSA, and sim() is the euclidean distance.","9. f9 : wi,k is numeric vector obtained with LSA, and sim() is the Chebyshev distance.","All these 9 features were introduced to a logistic regression classifier in order to obtain a classification model which allows us to determine the value of relatedness between a new pair of sentences2",". Here, we use as supervised class, the value of relatedness given to each pair of sentences on the training corpus.","The obtained results for the relatedness subtask are given in Table 1. In columns 2, 3 and 5, a large value signals a more efficient system, but a large MSE (column 4) means a less efficient system.

The obtained results show a competitive approach that may be further improved by consider-ing more lexical relations or other type of semantic similarity measures.","In general, we obtained the 7th place in the official ranking list from a total of 18 teams that participated at the textual entailment subtask. The result at the semantic relatedness subtask could be improved if we were considered to add the new features taken into consideration at the textual entailment subtask, an idea that we will implement in the future."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Jay J.
