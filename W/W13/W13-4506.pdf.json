The focal region of this earthquake was widespread, spanning approximately 500 km north to south from off the Ibaraki shore to the Iwate shore and approximately 200km east to west. The number of deaths and missing persons attributed to this disaster totaled more than 19,000, and the complex, large-scale disasters of the earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear power plant accident had a major impact on people’s lives. The Tokyo metropolitan area also was hit by a strong earthquake and various traffic problems occurred. For example, many railway and subway services were suspended for maintenance. Therefore, almost every railway and subway user was unable to return home easily, and they were called “victims unable to return home.” According to (Measures Council for Victims Unable to Return Home by Earthquake that directly hits Tokyo Area, 2012), the number of people who were not able to go home during that day by paralysis of these transport networks is estimated about 5.15 million people and it is 30% of a going-out people of the day.","Assessing the problem of “victims unable to return home” in Tokyo metropolitan area is ex-tremely important for anti-disaster measures. Although the questionnaire is performed ex post, it is not yet shown clearly what made going-home decision-making after the earthquake disaster. Moreover, since it was going-home behavior in big confusion, the problem that detailed time and position information are unknown exist.","Some previously studies have examined human behaviors via analysis of behavior log data at the time of a large-scale disaster. Because no rapid and accurate method existed to track population movements after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, (Bengtsson et al., 2011) used position data from subscriber identity module (SIM) cards from the largest mobile phone company in Haiti to estimate the magnitude and trends of population movements after the 2010 Haiti earthquake and the subsequent cholera outbreak. Their results indicated that estimates of population movements during disasters and outbreaks can be acquired rapidly and with potentially high validity in areas of high mobile phone usage. (Lu et al., 2012) also used the same data in Haiti to determine that 19 days after the earthquake, population movements had caused the population of the capital Port-au-Prince to decrease by approximately 23% and that the destinations of people who left the capital during the first three weeks after the earthquake were highly correlated with their mobility patterns during normal times and specifically with the locations of people with whom they had significant social bonds. Lu 44 et al. concluded that population movements during disasters may be significantly more predictable than previously thought. Overall, these previous studies clarified human movement over long periods of time. They showed that people in areas affected by an earthquake take refuge temporarily and that the population in the affected area is recovered over several months. Behavior log data should be able to clarify not only such long-term human behavior but also the human behaviors at the time of a disaster.","In this research, we analyze tweet data of Twitter as the behavior log data at the time of the Great East Japan Earthquake. Although tweet data does not contain actual behavior necessarily, there is possibility of containing thinking process and behavioral factors. We clarify the factors of going-home behavior in case of the Great East Japan Earthquake using Twitter data."]},{"title":"2 From Tweet Data To Behavioral Data 2.1 Framework","paragraphs":["First, we provide a framework of this research to analyze users’ going-home behavior using tweet data and geotag data. Figure 1 shows our framework: (1) behavior inference by tweet data,(2) feature engineering by geotag and tweet data, (3) estimation of behavioral model.","In (1) behavior inference by tweet data part, we inferred users’ going-home behavior result using Support vector machine (SVM) and Bag-Of-Words (BOW) representation. In (2) feature engineering by geotag and tweet data part, we made explanatory factors of users’ behavior from tweet data and geotag data. In (3) estimation of behavioral model part, we estimated users’ behavior model (discrete choice model). 2.2 Data In this section, we provide an outline of our data. This data is about 180-million tweet by Japanese in Twitter from March 11, 2011 to March 18, 2011. There are about 280 thousands tweet with geotag in this data. We sampled tweets whose timestamp is from 14:00, March 11 to 10:00, March 12 and whose GPS location is within Tokyo metropolitan area. The number of these tweet is 24,737 and the number of unique users (account) is 5,281. To observe users’ trip on the day, we extracted users that had over 2 geotag tweet and the number of users is 3,307.

Therefore, we analyzed all tweet of these users from 14:00, March 11 to 10:00 (3,307 users, 132, 989 tweets).","We tagged 300 users’ going-home behavior result manually to make supervised data. Our label set is composed of 1) going home by foot, 2) by train, 3) staying their offices or hotels until tomorrow morning, 4) other choice (taxi, bus, etc.), 5) unclear. 2.3 Morphological analysis Next, we give morphological analysis by MeCab and obtained BOW representation by each user’s tweet. To find the relationship between going-home behavior and each user’s tweet, we use information gain. Information gain is index which shows decreasing degree of each class’s entropy by existing word w. If word w is contained each user’s tweet, Random variableXw equals 1 and otherwise Xw = 0. Random variables which indicates each class is c and entropy H(c) is written as H(C) = − ∑ c P (c) log P (c). (1) And conditional entropy is written as H(c|Xw = 1) = − ∑ c P (c|Xw = 1) log P (c|Xw = 1) H(c|Xw = 0) = − ∑ c P (c|Xw = 0) log P (c|Xw = 0). Information gain IG(w) of word w is defined as average decreasing entropy and written as IG(w) = H(c) − (P (Xw = 1)H(c|Xw = 1) + P (Xw = 0)H(c|Xw = 0)) (2) 45 Table 1: Illustrative examples of words whose information gain is high (station) (walk) (foot) (rest) (bicycle) (train) (danger) (stop) (half) (arrived)","1)by foot (can walk) (TV) (toilet) (Kan-nana Street) km (Kawasaki) (tired) (far) (road) (O-edo subway line) (entry)","2)by train (Denen-toshi line) (miracle) (luckily) (smoothly) (Keio line) (can take a train) (sleep) (morning) (Sobu line) (congested) (search) JR (JR line) (take a train) (full capacity)","3)stay (daylight) (a spare time) (first train in the morning) (worry)","4)other Twitpic","5)unclear jishinskype","We calculated all words information gain IG(w) by 5 class (walk, train, stay, other, unclear). Table 1 shows illustrative examples. For example, words whose conditional probability of walking is high are “half”, “far”, “km”, “Kawasaki” and “Kannana Street”. They show user’s location. And “toilet”, “tired” and “danger” indicates psychological factors during going-home by foot.","In the case of train, “miracle”, “luckily” is contained and “O-edo line” and “Denen-toshi line” are the train and subway lines which is operated in March 11. In the case of stay, “morning”, “day-light” and “sleep” indicates that users slept at hotel or their offices and “first train in the morn-ing”, “worry” and “search” shows their going-home timing. Other choices users, who choose bicycle, taxi etc, and unclear users don’t show the understandable tendency. However, they submitted pictures for Twitpic, which is photo share site, and tweeted with #jishin hashtag.","As seen above, the words whose information gain is high is useful to infer their going-home behavior. Therefore, we made classifier by using these words as features. 2.4 SVM and behavior inference In this section, we infer each user’s behavioral result by SVM. we use 300 labeled data as supervised data and we treat top 500 words of information gain as features of SVM.

In this research, for simplicity, we assume that a position before the earthquake is the location of office (origin) and a position of 12:00, March 12, 2011 is the location of home (destina-tion). Next, road network distance, the on foot time required, the station nearest office, the station nearest home, the railroad time required, railroad expense, and the number of times of a railroad change are created using these GPS data. These are the features created using the network at the time of usual.","In order to express a spatial spread of people’s going-home behavior, Figure 3, 4 shows the spatial dstribution of users’ location of before the earthquake and the next day of the earthquake by plotting each user’s geotag.

This result indicates that the rate of on foot decreases relatively as distance with a house be-comes long, but 50% or more of people got home on foot if their distance is 20 km over. 3.2 Verbal factors Finally, a verbal explanation factor is generated. Since it is surmised that a family’s existence and with or without information has affected going-home decision-making, the factor which affects going-home decision-making behavior is extracted from each user’s tweet.","First, we analyze the effect of a safety check with a family. In this research, the family was defined as a spouse and children living together. And 353 of 3,307 persons had spoken existence of a family living together. We extracted safety check tweet such as “I got e-mail from my wife! I felt easy,”, “The telephone led to the wife and the daughter at last! ” and “My telephone is not connected to my son’s nursery school. ”","Figure 6, 7 shows the time zone rate of the safety checked tweet and the safety unidentified tweet according to going-home decision making.","Safety checked tweets are concentrated before *LFCVLVSP 4IJOKVLV ,JDIJKPKJ 4IJCVZB 5PLZP (PUBOEB 4IJOBHBXB 3PQQPOHJ ’VUBLPUBNBHBXB 4IJONBSVLP :PLPIBNB 4IJOZPLPIBNB,BXBTBLJ 6FOP ,JOTIJDIP )BOFEB\"JSQPSU Figure 4: Users’ location distribution in the morn-ing on March 12                 ","","","","","","","","   ","","","","","","","","VOEFS  L N     L N","     L N","PWFS   L N CZGPPU CZUSBJO CZPUIFS TUBZ Figure 5: The relationship between going-home behavior and the distance 18:00 (42% of on foot, 45% of by train, and 65% of stay).

We assume that the safety unidentified tweets are strongly reflecting each individual’s psychological state because they can perform every time zone until safety checked. If we assume that the tweet in a earlier time zone is more important for each user, an on foot going-home person will regard his/her family’s safety unidentified situation as more questionable than a railroad going-home person, and he may make decision of going-home by foot.","Next, the relationship between the information of train operation again and going-home decision-making is analyzed.

Discrete choice model is a statistical model used in fields, such as econometrics, travel behavior analysis, and marketing, and is also called Random utility model ((Ben-Akiva and Lerman, 1985); (Train, 2003)). In this research, Multinomial Logit Model (MNL) is used and it is the most fundamental model in a discrete choice model.","Discrete choice models describe decision mak-              SBUJP SBUJP SBUJPPWFS  Figure 8: The relationship between the rate of railroad resumption tweet and going-home decision-making             SBUJP SBUJP SBUJPPWFS  Figure 9: The relationship between uneasy tweet and going-home decision-making ers’ choices among alternatives. A decision maker, labeled n, faces a choice among J alternatives. The decision maker would obtain a certain level of utility from each alternative. The utility that decision maker n obtains from alternative j is Unj, j = 1, . . . , J . This utility is known to the decision maker but not, as we see in the following, by the researcher. The decision maker chooses the alternative that provides the greatest utility. The behavioral model is therefore: choose alternative i if and only if Uni > Unj, ∀j ̸= i.","Consider now the researcher. The researcher does not observe the decision maker’s utility. The researcher observes some attributes of the alternatives as faced by the decision maker, labeled xnj ∀j, and some attributes of the decision maker, labeled sn, and can specify a function that relates these observed factors to the decision maker’s utility. The function is denoted Vnj = V (xnj, sn) ∀j and is often called representative utility. Usually, V depends on parameters that are unknown to the researcher and therefore estimated statistically.","Since there are aspects of utility that the researcher does not or cannot observe, Vnj = Unj. Utility is decomposed as Unj = Vnj + εnj , where εnj captures the factors that affect utility but are not included in Vnj. This decomposition is fully general.","The researcher does not know εnj ∀j and therefore treats these terms as random. The joint density of the random vector εn = (εn1, . . . , εnJ ) is denoted f (εnj). With this density, the researcher can make probabilistic statements about the decision maker’s choice. The probability that decision 48 maker n chooses alternative i is Pni = Pr(Uni > Unj ∀j ̸= i) = Pr(Vni + εni > Vnj + εnj ∀j ̸= i) = Pr(Vni − Vnj > εnj − εni ∀j ̸= i)(3) This probability is a cumulative distribution, namely, the probability that each random term εnj −εni is below the observed quantity Vni −Vnj. MNL model is derived under the assumption that the unobserved portion of utility is distributed iid extreme value.","f (εnj) = e−εnj","e−e−ε","nj (4)","F (εnj) = e−e−ε nj (5) And decision maker n chooses alternative i is derived as Pni = eVni","∑ j eVnj .

Explanatory variables of on foot are required time by foot, the ratio of uneasy tweets and alternative specific constant. Explanatory variables of train are required time by train, log of the distance between office and home, the ratio of train resumption tweets, the dummy variables of family safety checked tweets and alternative specific constant. Explanatory variables of stay are the ratio of uneasy tweets, the ratio of waiting position tweets, the dummy variables of family safety checked tweets and alternative specific constant. We normalized the utility of other to 0.","Next, we outlines the estimation method of the coefficient parameter of a utility function. MNL model’s likelihood function is written as LL(β) = N∑ n=1 ∑ i δni ln Pni (7) where δni is Kronecker delta if decision maker n choice i, δni = 1 and otherwise δni = 0.

Therefore, parameters can be estimated uniquely with a maximum likelihood estimation. 4.3 the results and simulation Under the above setting, the estimation result is shown in Table 2. A likelihood ratio index is 0.428 and its goodness of fit is good enough. Moreover, the result that the coefficient parameter of the required time is negative and the choice probability of train increases as the distance between office and home is far is suitable for basic analysis and intuition,","Moreover, we estimated parameters of the rate of the uneasy tweet separately by on foot and stay. It turns out that the uneasy tweet rate has had big-ger influence to on foot choice. For example, from the ratio of parameters, the increase of 5 point uneasy tweet ratio is equivalent to the increase of 64 minutes required time by foot. From a perspective of family safety check, decision maker who could check family’s safety tend to choice stay. Therefore, family’s safety check is the important factors for the avoidance of confusion at the great disaster.","A sensitivity analysis is conducted based on this result. One is the analysis of the effect of the existence of a stay place on going-home behavior and another is the analysis of effect of family’s safety check in the early time zone. Figure 10 shows the results.","First, we consider the case where all people have the waiting place. If the ratio of waiting position tweets of users who choose by foot, train and other is same as the average ratio by stay choosers, the number of choice staying will increase by 1.18 49          ","  $VSSFOU4UBUF 5IFFFDUPG XBJUJOHMPDBUJPO 5IFFFDUPG TBGFUZDIFDL Figure 10: The result of sensitivity analysis times and the share of stay is 17.0%.","On the other hand, the share of going-home behavior such as on foot and train decreases by 3%. Although 3% of reduction seems to be very small influence apparently, generally the traffic conges-tion and confusion in a transport system occur by exceeding only 10 % of supplied capacity. From this point, 3% of reduction effects is not few.","Next, we analyzed the influence of the safety check within a family. It is checked from the tweets that there are 353 decision makers who have family living together. When all of these 353 persons was able to check family’s safety by 17:00, as shown in Figure 10, the number of agents who choice train or stay increase by 1.1 times, and the number of people who go home by foot decrease by 0.95 time. Needless to say, the safety check within a family at the time of a disaster is the important information. Since lines of communication other than a mobile phone carried out the big contribution by this earthquake disaster, these communication tools can prevent the confusion of transport network partially."]},{"title":"5 Conclusions","paragraphs":["In this paper, we inferred the going-home behavior in Tokyo metropolitan area after the Great East Japan Earthquake using tweet data and geotag data of Twitter and clarified the decision-making factors.
