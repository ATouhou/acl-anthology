Recent years have seen dramatic changes in the types and amount of data available to researchers in this field. Where most research on publications in the past has dealt with the abstracts of journal articles, we now have access to the full texts of journal articles via PubMedCentral. Where research on clinical documents has been hampered by a lack of availability of data, we now have access to large bodies of data through the auspices of the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital NLP Challenge, the i2b2 shared tasks (www.i2b2.org), the TREC Electronic Medical Records track, the US-funded Strategic Health Advanced Research Projects Area 4 (www.sharpn.org) and the Shared Annotated Resources (ShARe; https://sites.google.com/site/shareclefehealth/taskdescription; www.clinicalnlpannotations.org) project. Meanwhile, the number of abstracts in PubMed continues to grow exponentially. Text in the form of blogs created by patients discussing various healthcare topics has emerged as another data source, with a new perspective on healthrelated issues. Connecting the information from the three main sources in multiple languages to the scientific community, the healthcare provider, and the healthcare consumer presents new challenges. The Natural language processing for medicine and biology workshop at RANLP 2013 provided a venue for presentations of current work in this field. The topics of papers and posters presented at the workshop included finding domainspecific symptoms in patient records, helping parents understand diseases, phenotyping, and deidentification of clinical text.
