We are thrilled to have been able to accept a pleasantly wide range of interesting papers on the computational treatment of literature. The ACL community is certainly embracing literature! We want the workshop to bring together NLP researchers interested in literature and literary scholars on the quantitative edge of their field. We feel that those who “count words” for a living have something to offer to people who “read books” for a living, and vice versa. As Rauscher et al. (this volume) put it: It is hard for the computer scientist to imagine what research questions form the discourse in the humanities. In contrast to this, humanities scholars have a hard time imagining the possibilities and limitations of computer technology. . . Most papers at this year’s workshop touch upon the mutual benefits of interdisciplinary examination and the hurdles between computational methods and literary analysis. Two papers discuss such issues directly. Hammon et al. share their experience of combining literary analysis and computation in an annotation project. They emphasize the advantages of such collaboration. Boot discusses the importance of research into how literary works are perceived by their audiences and how a corpus of written “responses” can be a useful and interesting resource. This line of research, if further developed, may help gain insights into the role of the reader in the literary process – and help show the way toward modeling that role computationally. Two papers look at similar problems: how NLP can be effective in exploring and comparing differences between genres, and in testing certain literary hypotheses. Rauscher et al. show that extended analysis of concordances helps gain literary insight; and Jautze et al. use syntax as the basis of informative stylometric analysis across genres. Like last year, the computational treatment of poetry takes the central role at the workshop: five of ten papers! Voigt and Jurafsky perform a diachronic study of how the 20th-century political history of China has affected the country’s poetic tradition. Asgari and Chappelier apply topic modeling to a corpus of Persian poems and demonstrate that their methodology can contribute to comparative literature studies. Almuhareb et al. work on distinguishing Arabic poems from prose, and develop a search engine for Arabic poetry. The other two papers deal with high-level topical analyses of poetry, and point out significant challenges in this task. Fournier describes a pilot study into topical segmentation of Coleridge’s Kubla Khan; Brooke et al. build upon their previous work on topical segmentation of T. S. Eliot’s The Waste Land in an attempt to automatically cluster its segments by their speakers. At the symbolic end of the spectrum this year, Lessard and Levison explore the process of constructing a graphical representation of a story’s event structure to examine the role of repetition. They find the directed acyclic graph (DAG) to be a formalism that captures the intersecting threads of time and action in the film Groundhog Day. Finally, we are honored to host two distinguished speakers for a pair of invited talks. Livia Polanyi, Consulting Professor of Linguistics at Stanford University, has made longstanding contributions to the iii study of narrative, computational linguistics, discourse theory and related fields. Mark Riedl, Assistant Professor in the Georgia Tech School of Interactive Computing and director of its Entertainment Intelligence Lab, is an expert in the emerging field of interactive narrative and its relationship with the study of textual narrative. It is already the second edition of our workshop, and yet we are still only just scratching the surface of what interesting computational and humanistic problems – and solutions – are found in the collaboration of computational linguistics and literary analysis. . .

Each text, she knew, was a little theory about the nature of language. Once the text began, she simply did what was required. The artist is servant not mistress, she had learned. Creation is strictly carrying out what one is told. It was a lonely life. No one saw the words that she wrote. As a foot soldier in the army of those who wrote for the desk drawer, she talked to herself and grew impatient with what she had to say and so she decided one day to leave her desk and go out into the world beyond the window, to read instead of write and to listen to what others had to say. She wanted to understand what she had been doing day after day at her desk near the window because she knew that what had been happening there was that literature was being born – not great literature, probably not even good literature – and she wanted to know what this “literature” she was so busy serving might be. And so, she began to study the nature of language and to put off all consideration of what on earth that girl behind the window had been doing. She read and she studied and she learned and eventually she wrote and she explained and she taught and she left behind the questions about the nature of literature that had sent her out in the world to understand. But the years have a way of catching up with everyone and as summers became winters and winters became summers again, the young girl became a young woman and then a woman no longer young and then again that young woman no longer young found herself alone at a desk writing texts the she dared not call “poems” but now as she wrote as the theories flowed out onto the page she had learned enough to understand what these texts were theories of and why and how the language of the first breath that would grow into a full text determined the possibilities of what that text could become. And so, in this talk, having been asked to talk to this workshop on computational approaches to literature I will share with you some speculations about the nature of Verbal Art that I have learned through study and practice in the years that separated the woman who will stand before you from that young girl who sat behind her desk near a window years and years ago and wrote down texts that she did not give the name that they had earned. xi"]},{"title":"Invited speaker 2 Mark Riedl","paragraphs":["is an Assistant Professor in the Georgia Tech School of Interactive Computing and director of the Entertainment Intelligence Lab. Dr. Riedl’s research focuses on the intersection of artificial in-telligence, virtual worlds, and storytelling. The principle research question Dr. Riedl addresses through his research is: how can intelligent computational systems reason about and autonomously create engaging experiences for users of virtual worlds and computer games. Dr. Riedl earned a PhD degree in 2004 from North Carolina State University, where he developed intelligent systems for generating stories and managing interactive user experiences in computer games. From 2004 to 2007, Dr. Riedl was a Research Scientist at the University of Southern California Institute for Creative Technologies where he researched and developed interactive, narrative-based training systems. Dr. Riedl joined the Georgia Tech College of Computing in 2007 and in 2011 he received a DARPA Young Faculty Award for his work on artificial intelligence, narrative, and virtual worlds. His research is supported by the NSF, DARPA, the U.S. Army, and Disney."]},{"title":"Intelligent Narrative Generation: From Cognition to Crowdsourcing Abstract","paragraphs":["Storytelling is a pervasive part of the human experience–we as humans tell stories to communicate, inform, entertain, and educate. But what about computational systems? There are many applications for which we would also like intelligent system to reason about, understand, and create narrative structures: from recognition to question-answering, from entertainment to education. In this talk I will look at one particular aspect of computational modeling of narrative: automated story generation, the problem of creating novel narrative fabula event sequences for dramatic, pedagogical, or other purposes. I will trace the evolution of fabula story generation from its roots in cognitive systems to data-driven techniques and crowdsourcing. I will speculate on how systems may eventually learn how to create and tell stories from interacting with humans and literature. xii"]}]}
