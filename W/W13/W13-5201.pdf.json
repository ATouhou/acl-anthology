This process has certainly been facilitated by the increased availability of language data in the internet age, and the subsequent paradigm shift to statistical approaches, but also it coincided with an increasing acceptance of empirical approaches in linguistics and related academic fields, including empirical approaches to typology (Greenberg, 1963), corpus linguistics (Francis and Kucera, 1979, Brown Corpus), and (computational) lexicography (Kucera, 1969), as well as the dawn of Digital Humanities (Busa, 1974).","Given the complexity of language and the analysis of linguistic data on different levels, its in-vestigation involves a broad band-width of for-malisms and resources used to analyze, process and generate natural language. With the transition to empirical, data-driven research, the primary challenge in the field is thus to store, connect and exploit the wealth of language data available in all its heterogeneity. Interoperability of language resources has hence been an important issue addressed by the community since the late 1980s (Text Encoding Initiative, 1990), but still remains a problem that is solved only partially, i.e., on the level of specific sub-types of linguistic resources, such as lexical resources (Francopoulo et al., 2006) or annotated corpora (Ide and Suderman, 2007), respectively. A closely related challenge is information integration, i.e., how information from different sources can be retrieved and combined in an efficient way.","Recently, both challenges have been addressed by means of Linked Data principles (Chiarcos et al., 2013a,b), eventually leading to the formation of a Linguistic Linked Open Data (LLOD) cloud (Chiarcos et al., 2012b). The talk describes its current state of development, it presents selected examples for main types of linguistic resources in the LLOD cloud, and objectives leading to the adaptation of Linked Data principles for any of these.","Further, the talk elaborates on history and goals behind this effort, its relation to established standardization initiatives in the field, and on-going community activities conducted under the umbrella of the Open Linguistics Working Group (OWLG) of the Open Knowledge Foundation (Chiarcos et al., 2012a), an initiative of experts from various fields concerned with linguistic data, which works towards","1. promoting the idea of open linguistic resources,","2. developing means for their representation, and","3. encouraging the exchange of ideas and resources across different disciplines. As the Linked Data paradigm can be used to facilitate any of these aspects, the OWLG identified potential application scenarios for linked and/or open resources in linguistics since its formation in 2010. The Working Group also has intensified its community-building efforts by means of a series of workshops, accompanying publications and data set releases. As a result of this process, numerous resources have been provided in a Linked-Data-compliant way, and linked with each other, as sketched here for selected examples."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Roberto Busa.
