According to Frank Samadja (1993), MWEs are defined as “recurrent combinations of words that co-occur more often than expected by chance”. Timothy Baldwin et al. (2010) defined multiword expressions (MWEs) as lexical items that: (a) can be decomposed into multiple lexemes; and (b) display lexical, syntactic, semantic, pragmatic and/or statistical idiomaticity. Most real world NLP applications tend to ignore MWE, or handle them simply by listing, but successful applications will need to identify and treat them appropriately.","As Jackendoff (1997) stated, the magnitude of this problem is far greater than has traditionally been realized within linguistics. He estimates that the number of MWEs in a native speakers’s lexicon is of the same order of magnitude as the number of single words. In WordNet 1.7 (Fellbaum, 1999), for example, 41% of the entries are multiword.","MWEs can be broadly classified into lexicalized phrases and institutionalized phrases (Ivan A. sag et al., 2002). In terms of the semantics, compositionality is an important property of MWEs. Compositionality is the degree to which the features of the parts of a MWE combine to predict the features of the whole. According to the compositionality property, the MWEs can take a variety of forms: complete compositionality (also known as institutionalized phrases, e.g. many thanks, ‘রাজ সরকার’ (Rajya Sarkar, state government)), partial compositionality (e.g. light house, ‘শিপং মল’ (shopping mall), ‘আম আদিম’ (aam admi, common people)), idiosyncratically compositionality (e.g. spill the beans (to reveal)) and finally complete non-compositionality (e.g. hot dog, green card, ‘uভ সট’ (ubhoy sangkat, on the horns of a dilemma)).","Compound noun is a lexical unit. It is a class of MWE which is rapidly expanding due to the continuous addition of new terms for introducing new ideas. Compound nouns fall into both groups: lexicalized and institutionalized. A noun-noun compound in English characteristically occurs frequently with high lexical and semantic variability. A summary examination of the 90 million-64 word written component of the British National Corpus (BNC) uncover the fact that there are over 400,000 NN (Noun-Noun) compound types, with a combined token frequency of 1.3 million, that is, over 1% of words in the BNC are NN compounds (Timothy Baldwin et al., 2003). Since compound nouns are rather productive and new compound nouns are created from day to day, it is impossible to exhaustively store all compound nouns in a dictionary","It is also common practice in Bengali literature to use compound nouns as MWEs. Bengali new terms directly coined from English terms are also commonly used as MWEs in Bengali (e.g., ‘ডং ি’ (dengue three), ‘নােনা িসম’ (nano sim), ‘িভেলজ টু্ যিরজম’ (village tourism), ‘aালাট মেসজ’ (alert message)).","The main focus of our work is to develop a machine learning approach based on a set of statistical, syntactic and linguistic features for identifying Bengali noun-noun compounds.","To date, not much comprehensive work has been done on Bengali multiword expression identification.","Different types of compound nouns in Bengali are discussed in section 2. Related works are presented in section 3. The proposed noun-noun MWE identification method has been detailed in section 4. The evaluation and results are presented in section 5 and conclusions and feature work are drawn in section 6."]},{"title":"2 Classification of Bengali Compound Nouns","paragraphs":["In Bengali, MWEs are quite varied and many of these are of types that are not encountered in English. The primary types of compound nouns in Bengali are discussed below.","Named-Entities (NE): Names of people (‘তীথ দাস’ (Tirtha Das),"]},{"title":"‘","paragraphs":["নন রা’ (Nayan Roy)). Name of the location (‘হুগিল sশন’ (Hooghly Station), ‘aেশাক িবহার’ (Ashok Bihar)). Names of the Organization (‘আiিডাল কb aপােরটস aােসািসেশন’ (Ideal cable operators association), ‘িরবক iিnা’ (Reebok India)). Here inflection can be added to the last word.","Idiomatic Compound Nouns: These are characteristically idiomatic and unproductive. For example, ‘মা বাবা’ (maa baba, father mother), ‘কল কারখানা’ (kaal karkhana, mills and workshops) are MWEs of this kind.","Idioms: These are the expressions whose meanings can not be recovered from their component words. For example, ‘তােসর ঘর’ (taser ghar, any construction that may tumble down easily at any time), ‘পািখর চাখ’ (pakhir chokh, target), ‘সবুজ িবpব’ (sabuj biplab, green revolution) are the idioms in Bengali.","Numbers: These are productive in nature and little inflection like syntactic variation is also seen in number expression. For example, ‘সাা িতন ঘnা’ (soya teen ghanta, three hours and fifteen minutes), ‘আাi গুণ’ (arawi guun, two and a half times), ‘সাে িতনেট’ (sharre teenta, three hours and thirty minutes), ‘দ বছর’ (der bachar, one and a half year) are MWEs of this kind.","Relational Noun Compounds: These are generally consists of two words, no word can be in-serted in between. Some examples are: ‘িপচতু েতা ভাi’ (pistuto bhai, cousin), ‘মজ মে’ (majo meyya, second daughter).","Conventionalized Phrases (or Institutionalized phrases):","Institutionalized phrases are conventionalized phrases, such as (‘িববাহ বাষিক’ (bibaha barshiki, marriage anniversary, ‘চাkা জাম’ (chakka jam, standstill), ‘শার বাজার’ (share bazar, share market)). They are semantically and syntactically composi‐ tional, but statistically idiosyncratic.","","Simile terms: It is analogy term in Bengali and semi-productive (‘হােতর পাঁচ’ (hater panch, last resort), ‘কথার কথা’ (kather katha, a word for word’s sake)).","Reduplicated terms: Reduplicated terms are non-productive and tagged as noun phrase. Namely Onomatopoeic expression (‘খট খট’ (khhat khhat, knock knock), ‘হু হু’ (hu hu, the noise made by a strong wind)), Complete reduplication (‘বাি বাি’ (bari bari, door to door), ‘bেক bেক’ (blocke blocke, block block)), Partial reduplication (‘যnর মnর’ (jantar mantar)), Semantic reduplication (‘মাথা মুnু ’ (matha mundu, head or tail)), Correlative reduplication (‘মারামাির’ (maramari, fighting)).","Administrative terms: These are institutionalized as administrative terms and are non-productive in nature. Here inflection can be added with the last word (‘sরা মntক’ (sarastra montrak, home ministry)), ‘sাs সিচব’ (sastha sachib, health secretary)). 65","One of the component of MWE from English literature: Some examples of Bengali MWEs of this kind are ‘মাdাসা বাড ’ (madrasha board), ‘মো শহর’ (metro sahar, metro city).","Both of the component of MWE from English literature: Some examples of Bengali MWEs of this kind are ‘রািমং চাজ ’ (roaming charge), ‘kিডট কাড ’ (credit card)."]},{"title":"3 Related Work","paragraphs":["The earliest works on Multiword expression extraction can be classified as: Association measure based methods, deep linguistic based methods, machine learning based methods and hybrid methods.","Many previous works have used statistical measures for multiword expression extraction. One of the important advantages of using statistical measures for extracting multiword expression is that these measures are language independent. Frank Smadja (1993) developed a system, Xtract that uses positional distribution and part-of-speech information of surrounding words of a word in a sentence to identify interesting word pairs. Classical statistical hypothesis test like Chi-square test, t-test, z-test, log-likelihood ratio (Ted Dunning, 1993) have also been employed to extract collocations. Gerlof Bouma (2009) has presented a method for collocation extraction that uses some information theory based association measures such as mutual information and pointwise mutual information.","Wen Zhang et al (2009) highlights the deficiencies of mutual information and suggested an enhanced mutual information based association measures to overcome the deficiencies. The major deficiencies of the classical mutual information, as they mention, are its poor capacity to measure association of words with unsymmetrical co-occurrence and adjustment of threshold value. Anoop et al (2008) also used various statistical measures such as point-wise mutual information (K. Church et al., 1990), log-likelihood, frequency of occurrence, closed form (e.g., blackboard) count, hyphenated count (e.g., black-board) for extraction of Hindi compound noun multiword extraction. Aswhini et al (2004) has used co-occurrence and significance function to extract MWE automatically in Bengali, focusing mainly on Noun-verb MWE. Sandipan et al (2006) has used association measures namely salience (Adam Kilgarrif et al., 2000), mutual information and log likelihood for finding N-V collocation. Tanmoy (2010) has used a linear combination of some of the association measures namely co-occurrence, Phi, significance function to obtain a linear ranking function for ranking Bengali noun-noun collocation candidates and MWEness is measured by the rank score assigned by the ranking function.","The statistical tool (e.g., log likelihood ratio) may miss many commonly used MWEs that occur in low frequencies. To overcome this problem, some linguistic clues are also useful for multiword expression extraction. Scott Songlin Paul et al (2005) focuses on a symbolic approach to multiword extraction that uses large-scale semantically classified multiword expression template database and semantic field information assigned to MWEs by the USAS semantic tagger (Paul Rayson et al.,2004 ). R. Mahesh et al (2011) has used a stepwise methodology that exploits linguistic knowledge such as replicating words (ruk ruk e.g. stop stop), pair of words (din-raat e.g. day night), samaas (N+N, A+N) and Sandhi (joining or fusion of words), Vaalaa morpheme (jaane vaalaa e.g. about to go) constructs for mining Hindi MWEs. A Rule-Based approach for identifying only reduplication from Bengali corpus has been presented in Tanmoy et al (2010). A semantic clustering based approach for indentifying bigram noun-noun MWEs from a medium-size Bengali corpus has been presented in Tanmoy et al (2011). The authors of this paper hypothesize that the more the similarity between two components in a bigram, the less the probability to be a MWE. The similarity between two components is measured based on the synonymous sets of the component words.","Pavel Pecina (2008) used linear logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and Neur-al Networks separately on feature vector consisting of 55 association measures for extracting MWEs. M.C. Diaz-Galiano et al. (2004) has applied Kohonen’s linear vector quantization (LVQ) to integrate several statistical estimators in order to recognize MWEs. Sriram Venkatapathy et al. (2005) has presented an approach to measure relative compositionality of Hindi noun-verb MWEs using Maximum entropy model (MaxEnt). Kishorjit et al (2011) has presented a conditional random field (CRF) based method for extraction and translitera-tion of Manipuri MWEs. 66","Hybrid methods combine statistical, linguistic and/or machine learning methods. Maynard and Ananiadou (2000) combined both linguistics and statistical information in their system, TRUCK, for extracting multi-word terms. Dias (2003) has developed a hybrid system for MWE extraction, which integrates word statistics and linguistic information. Carlos Ramisch et al. (2010) presents a hybrid approach to multiword expression extraction that combines the strengths of different sources of information using a machine learning algorithm. Ivan A. Sag et al (2002) argued in favor of maintaining the right balance between symbolic and statistical approaches while developing a hybrid MWE extraction system."]},{"title":"4 Proposed Noun-Noun compound Identification Method","paragraphs":["Our proposed noun-noun MWE identification method has several steps: preprocessing, candidate noun-noun MWE extraction and MWE identification by classifying the candidates MWEs into two categories: positive (MWE) and negative (non-MWE). 4.1 Preprocessing At this step, unformatted documents are segmented into a collection of sentences automatically accord-ing to Dari (in English, full stop), Question mark (?) and Exclamation sign (!). Typographic or phonetic errors are not corrected automatically. Then the sentences are submitted to the chunker 1","one by one for processing. The chunked output is then processed to delete the information which is not required for MWE identification task.

The multiword expression candidates are primarily extracted using the following rule:","Bigram consecutive noun-noun token sequence within same NP chunk is extracted from the chunked sentences if the Tag of the token is NN or NNP or XC (NN: Noun, NNP: Proper Noun, XC: compounds) (Akshar Bharati et al., 2006).","We observed that some potential noun-noun multi-word expressions are missed due to the chunker’s error. For example, the chunked version of the sentence is ((NP কেবকার NN)) ((NP িবeসe NN )) ((NP সাiেকল NN, SYM )). Here we find that the potential noun-noun multi-word expression candidate “িবeসe সাiেকল” (BSA Cycle) cannot be detected using the first rule since “িবeসe” (BSA) and সাiেকল (Cycle) belong to the different chunk.","To identify more number of potential noun-noun MWE candidates, we use some heuristic rules as follows:","Bigram noun-noun compounds which are hyphenated or occur within single quote or within first brackets or whose words are out of vocabulary (OOV) are also considered as the potential candidates for MWE. 4.3 Features 4.3.1 Statistical features: We use the association measures namely phi, point-wise mutual information (pmi), salience, log likelihood, poisson stirl-ing, chi and t-score to calculate the scores of each noun-noun candidate MWE. These association measures use various types of frequency statistics associated with the bigram. Since Bengali is highly inflectional language, the candidate noun-noun compounds are stemmed while computing their frequencies.","The frequency statistics used in computing association measures are represented using a typical contingency table format (Satanjeev Banerjee et al., 2003). Table 1 shows a typical contingency table showing various types of frequencies associated with the noun-noun bigram <word, word2> (e.g., রাজ সরকার). The meanings of the entries in the contingency table are given below: n11 = number of times the bigram occurs, joint frequency.

Each decision tree participated in ensembling chooses a subset of features randomly to find the best split at each node of the decision tree. The method combines the idea of \"bagging\" (Leo Breiman, 1996) and the random selection of features. We use this algorithm for our multiword identification task for several reasons: (1) For many data sets, it produces a highly accurate classifier (Rich Caruana et al, 2008), (2) It runs efficiently on large databases and performs well consistently across all dimensions and (3) It generates an internal unbiased estimate of the generalization error as the forest building progresses.","The outline of the algorithm is given in the figure 2.","Training Random Forests for noun-noun MWE identification requires candidate noun-noun MWEs to be represented as the feature vectors. For this purpose, we write a computer program for automatically extracting values for the features characterizing the noun-noun MWE candidates in the documents. For each noun-noun candidate MWE in a document in our corpus, we extract the values of the features of the candidate using the measures discussed in subsection 4.3. If the noun-noun candidate MWE is found in the list of manually identified noun-noun MWEs, we label the MWE as a “Positive” example and if it is not found we label it as a “negative” example. Thus the feature vector for each candidate looks like {<a1 a2 a3 ..... an>, <label>} which becomes a training instance (example) for the random forest, where a1, a2 . . .an, indicate feature values for a candidate. A training set consisting of a set of instances of the above form is built up by running a computer program on the documents in our corpus.","For our experiment, we use Weka (www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka) machine learning tools.

The news articles published online under the section Rajya and Desh on the topics bandh-dharmoghat, crime, disaster, jongi, mishap, political and miscellaneous are included in the corpus. It consists of total 274 documents and all those documents contain 18769 lines of Unicode texts and 233430 tokens. We have manually identified all the noun-noun compound MWEs in the collection and labeled the training data by assign-ing positive labels to the noun-noun compounds and negative labels to the expressions which are not noun-noun compounds.

Total 8210 noun-noun compound MWE candidates are automatically extracted employing chunker and using heuristic rules as described in subsection 4.2. 5.2 Results To estimate overall accuracy of our proposed noun-noun MWE identification system, 10-fold cross validation is done. The dataset is randomly reordered and then split into n parts of equal size. For each of 10 iterations, one part is used for test-ing and the other n-1 parts are used for training the classifier. The test results are collected and averaged over all folds. This gives the cross-validation estimate of the accuracy of the proposed system.
