In (Villazon-Terrazas et. al 2012), for example, authors present their idea on a life cycle model (specification, modeling, generation, linking, publication, exploitation) and demonstrate its application within various domains. At the same time, in (Mendes et. al 2011) a DBpedia service has been presented (called DBpedia Spotlight), which automatically annotates text documents with DBpedia URI’s using the DBpedia in-house ontology. Similarly, Zemanta1","provides a plug-in to content creators, which recommends links to relevant content (articles, keywords, tags). Our approach is generally in-line with these ideas and services – domain specific applications, automatic semantic annotation, and addition of relevant linked content. However, our focus is preferably on: the tradeoff between the semantic knowledge holders (on-tologies, linked data) and their language reflection (domain texts), mediated by the linguistic processing pipelines; the adaptive flexibility of the constructed applications and the efficient storage and publishing of large data.","Within Ontotext, examples of mass media, semantic publishing web sites, such as the BBC’s sport web2","and the official web of the London’s Olympics 2013, have proven to attract a multi-1 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zemanta 2 www.bbc.com/sport million user bases. Behind such applications, as revealed by lead engineers at the BBC3",", there lies the complex architecture of the state-of-the-art Semantic and Text Analytics technologies, such as in-house: fast RDF database management system OWLIM4","and knowledge management platforms KIM5","; for robust semantic annotation and search, as well as for text analytics applications.","Both platforms are incorporated into numerous successful Semantic Publishing Solutions (including the BBC Sport6",", Press Association7",", Newz8",", EuroMoney9",", Publicis10","etc.). For the core methodology see (Kiryakov et. al 2003) and (Popov et. al 2003). Starting with the FIFA 2010 BBC web site, through the London Olympics, feeding the official news site with enriched content together with Press Association, we have built domain expertise, sound solution implementation methodologies, and a semantic publishing platform to serve our clients. Beyond mass media, specialized publishers licensed our products and commissioned us for customizations - like Euromoney for macroeconomic report analytics and Oxford University Press and IET for high value scientific content.","This talk aims to describe the parameters of our domain adaptation approach, used successfully in many projects for more than 5 years, to build rigorous semantic publishing solutions.","Our strategy relies on the calibration between the RDF semantic repository OWLIM, the semantic resources in KIM and the optimized Text Analytics techniques including methodologies for fast creation of gold data in the selected do-","3 www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2012/04/sports_dynamic_semantic.html","4 www.ontotext.com/owlim","5 http://www.ontotext.com/kim","6 http://www.ontotext.com/publishing","7 http://www.pressassociation.com/","8 newz.nl","9 http://www.euromoney.com/","10 http://www.publicis.de/ 23 main; focused curation of the automatically analyzed data and the application of advanced machine learning algorithms in data clustering. Thus, the success of our solutions lays in the customization of the advanced semantic technologies in combination with text analytics techniques, tuned to the needs of publishers and adapted to the requested domains."]},{"title":"2 Short Bio","paragraphs":["Borislav Popov is the Head of the Semantic Annotation and Search division at Ontotext. He has specialized in AI, spent some time on landmark projects in the financial and ERP industry across the Balkans with clients like BASF and AC Nielsen. He is a part of Ontotext since its founding and leads the company’s involvement in several EC funded projects with multi–million budgets. He took part in the birth of the KIM Platform and since then is leading both its development, the semantic annotation and search division and is primarily responsible for all the solution the group provides.
