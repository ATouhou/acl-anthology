Like the first six SSST workshops in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012, it aimed to bring together researchers from different communities working in the rapidly growing field of structured statistical models of natural language translation. We selected 8 papers for this year’s workshop, many of which reflect statistical machine translation’s movement toward not only tree-structured and syntactic models incorporating stochastic synchronous/transduction grammars, but also increasingly semantic models and the closely linked issues of deep syntax and shallow semantics. In the third year since “Semantics” was explicitly added to the workshop name, the work exploring SMT’s connections to semantics has continued to grow. Carpuat shows that word sense disambiguation tasks can be viewed as a method for semantic evaluation of machine translation lexical choice. Singh studies the impact of the orthographic representation of Manipuri, a Sino-Tibetan language on the task of SMT to and from English, and explores its impact on lexical ambiguity. Several papers deepen our understanding of theoretical and practical issues associated with structured statistical translation models. Maillette de Buy Wenniger and Sima’an show how to extend rules in a hierarchical phrase-based system with reordering information, by defining more specific nonterminals and augmenting rules with features. Huck, Vilar, Freitag and Ney present a detailed empirical study of cube pruning for hierarchical phrase-based systems. Herrmann, Niehues and Waibel incorporate a syntactic tree-based reordering method to model long-range reorderings in a phrase-based machine translation system, and combine reordering models at different levels of linguistic representation. Saers, Addanki and Wu present an unsupervised method for inducing an Inversion Transduction Grammar based on the Minimum Description Length principle. Maillette de Buy Wenniger and Sima’an propose a precise definition of what it means for an Inversion Transduction Grammar to cover the word alignment of a sentence, and experiment with human and machine-made alignments. Kaeshammer explores the expressiveness of synchronous linear context-free rewriting systems for machine translation by computing derivation coverage on manually word aligned parallel text. Thanks are due once again to our authors and our Program Committee for making the seventh SSST workshop another success.
