It provides a forum to facilitate the exchange and propagation of research results concerned with the annotation, manipulation, and exploitation of corpora; work towards the harmonization and interoperability from the perspective of the increasingly large number of tools and frameworks for annotated language resources; and work towards a consensus on all issues crucial to the advancement of the field of corpus annotation."]},{"title":"The LAW VII & ID mission statement","paragraphs":["This year the LAW has been combined with a workshop proposed for ACL 2013 on Collating Models of Discourse Annotation (CoMoDA). The aim of CoMoDA was to stimulate debate on and encourage work that proposes methods, frameworks and tools for comparing or aligning the varied types of discourse annotation currently available with the goal of achieving interoperability. CoMoDA proposed to use scholarly text as the testbed for this initiative by introducing a shared task. While both proposals were accepted as individual workshops, it was considered beneficial to combine them and create a two-day event which would reach out to both communities. Traditionally, the LAW features a theme, which provides a focus point for workshop submissions. More recently, it features also a challenge, which awards papers addressing certain aspects of the theme. We decided that a natural way of combining the two workshops would be to let the CoMoDA agenda guide the theme of the 7th LAW. This is how LAW VII and Interoperability with Discourse (LAW VII & ID) came into being. Thus, the LAW VII & ID workshop accepted papers on all aspects of linguistic annotation and was particularly interested in the comparison and interoperability of different models and techniques used for and in conjunction with discourse annotation, focusing on any of the following goals:","• Creation of new insights within the field of discourse (by juxtaposing two or more points of view as reflected by different annotation schemes or annotation techniques).","• Fostering interoperability between pragmatic and semantic phenomena in discourse, ranging from functional categories (e.g. methods, results, hypotheses, etc.) to traditional discourse relations (connectives, anaphora, metonymies, etc.). • Connecting syntactic, semantic and pragmatic layers of annotation.","• Working towards a framework, representation standards, tools and methods that will allow the integration and co-existence of current and future discourse-related annotation schemes. It was decided that the workshop would have a challenge and a shared task to encourage focussed submissions addressing the workshop theme. Any paper which dealt with annotation interoperability or integration automatically qualified for the challenge, while special consideration was given to papers (1) integrating functional discourse annotation from one or more corpora with other types of annotation; and (2) demonstrating how interoperability can increase the understanding of the discourse. The shared task was introduced to provide a testbed of scientific corpora for experimentation with different discourse annotation schemes. These proceedings include papers presented at LAW VII & ID, held in Sofia, Bulgaria, on 8-9 August 2013. iii"]},{"title":"Overview of accepted papers","paragraphs":["LAW VII & ID’s call for papers was answered by 48 submissions. After careful review, the Programme Committee accepted 18 long papers, together with ten additional papers to be presented as short talks and/or posters. This year’s submissions addressed many topics of interest for resource annotation. Among these, the following topics are strongly represented, and serve as the headers of the different sessions into which LAW VII & ID has been divided: 1. sparse annotations and annotation error correction (three accepted papers), 2. annotation comparison and evaluation (five accepted papers), 3. interoperability and/or discourse — the special theme of the workshop (five accepted papers), 4. discourse annotation (ten papers on this issue included in the proceedings), 5. semantic annotation (six accepted papers), and 6. novel methods in annotation (four papers fall under this category). While part-of-speech or syntactic tagging do not seem to feature prominently in the above thematic categories, there is actually a considerable amount of work being done on the correction and improvement of part-of-speech and/or syntactic annotations. Papers representative of such work have been included in the session on ‘Sparse Annotations & Error Correction’. The wide range of languages addressed in the accepted papers, the domains for which annotation was performed, as well as the countries of origin of the authors, indicate that this is a very active and lively area globally. As shown by the papers in the workshop proceedings, English is still the language of preference for annotation purposes (11 out of the 38 contributions deal with annotating English data to some extent). None of the papers submitted discussed linguistic annotation for Spanish, despite it being one of the most spoken languages in the world. Russian, while being one of the ten most spoken languages in the world, is not represented either. Interestingly, the ratio of papers representing Turkish is higher than the ratio of papers representing German, inspite of the huge amount of annotation projects and research being carried out in Germany. Asian languages are represented in the workshop by Chinese, Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese and Vietnamese, while Arabic languages are also represented: by Darija (from North-Africa) and Egyptian Arabic. The remaining languages dealt with in the papers are Czech, Danish, French, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese and Swedish. Having a look at the languages discussed in the workshop papers and the countries where they come from, one can see that a number of non-native English-speaking researchers are working on the annotation of English data. Globalization, research evaluation metrics and the lack of suitable open and/or free resources (amongst other reasons) may be the main explanation for this phenomenon.While not totally surprising or unexpected, this poses some concern for linguistic diversity in annotation and the preservation of these languages in the long run. The following includes some general observations on the accepted papers. Firstly, most of the semantic and discourse-related annotations of the workshop have been performed manually. This may indicate that existing technologies are not yet mature enough to produce automatic reliable semantic and discourse annotations or the scarcity of resources for producing automated methods. Secondly, only four out of the thirty-eight accepted submissions deal directly with annotation standards and standardization, and only two additional ones provide some kind of (explicit) best practices for annotation. This raises some concern, since it may mean that either (a) people are not aware of the standards being developed for annotation; or (b) the authors do not think these standards are useful for their work. In any case, we believe that some actions should be taken to remedy this situation. Thirdly, only five accepted papers discuss the interoperability topic, despite it being this yearś special theme. We believe this is a major iv challenge: advances in linguistic research in coming years will require annotations at different levels, and thus providing and querying corpora with such multi-layered information should become the norm. Thus, annotations at different levels and layers will have to interoperate to a great extent, with corpora and resources not conforming to such requirements running the risk of quickly becoming obsolete."]},{"title":"The LAW VII & ID Challenge","paragraphs":["To emphasise the need for interoperability in linguistic annotation the LAW VII & ID workshop presented The LAW Challenge, an award sponsored by the U.S. National Science Foundation (IIS 0948101 Content of Linguistic Annotation: Standards and Practices (CLASP)) and the ACL Special Interest Group on Annotation (ACL SIGANN). The aim of this year’s challenge was to promote the use and collaborative development of open, shared resources, and to identify and promote best practices for annotation interoperability focusing on (but not restricted to) discourse and discourse annotations. The second and third call for papers placed an emphasis on the challenge. Papers addressing one of the topics below were considered eligible for the challenge award:","1. integration of functional discourse annotation from one or more corpora with other types of annotation; 2. demonstration of how interoperability can increase understanding of the discourse; 3. interoperability or integration between different types of linguistic annotation. Other evaluation criteria considered in the challenge selection process include: • innovative use of linguistic information from different discourse annotation layers;","• demonstrable interoperability with at least one other annotation scheme or format developed by others; • quality of the annotated resource in terms of scheme design, documentation, tool support, etc.; • open availability of developed resources for community use; • usability and reusability of the annotation scheme or annotated resource; • outstanding contribution to the development of annotation best practices. Based on the above criteria, the winner of the second LAW Challenge was: \"Towards a Better Understanding of Discourse: Integrating Multiple Discourse Annotation Perspectives Using UIMA\" Authors: Claudiu Mihaila, Georgios Kontonatsios, Riza Theresa Batista-Navarro, Paul Thompson, Ioannis Korkontzelos and Sophia Ananiadou. This paper addresses interoperability between different types of discourse annotation and also some aspects of the shared task as it uses an extension of U-compare (a graphical UIMA-based workflow platform for combining NLP resources) to compare functional discourse annotations and correlate functional discourse annotations with discourse connectives. This work addresses both annotation interoperability and also how discourse annotations interact with other types of annotation, both in the context of scientific articles and other texts. It offers a framework on which future research can be based to further annotation interoperability and investigate the interaction and synergies between different discourse components. v The winning paper received a monetary award of $2500 towards covering the authors’ travel expenses and workshop registration."]},{"title":"The LAW VII & ID Shared Task","paragraphs":["In the context of the challenge, we created an optional shared task to promote the comparison, alignment and interoperability of discourse annotation schemes between them and also between other annotation schemes. The shared task aimed to use scientific texts as a testbed to help participants address the goals of the challenge. A paper was regarded as addressing the shared task when it used scientific papers to explore how discourse annotations interact, considering at least one functional discourse annotation scheme and potentially also other types of discourse annotations. A platform for the dissemination of scientific corpora was provided, so that the same character offsets were used in each case. Links to the corresponding annotation guidelines, links to annotation tools for discourse annotation and links to visualisation tools were also provided. The corpora made available for the shared task all contain functional annotations. We are interested in how these types of annotations can be combined with traditional discourse relations covering connectives, anaphora, metonymies and such and the resulting synergies. Collections of scientific texts were made available for download in a shared format, catering for visualizations using brat, a web-based tool for annotation visualisation and editing. Corpora released in comparable formats include: • The BioScope Corpus, • The GENIA corpus with meta-knowledge information for bio-events, • The ART/CoreSC corpus, • Chemistry AZ-II corpus (annotated with both CoreSC and AZ-II), and • 3 papers annotated with CoreSC, Meta-Knowledge for bio-events and discourse segments. A detailed description of the shared task along with the corresponding resources is available at http: //nactem.ac.uk/law7-id/sharedtask.html. The effort that went into the preparation of the material for the shared task was unfortunately not rewarded in terms of submissions received; only two papers addressed the shared task, of which only one was accepted for presentation at the workshop. We believe that the main reasons for this were the delay in releasing the shared task data and perhaps not advertising the existence of the shared task enough, since this is a first for the LAW series. The fact that one of the two shared-task related submissions won the challenge award offers some gratification, but we are hoping that more people will be able to contribute to this very interesting topic of comparing, aligning and integrating different types of annotation so as to connect together syntactic, semantic and pragmatic aspects of discourse. For this reason, we have scheduled a two hour session within the workshop itself. We will discuss the shared task and, potentially, also have some hands on experimentation with the data. This will help us envision how it could be explored for future use. vi"]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["We would like to thank SIGANN for its continuing organization of the LAW series, as well as the support of the ACL 2013 workshop committee chairs, Aoife Cahill and Qun Liu.
