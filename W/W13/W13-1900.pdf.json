The themes in this year’s papers and posters are divided equally between clinical and biomedical text processing. In addition to the customary research in practical and theoretical issues, such as domain adaptation, question answering, temporal relations extraction, and evaluation of text mining methods, this year, we see a growing body of research in languages other than English. The issues with clinical text processing in resource-poor languages are also discussed in the keynote presentation. Keynote: Processing clinical narratives in less-resourced languages: the challenge to start from scratch Galia Angelova, Ph.D. Linguistic Modeling Department, Institute of Information and Communication Technologies, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences Dr. Angelova presents automatic analysis of free texts in Bulgarian hospital discharge letters of patients with endocrine and metabolic diseases. Processing Bulgarian clinical texts is challenging due to some specific reasons: the notes contain about 37% Latin terms that might occur in Latin alphabet characters as well as transliterated to Cyrillic alphabet (34% of all tokens); the lack of important medical nomenclatures in Bulgarian: for example, the ATC classification is supported in Latin only and requires manual augmentation with Bulgarian drug names in Cyrillic alphabet; no electronic resource with medical terminology is available so the collection of terms and important phrases involves analysis of documents, such as manuals for coding to ICD-10 terms, or collection of collocations directly from the corpus of discharge letters, among others. Currently available resources and methods include automatic recognition of ICD-10 diagnoses; drugs, especially those taken during hospitalization; patient status; values of laboratory tests; and the temporal structure of diabetic case histories. Dr. Angelova discusses scenarios for application of the extraction components in practical settings when cleaning and validation of patient data is required. Dr. Claire Nedellec presents an overview of the BioNLP Shared Task 2013. Acknowledgments We are profoundly grateful to the authors who chose BioNLP as venue for presenting their innovative research. The authors’ willingness to share their work through BioNLP consistently makes the workshop noteworthy among the increasing numbers of available venues. We are equally indebted to the program committee members (listed elsewhere in this volume) who produced at least three thorough reviews per paper on a tight review schedule and with an admirable level of insight. Finally, we acknowledge the gracious sponsorship of the Computational Medicine Center and Division of Biomedical Informatics, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center. iii Organizers: Kevin Bretonnel Cohen, University of Colorado School of Medicine Dina Demner-Fushman, US National Library of Medicine Sophia Ananiadou, University of Manchester and National Centre for Text Mining, UK John Pestian, Computational Medical Center, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center Jun’ichi Tsujii, Microsoft Research Asia and National Centre for Text Mining, UK Program Committee: Emilia Apostolova, DePaul University, USA Eiji Aramaki, University of Tokyo, Japan Alan Aronson, US National Library of Medicine Sabine Bergler, Concordia University, Canada Olivier Bodenreider, US National Library of Medicine Kevin Cohen, University of Colorado, USA Nigel Collier, National Institute of Informatics, Japan Dina Demner-Fushman, US National Library of Medicine Noemie Elhadad, Columbia University, USA Marcelo Fiszman, US National Library of Medicine Filip Ginter, University of Turku, Finland Graciela Gonzalez, Arizona State University, USA Antonio Jimeno Yepes, NICTA, Australia Halil Kilicoglu, US National Library of Medicine Jin-Dong Kim, University of Tokyo, Japan Robert Leaman, US National Library of Medicine Ulf Leser, Humboldt University of Berlin, Germany Zhiyong Lu, US National Library of Medicine Makoto Miwa, National Centre for Text Mining, UK Naoaki Okazaki, Tohoku University, Japan Jong Park, KAIST, South Korea Rashmi Prasad, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, USA Sampo Pyysalo, National Centre for Text Mining, UK Bastien Rance, Georges Pompidou European Hospital, France Andrey Rzhetsky, University of Chicago, USA Matthew Simpson, US National Library of Medicine Pontus Stenetorp, University of Tokyo, Japan Yoshimasa Tsuruoka, University of Tokyo, Japan Karin Verspoor, NICTA, Australia W.
