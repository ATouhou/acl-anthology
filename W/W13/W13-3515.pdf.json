Such databases are accurate, but as they broaden their scope they become increasingly incomplete. In contrast to extending such a database, we present a system to query whether it contains an arbitrary fact. This work can be thought of as re-casting open domain information extraction: rather than growing a database of known facts, we smooth this data into a database in which any possible fact has membership with some confidence. We evaluate our system predicting held out facts, achieving 74.2% accuracy and outperforming multiple baselines. We also evaluate the system as a common-sense filter for the ReVerb Open IE system, and as a method for answer validation in a Question Answering task."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Databases of facts, such as Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2008) or Open Information Extraction (Open IE) extractions, are useful for a range of NLP applications from semantic parsing to information extraction. However, as the domain of a database grows, it becomes increasingly impractical to collect completely, and increasingly unlikely that all the elements intended for the database are explicitly mentioned in the source corpus. In particular, common-sense facts are rarely explicitly mentioned, despite their abundance. It would be useful to infer the truth of such unseen facts rather than assuming them to be implicitly false.","A growing body of work has focused on automatically extending large databases with a finite set of additional facts. In contrast, we propose a system to generate the (possibly infinite) completion of such a database, with a degree of confidence for each unseen fact. This task can be cast as querying whether an arbitrary element is a member of the database, with an informative degree of confidence. Since often the facts in these databases are devoid of context, we refine our notion of truth to reflect whether we would assume a fact to be true without evidence to the contrary. In this vein, we can further refine our task as determining whether an arbitrary fact is plausible – true in the absence contradictory evidence.","In addition to general applications of such large databases, our approach can further be integrated into systems which can make use of probabilistic membership. For example, certain machine translation errors could be fixed by determining that the target translation expresses an implausible fact. Similarly, the system can be used as a soft feature for semantic compatibility in coreference; e.g., the types of phenomena expressed in Hobbs’ selectional constraints (Hobbs, 1978). Lastly, it is useful as a common-sense filter; we evaluate the system in this role by filtering implausible facts from Open IE extractions, and filtering incorrect responses for a question answering system.","Our approach generalizes word similarity metrics to a notion of fact similarity, and judges the membership of an unseen fact based on the aggregate similarity between it and existing members of the database. For instance, if we have not seen the fact that philosophers are mortal1","but we know that Greeks are mortal, and that philosophers and Greeks are similar, we would like to infer that the fact is nonetheless plausible.","We implement our approach on both a large open-domain database of facts extracted from the Open IE system ReVerb (Fader et al., 2011), and ConceptNet (Liu and Singh, 2004), a hand curated database of common sense facts. 1 This is an unseen fact in http://openie.cs.","washington.edu. 133"]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Many NLP applications make use of a knowledge base of facts. These include semantic parsing (Zelle and Mooney, 1996; Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005; Kate et al., 2005; Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2007) question answering (Voorhees, 2001), information extraction (Hoffmann et al., 2011; Surdeanu et al., 2012), and recognizing textual entailment (Schoenmackers et al., 2010; Berant et al., 2011).","A large body of work has been devoted to creating such knowledge bases. In particular, Open IE systems such as TextRunner (Yates et al., 2007), ReVerb (Fader et al., 2011), Ollie (Mausam et al., 2012), and NELL (Carlson et al., 2010) have tackled the task of compiling an open-domain knowledge base. Similarly, the MIT Media Lab’s ConceptNet project (Liu and Singh, 2004) has been working on creating a large database of common sense facts.","There have been a number of systems aimed at automatically extending these databases. That is, given an existing database, they propose new relations to be added. Snow et al. (2006) present an approach to enriching the WordNet taxonomy; Tandon et al. (2011) extend ConceptNet with new facts; Soderland et al. (2010) use ReVerb extractions to enrich a domain-specific ontology. We differ from these approaches in that we aim to provide an exhaustive completion of the database; we would like to respond to a query with either membership or lack of membership, rather than extending the set of elements which are members.","Yao et al. (2012) and Riedel et al. (2013) present a similar task of predicting novel relations between Freebase entities by appealing to a large collection of Open IE extractions. Our work focuses on arguments which are not necessarily named entities, at the expense of leveraging less entity-specific information.","Work in classical artificial intelligence has tackled the related task of loosening the closed world assumption and monotonicity of logical reasoning, allowing for modeling of unseen propositions. Reiter (1980) presents an approach to leveraging default propositions in the absence of contradictory evidence; McCarthy (1980) defines a means of overriding the truth of a proposition in abnormal cases. Perhaps most similar to this work is Pearl (1989), who proposes approaching nonmonotonicity in a probabilistic framework, and in particular presents a framework for making infer-ences which are not strictly entailed but can be reasonably assumed. Unlike these works, our approach places a greater emphasis on working with large corpora of open-domain predicates."]},{"title":"3 Approach","paragraphs":["At a high level, we are provided with a large database of facts which we believe to be true, and a query fact not in the database. The task is to output a judgment on whether the fact is plausible (true unless we have reason to believe otherwise), with an associated confidence. Although our approach is robust to unary relations, we evaluate only against binary relations.","We decompose this decision into three parts, as illustrated in Figure 1: (i) we find candidate facts that are similar to our query, (ii) we define a notion of similarity between these facts and our query, and (iii) we define a method for aggregating a collection of these similarity values into a single judgment. The first of these parts can be viewed as an information retrieval component. The second part can be viewed as an extension of word similarity to fact similarity. The third part is cast as a classification task, where the input is a set of similar facts, and the decision is the confidence of the query being plausible.","We define a fact as a triple of two arguments and a relation. We denote a fact in our database as f = (a1, r, a2). A fact which we are querying is denoted by fq – as our focus is on unseen facts, this query is generally not in the database. 3.1 Finding Candidate Facts Naı̈vely, when determining the correctness of a query fact, it would be optimal to compare it to the entire database of known facts. However, this approach poses significant problems:","1. The computational cost becomes unreasonable with a large database, and only a small portion of the database is likely to be relevant.","2. The more candidates we consider the more opportunities we create for false positives in finding similar facts. For a sufficiently large database, even a small false positive rate could hurt performance.","To address these two problems, we consider only facts which match the query fact in two of their three terms.

A large database of facts is queried for candidate entries that may be similar to the query fact (see Section 3.1); the similarity of each of these facts to the query fact is computed using a number of word similarity metrics (see Section 3.2); finally, these similarity judgments are aggregated into a single judgment per metric, and then a single overall judgment (see Section 3.3). functions: cand(fq, fi; a1), cand(fq, fi; r), and cand(fq, fi; a2) for whether the query fq matches a fact in our database fi on all but one of the arguments (or relation). For efficiency, the total number of candidates returned by each of these three functions was limited to 100, creating up to 300 similar facts overall.","The simplest implementation of this cand function would be exact match (candexact); however, this is liable to return few results. As an example, suppose our query is (private land, be sold to, government). We would like to consider a fact in our database (his land, be sold to, United States) as similar except for second argument (government versus United States), despite the first argument not matching exactly. To account for this, we define a class of functions which match the head word of the two phrases, and as many of the following stricter criteria as possible while maintaining at least 40 candidate facts:2 candhead Match the head word of the two phrases only. Head words were extracted using the Stanford Parser (Klein and Manning, 2003), treating each argument and relation as a sentence. candvn Match all verbs and nouns in the two phrases; This prunes candidates such as (land of our ancestors, be sold to, Prussia). Tagging was done with the Stanford Tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003). candopen Match the open-class words between the two phrases. More precisely, it matches every word which is not a pronoun, determiner, preposition, or form of the 2","This threshold is chosen in conjunction with the aggregation threshold in Section 3.3, to allow for at least two facts in the 95% threshold. verb be. This prunes candidates such as (worthless land, be sold to, gullible investors).","We proceed to describe our notion of similarity between facts, which will be applied to the set of candidate similar facts retrieved. 3.2 Similarity Between Facts Determining the similarity between two facts is in general difficult. For sufficiently complicated facts, it can be has hard as recognizing textual entailment (RTE); for instance, determining that every philosopher is mortal and Socrates is mortal are similar requires fairly sophisticated inference. We choose a simple approach, in order to avoid fitting to a particular corpus or weakening our ability to generalize to arbitrary phrases.","Our approach casts fact similarity in terms of as-sessing word similarity. The candidate facts from Section 3.1 differ from the query fact by a single phrase; we define the similarity between the candidate and query fact to be the similarity between the differing term.","The word similarity metrics are summarized in Table 1. They fall into two broad classes: information-theoretic thesaurus based metrics, and distributional similarity metrics. Thesaurus Based Metrics We adopt many of the thesaurus based similarity metrics described in Budanitsky and Hirst (2006). For each metric, we use the WordNet ontology (Miller, 1995) combined with n-gram counts retrieved from Google n-grams (Brants and Franz, 2006). Every word form was assigned a minimum count of 1; 2265 entries had no counts and were assigned this minimum (1.5%). 167 of these were longer than 5 words; the remaining did not appear in the corpus.","Since WordNet is a relatively sparse resource, 135 if a query phrase is not found a number of simple variants are also tried. These are, in order of preference: a lemmatized version of the phrase, the head word of the phrase, and the head lemma of the phrase. If none of these are found, then the named entities in the sentence were replaced with their types. If that fails as well, acronyms3","were expanded. For words with multiple sense, the maximum similarity for any pair of word senses was used. Distributional Similarity Based Metrics We define a number of similarity metrics on the 50 dimensional word vectors of Huang et al. (2012). These cover a vocabulary of 100,231 words; a special vector is defined for unknown words.","Compound phrases are queried by treating the phrase as a bag of words and averaging the word vectors of each word in the phrase, pruning out unknown words. If the phrase contains no known words, the same relaxation steps are tried as the thesaurus based metrics. 3.3 Aggregating Similarity At this stage, we are presented with a set of candidate facts which may be similar to our query, and a set of similarity judgments for each of these candidate facts. Intuitively, we would like to mark a fact as plausible if it has enough sufficiently similar candidate facts based on a large number of metrics. This is a two-dimensional aggregation task: (i) we aggregate judgments for a single similarity metric, and (ii) we aggregate these aggregate judgments across similarity metrics. We accomplish the first half with a thresholded average similarity; the second half we accomplish by using the aggregate similarity judgments as features for a logistic regression model. Thresholded Average Similarity Given a set of similarity values, we average the top 5% of the values and use this as the aggregate similarity judgment. This approach incorporates the benefit of two simpler aggregation techniques: averaging and taking the maximum similarity.","Averaging similarity values has the advantage of robustness – given a set of candidate facts, we would like as many of those facts to be as similar to the query as possible. To illustrate, we should be more certain that (philosophers, are, mortal)","3","6053 acronyms and initialisms were scraped from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ acronyms_and_initialisms Name Formula Thesaurus Based Path − log len(w1, lcs, w2) Resnik − log P (lcs) Lin log(P (lcs)2",")","log(P (w1)·P (w2)) Jiang-Conrath log (","P (lcs)2 P (w1)·P (w2) )−1 Wu-Palmer","2·depth(lcs) 2·depth(lcs)+len(w1,lcs,w2) Distrib utional","Cosine w1·w2 ∥w1∥∥w2∥ Angle arccos (","w1·w2 ∥w1∥∥w2∥) ) Jensen-Shannon","(KL(p1∥p2)+KL(p2∥p1)) 2","Hellinger 1√ 2 ∥√ p1 − √ p2∥ Jaccard ∥ min(w1,w2)∥1 ∥ max(w1,w2)∥1 Dice ∥ min(w1,w2)∥1 1 2 ∥w1+w2∥1 Table 1: A summary of similarity metrics used to calculate fact similarity.

However, since the number of similar facts is likely to be small relative the number of candidate facts considered, this approach has the risk of losing the signal in the noise of uninformative candidates. Taking the maximum similarity judgment alleviates this concern, but constrains the use of only one element in our aggregate judgment.","If fewer than 20 candidates are returned, our combination approach reduces to taking the maximum similarity value. Note also that the 40 fact threshold in the candidate selection phase is chosen to provide at least two similarity values to be averaged together. The threshold was chosen empirically, although varying it does not have a significant effect on performance. Aggregate Similarity Values At this point, we have a number of distinct notions of similarity: for each metric, for each differing term, we have a judgment for whether the query fact is similar to the list of candidates. We combine these using 136 a simple logistic regression model, treating each judgment over different metrics and terms as a feature with weight given by the judgment. For example, cosine similarity may judge candidate facts differing on their first argument to have a similarity of 0.2. As a result, a feature would be created with weight 0.2 for the pair (cosine, argument 1). In addition, features are created which are agnostic to which term differs (e.g., the cosine similarity on whichever term differs), bringing the total feature count to 44 for 11 similarity metrics.","Lastly, we define 3 auxiliary feature classes:","• Argument Similarity: We define a feature for the similarity between the two arguments in the query fact. Similarity metrics (particularly distributional similarity metrics) often capture a notion more akin to relatedness than similarity (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006); the subject and object of a relation are, in many cases, related in this sense.","• Bias: A single bias feature is included to account for similarity metrics which do not center on zero.","• No Support Bias: A feature is included for examples which have no candidate facts in the knowledge base."]},{"title":"4 Data","paragraphs":["Our approach is implemented using two datasets. The first, described in Section 4.1, is built using facts retrieved from running the University of Washington’s ReVerb system run over web text. To showcase the system within a cleaner environment, we also build a knowledge base from the MIT Media Lab’s ConceptNet. 4.1 ReVerb We created a knowledge base of facts by running ReVerb over ClueWeb09 (Callan et al., 2009). Extractions rated with a confidence under 0.5 were discarded; the first billion undiscarded extractions were used in the final knowledge base. This resulted in approximately 500 million unique facts.","Some examples of facts extracted with ReVerb are given in Table 2. Note that our notion of plausibility is far more unclear than in the ConceptNet data; many facts extracted from the internet are explicitly false, and others are true only in specific contexts, or are otherwise underspecified.","Argument 1 Relation Argument 2 cat Desires tuna fish air CapableOf move through","tiny hole","sneeze HasA allergy","person who IsA not wage-slaves","get more sleep Table 3: Example ConceptNet extractions.

ConceptNet is a hand-curated common sense database, taking information from multiple sources (including ReVerb) and consolidating them in a consistent format. We focus on the manually created portion of the database, extracted from sources such as the Open Mind Common Sense4","(Singh et al., 2002).","The knowledge base consists of 597,775 facts, each expressing one of 34 relations. Examples of facts in the ConceptNet database are given in Table 3. While the arguments are generally cleaner than the ReVerb corpus, there are nonetheless instances of fairly complex facts. 4.3 Training Data Our training data consists of a set of tuples, each consisting of a fact f and a database d which does not contain f . We create artificial negative training instances in order to leverage the standard classification framework. We would like negative examples which are likely to be implausible, but which are close enough to known facts that we can learn a reasonable boundary for discriminating between the two. To this end, we sample negative instances by modifying a single argument (or the relation) of a correspond-ing positive training instance. In more detail: we take a positive training instance (a1, r, a2) and a fact from our database (a′","1, r′",", a′","2), and compute the cosine similarity simcos(a1, a′","1), simcos(r, r′","),","and simcos(a2, a′ 2).

That is, if our database consists of d = {f0, f1, . . . fn} we construct training instances (fi, d \\ {fi}).

The first, described in Section 5.2, evaluates the system’s ability to discriminate plausible facts from sampled implausible facts, mirroring the training regime. The second evaluates the system as a semantic filter for ReVerb extractions, tested against human evaluations. The third uses our system for validating question answering responses. 5.1 Baselines We define a number of baselines to compare against. Many of these are subsets of our system, to justify the inclusion of additional complexity. Similar Fact Count This baseline judges the truth of a fact by tuning a threshold on the total number of similar facts in the database. This baseline would perform well if our negative facts were noticeably disconnected from our database. Argument Similarity A key discriminating feature may be the similarity between a1 and a2 in true versus false facts. This baseline thresholds the cosine similarity between arguments, tuned on the training data to maximize classification accuracy. Cosine Similarity At its core, our model judges the truth of a fact based on its similarity to facts in the database; we create a baseline to capture this intuition. For every candidate fact (differing in either an argument or the relation), we compute the cosine similarity between the query and the candidate, evaluated on the differing terms.

For both domains we train on a balanced dataset of 20,000 training and 10,000 test examples. Performance is measured in terms of classification accuracy, with a random baseline of50%.","Table 4 summarizes our results. The similar fact count baseline performs nearly at random chance, suggesting that our sampled negative facts cannot be predicted solely on the basis of connectedness with the rest of the database. Furthermore, we out-perform the cosine baseline, supporting the intuition that aggregating similarity metrics is useful.","To evaluate the informativeness of the confidence our system produces, we can allow our system to abstain from unsure judgments. Recall refers to the percentage of facts the system chooses to make a guess on; precision is the percentage of those facts which are classified correctly.

Many ReVerb extractions are semantically implausible, or clash with common-sense intuition. We annotate a number of extractions on Mechanical Turk, and attempt to predict the extractions’ feasibility.","This task is significantly more difficult than the intrinsic evaluations.

Another part stems from these facts already having been filtered once by ReVerb’s confidence estimator.","To collect training and test data, we asked work-ers on Amazon Mechanical Turk to rate facts as correct, plausible, or implausible. They were in-structed that they need not research the facts, and that correct facts may be underspecified. Workers were given the following descriptions of the three possible responses:","• Correct: You would accept this fact if you read it in a reputable source (e.g., Wikipedia) in an appropriate context.","• Plausible: You would accept this fact if you read it in a storybook.","• Implausible: The fact is either dubious, or otherwise nonsense.","Below this, five examples were shown alongside one control (e.g., (rock, float on, water)). Workers who answered more than 20% of the controls incorrectly were discarded.

The test corpus consists of 1286 positive and 689 negative examples (1975 total; 65% positive)","Our system was retrained with the human evaluated training data; to account for class bias, our system’s classification threshold was then tuned on the training data, optimizing for area under the precision/recall curve. Figure 4 illustrates our results, bounded below by majority choice. Our system achieves an area under the curve of 0.721; the cosine baseline has an area of 0.696.","Our system offers a viable trade-off of recall in favor of precision. For example, keeping only a third of the data can reduce the error rate by 25% – this can be appealing for large corpora where filtering is frequent anyways. 5.4 Answer Validation Exercise The Answer Validation Exercise, organized as a track at CLEF between 2006 and 2008, focuses on filtering candidate answers from question answering systems (Peñas et al., 2007; Peñas et al., 2008; Rodrigo et al., 2009). Systems are presented with a question, and a set of answers along with their justification. The answers are either validated, rejected, or given an annotation of unknown and ignored during scoring. Since the proportion of correct answers is small (around 10%), the evaluation measures precision and recall over true answers predicted by each system.","Many answers in the task are incorrect be-cause they violate common-sense intuition – for instance, one answer to What is leprosy? was Africa clinic. While any such specific mistake is easy to fix, our approach can be a means of handling a wide range of such mistakes elegantly.","To adapt our system to the task, we first heuristically converted the question into a query fact using the subject and object Stanford Dependency labels (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008). If either the subject or object specifies a type (e.g., Which party does Bill Clinton belong to?), the score of the fact encoding this relationship (e.g., (Democrat, be, party)) is averaged with the main query. Next, answers with very little n-gram overlap between the justification and either the question or answer are filtered; this filters answers which may be correct, but were not properly justified.
