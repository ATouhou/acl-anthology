In fact, the development of computer technologies and corpus-based approaches has enabled the identification of complex patterns of word associations, proving that the speakers use a large number of preconstructed phrases that constitute single choices (Sinclair, 1991:110). Several studies have also shown that great part of a speaker’s lexicon is composed by these word associations (Jackendoff, 1997; Fellbaum, 1998). These multiword expressions (MWE)1","appear in every kind of spoken and  1 The term multiword expression will be used to refer to any sequence of words that act as a single unit, embracing all different types of word combinations (collocations, compound nouns, light verbs, institutionalized phrases, idioms, etc.). written discourse and, despite the fact that they don’t pose any problems from the speaker’s point of view (we easily recognize that they function as a single unit that may have a specific meaning), natural language processing (NLP) applications, on the other hand, find notorious difficulties when dealing with them (Sag et al., 2000).","Bearing in mind the extreme importance of the study of this linguistic phenomenon for the improvement of NLP systems, this paper will address an ongoing analysis that aims to create a typology for MWE in Portuguese (based on a MWE lexicon previously extracted from a 50 million word written corpus) that will be used to enrich that lexicon with extensive information regarding these expressions. This annotated lexicon will be a resource that will allow for the annotation of these expressions in running text (Hendrickx et al., 2010a).","This presentation will briefly discuss compila-tion of the lexicon and the methodology adopted for MWE selection and organization (section 2), the typology based on syntactic, semantic and statistic criteria (section 3), the annotation proposal of the lexicon (section 4) and applications of the work (section 5)."]},{"title":"2 MWE: Corpus and Lexicon","paragraphs":["The work we are going to present used the lexicon of word combinations2","that was created within the scope of the project COMBINA-PT – Word Combinations in Portuguese Language 3",".

In all, the lexicon comprises 1.180 main lemmas, 14.153 group lemmas and 48.154 word combinations. Mendes et al. (2006) describe the criteria used for MWE selection: following the results of previous studies (Evert and Krenn, 2001; Pereira and Mendes, 2002), the authors first selected groups with MI5","values between 8 and 10, and, throughout manual validation, applied several criteria upon which usually relies the definition of a MWE: a) lexical and syntactic fixedness that can be observed through the possibility of replacing elements, inserting modifiers, changing the syntagmatic structure or gender/number features; b) total or partial loss of compositional meaning, which means that the meaning of the expressions can not be predicted by the meaning of the parts; c) frequency of occurrence, which means that the expressions may be semantically compositional but occur with high frequency, revealing sets of favoured co-occurring forms, which could tell that they may be in their way to a possible fixedness."]},{"title":"3 Data Analysis: Towards a Typology","paragraphs":["In contrast to languages for which there is a wide range of studies regarding MWE both from a linguistic and a computational point of view, for Portuguese little work has been done so far. Great part of the existing studies had paid more attention to idiomatic expressions and compound nouns in general, relegating the analysis of other types of expressions to the morphossyntactic properties of its elements (Macário Lopes, 1992; Chacoto, 1994; Baptista, 1994; Vilela, 2002; Ranchhod, 2003)6",".","Considering the existence of different types of MWE with different degrees of syntactic and semantic cohesion, our analysis tries to categorize these expressions taking into account their lexical, syntactic, semantic and pragmatic properties. Thus, from a semantic standpoint, three major classes were considered: (i) expressions with compositional meaning (pão de centeio ‘rye bread’); (ii) expressions with partial idiomatic meaning, i.e., at least one of the elements keeps its literal meaning  5 Statistical association measure (Church and Hanks, 1990). 6 Some research has been carried out regarding the identification and annotation of Complex Predicates, usually called in the literature Light Verb Constructions or Support Verb Constructions (Hendrickx et al., 2010b; Duran et al., 2011; Zeller and Padó, 2012). 88 (vontade de ferro ‘iron will’); (iii) expressions with total idiomatic meaning (pés de galinha ‘crow’s feet’). Note, however, that one may find notorious difficulties regarding the evaluation of the meaning of certain expressions that seems to be linked to two major factors: (i) the polysemous nature of the words (it is necessary to establish a boundary between compositional and figurative meanings. If we consider the literal meaning to be the first prototypical meaning of a word, this restrictive definition will trigger us to consider a large number of MWE as idiomatic); (ii) the awareness of the semantic motivation that had led to the idiomatic meanings, which depends on cultural and social factors. This semantic criterion implies that the same type of MWE may occur in different classes. It is the case with compound nouns. Although we tried to accentuate the different degrees of lexicalization of this type of expressions, we are acutely aware that drawing this dividing line neither is easy nor allows for accurate definitions and divisions. Within each of these three semantic categories, the expressions are also analyzed according to their grammatical category and lexical and syntactic fixedness. Regarding the latest aspect, the expressions may be: (i) fixed (no variation); (ii) semi-fixed (nominal/verbal inflection)7","; (iii) with variation: lexical (permutation, replacement of elements, insertion of modifiers) and/or syntactic (constructions with passives, relatives, pronouns, extraction, adjectival vs. prepositional modifiers). Our typology relies, then, on several categories, some of which we will briefly present.  Expressions with Compositional Meaning Favoured co-occurring forms – expressions that occurred with high frequency in the corpus, revealing a tendency to co-occur in certain contexts (pão seco ‘dry bread’, desvendar o mistério ‘unravel the mystery’). Expressions with full lexical and syntactic variation8",". Compound nouns – expressions that represent a single concept (noite de núpcias ‘wedding night’, cama de casal ‘double bed’, cavalo alazão9","‘chestnut horse’, Idade do Ferro ‘Iron Age’). Usually,  7 Since Portuguese is a highly inflectional language, practically all the verbs and nouns that occur in MWE inflect. 8 More examples of variation will be included in Section 4. 9 “Lexikalische Solidaritäten” (Coseriu, 1967). these expressions are semi-fixed. However, we also observed that some combinations may occur in a small distributional paradigm (cama de solteiro ‘single bed’) that allows for predicative constructions (a cama é de solteiro lit. ‘the bed is single’). Entities are fixed. Institutionalized expressions – expressions observed with higher frequency than any alternative lexicalization of the same concept (lufada de ar fresco ‘breath of fresh air’, condenar ao fracasso ‘doomed to failure’, abrir um precedente ‘set a precedent’). Apart from inflection, since there are alternative expressions, we also observed lexical variation, such as substitution (rajada de ar fresco ‘rush of fresh air’), insertion of modifiers (condenar este projecto ao fracasso lit. ‘to doom this project to failure’) and change in the syntagmatic structure (o precedente foi aberto ‘a precedent has been set’, abertura de um precedente lit. ‘the opening of a precedent’). Ligh verb constructions – expressions where the noun is used in a normal sense and the verb meaning appears to be bleached (dar um passeio ‘take a walk’). Expressions with lexical and syntactic variation (substitution, insertion of modifiers, change in the syntagmatic structure). proverbs (no poupar é que está o ganho ‘profit is in saving’). Despite our conception of proverbs as frozen expressions, the fact is that speakers’ lexical creativity may result in the production of expressions such as no anunciar/atacar/descontar/esperar/comparar é que está o ganho ‘profit is in announcing/attacking/discounting/waiting/comparing’.  Expressions with Partial Idiomatic Meaning Expressions with an additional meaning that can not be derived from the meaning of its parts10",", (cinturão negro ‘black belt’ + martial arts expert, abrir a boca ‘open the mouth’ + to speak/to yawn, deitar as mãos à cabeça lit. ‘throw the hands in the head’ (throw one’s hands up) + despair). Nominal expressions are semi-fixed while verbal expressions may undergo inflection and lexical variation, such as substitution (levar/lançar as mãos à cabeça lit. ‘put/lay the hands in the head’) and insertion of modifiers (deitou logo as mãos à cabeça lit. ‘put immediately his hands in his head’).  10 Quasi-phrasemes or quasi-idioms (Mel’cuk, 1998). 89 Compound nouns: (i) the meaning does not occur in any other combination (sorriso amarelo lit. ‘yellow smile’ → yellow = wry); (ii) the meaning may occur in different combinations (café fresco ‘fresh coffe’, pão fresco ‘fresh bread’ → fresh = recent); (iii) periphrastic nouns11","(continente negro ‘black continent’ = Africa); (iv) entities (dama de ferro ‘iron lady’). Apart from inflection, some expressions are subject to lexical and syntactic variation, namely insertion of modifiers (sorriso muito amarelo lit. ‘smile very yellow’), alternation between simple elements and elements with suffixes (sorrisinho amarelo lit. ‘little yellow smile’) and alternation between adjectival and prepositional modifiers (silêncio mortal ‘deadly silence’, silêncio de morte ‘silence of death’). Entities are fixed.  Expressions with Total Idiomatic Meaning Expressions transposed to another semantic field by metaphoric process (balde de água fria ‘cold shower’, faca de dois gumes ‘double-edge knife’, esticar o pernil ‘kick the bucket’, deitar água na fervura ‘pour oil on troubled waters’, a sangue frio ‘in cold blood’). Adverbial expressions are fixed. Some of the nominal and verbal structures may undergo lexical and syntactic variation, such as substitution (arma/espada/pau de dois gumes ‘double-edge weapon/sword/stick’), insertion of modifiers (deitar mais água na fervura ‘pour more oil on troubled waters’), permutation (estar de mãos e pés atados ‘bound hand and foot’, estar de pés e mãos atados ‘bound foot and hand’ (helpless)) and occurrence both in negative and affirmative sentences (ter olhos na cara lit. ‘have eyes in the face’ (put things in perspective), não ter olhos na cara lit. ‘do not have eyes in the face’). Compound nouns (flor de estufa ‘greenhouse plant’ (delicate person); mão de ferro ‘iron fist’). Apart from inflection, we observed alternation between simple elements and elements with suffixes. Proverbs (grão a grão enche a galinha o papo lit. ‘grain by grain the hen fills its belly’ (little strokes fell great oaks)). As in compositional proverbs, we also observed lexical variation (grão a grão enche muita gente o papo lit. ‘grain by grain lots of people fill their bellies’).   11 Cf. Sanromán, 2000. In what idiomatic expressions are concerned, it is important to note the fact that the transposition of an expression to another semantic field is a synchronic process that usually implies that at some point in time (including the present day) the expressions may simultaneously present compositional and idiomatic meanings (porto de abrigo ‘harbor’; ‘safe haven’). Curiously, from a statistical point of view, our study showed that the idiomatic meaning is the one that usually presents high frequency of occurrence. This information, together with the interpretation of the context, may help the automatic systems to decide whether they face a compositional or idiomatic expression. In a sweeping look at the data, we observed that MWE show particular properties according to their syntactic pattern. Thus, at the sentence level (proverbs and aphorisms), MWE usually do not accept syntactic changes (the possible change seems to be lexical, when speakers substitute one or more elements), while verb phrases admit much more morphossyntactic variation. Noun phrases, on the other hand, raise specific issues. Compositional groups can behave as idiomatic ones and it is not always easy to distinguish them. The modifiers of the noun can express different semantic relations (part of, made of, used for) that may interact with the meaning (literal or idiomatic) of the noun."]},{"title":"4 Annotation of the Lexicon","paragraphs":["The information presented on our typology will allow us to enrich the lexicon mentioned in Section 2. Our purpose is to have each MWE entry in the lexicon labeled regarding: (i) canonical form of the expression; (ii) definition of idiomatic expressions through synonyms or literal paraphrases; (iii) grammatical category of both the expression and its elements; (iv) idiomatic property and additional meanings; (v) possible variation; (vi) function of MWE parts (e.g., obligatory, optional, free). As we have seen before, MWE have different types of variation for which we have to account for. We will briefly discuss our proposal for handling the annotation of some cases of lexical and syntactic variation in the lexicon.  Lexical Variation Insertion of modifiers – lexical elements (usually with an emphatic function) that do not belong to the canonical form are not part of the MWE and 90 are not labeled (sorriso muito amarelo lit. ‘smile very yellow’). Lexical substitution – This variation is restrict-ed to limited set of alternatives. This set is record-ed in the MWE lexicon as ‘obligatory parts of the MWE and member of a set list’ (comer/vender/comprar/impingir/levar gato por lebre lit. ‘eat/sell/buy/impose/take a cat instead of a hare’ (buy a pig in a poke)). Free lexical elements – These elements are marked in the lexicon with, e. g., a pronoun (ALGUÉM ‘someone’, ALGUM ‘something’) or a particular phrase (NP, PP) (estar nas mãos de ALGUÉM ‘to be in the hands of someone’). There are also cases where parts of the MWE may freely vary, while other parts remain fixed (a educação é a mãe de todas as civilizações ‘educa-tion is the mother of all civilizations’, a liberdade é a mãe de todas as virtudes ‘liberty is the mother of all virtues’). These cases are treated likewise (ALGO é a mãe de todas as NOUN-PL ‘something is the mother of all NOUN-PL’) Also, since creative use of language can lead to MWEs that only partly match the canonical MWE (cf. proverbs), we label these parts as 'different from canonical form'.  Syntactic Variation Pronouns/Possessives – These elements will be marked up as part of the MWE, but will have an additional label to signal that they are optional (estar nas mãos dele/estar nas suas mãos ‘to be in the hands of him’/’to be in his hands’). From active to passive voice – Auxiliary verbs are not labeled as part of the MWE (passar ALGO a pente fino/ALGO foi passado a pente fino lit. ‘pass something with a fine toothcomb’/‘something was passed with a fine toothcomb’ (to scrutinize)).  According to Hendrickx et al. (2010a), this annotated lexicon could be the basis for the annotation of idiomatic MWE in running text12",". Each MWE encountered in the corpus would be annotated with a link to the corresponding entry in the lexicon. Linking each MWE to its canonical form  12 The authors’ approach is to annotate CINTIL corpus, a 1M word corpus of both spoken and written data from different sources that has been previously annotated with linguistic information such as part-of-speech, lemma, inflection, proper names, etc. (http://cintil.ul.pt/pt/). would allow for an easier detection of all occur-rences of one particular MWE and check its variation in the corpus. The annotation process would combine automatic retrieval with manual valida-tion in order to better account for variable expressions. Without doubt, the corpus would contain many MWE that were not yet listed in the lexicon. Therefore, each sentence would need to be checked manually for new MWE and the newly discovered expression would be manually added to the lexicon."]},{"title":"5 Conclusion","paragraphs":["This paper has shown the ongoing research that aims to describe, as detailed as possible, the syntactic and semantic properties of different types of Portuguese MWE. During our analysis, we encountered two major problems: (i) the evaluation of the meaning of certain expressions (compositional or idiomatic); (ii) the attempt to account for all possible lexical and syntactic variation. The information obtained from the typology will be used to annotate a MWE lexicon. Having a resource with such information (that includes additional meanings, possible variation that accounts for obligatory and optional elements, etc.) will be of extreme value for the development and evaluation of automatic MWE identification systems."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Baptista Jorge. 1994.
