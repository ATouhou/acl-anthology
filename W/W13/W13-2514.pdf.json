This paper proposes a method for exploiting Wikipedia articles without worrying about the position of the sentences in the text. The algorithm ranks the candidate sentence pairs by means of a customized metric, which combines different similarity criteria. Moreover, we limit the search space to a specific topical domain, since our final goal is to use the extracted data in a domain-specific Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) setting. The precision estimates show that the extracted sentence pairs are clearly semantically equivalent. The SMT experiments, however, show that the extracted data is not refined enough to improve a strong in-domain SMT system. Nevertheless, it is good enough to boost the performance of an out-of-domain system trained on sizable amounts of data."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["A high-quality Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) system can only be built with large quantities of parallel texts. Moreover, systems specialized in specific domains require in-domain training data. A well-known problem of SMT systems is that existing parallel corpora cover a small percentage of the possible language pairs and very few domains. We therefore need a language-independent approach for discovering parallel sentences in the available multilingual resources.","This idea was explored intensively in the last decade with different text sources, generically called comparable corpora, such as news feeds, encyclopedias or even the entire Web. The first approaches focused merely on news corpora and were either based on IBM alignment models (Zhao and Vogel, 2002; Fung and Cheung, 2004) or employing machine learning techniques (Munteanu and Marcu, 2005; Abdul Rauf and Schwenk, 2011).","The multilingual Wikipedia is another source of comparable texts, not yet thoroughly explored. Adafre and de Rijke (2006) describe two methods for identifying parallel sentences across it based on monolingual sentence similarity (MT and respectively, lexicon based). Fung et al. (2010) approach the problem by combining recall-and precision-oriented methods for sentence alignment, such as the DK-vec algorithm or algorithms based on cosine similarities. Both approaches have achieved good results in terms of precision and recall.","However, we are interested in real applica-tion scenarios, such as SMT systems. The following approaches report significant performance improvements when using the extracted data as training material for SMT: Smith et al. (2010) use a maximum entropy-based classifier with various feature functions (e.g. alignment coverage, word fertility, translation probability, distor-tion). Ştefănescu et al. (2012) propose an algorithm based on cross-lingual information retrieval, which also considers similarity features equivalent to the ones mentioned in the previous paper.","The presented approaches extract general purpose sentences, but we are interested in a specific topical domain. We have previously tackled the problem (Plamada and Volk, 2012) and en-countered two major bottlenecks: the alignment algorithm for matching possible candidates and the similarity metric used to compare them. To our knowledge, existing sentence alignment algorithms (including the one we have employed in the first place) have a monotonic order constraint, meaning that crossing alignments are not 112 allowed. But this phenomenon occurs often in Wikipedia, because its articles in different languages are edited independently, without respect-ing any guidelines. Moreover, the string-based comparison metric proved to be unreliable for identifying parallel sentences.","In this paper we propose an improved approach for selecting parallel sentences in Wikipedia articles which considers all possible sentence pairs, regardless of their position in the text. The selection will be made by means of a more informed similarity metric, which rates different aspects concerning the correspondences between two sentences. Although the approach is language and domain-independent, the present paper reports results obtained through querying the German and French Wikipedia for Alpine texts (i.e. mountaineering reports, hiking recommendations, articles on the biology and the geology of mountainous regions). Moreover, we report preliminary results regarding the use of the extracted corpus for SMT training."]},{"title":"2 Finding candidate articles","paragraphs":["The general architecture of our parallel sentence extraction process is shown in Figure 1. We applied the approach only to the language pair German-French, as these are the languages we have expertise in. In the project Domain-specific Statistical Machine Translation1","we have built an SMT system for the Alpine domain and for this language pair. The training data comes from the Text+Berg corpus2",", which contains the digitized publications of the Swiss Alpine Club (SAC) from 1864 until 2011, in German and French. This SMT system will generate the automatic translations required in the extraction process.","The input consists of German and French Wikipedia dumps3",", available in the MediaWiki format 4",". Therefore our workflow requires a preprocessing step, where the MediaWiki contents are transformed to XML and then to raw text. Preprocessing is based on existing tools, such as WikiPrep5",", but further customization is needed in order to correctly convert localized MediaWiki elements (namespaces, templates, date and number formats etc.). We then identify Wikipedia articles","1","http://www.cl.uzh.ch/research en.html","2","See www.textberg.ch","3","Accessed in September 2011","4","http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki","5","http://sourceforge.net/projects/wikiprep/ Figure 1: The extraction workflow available in both languages by means of the inter-language links provided by Wikipedia itself. This reliable information is a good basis for the extraction workflow, since we do not have to worry about the document alignment.","Upon completion of this step, we have extracted a bilingual corpus of approximately 400 000 articles per language. The corpus is subsequently used for information retrieval (IR) queries aiming to identify the articles belonging to the Alpine domain. The input queries contain the 100 most frequent mountaineering keywords in the Text+Berg corpus (e.g. Alp, Gipfel, Berg, Route in German and montagne, sommet, voie, cabane in French). This filter reduces the search space to 40 000 articles. Although we have refined our search terms by discarding the ones occurring frequently in other text types (e.g. meter, day, year, end), we were not able to avoid a small percentage of false positives. Once we extract the Alpine comparable corpus, we proceed to the extraction of 113 parallel sentences, which will be thoroughly discussed in the following section. See (Plamada and Volk, 2012) for more details about the extraction pipeline."]},{"title":"3 Finding parallel segments in Wikipedia articles","paragraphs":["The analysis of our previous results brought into attention many ”parallel“ sentence pairs of different lengths, meaning that the shared translated content does not span over the whole sentence. As an example, consider the following sentences which have been retrieved by the extraction pipeline. Although they both contain information about the valleys connected by the Turini pass, the German sentence contains a fragment about its position, which has not been translated into French. DE: Der Pass liegt in der äusseren, besiedelten Zone des Nationalpark Mercantour und stellt den Übergang zwischen dem Tal der Bévéra und dem Tal der Vésubie dar. FR: Le col de Turini relie la vallée de la Vésubie à la vallée de la Bévéra.","If this sentence pair would be used for MT training, it would most probably confuse the system, because noisy word alignments are to be expected. Our solution to this problem is to split the sentences into smaller entities (e.g. clauses) and then to find the alignments on this granularity level. The clause boundary detection is performed independently for German and French, respectively, following the approach developed by Volk (2001). The general idea is to split the sentences into clauses containing a single full verb.","Our alignment algorithm, unlike previous approaches, ignores the position of the clauses in the texts. Although Wikipedia articles are divided into sections, their structure is not synchronized across the language variants, since articles are edited independently. We have encountered, for example, cases where one section in the French article was included in the general introduction of the German article. If we would have considered sections boundaries as anchor points, we would have missed useful clause pairs. We therefore decided to use an exhaustive matching algorithm, in order to cover all possible combinations.","For the sake of simplicity, we reduce the problem to a monolingual alignment task by using an intermediary machine translation of the source article. We decided that German articles should always be considered the source because we expect a better automatic translation quality from German to French. The translation is performed by our in-house SMT system trained on Alpine texts. The algorithm generates all possible clause pairs between the automatic translation and the targeted article and computes for each of them a similarity score. Subsequently it reduces the search space by keeping only the 3 best-scoring alignment candidates for each clause. Finally the algorithm returns the alignment pair which maximizes the similarity score and complies with the injectivity constraint. In the end we filter the results by allowing only clause pairs above the set threshold.","We defined our similarity measure as a weighted sum of feature functions, which returns values in the range [0,1]. The similarity score models two comparison criteria:","• METEOR score We used the METEOR similarity metric because, unlike other string-based metrics (e.g. BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002)), it considers not only exact matches, but also word stems, synonyms, and paraphrases (Denkowski and Lavie, 2011). Suppose that we compute the similarity between the following sentences in French: j’ aimerais bien vous voir and je voudrais vous voir (both meaning I would like to see you). BLEU, which is a string-based metric, would assign a similarity score of 52.5. This value could hardly be considered reliable, given that the sentence ta voiture vous voir (paired with the first sentence) would get the same BLEU score, although the latter sentence (EN: your car see you) is obviously nonsense. On the other hand, METEOR would return a score of 90.3 for the original sentence pair, since it can appreciate that the two pronouns (je and j’) are both variations of the first person singular in French and that the predicates convey the same meaning.","• Number of aligned content words However, METEOR scores can also be misleading, since they rely on automatic word alignments. Two sentences are likely to receive a high similarity score when they share many aligned words. However, the alignments are not always reliable. We often saw 114 sentence pairs with a decent Meteor score where only some determiners, punctuation signs or simple word collocations (e.g. de la montagne (EN: of the mountain)) were matched. As an illustration, consider the following sentence pair and its corresponding alignment: Hyp: les armoiries , le désir de la ville de breslau par ferdinand i. le 12 mars 1530 a Ref: le 19 juin 1990 , le conseil municipal rétablit le blason original de la ville 2-4 3-5 5-12 6-13 7-14 13-0 Although the sentences are obviously not semantically equivalent (a fact also suggested by the sparse word alignments), the pair receives a METEOR score of 0.23. We decided to compensate for this by counting only the aligned pairs which link content words and dividing them by the total number of words in the longest sentence from the considered pair. In the example above, only one valid alignment (7-14) can be identified, therefore the sentence pair will get a partial score of 1/18. In this manner we can ensure the decrease of the initial similarity score.","Additionally, we have defined a token ratio feature to penalize the sentence length differences. Although a length penalty is already included in the METEOR score, we still found false candidate pairs with exceedingly different lengths. Therefore we decided to use this criterion as a selection filter rather than including it in the similarity function, in order to increase the chances of other candidates with similar length. Even if no other candidate will pass all the filters, at least we expect the precision to increase, since we will have one false positive less.","The final formula for the similarity score between two clauses src in the source language and, respectively trg in the target language is: score(src, trg) = w1 ∗ s1 + (1 − w1) ∗ s2 (1) where s1 represents the METEOR score and s2 the alignment score.","The weights, as well as the final threshold are tuned to maximize the correlation with human judgments. We modeled the task as a minimization problem, where the function value increases by 1 for each correctly selected clause pair and decreases by 1 for each wrong pair. The solution (consisting of the individual weights and the threshold) is found using a brute force approach, for which we employed the scipy.optimize package from Python. The training set consists of an article with 1300 clause pairs, 25 of which are parallel and the rest non-parallel. We chose this distribution of the useful/not useful clauses because this corresponds to the real distribution observed in Wikipedia articles. In the best configuration, we retrieve 23 good clause pairs and 1 wrong. This corresponds to a precision of 95% and a recall of 92% on this small test set.","However, we can influence the quantity of extracted parallel clauses by manually adjusting the final filter threshold. Figure 2 depicts the size variations of the resulting corpus at different thresholds, where the relative frequency is represented on a logarithmic scale. We notice that the rate of decrease is linear in the log scale of the number of extracted clause pairs. We start at a similarity score of 0.2 because the pairs below this threshold are too noisy. The data between 0.2 and 0.3 is already mixed, as it will be shown in the following sections. However, since this data segment contains approximately twice as much data as the summed superior ones, we decided to include it in the corpus. Figure 2: The distribution of the extracted clause pairs at different thresholds","Table 1 presents German-French clause pairs with their corresponding similarity scores. On the top we can find rather short clauses (up to 10 words) with perfectly aligned words. One expects that the decrease of the values implies that 115 Nr.

A manual inspection of the extracted pairs showed that this is not always the case. We have found clause pairs with almost perfect 1-1 word correspondences and a similarity score of only 0.51. The ”low” score is due to the fact that we are comparing human language to automatic translations, which are not perfect.","On the other hand, a comparable score can be achieved by a pair in which one of the clauses contains some extra information (e.g. pair number 7). The extra parts in the German variant (2248 km2","große - EN: with an area of 2248 km2","; 3954 m hohen - EN: 3954 m high) cannot be separated by means of clause boundary detection, since they don’t contain any verbs. This finding would motivate the idea of splitting the phrases into subsentential segments (linguistically motivated or not) and aligning the segments, similar to what Munteanu (2006) proposed. Nevertheless, we consider this pair a good candidate for the parallel corpus.","Pair number 8 has the same coordinates (i.e. an extra tail in the German variant), yet it receives a lower score, which might disqualify it for the final list, if we only look at the numbers. In this case, the low score is caused by the German compounds (Vulkanbauten, Hocheifel), which are unknown to the SMT system, therefore they are left untranslated and cannot be aligned. However, we argue that this clause pair should also be part of the extracted corpus. 116 Score Average sentence length range German French [0.9 − 1.0] 4 4.26 [0.8 − 0.9) 4.87 5.04 [0.7 − 0.8) 6.47 6.65 [0.6 − 0.7) 10.78 10.71 [0.5 − 0.6) 12.09 11.51 [0.4 − 0.5) 11.91 11.80 [0.3 − 0.4) 11.28 11.22 [0.2 − 0.3) 11.22 11.01 Table 2: The average sentence length for different score ranges","The last pair is definitely a bad candidate for a parallel corpus, since the clauses do not convey the same meaning, although they share many words (avoir un effet - auswirken, sur la santé - auf die Gesundheit). A subsentential approach would allow us to extract the useful segments in this case, as well. There are, of course, pairs with similar scores and poorer quality, therefore 0.2 is the low-est threshold which can provide useful candidate pairs. At the other end of the scale, we consider pairs above 0.4 as parallel and everything below as comparable. As a general rule, a high threshold ensures a high accuracy of the extraction pipeline.","Table 2 presents the average length (number of tokens) of the extracted clauses for different ranges of the similarity score. We notice that the best ranked clauses tend to be very short, whereas the last ranked are longer, as the examples in table 1 confirm. However, the average length over the whole extracted corpus is below 10 words, a small value compared to the results reported on Wikipedia articles by Ştefănescu and Ion (2013). This finding is due to the fact that we are aligning clauses instead of whole sentences.","We expected the German sentences to be usually shorter than the French ones (or at least have a similar number of words), since they are more likely to contain compounds. This fact is confirmed by the first part of the table. A turnaround occurs in the range (0.5,0.6), where the German sentences become slightly longer than the French ones, since they tend to contain extra information (see also table 1)."]},{"title":"4 Experiments and Results","paragraphs":["The conducted experiments have focused only on the extraction of parallel clauses and their use in a SMT scenario. For this purpose, we have used as input the articles selected and preprocessed in the previous development phase (Plamada and Volk, 2012). Specifically, the data set consists of 39 000 parallel articles with approximately 6 million German clauses and 2.7 million French ones. We were able to extract 225 000 parallel clause pairs out of them, by setting the final filter threshold to 0.2. This means that roughly 4% of the German clauses have an French equivalent (and 8% when reporting to the French clauses), figures comparable to our previous results on a different sized data set. However, the quality of the extracted data is higher than in our previous approaches.","To evaluate the quality of the parallel data extracted, we manually checked a set of 200 automatically aligned clauses with similarity scores above 0.25. For this test set, 39% of the extracted data represent perfect translations, 26% are translations with an extra segment (e.g. a noun phrase) on one side and 35% represent misalignments. However, given the high degree of parallelism between the clauses from the middle class, we consider them as true positives, achieving a precision of 65%. Furthermore, 40% of the false positives have been introduced by matching proper names, 32% contain matching subsentential segments (word sequences longer than 3 words) and 27% represent failures in the alignment process. 4.1 SMT Experiments In addition to the manual evaluation discussed in the previous subsection, we have run preliminary investigations with regard to the usefulness of the extracted corpus for SMT. In this evaluation scenario, we use only pairs with a similarity score above 0.35. The results discussed in this section refer only to the translation direction German-French. The SMT systems are trained with the Moses toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007), according to the WMT 2011 guidelines6",". The translation performance was measured using the BLEU evaluation metric on a single reference translation. We also report statistical significance scores, in order to indicate the validity of the comparisons between the MT systems (Riezler and Maxwell, 2005). We consider the BLEU score difference significant if the computed p-value is below 0.05.","We compare two baseline MT systems and several systems with different model mixtures (trans-6 http://www.statmt.org/wmt11/baseline.html 117 lation models, language models or both). The first baseline system is an in-domain one, trained on the Text+Berg corpus and is the same used for the automatic translations required in the extraction step (see section 3). The second system is purely out-of-domain and it is trained on Europarl, a collection of parliamentary proceedings (Koehn, 2005). The development set and the test set contain in-domain data, held out from the Text+Berg corpus. Table 3 lists the sizes of the data sets used for the SMT experiments. Data set Sentences DE Words FR Words SAC 220 000 4 200 000 4 700 000 Europarl 1 680 000 37 000 000 43 000 000 Wikipedia 120 000 1 000 000 1 000 000 Dev set 1424 30 000 33 000 Test set 991 19 000 21 000 Table 3: The size of the German-French data sets","Our first intuition was to add the extracted sentences to the existing in-domain training corpus and to evaluate the performance of the system. In the second scenario, we added the extracted data to an SMT system for which no in-domain parallel data was available. For this purpose, we experimented with different combinations of the models involved in the translation process, namely the German-French translation model (responsible for the translation variants) and the French language model (ensures the fluency of the output). Besides of the models trained on the parallel data available in each of the data sets, we also built combined models with optimized weights for each of the involved data sets. The optimization was performed with the tools provided by Sennrich (2012) as part of the Moses toolkit. We also want to compare several language models, some trained on the individual data sets, others obtained by linearly interpolating different data sets, all optimized for minimal perplexity on the in-domain development set. The results are summarized in table 4.","A first remark is that an out-of-domain language model (LM) adapted with in-domain data (extracted from Wikipedia and/or SAC data) significantly improves on top of a baseline system trained with out-of-domain texts (Europarl, EP) with up to 1.7 BLEU points. And this improve-ment can be achieved with only a small quantity of additional data compared to the size of the original training data (120k or 220k versus 1680k sentence pairs). When replacing the out-of-domain Translation Language model BLEU model score Europarl TM EP LM 9.45 Europarl TM EP+Wiki LM 10.39 EP+Wiki TM EP+Wiki LM 10.37 Europarl TM EP+Wiki+SAC LM 11.22 EP+Wiki TM EP+Wiki+SAC LM 11.74 EP+WMix TM EP+Wiki+SAC LM 10.40 SAC TM SAC LM 16.71 SAC+Wiki TM SAC+Wiki LM 16.51 SAC+WMix TM SAC+Wiki LM 16.37 Table 4: SMT results for German-French translation model with a combined one (including the Wikipedia data set) and keeping only the adapted language models, we can observe two tendencies. In the first case (using a combination of out-of-domain and Wikipedia-data for the language model), the BLEU score remains approximately at the same level (10.37-10.39), the difference not being statistically significant (p-value = 0.387).","The addition of quality in-domain data for the LM from the previous configuration brings an improvement of 0.5 BLEU points on top of the best Europarl system (11.22 BLEU points). Given that all other factors are kept constant, this improve-ment can be attributed to the additional translation model (TM) trained on Wikipedia data. More-over, the statistical significance tests confirm that the improved system performs better than the previous one (p-value = 0.005). To demonstrate that these results are not accidental, we replaced the Wikipedia extracted sentences with a random combination thereof (referred to as WMix) and re-trained the system. Under these circumstances, the performance of the system dropped to 10.40 BLEU points. These findings demonstrate the effect of a small in-domain data set on the performance of an out-of-domain system trained on big amounts of data. If the data is of good quality, it can improve the performance of the system, other-wise it significantly deteriorates it.","We notice that the performance of a strong in-domain baseline system (SAC) cannot be heavily influenced (either positively or negatively) by translation and language model mixtures combining existing in-domain data with Wikipedia data. In terms of BLEU points, the mixture models trained with ”good” Wikipedia data cause a perfor-118 mance drop of 0.2, but the significance test shows that the difference is not statistically significant (p-value = 0.08). On the other hand, the TM including shuffled Wikipedia sentences causes a performance drop of 0.34 BLEU points, which is statistically significant (p-value = 0.013). We can conclude that the quantity of the data is not the decisive factor for the performance change, but rather the quality of the data. The Wikipedia extracted data set maintains the good performance, whereas a random mixture of the Wikipedia data set causes a performance decrease. Therefore the focus of future work should be on obtaining high quality data, regardless of its amount."]},{"title":"5 Conclusions and Outlook","paragraphs":["In this paper we presented a method for extracting domain-specific parallel data from Wikipedia articles. Based on previous experiments, we focus on clause level alignments rather than on full-sentence extraction methods. Moreover, the rank-ing of the candidates is based on a metric combining different similarity criteria, which we defined ourselves. The precision estimates show that the extracted sentence pairs are clearly semantically equivalent. The SMT experiments, however, show that the extracted data is not refined enough to improve a strong in-domain SMT system. Nevertheless, it is good enough to overtake an out-of-domain system trained on 10 times bigger amounts of data.","Since our extraction system is merely a prototype, there are several ways to improve its performance, including better filtering for in-domain articles, finer grained alignment and more sophisticated similarity metrics. For example, the selection of domain-specific articles can be improved by means of an additional filter based on Wikipedia categories. The accuracy of the extraction procedure can be improved by means of a more informed similarity metric, weighting more feature functions. Moreover, we can bypass the manual choice of thresholds by employing a classifier (e.g. SVMlight","(Joachims, 2002)). Additionally, we could try to align even shorter sentence fragments (not necessarily linguistically motivated).","We are confident that Wikipedia can be seen as a useful resource for SMT, but further investiga-tion is needed in order to find the best method to exploit the extracted data in a SMT scenario. For this purpose, quality data should be preferred over sizable data. We would therefore like to experi-ment with different ratio combinations of the data sets (Wikipedia extracted and in-domain data) until we find a combination which outperforms our in-domain baseline system."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Sadaf Abdul Rauf and Holger Schwenk. 2011.
