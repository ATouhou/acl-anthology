We use machine learning classification using lexical, word ending and dictionary-based features, with linear support vector machines and random forests. We find that lexical features are the most helpful."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Text dating, or determination of the time period when it was written, proves to be a useful component in NLP systems that can deal with such diachronistically dynamic inputs (Mourão et al., 2008). Besides this, the models that can perform such classification can shine light on less than obvious changes of certain features.","The knowledge captured in such systems can prove useful in transferring modern language resources and tools to historical domains (Meyer, 2011). Automatic translation systems between and across language stages, as in the corpus introduced by (Magaz, 2006), can benefit from the identification of feature variation over time.","In this paper we study the problem of supervised temporal text classification across genres and authors. The problem turns out to be solvable to a very high degree of accuracy."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["The influence of the temporal effects in automatic document classification is analyzed in (Mourão et al., 2008) and (Salles et al., 2010). The authors state that a major challenge in building text classification models may be the change which occurs in the characteristics of the documents and their classes over time (Mourão et al., 2008). Therefore, in order to overcome the difficulties which arise in automatic classification when dealing with documents dating from different epochs, identifying and accounting for document characteristics changing over time (such as class frequency, relationships between terms and classes and the similarity among classes over time (Mourão et al., 2008)) is essential and can lead to a more accurate discrimination between classes.","In (Dalli and Wilks, 2006) a method for classification of texts and documents based on their predicted time of creation is successfully applied, proving that accounting for word frequencies and their variation over time is accurate. In (Kumar et al., 2012) the authors argue as well for the capability of this method, of using words alone, to determine the epoch in which a text was written or the time period a document refers to.","The effectiveness of using models for individuals partitions in a timeline with the purpose of pre-dicting probabilities over the timeline for new documents is investigated in (Kumar et al., 2011) and (Kanhabua and Nørvåg, 2009). This approach, based on the divergence between the language model of the test document and those of the timeline partitions, was successfully employed in pre-dicting publication dates and in searching for web pages and web documents.","In (de Jong et al., 2005) the authors raise the problem of access to historical collections of documents, which may be difficult due to the different historical and modern variants of the text, the less standardized spelling, words ambiguities and 102 other language changes. Thus, the linking of current word forms with their historical equivalents and accurate dating of texts can help reduce the temporal effects in this regard.","Recently, in (Mihalcea and Nastase, 2012), the authors introduced the task of identifying changes in word usage over time, disambiguating the epoch at word-level."]},{"title":"3 Approach 3.1 Datasets used","paragraphs":["In order to investigate the diachronic changes and variations in the Romanian lexicon over time, we used copora from five different stages in the evolution of the Romanian language, from the 16th to the 20th","century. The 16th","century represents the beginning of the Romanian writing. In (Dimitrescu, 1994, p. 13) the author states that the modern Romanian vocabulary cannot be completely understood without a thorough study of the texts written in this period, which should be considered the source of the literary language used to-day. In the 17th","century, some of the most important cultural events which led to the development of the Romanian language are the improvement of the education system and the establish-ing of several printing houses (Dimitrescu, 1994, p. 75). According to (Lupu, 1999, p. 29), in the 18th","century a diversification of the philological interests in Romania takes place, through writing the first Romanian-Latin bilingual lexicons, the draft of the first monolingual dictionary, the first Romanian grammar and the earliest translations from French. The transition to the Latin alphabet, which was a significant cultural achievement, is completed in the 19th","century. The Cyrillic alphabet is maintained in Romanian writing until around 1850, afterwards being gradually replaced with the Latin alphabet (Dimitrescu, 1994, p. 270). The 19th","century is marked by the conflict (and eventually the compromise) between etymologism and phonetism in Romanian orthography. In (Maiorescu, 1866) the author argues for apply-ing the phonetic principle and several reforms are enforced for this purpose. To represent this period, we chose the journalism texts of the leading Romanian poet Mihai Eminescu. He had a crucial influence on the Romanian language and his contribution to modern Romanian development is highly appreciated. In the 20th","century, some variations regarding the usage of diacritics in Romanian orthography are noticed.","Century Corpus Nwords type token 16 Codicele Todorescu 3,799 15,421 Codicele Martian 394 920 Coresi, Evanghelia cu ı̂nvăt ̧̆atură 10,361 184,260 Coresi, Lucrul apostolesc 7,311 79,032 Coresi, Psaltirea slavo-română 4,897 36,172 Coresi, Târgul evangheliilor 6,670 84,002 Coresi, Tetraevanghelul 3,876 36,988 Manuscrisul de la Ieud 1,414 4,362 Palia de la Orăsţie 6,596 62,162 Psaltirea Hurmuzaki 4,851 32,046 17 The Bible 15,437 179,639 Miron Costin, Letopisetu̧l T ̧̆arii Moldovei 6,912 70,080 Miron Costin, De neamul moldovenilor 5,499 31,438 Grigore Ureche, Letopisetu̧l T ̧̆arii Moldovei 5,958 55,128 Dosoftei, Viata̧ si petreacerea sfinti̧lor 23,111 331,363 Varlaam Motoc, Cazania 10,179 154,093 Varlaam Motoc, Răspunsul ı̂mpotriva 2,486 14,122 Catehismului calvinesc 18 Antim Ivireanul, Opere 11,519 123,221 Axinte Uricariul, Letopisetu̧l T ̧̆arii 16,814 147,564 Românesti si̧ al T ̧̆arii Moldovei Ioan Canta, Letopisetu̧l T ̧̆arii Moldovei Dimitrie Cantemir, Istoria ieroglifică 13,972 130,310 Dimitrie Eustatievici Braso̧veanul, 5,859 45,621 Gramatica românească Ion Neculce, O samă de cuvinte 9,665 137,151 19 Mihai Eminescu, Opere, v.

We handled word boundaries and lower-cased all words. We computed, for each text in our corpora, the number of words (type and token). The results are listed in Table 1. For identifying words from our corpora in dictionaries, we performed lemmatization. The information provided by the machine-readable dictionary dexonline 1","regarding inflected forms al-lowed us to identify lemmas (where no semantic or part-of-speech ambiguities occurred) and to further lookup the words in the dictionaries. In our investigations based on dexonline we decided to use the same approach as in (Mihalcea and Nastase, 2012) and to account only for unambiguous words. For example, the Romanian word ai is morphologically ambiguous, as we identified two corresponding lemmas: avea (verb, meaning to have) and ai (noun, meaning garlic). The word amânare is semantically ambiguous, having two different associated lemmas, both nouns: amânar (which means flint ) and amâna (which means to postpone). We do not use the POS information di-1 http://dexonline.ro 103 rectly, but we use dictionary occurrence features only for unambiguous words.","The database of dexonline aggregates information from over 30 Romanian dictionaries from different periods, from 1929 to 2012, enabling us to investigate the diachronic evolution of the Romanian lexicon. We focused on four different sub-features:","• words marked as obsolete in dexonline definitions (we searched for this tag in all dictionaries)","• words which occur in the dictionaries of archaisms (2 dictionaries)","• words which occur in the dictionaries published before 1975 (7 dictionaries)","• words which occur in the dictionaries published after 1975 (31 dictionaries) As stated before, we used only unambiguous words with respect to the part of speech, in order to be able to uniquely identify lemmas and to extract the relevant information.
