Though events have long been a subject of study, the NLP community has yet to achieve a consensus on the treatment of events, in spite of its critical importance to several areas in natural language processing, such as topic detection and tracking (Allan et al., 1998), information extraction (Humphreys et al., 1997), question answering (Narayanan and Harabagiu, 2004), textual entailment (Haghighi et al., 2005), and contradiction detection (De Marneffe et al., 2008). Most attempts to provide annotation of event coreference have been limited to specific scenarios or domains, as in LDC’s ACE and Machine Reading event annotation (Humphreys et al., 1997; Bagga and Baldwin, 1999; He, 2007). The recent OnotoNotes annotations include more general event mentions and coreference, but mainly identify coreferences between verbs and nominalizations (Pradhan, 2007). Events are also a central element of the Time-ML temporal relation annotation, with an overlap-ping but slightly different approach (Pustejovsky, et al., 2010). Truly comprehensive event detection must encompass the detection of events and their subevents, and take into account bridging references (Poesio and Artstein, 2005; 2008). The requisite event representation is clearly related to the information available in lexical resources such as PropBank, VerbNet, and FrameNet, but goes well beyond anything they currently contain. Bejan and Harabagiu (2010) have recently offered broader event coreference annotation for evaluation purposes, which was revised and extended by Lee et al., (2012). The organizers are themselves involved in event coreference projects for deep natural language understanding and medical informatics. The time is ripe to bring together people interested in a serious discussion about the nature, definition, recognition, and representation of events and their parts and aspects. As a community we have to develop appropriate guidelines, resources, and processes for dealing with events and inter-event coreference. In this workshop we structure the discussion around three themes: • Foundations: What are Events? Definition and recognition. • Coreference: When are two events the same? What kinds of identity are there? • Representation: How best to represent events and event groups? This is a genuine “working\" workshop. Leading up the workshop, the organizers, with the assistance of the program committee, organized a shared annotation task on event mention and coreference annotation. Data was made available for participants to annotate, and the resulting annotations were analyzed for agreements and disagreements. During the workshop, the principal differences emerging from the different annotation schemes will be highlighted and discussed, with the intention of reaching a consensus on the handling of events and their coreference in future work in the NLP community. We have invited James Pustejovsky, the leader of the Time-ML effort, whose contribution as the keynote address are much appreciated. We hope that this workshop will be the beginning of a concerted effort to come to grips with the iii challenging topic of events. Reference","1.
