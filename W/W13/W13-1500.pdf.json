This interest is mainly due to the greater importance of the Web and the need to provide equal access and equal opportunity to people with diverse disabilities. The role of assistive technologies based on language processing has gained importance as it can be observed from the growing number of efforts (United Nations declarations on universal access to information or the WAI guidelines related to content) and research in conferences and workshops (W4A, ICCHP, ASSETS, SLPAT, etc.). However, language resources and tools to develop assistive technologies are still scarce. This 2nd Workshop of Natural Language Processing for Improving Textual Accessibility (NLP4ITA) aimed to bring together researchers focused on tools and resources for making textual information more accessible to people with special needs including diverse ranges of hearing and sight disabilities, cognitive disabilities, elderly people, low-literacy readers and adults being alphabetized, among others. NLP4ITA 2013 received 9 contributions from which 6 papers were accepted. We believe the accepted papers are of high quality and present a mixture of interesting topics. We would like to thank all people who in one way or another helped in making this workshop a success. Our special thanks go to Kathleen F. McCoy for accepting to give the invited presentation, to the members of the program committee who did an excellent job in reviewing the submitted papers, to Sandra Szasz for designing and updating the NLP4ITA website, and to the NAACL organizers. Last but not least, we would like to thank our authors and the participants of the workshop.
