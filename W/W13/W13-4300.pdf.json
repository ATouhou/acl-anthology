The workshop is a satellite event of IJCNL 2013 being held at Nagoya, Japan, 14-18 October, 2013. These days, lexical resources form a critical component of NLP systems. Even though statistical, ML driven approaches are the ruling paradigm in many sub areas of NLP, the \"accuracy plateau\" or the saturation is often overcome only with the deployment of lexical resources. In this year’s ALR workshop, there were 15 submissions of which 10 were accepted after rigorous double blind review. The topics of the papers form a rich panorama with sentiment analysis, annotation, parsing, bilingual dictionary, semantics and so on. Languages too are diverse covering Punjabi, Bangla, Hindi, Malayalam, Vietnamese and Chinese amongst others. We hope the proceedings of the workshop will be a valuable addition to knowledge and technique of processing Asian Languages.
