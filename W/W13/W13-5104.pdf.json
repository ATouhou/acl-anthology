Newborn screening for rare diseases has been adopted by many European and North American jurisdictions. The results of genetic testing are given to millions of families and children’s guardians who often turn to the Internet to find more information about the disease. We found 42 medical forums and blogs where parents and other related adults form virtual communities to discuss the disease diagnosis, share related knowledge and seek moral support. Many people (up to 75% in some population groups) look for professional medical publications to find reliable information. How can it be made easier for these non-medical professionals to understand such texts? We suggest that recommender systems, installed on web sites of research and teaching health care organizations, can be a tool that helps parents to navigate a massive amount of available medical information. In this paper, we discuss NLP architecture of such a system.

Accumulatively, rare diseases are not uncommon. In UK, one in 17 people will be affected at some point in their lives; this equates to more than 3.5 million people. Most of these will be children, and 30% of individuals with a rare disease will die before they are five years old. 1"," In Canada, one in 12 people suffer from a rare disease, and the number of identified rare diseases identified constantly increases. 2 Nevertheless, Raffle and Gray (2007) note that screening programs can induce harm. Whereas the programs improve health status in patients by diagnosing them early and treating optimally, after the screening, parents and guardians of the newborns receive a substantial amount of new information about health of their children. The results may cause parental stress and anxiety, among other negative factors. To aid in naviga-tion through the screening results, health care authorities organized web-based resource centers, such as a joint web site by the Newborn Screening Ontario program and Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario  A prevailing understanding is that early diagnosis and treatment may ease the burden of a disease. Thus, newborn screening for rare diseases has become a routine procedure in USA, Canada and the member states of the European Union. 3 or the Newborn Screen-","ing web site by the National Health Service 4 Emergence of user-friendly online technologies prompted the general public to turn to the Internet to gain more knowledge on health-related issues, a phenomenon often referred to as Dr. Google. A 2011 survey of the US population estimated that i) 59% of all adults have looked online for information about health topics such .   1 http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcblog/2013/02/28/ what-is-the-cost-of-rare-diseases/ 2 http://rare-diseases.ca/ 3 http://www.newbornscreening.on.ca/bins/index.asp 4 http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Screening/Pages/Newbo rnscreening.aspx 24 as a specific disease or treatment, ii) 18% of adults have consulted online reviews of particular drugs or medical treatments, iii) 29% of all adults sought online health information related to somebody’s else medical condition (Fox 2011; Fox 2011a). Preference in online searches related to specific health problems was previously reported by Nicholas et al. (2003).  At the same time, the general public does not consider different sources of the available health information as being equal. 75% of non-medical professionals aim their online searchers at professional medical sites and publications (McMullan, 2006). Many individuals prefer to have an access to a complex and complete information (80%), whereas some feel that the information usually accessed is too basic (45%) (ibid). An important question arises as to how well the readers can understand the information they retrieve. Eysenbach (2003) reported that patients who sought health information online felt that Internet information can be overwhelming (31%), conflicting (76%) and confusing (27%).  The system that we are building aims to help individuals, specifically parents of newborns, to navigate and assess medical publications about rare diseases. "]},{"title":"2 Motivation","paragraphs":["It has been documented that many parental users of the Internet are first-time parents (Oprescu et al, 2013) and parents with young children (Balka and Butt, 2006). They might not have a hands-on experience or practice in dealing with a complex medical issue and information related to it and can be easily overwhelmed. This is especially true for parents of newborn babies which were screened positive for one of the rare diseases.  The screening happens at the very beginning of the child’s life. A positive result may cause parents’ insecurity and increase their uncertainty about future (Brashers, 2001). Gaining new knowledge through relevant information is one of the tools that can alleviate stress and anxiety (Brashers, 2000). It is natural that the affected parents search for information about the diagnosis and turn their attention to professional medical publications.  In the quest for knowledge, parents face a challenge of understanding a complex text that in-cludes assessment of the relevance of the retrieved information and ability to differentiate among available options. This necessitates, among other required skills, ability to discriminate between different degrees of certainty and evaluate the likelihood score found in the text (Holmes, 1982; Morante and Sporleder, 2012). "]},{"title":"3 Medical Forum Data","paragraphs":["To get a notion of the public concerns and ques-tions, we automatically extracted and manually analyzed messages posted on medical forums and blogs dedicated to newborn screening for rare diseases.  We selected 42 forums frequently visited by parents and families concerned about newborn screening and its consequences (e.g., forums.familyeducation.com,www.justmommies.c om/babies/newborn,www.parentingforums.org /forum.php). We did not require research ethics review for this study as all of the data collected and used was from publically available sources. Nevertheless, we confirmed with our institutional research ethics board that no review of research on public data sets was necessary."," To find what parents think and discuss, we followed two strategies to collect data: a manual search and automated crawling of parenting forums and blogs. In our manual data collection, we used Google to find blogs, comments and medical forums that could post messages with the relevant content.

First, we performed manual search to find forums with the related phrases mentioned above. Then we used URLs of the selected forums as a seed for Nutch. We stored the collected HTML pages in MySQL database. Next, we searched these pages with Apache Solr, which uses the cosine similarity metric to find related page to the search query:    where A and B are the term frequency vectors of the query and a document. We marked page as relevant if it contained any three-phrase combination built from three sets of phrases mentioned earlier in this section.  After finding pages with relevant comments, their content was downloaded and analyzed in-dependently by two authors.

Previously, several studies connected the use of modal verbs (can, might, should), amplifiers (certainly, definitely) with the level of expectation of an event (Henriksson and Velupillai, 2010; Sokolova and Lapalme, 2011).  However, these studies did not categorize epistemic expressions based on their strength of conviction in the event happening. We categorize the strength of conviction by assigning six categories: impossible, improbable, uncertain, possible, probable, and certain (Horn, 1989; Sokolova et al, 2010). Table 2 shows the categories and expressions.  Table 2: Examples of epistemic expressions Epistemic category Expressions Impossible Never happens Improbable Hardly expected Uncertain We unsure Possible Perhaps Probable There is a certain risk Certain We always see  The suggested six categories add three negative categories (impossible, improbable, uncertain) to common positive happenstance categories (possible, probable, certain) (R. Saurı́and J. Pustejovsky, 2009).  Language expressions corresponding to the categories contain extensional modifiers, i.e. modifiers of degree and happenstance (Sokolova and Lapalme, 2011). The modifiers can be modal verbs (can, must, would), adverbs (likely, most-ly), adjectives (common, rare) and quantifying pronouns (every, none). These expressions should be disambiguated in the context of a sentence or a clause.  Below we categorize a few expressions found in articles on rare diseases: • Impossible: such off-target gene modulat-","ing effects are currently impossible to pre-","dict • Improbable: in part out of concern that re-","cruitment of eligible subjects with SMA Type","I would be difficult because of their high level of inter-current illness and mortality in childhood","• Uncertain: these studies could not rule out an additional contribution resulting from restoration of SMN levels in muscle","• Possible: raising the possibility that intrinsic responses to low levels of SMN in skeletal muscle may also contribute directly to SMA pathogenesis","• Probable: Studies have shown that restoring SMN protein levels in neurons can significantly ameliorate disease progression","• Certain: A neighboring nearly-identical copy of this gene, SMN2, is invariably present in individuals with SMA  Our next step was to assess the presence of epistemic expressions in articles on rare diseases."]},{"title":"5 Empirical evidence","paragraphs":["For our preliminary study we decided on a group of articles dedicated to spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a neurodegenerative disease affecting 1 in 11000 newborns world- wide (Farooq et al, 2013). We selected six full-length research articles. The articles were published in Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases, Neurodegenerative Diseases (an open source book), Journal of Clinical Investigation, Plos One, and Human Molecular Genetics (2 articles)."," The articles’ content covers most of parent concerns (see Table 1): a) severity of the disease, b) available treatment and the effects of an early treatment, c) a possible course of the disease, reliability of tests, d) medications. Thus, the article selection allows the empirical results to be representative of the information parents will find. At the same time, we cover language expressions belonging to different authors.  Three articles were written by a team of leading researchers in SMA; these authors have written papers that receive a high rank in SMA search through Google Scholar; hence, there is a high probability that parents looking for the SMA information will first encounter papers published by this team (Articles A). Three other articles were written by other teams working on SMA research (Articles B). We report the descriptive statistics in Table 3; vocabulary signifies different words in the text."," 27 Table 3: Vocabulary richness of the six articles; d.leg. – vocabulary with occur. = 1, h.leg. – vocabulary with occur. = 2, occ > 5 – vocabulary that occur 6 and more times.","Articles A # words vocab. d. leg. h. leg.

For the information retrieval, we built N-gram models of each article (N = 1, ..., 4). We tokenized data by splitting along spaces and punctuation marks. We kept the original capitalization to preserve the beginning of sentences. We used combinations of the seed words to find N-grams with the epistemic meaning. Table 4 lists examples of the seed words.

","Manual analysis showed that the most frequent bi- and tri-grams expressed negative and positive conviction, supporting the proposed expansion of epistemic categories by negative impossible, improbable and uncertain.

Although a thirst for medical knowledge among non-medical readers has been documented (see Section 1), there are not many developed NLP tools and methods that help such readers to understand medical texts.  Although epistemic disambiguation is important for text understanding, other text analysis tasks are essential in order to build an effective system that helps parents to understand medical publications related to rare diseases. Hence, the proposed system name is the Parent Advisor.  We suggest that such the Parent Advisor is organized as a pipeline of NLP and Text Mining tools, each serving a special purpose (Figure 1): 1. social media analyzer, to identify concept","shift in parents’ concerns; 2. article content classifier, to select relevant","articles for further analysis; 3. relevant article ranker, to evaluate the use-","fulness of the selected articles; 4. factual information extractor, to retrieve in-","formation related to parents’ concerns 5. epistemic disambiguator, to assess the re-","trieved factual information. 6. the output ranker, which ranks the factual","information according to the assigned epis-","temic categories.  We also suggest that human participation should be incorporated in the system functioning. To support the actuality of text analysis, parents can be surveyed and polled either on a regular basis or in relation to medical and health-related events (e.g., a new discovery, a proposed change in health care) (Fox, 2011). Medical professionals should be involved in the article ranking, to ensure the quality of the selected publications. Additionally to standard text annotation, a team of communication and medical professionals can assist in the factual information extraction and epistemic disambiguation (Scott et al, 2012).

Emergence of electronic health records enabled studies of epistemic expressions, often linking them with the diagnosis of a patient (McCoy et al, 2012; S. Velupillai’ 2010). Expressions of certainty in the medical publications, however, are not well studied, although it is natural to expect a medical publication to contain epistemic expressions: while presenting factual information, a publication also conveys the authors’ inference from the facts and conviction in the event happenstance."," Categorizing text into speculative and nonspeculative parts partially addresses the problem (Szarvas, 2008; Sanchez et al, 2010) as such division only differentiates the certain (aka nonspeculative) category from other epistemic categories. We, however, want to analyze language expressions of several epistemic categories.  Vagueness in clinical records was studied by Emanuel and Emanuel (1989) and more recently by Hyland (2006) and Scott et al (2012). These studies concentrate on the use of happenstance modifiers (Sokolova and Lapalme, 2011), also known as linguistic hedges (e.g., possible, probably, few, consistent with). The goal is to develop an automated analysis of diagnosis and symptom information extracted from electronic patient records (Scott et al, 2012). Although the task is similar to our goal, we plan to work with information extracted from medical publications.  A more complex approach would be to introduce a pragmatic component into the epistemic analysis of medical publications. This approach differentiates between a hypothesis, accepted knowledge, and new experimental knowledge (Nawaz et al, 2010). Such categorization may be useful in the recommender system designed for the general public. In future, we plan to work on the hypothesis - experimental knowledge division.  Our work also closely relates to text understanding and interpretation (Bos, 2011). With the development of Internet search engines, text understanding and interpretation mainly focused on retrieval of texts relevant to the query. A few systems develop a more advanced and deep text exploration which interprets text on demand from the system users (Dunne et al, 2012). The systems are field-specific, often built on ontology, and are designed to help professionals working in the field (Dunne et al, 2012; Wimalasuriya and Dou, 2010). An advanced, semantically based information retrieval is performed by question-answering systems. In medicine, such systems assist clinicians to find clinically-relevant information (Cao et al, 2011). Our goal, in con-30 trast, is to build a system that helps the general public to understand professional medical text.  Note that during the related work analysis, we could not find published studies that relate parent concerns to social media to rare disease information."]},{"title":"8 Future Work Our immediate future work will focus on epistemic annotation of a large collection of SMA articles.

Parent Advisor can help parents to understand medical publications related to rare diseases. The topic of rare diseases became a subject of many discussions, as more and more jurisdictions adopted a policy of newborn screening for rare diseases."," To make our future system actual and useful for parents, we have studied messages posted on 42 medical forums. These forums are frequently visited by parents and families who have ques-tions related to newborn screening for rare diseases. We identified several issues that concern the general public most (prevalence and severity of the disease, available treatment and the effects of an early treatment, a possible course of the disease, reliable tests, health care facilities, medications and their side effects, future use of the results).  We chose epistemic disambiguation as the focus of our first sub-project in building Parent Advisor. We identified six epistemic categories (impossible, improbable, uncertain, possible, probable, certain), thus expanding a usual range of positive categories (possible, probable certain) by negative categories (impossible, improbable, uncertain).  In this paper, we also outlined the architecture of the system, sketched human-system collabora-tion desirable for the system to be effective, and presented a detailed plan for future work."," Acknowledgments"]},{"title":"This work was in part supported by Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery Grant.
