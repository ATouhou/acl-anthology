The task of sentence compression in particular has benefited from the availability of a number of useful resources such as the the Ziff-Davis compression corpus (Knight and Marcu, 2000) and the Edinburgh compression corpus (Clarke and Lapata, 2006b) which make compression problems highly relevant for data-driven approaches involving language generation.","The sentence compression task addresses the problem of minimizing the lexical footprint of a sentence, i.e., the number of words or characters in it, while preserving its most salient informa-tion. This is illustrated in the following example from the compression corpus of Clarke and Lapata (2006b): Original: In 1967 Chapman, who had cultivated a conventional image with his ubiquitous tweed jacket and pipe, by his own later admission stunned a party attended by his friends and future Python colleagues by coming out as a homosexual. Compressed: In 1967 Chapman, who had cultivated a conventional image, stunned a party by coming out as a homosexual. Compression can therefore be viewed as analogous to text summarization1","defined at the sentence level. Unsurprisingly, independent selection of tokens for an output sentence does not lead to fluent or meaningful compressions; thus, compression systems often assemble output text from units that are larger than single tokens such as n-grams (McDonald, 2006; Clarke and Lapata, 2008) or edges in a dependency structure (Filippova and Strube, 2008; Galanis and Androutsopoulos, 2010). These systems implicitly rely on a structural representation of text—as a sequence of tokens or as a dependency tree respectively—to to underpin the generation of an output sentence.","In this work, we present structured transduction: a novel supervised framework for sentence compression which employs a joint inference strategy to simultaneously recover sentence compressions under both these structural representations of text—a token sequence as well as a tree of syntactic dependencies. Sentence generation is treated as a discriminative structured prediction task in which rich linguistically-motivated 1","To further the analogy, compression is most often formulated as a word deletion task which parallels the popular view of summarization as a sentence extraction task. 65 features can be used to predict the informativeness of specific tokens within the input text as well as the fluency of n-grams and dependency relationships in the output text. We present a novel constrained integer linear program that optimally solves the joint inference problem, using the notion of commodity flow (Magnanti and Wolsey, 1994) to ensure the production of valid acyclic sequences and trees for an output sentence.","The primary contributions of this work are:","• A supervised sequence-based compression model which outperforms Clarke & Lapata’s (2008) state-of-the-art sequence-based compression system without relying on any hard syntactic constraints.","• A formulation to jointly infer tree structures alongside sequentially-ordered n-grams, thereby permitting features that factor over both phrases and dependency relations. The structured transduction models offer additional flexibility when compared to existing models that compress via n-gram or dependency factorizations. For instance, the use of commodity flow constraints to ensure well-formed structure permits arbitrary reorderings of words in the input and is not restricted to producing text in the same order as the input like much previous work (McDonald, 2006; Clarke and Lapata, 2008; Filippova and Strube, 2008) inter alia.2","We ran compression experiments with the proposed approaches on well-studied corpora from the domains of written news (Clarke and Lapata, 2006b) and broadcast news (Clarke and Lapata, 2008). Our supervised approaches show significant gains over the language model-based compression system of Clarke and Lapata (2008) under a variety of performance measures, yielding 13-15% relative F1 improvements for 4-gram retrieval over Clarke and Lapata (2008) under identical compression rate conditions."]},{"title":"2 Joint Structure Transduction","paragraphs":["The structured transduction framework is driven by the fundamental assumption that generating fluent text involves considerations of diverse structural relationships between tokens in both input and output sentences. Models for sentence compression often compose text from units that are","2","We do not evaluate token reordering in the current work as the corpus used for experiments in §3 features human-generated compressions that preserve token ordering. larger than individual tokens, such as n-grams which describe a token sequence or syntactic relations which comprise a dependency tree. However, our approach is specifically motivated by the perspective that both these representations of a sentence—a sequence of tokens and a tree of dependency relations—are equally meaningful when considering its underlying fluency and integrity. In other words, models for compressing a token sequence must also account for the compression of its dependency representation and vice versa.","In this section, we discuss the problem of recovering an optimal compression from a sentence as a linear optimization problem over heterogenous substructures (cf. §2.1) that can be assembled into valid and consistent representations of a sentence (cf. §2.2). We then consider rich linguistically-motivated features over these substructures (cf. §2.3) for which corresponding weights can be learned via supervised structured prediction (cf. §2.4). 2.1 Linear Objective Consider a single compression instance involving a source sentence S containing m tokens. The notation ̂S is used to denote a well-formed compression of S. In this paper, we follow the standard assumption from compression research in assuming that candidate compressions ̂S are assembled from the tokens in S, thereby treating compression as a word-deletion task. The inference step aims to retrieve the output sentence ̂S∗","that is the most likely compression of the given input S, i.e., the ̂S that maximizes p( ̂S|S) ∝ p( ̂S, S) or, in an equivalent discriminative setting, the ̂S that maximizes a feature-based score for compression","̂S∗ ≜ arg max","̂S","w⊤ Φ(S, ̂S) (1) where Φ(S, ̂S) denotes some feature map parameterized by a weight vector w.","Let T ≜ {ti : 1 ≤ i ≤ m} represent the set of tokens in S and let xi ∈ {0, 1} represent a token indicator variable whose value corresponds to whether token ti is present in the output sentence ̂S. The incidence vector x ≜ ⟨x1, . . . , xm⟩⊤ therefore represents an entire token configuration that is equivalent to some subset of T .","If we were to consider a simplistic bag-of-tokens scenario in which the features factor entirely over the tokens from T , the highest-scoring 66 compression under (1) would simply be the token configuration that maximizes a linear combination of per-token scores, i.e.,","∑","ti∈T xi · θtok(i) where θtok : N → R denotes a linear scoring function which measures the relative value of retain-ing ti in a compression of S based on its features, i.e., θtok(i) ≜ w⊤","tokφtok(ti). Although this can be solved efficiently under compression-rate constraints, the strong independence assumption used is clearly unrealistic: a model that cannot consider any relationship between tokens in the output does not provide a token ordering or ensure that the resulting sentence is grammatical.","The natural solution is to include higher-order factorizations of linguistic structures such as n-grams in the objective function. For clarity of ex-position, we assume the use of trigrams without loss of generality. Let U represent the set of all possible trigrams that can be constructed from the tokens of S; in other words U ≜ {⟨ti, tj, tk⟩ : ti ∈ T ∪ {START}, tj ∈ T, tk ∈ T ∪ {END}, i ̸= j ̸= k}. Following the notation for token indicators, let yijk ∈ {0, 1} represent a trigram indicator variable for whether the contiguous sequence of tokens ⟨ti, tj, tk⟩ is in the output sentence. The incidence vector y ≜ ⟨yijk⟩⟨ti,tj,tk⟩∈U hence represents some subset of the trigrams in U . Similarly, let V represent the set of all possible dependency edges that can be established among the tokens of S and the pseudo-token ROOT, i.e., V ≜ {⟨i, j⟩ : i ∈ T ∪ {ROOT}, j ∈ T, tj is a dependent of ti in S}. As before, zij ∈ {0, 1} represents a dependency arc indicator variable indicating whether tj is a direct dependent of ti in the dependency structure of the output sentence, and z ≜ ⟨zij⟩⟨ti,tj⟩∈V represents a subset of the arcs from V .","Using this notation, any output sentence ̂S can now be expressed as a combination of some token, trigram and dependency arc configurations ⟨x, y, z⟩. Defining θngr and θdep analogously to θtok for trigrams and dependency arcs respectively, we rewrite (1) as","̂S∗ = arg max","x,y,z ∑ ti∈T xi · θtok(i) + ∑ ⟨ti,tj,tk⟩∈U yijk · θngr(i, j, k) + ∑ ⟨ti,tj⟩∈V zij · θdep(i, j)","= arg max x,y,z","x⊤ θ","tok + y⊤ θ","ngr + z⊤ θ dep (2) where θtok ≜ ⟨θtok(i)⟩ti∈T denotes the vector of token scores for all tokens ti ∈ T and θngr and θdep represent vectors of scores for all trigrams and dependency arcs in U and V respectively. The joint objective in (2) is an appealingly straightforward and yet general formulation for the compression task. For instance, the use of standard substructures like n-grams permits scoring of the output sequence configuration y under probabilistic n-gram language models as in Clarke and Lapata (2008). Similarly, consideration of dependency arcs allows the compressed dependency tree z to be scored using a rich set of indicator features over dependency labels, part-of-speech tags and even lexical features as in Filippova and Strube (2008).","However, unlike the bag-of-tokens scenario, these output structures cannot be constructed efficiently due to their interdependence. Specifically, we need to maintain the following conditions in order to obtain an interpretable token sequence y:","• Trigram variables yijk must be non-zero if and only if their corresponding word variables xi, xj and xk are non-zero.","• The non-zero yijk must form a sentence-like linear ordering, avoiding disjoint structures, cycles and branching. Similarly, a well-formed dependency tree z will need to satisfy the following conditions:","• Dependency variables zij must be non-zero if and only if the corresponding word variables xi and xj are.","• The non-zero zij must form a directed tree with one parent per node, a single root node and no cycles. 2.2 Constrained ILP Formulation We now discuss an approach to recover exact solutions to (2) under the appropriate structural constraints, thereby yielding globally optimal compressions ̂S ≡ ⟨x, y, z⟩ given some input sentence S and model parameters for the scoring functions. For this purpose, we formulate the inference task for joint structural transduction as an integer linear program (ILP)—a type of linear program (LP) in which some or all of the decision variables are restricted to integer values. A number of highly optimized general-purpose solvers exist for solving ILPs thereby making them tractable for sentence-level natural language problems in which the number of variables and constraints is described by a low-order polynomial over the size of the input. 67","Recent years have seen ILP applied to many structured NLP applications including dependency parsing (Riedel and Clarke, 2006; Martins et al., 2009), text alignment (DeNero and Klein, 2008; Chang et al., 2010; Thadani et al., 2012) and many previous approaches to sentence and document compression (Clarke and Lapata, 2008; Filippova and Strube, 2008; Martins and Smith, 2009; Clarke and Lapata, 2010; Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2011; Woodsend and Lapata, 2012). 2.2.1 Basic structural constraints We start with constraints that define the behavior of terminal tokens. Let y∗jk, yij∗ and z∗j denote indicator variables for the sentence-starting trigram ⟨START, tj, tk⟩, the sentence-ending trigram ⟨ti, tj, END⟩ and the root dependency ⟨ROOT, tj⟩ respectively. A valid output sentence will started and terminate with exactly one trigram (perhaps the same); similarly, exactly one word should act as the root of the output dependency tree.","∑ j,k y∗jk = 1 (3) ∑ i,j yij∗ = 1 (4) ∑ j z∗j = 1 (5) Indicator variables for any substructure, i.e., n-gram or dependency arc, must be kept consistent with the token variables that the substructure is defined over. For instance, we require constraints which specify that tokens can only be active (non-zero) in the solution when, for 1 ≤ p ≤ n, there is exactly one active n-gram in the solution which contains this word in position p.3","Tokens and dependency arcs can similarly be kept consistent by ensuring that a word can only be active when one incoming arc is active. xl − ∑ i,j,k: l∈{i,j,k} yijk = 0, ∀tl ∈ T (6) xj − ∑ i zij = 0, ∀tj ∈ T (7)","3","Note that this does not always hold for n-grams of order n > 2 due to the way terminal n-grams featuring START and END are defined. Specifically, in a valid linear ordering of tokens and ∀r ∈ 1 . . . n − 2, there can be no n-grams that feature the last n−r −1 tokens in the r’th position or the first n − r − 1 tokens in the (n − r + 1)’th position. However, this is easily tackled computationally by assuming that the terminal n-gram replaces these missing n-grams for near-terminal tokens in constraint (6). 2.2.2 Flow-based structural constraints A key challenge for structured transduction models lies in ensuring that output token sequences and dependency trees are well formed. This requires that output structures are fully connected and that cycles are avoided. In order to accomplish this, we introduce additional variables to establish single-commodity flow (Magnanti and Wolsey, 1994) between all pairs of tokens, inspired by recent work in dependency parsing (Martins et al., 2009). Linear token ordering is maintained by defining realvalued adjacency commodity flow variables γ","adj","ij which must be non-zero whenever tj directly follows ti in an output sentence. Similarly, tree-structured dependencies are enforced using additional dependency commodity flow variables γ","dep","ij which must be non-zero whenever tj is the dependent of ti in the output sentence. As with the structural indicators, flow variables γ adj ∗j , γ adj i∗ , γ","dep","∗j are also defined for the terminal pseudo-tokens START, END and ROOT respectively.","Each active token in the solution consumes one unit of each commodity from the flow variables connected to it. In conjunction with the consistency constraints from equations (6) and (7), this ensures that cycles cannot be present in the flow structure for either commodity. ∑ i γc ij − ∑ k γc jk = xj, ∀tj ∈ T, (8) ∀c ∈ {adj, dep} By itself, (8) would simply set all token indicators xi simultaneously to 0. However, since START and ROOT have no incoming flow variables, the amount of commodity in the respective outgo-ing flow variables γ adj ∗j and γ","dep","∗j remains unconstrained. These flow variables therefore provide a point of origin for their respective commodities.","In order for commodity flow to be meaningful, it should be confined to mirroring active structural indicators; for this, we first restrict the amount of commodity in any γc","ij to be non-negative. γc ij ≥ 0, ∀ti, tj ∈ T (9) ∀c ∈ {adj, dep} The adjacency commodity is then linked to the n-grams that would actually establish an adjacency relationship between two tokens, while the dependency commodity is linked to its corresponding dependency arcs. In conjunction with (8–9), these 68 START END ROOT Production was closed down at Ford last night for the Christmas period .","8 γadj","1,3 = 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 7 γdep 3,1 = 1","2 1 2 1 1","Figure 1: An illustration of commodity values for a valid solution of the program. The adjacency com-","modity γadj","and dependency commodity γdep","are denoted by solid and dashed lines respectively. constraints also serve to establish connectivity for their respective structures. γ adj ij − Cmax ∑ k yijk ≤ 0, ∀ti, tj ∈ T (10) γ adj jk − Cmax ∑ i yijk ≤ 0, ∀tj, tk ∈ T (11) γ dep ij − Cmaxzij ≤ 0, ∀ti, tj ∈ T (12) where Cmax is the maximum amount of commodity that the γij variables may carry and serves as an upper bound on the number of tokens in the output sentence. Since we use commodity flow to avoid cyclical structure and not to specify spanning arborescences (Martins et al., 2009), Cmax can simply be set to an arbitrary large value. 2.2.3 Compression rate constraints The constraints specified above are adequate to enforce structural soundness in an output compression. In addition, compression tasks often involve a restriction on the size of the output sentence. When measured in tokens, this can simply be expressed via constraints over token indicators. ∑ i xi ≥ Rmin (13) ∑ i xi ≤ Rmax (14) where the compression rate is enforced by restrict-ing the number of output tokens to [Rmin, Rmax]. 2.3 Features The scoring functions θ that guide inference for a particular compression instance are defined above as linear functions over structure-specific features. We employ the following general classes of features for tokens, trigrams and dependency arcs.","1. Informativeness: Good compressions might require specific words or relationships between words to be preserved, highlighted, or perhaps explicitly rejected. This can be expressed through features on token variables that indicate a priori salience.4","For this purpose, we rely on indicator features for part-of-speech (POS) sequences of length up to 3 that surround the token and the POS tag of the token’s syntactic governor conjoined with the label. Inspired by McDonald (2006), we also maintain indicator features for stems of verbs (at or adjacent to the token) as these can be useful indications of salience in compression. Finally, we maintain features for whether tokens are negation words, whether they appear within parentheses and if they are part of a capitalized sequence of tokens (an approximation of named entities).","2. Fluency: These features are intended to capture how the presence of a given substructure contributes to the overall fluency of a sentence. The n-gram variables are scored with a feature expressing their log-likelihood under an LM. For n-gram variables, we include features that indicate the POS tags and dependency labels corresponding to the tokens it covers. Dependency variable features involve indicators for the governor POS tag conjoined with the dependency direction. In addition, we also use lexical features for prepositions in the governor position of dependency variables in order to indicate whether certain prepositional phrases are likely to be preserved in compressions.","3. Fidelity: One might reasonably expect that many substructures in the input sentence will appear unchanged in the output sentence. Therefore, we propose boolean features that indicate that a substructure was seen in the input. Fidelity scores are included for all n-gram variables alongside label-specific fi-","4 Many compression systems (Clarke and Lapata, 2008;","Filippova and Strube, 2008) use a measure based on tf*idf","which derives from informativeness score of Hori and Furui","(2004), but we found this to be less relevant here. 69 delity scores for dependency arc variables, which can indicate whether particular labels are more or less likely to be dropped.","4. Pseudo-normalization: A drawback of using linear models for generation problems is an inability to employ output sentence length normalization in structure scoring. For this purpose, we use the common machine translation (MT) strategy of employing word penalty features. These are essentially word counts whose parameters are intended to balance out the biases in output length which are induced by other features. Each scale-dependent feature is recorded both absolutely as well as normalized by the length of the input sentence. This is done in order to permit the model to acquire some robustness to variation in input sentence length when learning parameters. 2.4 Learning In order to leverage a training corpus to recover weight parameters w∗","for the above features that encourage good compressions for unseen data, we rely on the structured perceptron of Collins (2002). A fixed learning rate is used and parameters are averaged to limit overfitting.5","In our experiments, we observed fairly stable convergence for compression quality over held-out development corpora, with peak performance usually encountered by 10 training epochs."]},{"title":"3 Experiments","paragraphs":["In order to evaluate the performance of the structured transduction framework, we ran compression experiments over the newswire (NW) and broadcast news transcription (BN) corpora collected by Clarke and Lapata (2008). Sentences in these datasets are accompanied by gold compressions—one per sentence for NW and three for BN—produced by trained human annotators who were restricted to using word deletion, so paraphrasing and word reordering do not play a role. For this reason, we chose to evaluate the systems using n-gram precision and recall (among other metrics), following Unno et al. (2006) and standard MT evaluations.","We filtered the corpora to eliminate instances with less than 2 and more than 110 tokens and used","5","Given an appropriate loss function, large-margin structured learners such as k-best MIRA (McDonald et al., 2005) can also be used as shown in Clarke and Lapata (2008). the same training/development/test splits from Clarke and Lapata (2008), yielding 953/63/603 sentences respectively for the NW corpus and 880/78/404 for the BN corpus. Dependency parses were retrieved using the Stanford parser6","and ILPs were solved using Gurobi.7","As a state-of-the-art baseline for these experiments, we used a reimplementation of the LM-based system of Clarke and Lapata (2008), which we henceforth refer to as CL08. This is equivalent to a variant of our proposed model that excludes variables for syntactic structure, uses LM log-likelihood as a feature for trigram variables and a tf*idf -based significance score for token variables, and incorporates several targeted syntactic constraints based on grammatical relations derived from RASP (Briscoe et al., 2006) designed to encourage fluent output.","Due to the absence of word reordering in the gold compressions, trigram variables y that were considered in the structured transduction approach were restricted to only those for which tokens appear in the same order as the input as is the case with CL08. Furthermore, in order to reduce computational overhead for potentially-expensive ILPs, we also excluded dependency arc variables which inverted an existing governor-dependent relationship from the input sentence parse.","A recent analysis of approaches to evaluating compression (Napoles et al., 2011b) has shown a strong correlation between the compression rate and human judgments of compression quality, thereby concluding that comparisons of systems which compress at different rates are unreliable. Consequently, all comparisons that we carry out here involve a restriction to a particular compression rate to ensure that observed differences can be interpreted meaningfully. 3.1 Results Table 1 summarizes the results from compression experiments in which the target compression rate is set to the average gold compression rate for each instance. We observe a significant gain for the joint structured transduction system over the Clarke and Lapata (2008) approach for n-gram F1.

(2011b) indicate that various other metrics over syntactic relations such as those produced by RASP also correlate significantly with human judgments of compression quality. Compressed sentences were therefore parsed with RASP as well as the Stanford dependency parser and their resulting dependency graphs were compared to those of the gold compressions. These metrics show statistically insignificant differences except in the case of F1 over Stanford dependencies for the NW corpus.8","Comparisons with CL08 do not adequately address the question of whether the performance gain observed is driven by the novel joint inference approach or the general power of discriminative learning. To investigate this, we also studied a variant of the proposed model which eliminates the dependency variables z and associated commodity flow machinery, thereby bridging the gap between the two systems discussed above. This system, which we refer to as Seq ST, is other-wise trained under similar conditions as Joint ST. Table 2 contains an example of incorrect system output for the three systems under study and illustrates some specific quirks of each, such as the tendency of CL08 to preserve deeply nested noun phrases, the limited ability of Seq ST to identify heads of constituents and the potential for plausible but unusual output parses from Joint ST.","Figure 2 examines the variation of content word F1% when the target compression rate is varied for the BN corpus, which contains three refer-","8","Our RASP F1 results for Clarke and Lapata (2008) in Table 1 outperform their reported results by about 10% (absolute) which may stem from our Gigaword-trained LM or improvements in recent versions of RASP.","Input When Los Angeles hosted the Olympics in 1932 , Kurtz competed in high platform diving.","Gold When Los Angeles hosted the Olympics , Kurtz competed in high diving .","CL08 When Los Angeles hosted Olympics in 1932 , in high platform diving .","Seq ST When Los Angeles hosted the Olympics , Kurtz competed in high platform","Joint ST When Los Angeles hosted the Olympics in 1932 , Kurtz competed diving .

Although the gold compressions are often unreachable under low rates, this provides a view into a model’s ability to select meaningful words under compression constraints.

As all three systems track each other fairly closely, the plot conveys the absolute difference of the ST systems from the CL08 baseline, which reveals that Joint ST largely outperforms Seq ST under different compression conditions. We also note that a high compression rate, i.e., minimal compression, is generally favorable to CL08 under the RASP F1 measure and conjecture that this may be due to the hard syntactic constraints employed by CL08, some of which are defined over RASP relations. At higher compression rates, these constraints largely serve to prevent the loss of meaningful syntactic relationships, e.g., that between a preposition and its prepositional phrase; however, a restrictive compression rate would likely result in all such mutually-constrained components be-ing dropped rather than simultaneously preserved. 71 Figure 2: Informativeness of compressions in the BN test corpus indicated by noun and verb F1% with respect to gold at different compression rates."]},{"title":"4 Related Work","paragraphs":["An early notion of compression was proposed by Dras (1997) as reluctant sentence paraphrasing under length constraints. Jing and McKeown (2000) analyzed human-generated summaries and identified a heavy reliance on sentence reduction (Jing, 2000). The extraction by Knight and Marcu (2000) of a dataset of natural compression instances from the Ziff-Davis corpus spurred interest in supervised approaches to the task (Knight and Marcu, 2002; Riezler et al., 2003; Turner and Charniak, 2005; McDonald, 2006; Unno et al., 2006; Galley and McKeown, 2007; Nomoto, 2007). In particular, McDonald (2006) expanded on Knight & Marcu’s (2002) transition-based model by using dynamic programming to recover optimal transition sequences, and Clarke and Lapata (2006a) used ILP to replace pairwise transitions with trigrams. Other recent work (Filippova and Strube, 2008; Galanis and Androutsopoulos, 2010) has used dependency trees directly as sentence representations for compression. Another line of research has attempted to broaden the notion of compression beyond mere word deletion (Cohn and Lapata, 2009; Ganitkevitch et al., 2011; Napoles et al., 2011a). Finally, progress on standalone compression tasks has also enabled document summarization techniques that jointly address sentence selection and compression (Daumé and Marcu, 2002; Clarke and Lapata, 2007; Martins and Smith, 2009; Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2011; Woodsend and Lapata, 2012), a number of which also rely on ILP-based inference.","Monolingual text-to-text generation research also faces many obstacles common to MT.
