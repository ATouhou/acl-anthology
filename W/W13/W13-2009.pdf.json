Two BioNLP ST 2013 participants successfully completed the PC task.

Pathway models formalizing biomolecules and their reactions in machine readable representations are a key way of sharing and communicating human understand-ing of these phenomena and of developing computational models of biological systems (Kitano, 2002). Many pathway models integrate knowledge from hundreds or thousands of scientific publications, and their curation requires substantial manual effort. To support this effort, we have developed PathText (Kemper et al., 2010) which provides a seamless environment integrating a pathway visualizer, text mining systems and annotation tools. Furthermore, automatic processing of the domain literature could thus potentially play pyruvate kinase catalyzes the conversion of PEP to pyruvate.GGP +Regulation Conversion Chem ChemicalThemeCause Theme Product Figure 1: Event representation for a conversion reaction. an important role in the support of pathway curation.","Information extraction targeting biomolecular reactions has been a major focus of efforts in biomedical natural language processing, with several tasks, resources, and tools addressing in particular protein-protein interactions (Krallinger et al., 2007; Pyysalo et al., 2008; Tikk et al., 2010). However, most such efforts have employed simple representations, such as entity pairs, that are not sufficient for capturing molecular reactions to the level of detail required to support the curation of pathway models. Additionally, previous efforts have not directly involved the semantics (e.g. reaction type definitions) of such models. Perhaps in part due to these reasons, natural language processing and information extraction methods have not been widely embraced by biomedical pathway curation communities (Ohta et al., 2011c; Ohta et al., 2011a).","We believe that the extraction of structured event representations (Figure 1) pursued in the BioNLP Shared Tasks offers many opportunities to make significant contributions to support the development, evaluation and maintenance of biomolecular pathways. The Pathway Curation (PC) task, a main task of the BioNLP Shared Task 2013, is proposed as a step toward realizing these opportunities. The PC task aims to evaluate the applicability of event extraction systems to pathway curation and to encourage the further development of methods for related tasks.

The primary aim is the extraction of event structures, or events, each of which can involve any number of physical entities or other events in specific roles.","The event representation is sufficiently expressive to allow the definition of event structures that closely parallel the definition of reactions in pathway representations such as SBML and BioPAX. These pathway representations differentiate between three primary groups of reaction participants: reactants (“inputs”), products (“outputs”), and modifiers, where the specific roles of modifiers can be further identified to differentiate e.g.","1","http://www.ebi.ac.uk/sbo/main/","2","http://www.pantherdb.org/pathway/","3","http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels-main/ reaction catalysts from inhibitors. Correspondingly, the PC task applies the Theme role defined in previous BioNLP ST tasks to capture reactants, introduces a new Product role for products, and applies the previously definedCause role and regulatory events to capture modifiers (Figure 2; see also Section 2.3).","It is important to note that while the event representation allows a one-to-one mapping to reactions in principle, an annotation scheme cannot guarantee that actual statements in text map to fully specified reactions: in free-form text, authors frequently omit mention of some entities taking part in reactions, perhaps most typically to avoid redundancies such as in “p38 γ is phosphorylated into phospho-p38γ” (Figure 2b). Representations extracted from explicit statements in text will thus in some cases omit aspects of the corresponding complete reactions in pathway models.","Systems addressing the PC task are expected to extract events of specific types given 1) free-form text and 2) gold standard annotation for mentions of physical entities in that text. The task annotations also include equivalence relations and event modifications, a secondary extraction target. The annotation types are detailed below. 2.1 Entities The entity annotation marks mentions of physical entities using start and end offsets in text (contiguous span) and a type selected from a fixed set. The following four entity types are marked in the PC task: SIMPLE CHEMICAL, annotated with reference to the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) resource (Degtyarenko et al., 2008); 68 Entity type Scope Reference Ontology ID SIMPLE CHEMICAL simple, non-repetitive chemical entities ChEBI SBO:0000247 GENE OR GENE PRODUCT genes, RNA and proteins gene/protein DBs SBO:0000246 COMPLEX entities of non-covalently linked components complex DBs SBO:0000253 CELLULAR COMPONENT parts of cell and extracellular environment GO-CC SBO:0000290 Table 1: Entity types, definitions, and reference resources.","Event type Core arguments Additional arguments Ontology ID","CONVERSION Theme:Molecule, Product:Molecule SBO:0000182 PHOSPHORYLATION Theme:Molecule, Cause:Molecule Site:SIMPLE CHEMICAL SBO:0000216 DEPHOSPHORYLATION Theme:Molecule, Cause:Molecule Site:SIMPLE CHEMICAL SBO:0000330","(Other modifications, such as ACETYLATION, defined similarly.)","LOCALIZATION Theme:Molecule At/From/ToLoc:CELL.

GENE OR GENE PRODUCT, annotated with reference to gene and protein databases such as UniProt (Consortium, 2011), Entrez Gene (Maglott et al., 2005) and PFam (Finn et al., 2010); COMPLEX, annotated with reference to database resources covering complexes; and CELLULAR COMPONENT, annotated following the scope of the Gene Ontology cellular component subontology (Ashburner et al., 2000) (Table 1). For discussion of the relation between these types and the representations applied in pathway models, we refer to Ohta et al. (2011c).","In terms of mention types in text, the annotation for SIMPLE CHEMICAL, GENE OR GENE PRODUCT and COMPLEX covers entity name mentions only, while the annotation for CELLULAR COMPONENT covers entity name mentions, nominal mentions, and adjectival references (e.g. “ mitochondrial”). 2.2 Relations The PC task defines one relation type, Equiv (equivalence), which can hold between entity mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK, also\\ known as ERK)Gene or gene product GGP GGPEquivEquiv Figure 3: Example Equiv annotation. mentions of the same type and specifies that they refer to the same real-world entity (Figure 3). These relations are only applied to determine if two events match during evaluation, where entities connected by an Equiv relation are considered in-terchangeable. Gold standard Equiv relations are applied also for test data, and systems participating in the task are not expected to extract these relations. 2.3 Events The event annotation marks references to reactions, processes and comparable associations in scope of the annotation using the event representation. For the definition and scope of the event annotation, we rely primarily on the Systems Biology Ontology (SBO), drawing some general types not in scope of this ontology from the Gene Ontology (GO).

We refer again to Ohta et al. (2011c) for detailed discussion of the relation between these types and other representations applied in pathway models.","The role in which each event argument (entity or other event) participates in an event is specified as one of the following: Theme entity/event that undergoes the effects of the event. For example, the entity that is transcribed in a TRANSCRIPTION event or transported in a TRANSPORT event. Cause entity/event that is causally active in the event. Marks, for example, “P 1” in “P 1 inhibits P2 expression”. AtLoc,FromLoc,ToLoc : location in which the Theme entity of a LOCALIZATION event is localized (At) in LOCALIZATION events not involving movement or is transported (or moves) from/to (From/To) in LOCALIZATION and TRANSPORT events involving movement. Site site on the Theme entity that is modified in the event. Can be specified for modification events such as PHOSPHORYLATION. Participant general role type identifying an entity that participates in some underspecified way in a high-level process. Only applied for the PATHWAY type. 2.4 Event modifications In addition to events, the PC task defines a secondary extraction target, event modifications. Two modification types are defined: NEGATION and SPECULATION. Both are binary flags that modify events, the former marking an event as being explicitly stated as not occurring (e.g. “P is not phosphorylated”) and the latter as being stated in a speculative context (“P may be phosphorylated.”). Both are defined in terms of annotation scope and semantics identically as in the BioNLP ST’09 (Kim et al., 2009). 2.5 Evaluation The PC task evaluation applies the standard evaluation criteria established in the BioNLP ST 2009. These criteria relax exact matching between gold and predicted events in two aspects: approximate trigger boundary matching, and approximate recursive event matching. The former allows predicted event triggers to differ from gold triggers by one word, and the latter requires recursively referred events to only match in their core arguments (see Table 2). We refer to Kim et al. (2011) for a detailed definition of these criteria."]},{"title":"3 Corpus","paragraphs":["This section presents the PC task corpus and its annotation process. 3.1 Document selection To assure that the documents annotated for the PC task corpus are relevant to pathway reactions, we applied two complementary approaches, both selecting documents on the basis of relevance to a specific pathway reaction. First, we selected from the BioModels repository those pathway models with the largest numbers of manually created annotations referencing a specific PubMed document identifier. For each of these models, we extracted literature references, selected a random subset, downloaded the documents, and manually filtered to select abstracts that explicitly discuss relevant molecular reactions. Second, as only a small sub-set of models include explicit references to the 70 literature providing evidence for specific pathway reactions, we applied an alternative strategy where reactions from a selection of PANTHER DB models were entered into the PathText system (Kemper et al., 2010),4","which is capable of suggest-ing documents relevant to given reactions based on an SBML model. We then selected a random set of reactions to query the system, and manually evaluated the highest-ranking documents to identify those whose abstracts explicitly discuss the selected reaction. We refer to Miwa et al. (2013a) for a detailed description of this approach. Table 3 presents the pathway models on which the document selection was based. 3.2 Annotation process The base entity annotation for the PC corpus was created automatically using state-of-the-art entity mention taggers for each of the targeted entity types. For SIMPLE CHEMICAL tagging, the OS-CAR4 system (Jessop et al., 2011) trained on the chemical named entity recognition corpus of Corbett and Copestake (2008) was applied. For GENE OR GENE PRODUCT mention detection, the NERsuite5","system trained on the BioCreative 2 Gene Mention task (Wilbur et al., 2007) corpus was used. NERsuite was also applied for CELLULAR COMPONENT mention detection, for this task trained on the Anatomical Entity Mention (AnEM) corpus (Ohta et al., 2012). Finally, COMPLEX annotations were created using a combination of a dictionary and heuristics making use of the GENE OR GENE PRODUCT annotation (for mentions such as “ cyclin E/CDK2 complex”). To support the curation process, these tools were in-tegrated into the NaCTeM text-analysis workflow system Argo (Rak et al., 2012).","Based on the evaluations of each of these tools in the studies presenting them, we expected initial automatic tagging performance to be in the range 80-90% in both precision and recall. Following initial automatic annotation, the entity mention annotation was manually revised to improve quality and consistency. As the entity annotation is not itself a target of extraction in the shared task, we did not separately evaluate the consistency of the revised entity mention annotation.","To assure that the quality and consistency of the event annotation are as high as possible, ini-4 http://nactem.ac.uk/pathtext/ 5 http://nersuite.nlplab.org/ Item Train Devel Test Total Documents 260 90 175 525 Words 53811 18579 35966 108356 Entities 7855 2734 5312 15901 Events 5992 2129 4004 12125 Modifications 317 80 174 571 Table 4: PC corpus statistics tial event annotation was created entirely manually, without automatic support. This annotation effort was carried out using the BRAT annotation tool (Stenetorp et al., 2012) by a group of biologists in collaboration between NaCTeM and KISTI. Following initial annotator training and refinement of guidelines based on the event type definitions provided by the reference ontologies, the primary event annotation was created by three biologists. To evaluate and maintain annotation consistency, a random 20% of documents were annotated redundantly by all annotators, and these overlapping annotations were periodically evaluated and differences in annotation were discussed between the annotators and annotation coordinators. Following initial annotation, a round of semi-automatic consistency checks were applied using BRAT. Evaluation of the redundantly annotated documents using the primary task evaluation criteria gave an inter-annotator agreement of 61.0% in F-score. For the final corpus, the redundantly annotated documents were evaluated separately by an annotation coordinator to select the best of each set.6","The overall statistics of the corpus are summarized in Table 4. We note that the among the previous BioNLP ST corpora, only the GENIA (GE) task corpus has a larger number of annotated events than the PC corpus."]},{"title":"4 Results 4.1 Participation","paragraphs":["Two groups submitted final results to the PC task, one from the National Centre for Text Min-ing (NaCTeM) and one from the University of Turku BioNLP group (TEES-2.1) (Table 5).

The two systems share the same overall architecture, a one-best pipeline with SVM-based stages for event trigger detection, trigger-argument relation detection, argument grouping into event structures, and modification prediction. The feature representations of both systems draw on substructures of dependency-like representations of sentence syntax, derived from full parses of input sentences. TEES applies the Charniak and Johnson (2005) parser with the McClosky (2009) biomedical model, converting the phrase-structure parses into dependencies using the Stanford tools (de Marneffe et al., 2006). By contrast, EventMine uses a combination of the predicate-argument structure analyses created by the deep parser Enju (Miyao and Tsujii, 2008) and the out-put of the the GDep best-first shift-reduce dependency parser (Sagae and Tsujii, 2007). All three parsers have models trained in part on the biomedical domain GENIA treebank (Tateisi et al., 2005).","Interestingly, both systems make use of the GE task data, but the application of EventMine extends on this considerably by applying a stacked model (Miwa et al., 2013b) with predictions also from models trained on the BioNLP ST 2011 EPI and ID tasks (Pyysalo et al., 2012) as well as from four corpora introduced outside of the shared tasks by Thompson et al. (2011), Pyysalo et al. (2011), Ohta et al. (2011b) and Ohta et al. (2011c). 4.2 Evaluation results Table 6 summarizes the primary evaluation results. The two systems demonstrate broadly similar performance in terms of F-scores, with NaCTeM achieving an 1.7% point higher overall result. 8 http://jbjorne.github.io/TEES/ However, the systems show quite different performance in terms of the precision/recall balance: while the NaCTeM system has little difference between precision and recall, TEES-2.1 shows a clear preference for precision, with 8.6% lower recall than precision.","Results are shown separately for each event type in Table 7. The results largely mirror the overall performance, with the NaCTeM system show-ing better performance for 13 out of the 21 event types present in the test data and more balanced precision and recall than TEES-2.1, which emphasizes precision over recall for almost all event types. Although the results do not include evaluation of EventMine with a reduced set of stacked models in training, the modest difference in performance suggests that comprehensive use of previously released event resources in EventMine did not confer a decisive advantage, perhaps in part due to differences in the event definitions between the PC task and previous resources.","Overall, the two systems appear quite similar not only in architecture but also performance, with the clearest systematic difference observed being the different emphases on precision vs. recall. As both systems are based on machine learning methods with real-valued outputs, it would be relatively straightforward to use prediction confidences to analyse performance over the entire precision-recall curve instead of a single fixed point. Such analysis could provide further insight into the relative strengths and weaknesses of these two systems."]},{"title":"5 Discussion","paragraphs":["Although participation in this initial run of the PC task was somewhat limited, the two participating systems have been applied to a large variety of event extraction tasks over the last years and have shown consistently competitive performance with the state of the art (Björne and Salakoski, 2011; Miwa et al., 2012).
