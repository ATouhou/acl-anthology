Our system interacts with users by recognizing what the users say, predicting the context, and following the users‟ feelings. For this interaction, our system follows three basic counseling techniques: paraphrasing, asking open questions, and reflecting feelings. To follow counseling techniques, we extracted 5W1H information and user emotions from user utterances, and we generated system utterances while using the counseling techniques. We used the conditional random field algorithm to extract 5W1H information, and constructed our counseling algorithm using a dialog strategy that was based on counseling techniques. A total of 16 adults tested our system and rated it with a higher score as an in-teractive communicator compared with the baseline system."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Over the past 45 years, suicide rates have in-creased by 60% worldwide.","1","To prevent suicide, suicide people need to counsel with counselors. However, counseling with a human counselor requires a substantial cost, and in addition, there is a location restriction. Developing a counseling dialog system could be an effective solution to address this problem because the system has no limitations with respect to time and location.","In this study, we present a counseling dialog system. The system interacts with users by recognizing what the users say, predicting the context, and following the users‟ feelings. We used three counseling techniques for our system, to interact with the users. The system performs paraphrasing, asks open questions, and reflects feelings.  1  http://www.who.int/mental_health/prevention/suicide/suicid eprevent/en/","Paraphrasing is a technique that paraphrases user utterances. For example, when a user utterance is “My dog picked up the ball”, then it could be paraphrased by “Oh, your dog picked up the ball”. The technique of asking open questions is to ask some questions to the user, to obtain more information. For example, when a user says “I played computer games”, then the counselor could say “When did you play?” or “Where did you play?”. Finally, reflecting a feeling is a similar technique to paraphrasing, but it includes emotional comments. For example, when a user says “My dog died. I‟m so sad”, then the counselor could say, “Oh, your dog died. You look depressed.” or “You look so sad”.","In our approach, we extract 5W1H (who, what, when, where, why, how) information and four basic emotions (happy, afraid, sad, and angry) from user utterances. We generate system utterances using 5W1H information and basic emotions."]},{"title":"2 Counseling Techniques","paragraphs":["Counselors show empathy with clients by listening and understanding them. Clients feel comfortable by a counselor‟s attention. Counselors listen, ask questions, answer questions, and concentrate on clients. Attention and empathy is important for counseling. Counselors show interest and care about the clients‟ emotions. Our counseling dialog system also focused on attending and empathy.","Many counseling techniques are used in counseling. Basic attending, self-expression, and micro-training skills are introduced in Theron et al. (2008). Basic attending and self-expression skills are about non-verbal behavior, such as tone of voice and eye contact. Micro-training skills are the basic verbal counseling techniques that are learned for counseling beginners: open and closed questions, minimal encouragement, paraphrasing, reflection of feelings and summarization. 349","We chose three micro-training skills to attend and show empathy with clients. These skills are open questions, paraphrasing, and reflection of feelings because they are basic techniques to show emphasize effectively."]},{"title":"3 Related Work","paragraphs":["The SEMAINE project aims to build a Sensitive Artificial Listeners (SAL) – conversational agents that are designed to interact with a human user through robust recognition and the generation of non-verbal behavior (Schröder et al., 2008). This system detects user emotions by multimodal sensors (camera, microphone). A virtual face in this system shows facial expressions based on user emotions, and it encourages the user to speak by reacting and asking questions. These techniques could show empathy with users. However, it has limited verbal skills because SEMAINE does not have language understanding module. In our research, our system follows user utterances and generates system utterances based on user‟s 5W1H."]},{"title":"4 Data Collection","paragraphs":["We generated 4,284 utterances by using fifty-three 5W1H information sets and four basic emotions (Figure 1).

When a user inputs a sentence, a natural language understanding (NLU) module understands the main action (the user‟s intention) and extracts the 5W1H entities from the user‟s utterance. The emotion detection module detects the user‟s emotions using the emotional keyword dictionary. The dialog management module decides the system‟s action from the main action and the 5W1H information from the trained module from the example dialog corpus. The natural language generation (NLG) module generates the system utterance using a system utterance template. We can generate the system utterance by replacing 5W1H slots with entities.  User Natural Language Understanding Dialog Manager Natural Language Generation Dialog Template Emotion Detector Output Emotional Keyword  Figure 2. Counseling Dialog System Hierarchy 350 5.2 Natural Language Understanding In our approach, the NLU module understands the user utterance by classifying the main action and the 5W1H entities from the user utterance. To classify user intention, we used maximum entropy model (Ratnaparkhi, 1998) trained on a linguistically motivated features. We used a lexical word features for the utterance model. The lexical word features are lexical trigrams using previous, current, and next lexical words. To extract 5W1H entities, we used a conditional random field (CRF) model (Laffery et al., 2001). We also used lexical word features (lexical trigrams) to train model.","5.3 Dialog Management with Counseling Strategy When we extract 5W1H information or user emotions, the dialog management module keeps them in the emotion slot or in the six 5W1H slots. This slot information is discussed in a dialog.","The dialog management module decides the system‟s action by the main action, the 5W1H entities, and the user‟s emotions. Dialog management follows the rules in figure 3, which is our dialog strategy for the counseling system. In figure 3, „Counseling group?‟ node finds users intentions included in „others group‟ (rejection or thanks could be included). The „User Emotion Detection‟ node figures out whether the user utterance is to include emotional keywords or whether the user emotion is already known by the discourse. The „6 slot empty‟ node checks whether the user utterance includes at least one of the 5W1H elements or whether the 5W1H entity is already known. The „6 slot full‟ node decides whether the user utterance with a discourse has all six 5W1H entries. From this strategy, we can notice that we cannot reflect a user‟s feeling without the user‟s emotion. We cannot ask open questions when all of the 5W1H slots are filled.  Yes No No No No No Yes No Yes YesYes","Yes 6 slot empty 6 slot full 6 slot empty 6 slot full Counseling group?

Dialog Strategy Architecture 5.4 Emotion Detection The emotion detection module decides the user‟s emotion with respect to the four basic emotions. To detect the user‟s emotions, we find emotional keywords in the user‟s utterances. If any emotional keyword appears in a user utterance, we decide that the user‟s emotion which includes that keyword. For this approach, we made a dictionary of emotional keywords for each basic emotion. The dictionary has approximately 15 emotional keywords for each basic emotion (Table 3)."," Emotion Keywords Happy happy, joy, glad, pleasure, ... Sad sad, depress, grief, sorrow, ... Angry anger, rage, indignation, wrath, ... Afraid afraid, fear, terror, dread, ...  Table 3. Emotional Keywords for Emotions 5.5 Natural Language Generation The NLG module generates the system‟s utterances by selecting an utterance template from the template database. There are various system templates for each system action, for the 5W1H slot entities, and for the user‟s emotions (Figure 4). When the system template is chosen, we can generate system utterances by replacing the 5W1H slot with a 5W1H discourse. „O‟ means we should have the entity, „X‟ means we do not have the entity, and „*‟ means we do not care whether we have the entity or not.

Counseling Dialog Example"]},{"title":"6 Experiment","paragraphs":["We measured how systems show empathy with users. Our baseline system is a Korean chat-oriented dialog system (Kim et al., 2012). The chat-oriented dialog system shows empathy by understanding user utterances and making a conversation. In our experiment, 7 basic situations are given for each person. Situations are explained by 5W1H, and users generated various utterances using that information. Each person generated approximately 100 utterances during 30 minutes and made estimates for each system. We recruited 16 volunteers to use our system and to estimate its effectiveness. Each user checked 17 questions from 1 to 10. The questions ask users how does each system understand the user utterance, is it appropriate for counseling, and does it satisfy the users (Table 5).","","Question Chat-Oriented Counseling 1-1.

However, our system scored over 6.5 overall. It means our system is valuable as a counselor."]},{"title":"7 Conclusion","paragraphs":["In this study, we introduced counseling techniques that we used to implement counseling dialog system. The experimental results showed that our system shows empathy with users. Although the results of this study bring us a step closer to implementing counseling dialog system, the results are only valid with 5W1H information in Korean. Our future works are to improve our counseling dialog system using new NLU module which extracts 5W1H information from more general utterances, with new emotion detection method, and with more counseling techniques.
