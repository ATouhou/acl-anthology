As a first step, we produce a system for locating instances of metaphor in English and Spanish text. In contrast to previous work which relies on resources like syntactic parsing and WordNet, our system is based on LDA topic modeling, enabling its application even to low-resource languages, and requires no labeled data. We achieve an F-score of 59% for English."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Patterns in the use of metaphors can provide a great deal of insight into a culture. Cultural differences expressed linguistically as metaphor can play a role in matters as complex and important as diplomatic relations. For instance, Thornborrow (1993) discusses the different metaphors that are used in the context of security in French and British coverage of two major post-cold-war summit meetings. Example metaphors such as “the cornerstone of the new security structure,” “structures for defence and security cooperation,” and “the emerg-ing shape of Europe,” exemplify the English use of the source concept structure in describing the target concept of security. In contrast, the metaphors “des règles de sécurité nouvelles (new rules of security)”, “une révision fondamentale des dispositions de sécurité (a fundamental revision of security provisions)”, and “un système de sécurité européen (a system of European security)” exemplify the French use of the more abstract source concept system to describe the same target concept. As Thornborrow notes, the implied British conception of security as “concrete, fixed, and immobile” contrasts deeply with the French conception of security as “a system as a series of processes.”","Our ultimate goal is to use metaphor to further our knowledge of how different cultures understand complex topics. Our immediate goal in this paper is to create an automated system to find instances of metaphor in English and Spanish text.","Most existing work on metaphor identification (Fass, 1991; Martin, 1994; Peters and Peters, 2000; Mason, 2004; Birke and Sarkar, 2006; Gegigan et al., 2006; Krishnakumaran and Zhu, 2007; Shutova et al., 2010; Shutova et al., 2012)1","has relied on some or all of handwritten rules, syntactic parsing, and semantic databases like WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) and FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998). This limits the approaches to languages with rich linguistic resources. As our ultimate goal is broad, cross-linguistic application of our system, we can-not rely on resources which would be unavailable in resource-poor languages. Instead, we apply LDA topic modeling (Blei et al., 2003b) which requires only an adequate amount of raw text in the target language. This work is similar to Bethard et al. (2009), in which an SVM model is trained with LDA-based features to recognize metaphorical text. There the work is framed as a classification task, and supervised methods are used to label metaphorical and literal text. Here, the task is one of recognition, and we use heuristic-based, unsu-  1 See Shutova (2010) for a survey of existing approaches 58 pervised methods to identify the presence of metaphor in unlabeled text. We hope to eliminate the need for labeled data which, as discussed in Bethard et al. (2009) and elsewhere, is very difficult to produce for metaphor recognition."]},{"title":"2 Terminology","paragraphs":["We will refer to a particular instance of metaphorical language in text as a linguistic metaphor. Each such metaphor talks about a target concept in terms of a source concept. For example, in “Dems, like rats, will attack when cornered” the source concept is animals and the target concept is politicians2",", or at a higher level, governance. The abstract mapping between a source concept and a target concept will be referred to as a conceptual metaphor which is grounded by a collection of linguistic metaphors.","In this work, we restrict our attention to a single target concept, governance. Our definition of governance is broad, including views of the governed and those who govern, institutions of government, laws, and political discourse. We used a large collection (see Table 1) of potential source concepts. Beginning with the source concepts of primary metaphors, which are hypothesized to be universal (Grady, 1998), we expanded our set to include source concepts commonly found in the scientific literature about metaphor, as well as those found by human annotators manually collecting instances of governance-related metaphors.

The core idea of our system is to use LDA topics as proxies for semantic concepts which may serve as the source or target for a metaphor. For a given language, we build an LDA model from Wikipedia and then align its topics to potential source and target concepts, which are defined by small human-created lists of seed words.","At runtime, the system first does LDA inference on our input corpus to get topic probabilities for each document and sentence. The system then selects those sentences linked by LDA to both a source-aligned topic and a target-aligned topic.3"," For example, a sentence containing “...virtud so-  3 This is a distant, automatic relative of the ‘directed-search’ technique of Martin (1994). 59 cial para construir la democracia...”4","will be selected because LDA strongly associates it with both the topic [elecciones, ministro, sucesor, ...]5",", aligned to the target concept governance, and the topic [edificio, arquitectura, torre,...] 6",", aligned to the source concept physical structure.","Next, the system identifies the words in each selected sentence that are strongly associated with each concept. In the sentence above, it marks virtud and democracia as target-associated and construir as source-associated.","Next it applies two filters. First, we exclude any sentence with too few words that are not LDA stopwords, because the model's predictions may be very inaccurate in these cases. Second, if the topic associated with the source model for a sentence is also a top-ranked topic for the document as a whole, the sentence is excluded. The reason for this is that if the source concept is present throughout the document, it is probably being used literally (see Figure 2).","Finally, it uses previously-computed information to determine a final score. All linguistic metaphors scoring above a certain threshold are returned. By varying this threshold, the user can vary the precision-recall tradeoff as needed. A diagram of the system can be found in Figure 1."," Figure 2: Even though the last sentence is relevant to the source concept pathways and the target concept governance, it will be correctly rejected because pathways-aligned topics are present throughout the document."]},{"title":"4 Implementation Details: Training","paragraphs":["Our runtime system requires as input an LDA model, a list of seed words for each concept, and an alignment between concepts and LDA topics. 4.1 LDA Topic Model The topics defined by LDA topic modeling serve as stand-ins for the more abstractly-defined source and target concepts underlying the metaphors. The input to training our LDA model is the full text of  4 social virtue to build democracy 5 elections, minister, successor 6 building, architecture, tower Wikipedia articles in the target language. Wikipedia is available in numerous languages and serves as a corpus of general knowledge, providing us with topics corresponding to a broad range of concepts. Our LDA model is trained using MALLET (McCallum, 2002) for 1000 iterations with 100 topics, optimizing hyperparameters every 10 iterations after a 100 iteration burn-in period. The 500 most common tokens in the training corpus were used as stopwords. The result of LDA is 100 topics, where each topic is a probability distribution over the training corpus vocabulary. Representative words for example English topics are shown in Figure 3.  Figure 3: Sample LDA topics with representative terms 4.2 Concept Seed Word Lists For each concept , we have a label and a small set of seed words representing that concept, referred to as . These lists were created by hand in English and then translated into Spanish by native speakers. The translation was not intended to be exact; we instructed the annotators to create the lists in a way that was appropriate for their language and culture. For instance, the football topic for English describes American football, but in Spanish, the same topic describes soccer. 4.3 Concept-Topic Alignment The final input to our system is an alignment between concepts and topics, with every topic being mapped to at most one concept. In addition to the seed lists and LDA model, this alignment process takes a score threshold and a maximum number of alignments per source and target concept and .","The alignment algorithm is as follows. We align each topic to the concept with the maximum score , which measures the concept terms’ summed probability in the LDA topic: . We remove all alignments where . Finally, for each concept, only the highest scoring alignments are kept, where may be different for source and Our county has many roads in bad shape. Thousands of our bridges are structurally deficient.

Our only trump concept in this study is war. If an LDA topic is aligned with both the war concept and the governance concept, it is removed from alignment with the governance concept. We do this because war is so tightly associated with governments that the alignment algorithm invariably aligns it to the governance topic. However, war is also a very important source concept for governance metaphors; our choice is to suffer on recall by missing some governance-relevant sentences, but increase recall on metaphors for which the source concept is war. Sample topic-concept alignments are shown inTable 2. By inspecting the resulting alignments by hand, we chose the following parameter values for both languages: =0.01, =3, =5.","The process of defining concepts is simple and fast and the alignment method is inexpensive. Therefore, while we have not captured all possible source concepts in our initial list, expanding this list is not difficult. We can define new source concepts iteratively as we analyze metaphors that our extraction system misses, and we can add target concepts as our interests broaden."]},{"title":"5 Implementation Details: Runtime","paragraphs":["The system receives as input a corpus of documents, their LDA decodings, the LDA decodings of each sentence treated as a separate document, and the topic-concept alignments. Each four-tuple is processed independently, where is the language, is the source concept, is the target concept, and is the sentence."," Determining Concept Relevance: Recall our basic intuition that a sentence relevant both to an LDA topic in (termed source-relevant) and one in (termed target-relevant) is potentially metaphorical. The system judges a sentence to be -relevant if the probability of -aligned topics in that sentence is above a threshold: , where is an adjustable parameter tuned by hand. is 0.06 in English and 0.05 in Spanish. is 0.1 in both languages. On the source side, the system removes all topics in from and renormalizes before determining relevance in order to avoid penalizing sentences for having very strong evidence of relevance to governance in addition to providing evidence of relevance to a source concept. For reference below, let (a measure of how strongly the sentence is associated with its topics) and let (the most proba-ble -aligned topic in the sentence).","If is not both source- and target-relevant, the system stops and the sentence is not selected."," Finding Concept-Associated Words: The system next creates sets of the words in associated with the concept . Let . Then let","{ , where is a hand tuned parameter set to 0.1 for both languages.

For reference below, let (the most strongly concept-associated words in the sentence) 61 and (the combined strength of those associations).","If lacks words strongly associated with the source and target concepts (that is, or is empty), the system stops and the sentence is not selected.","Filters: The system applies two filters. First, must have at least four words which are not LDA stopwords; otherwise, the LDA predictions which drive the system's concept-relevance judgements tend to be unreliable. Second, the most likely source topic must not be one of the top 10 topics for the document as a whole, for reasons described above. If either of these requirements fail, the system stops and the sentence is not selected.","Final Scoring: Finally, the system determines if ( ( ) ( ) ) where is a hand-tuned threshold set to -10.0 for English and -13.0 for Spanish. This takes into account the strength of association between topics and the sentence, between the annotated words and the topics, and between the topics and their aligned concepts. Any sentence passing this threshold is selected as a linguistic metaphor."]},{"title":"6 Example Output","paragraphs":["We provide examples of both true and false positives extracted by our system.

In each, some words related to the target concept governance are described using terms related to the source concept animals. Example 1 best represents the desired output of our system, such that it contains a governance- and animals-relevant metaphor and the terms associated with the metaphor are properly annotated. Some issues do arise in these true positive examples. Example 2, while often termed a simile, is counted as a metaphor for our purposes. In example 3, the source term is correctly annotated, but the target terms should be political ambitions rather than Obama. It is unclear why the term snakehead but not the term fish in example 4 is associated with the source concept.","Examples 5 through 8 represent system errors. In example 5, the fact that the word whopper occurs frequently to describe a large animal (especially a fish) causes the sentence to be mistakenly identified as relevant to the source concept animal. The source term animal in example 6 is clearly relevant to the source concept, but it is being used literally. The document-level source concept filtering does not entirely eliminate this error class. While example 7 contains a metaphor and has some relationship to American politics, it would be counted as an error in our evaluations because the metaphor itself is not related to governance. In example 8, we have two errors. First, tea is strongly present in the topic aligned to the animal concept, causing the sentence to be incorrectly marked as source-relevant. Second, because our topic model operates at the level of individual words, it was unable to recognize that tea here is part of the fixed, governance-related phrase tea party. 7",""]},{"title":"7 Evaluation 7.1 Collecting Evaluation Data","paragraphs":["We collected a domain-specific corpus in each language. We curated a set of news websites and governance-relevant blogs in English and Spanish and then collected data from these websites over the course of several months. For each language, we ran our system over this corpus (all steps in  7 an American political movement 62 Section 5), produced a set of linguistic metaphors for each topic-aligned source concept (the target concept was always governance), and ranked them by the final score (Section 4.4). Below, we will refer to the set of all linguistic metaphors sharing the same source and target concept as a conceptual metaphor. 7.2 Simple Evaluation For this evaluation, we selected the top five examples for each conceptual metaphor. If the same sentence was selected by multiple conceptual metaphors, it was kept for only the highest scoring one. We then added enough of the highest-ranked unselected metaphors to create a full set of 300. We then added random sentences from the corpus that were not selected as metaphorical by the system to bring the total to 600. Our Spanish annotators were unavailable at the time this evaluation took place, so we are only able to report results for English in this case.","For each of these instances, two annotators were asked the question, “Is there a metaphor about governance in this example?” These annotators had previous experience in identifying metaphors for this study, both by searching manually in online texts and evaluating previous versions of our system. Over time we have given them feedback on what does and does not constitute a metaphor. In this case, the annotators were given neither the system's concept-word association annotations nor the source concept associated with the instance. In one way, the evaluation was generous, because any metaphor in the extracted sentence would benefit precision even if it was not the metaphor found by our system. On the other hand, the same is true for the random sentences; while the system will only extract metaphors with source concepts in our list, the annotators had no such restriction. This causes the recall score to suffer. The annotation task was difficult, with a -score of 0.48. The resulting scores are given in Table 3. The examples given in Section 5 illustrate the error classes found among the false positives identified by the human annotators. There are many cases where the source-concept associated terms are used literally rather than metaphorically, and many cases where the system-found metaphor is not about governance. Some text processing issues, such as a bug in our sentence breaking script, as well as the noisy nature of blog and blog comment input, caused some of the examples to be difficult to in-terpret or evaluate."," Annotator Precision ‘Recall’ F Kappa","1","2 65 43 67 60 66 50 0.48","Mean 54 64 59 Table 3: Simple English Evaluation 7.3 Stricter Evaluation Common Experimental Setup We did a second evaluation of both English and Spanish using a different paradigm. For each language, we selected the 250 highest-ranked linguistic metaphor instances in the corpus. Subjects on Amazon Mechanical Turk were shown instances with the system-predicted concept-associated words highlighted and asked if the highlighted words were being used metaphorically (options were yes and no). Each subject was randomly asked about roughly a quarter of the data.","","We paid the subjects $10 per hour. We added catch trial sentences which asked the subject to simply answer yes or no as a way of excluding those not actually reading the sentences. Subjects answering these questions incorrectly were excluded (17 in English, 25 in Spanish).","We defined the metaphoricity of an instance to be the fraction of subjects who answered yes for that instance. We define the metaphoricity of a conceptual metaphor as the average metaphoricity of its groundings among the instances in this evaluation set.","  63 English Results","We restricted our subjects to those claiming to be native English speakers who had IP addresses within the U.S. and had 115 participants. The examples were grouped into 66 conceptual metaphors. The mean metaphoricity of instances was 0.41 (standard deviation=0.33). The mean metaphoricity of the conceptual metaphors (Figure 4), was 0.39 (SD=0.26). Although there was wide variance in metaphoricity across conceptual metaphors, it appears likely that most of the conceptual metaphors discovered by the system are correct: 65% of the conceptual metaphors had metaphoricity greater than 0.25, and 73% greater than 0.2. Given that many metaphors are conventional and difficult to detect in natural language (Lakoff and Johnson, 1980), it is possible that even in cases in which only a minority of subjects detected a metaphor, a metaphor nonetheless exists Spanish Results We restricted our subjects to those claiming to be native speakers of Mexican Spanish with IP addresses in the US (57) or Mexico (29). The instances were grouped into 52 conceptual metaphors. The mean metaphoricity of instances was 0.33 (SD=0.23) and for conceptual metaphors (Figure 4), 0.31 (SD=0.16). 60% of conceptual metaphors had metaphoricity greater than 0.25, and 73% greater than 0.2. That performance was only slightly lower than English is a positive indication of our method’s cross-linguistic potential."]},{"title":"8 Discussion and Future Work","paragraphs":["We observed a number of problems with our approach which provide avenues for future research.","8.1 Topics as Proxies of Primary Metaphor Concepts Many of the metaphors missed by our system were instances of primary metaphor, especially those involving movement and spatial position. Our LDA approach is poorly suited to these because the source concepts are not well-characterized by word co-occurrence: words describing movement and spatial position do not have a strong tendency to co-occur with other such words, at least in Wikipedia. Augmenting our system with a separate     Figure 4: Metaphoricity of Conceptual Metaphors for English (top) and Spanish (bottom) 64 approach to primary metaphor would boost its performance significantly.","8.2 Topics as Proxies of Non-Primary Metaphor Concepts We found that most of our potential source concepts did not correspond to any LDA topic. However, many of these, such as wild west, have fairly strong word co-occurrence patterns, so they plausibly could be found by a different topic modeling algorithm. There are two promising approaches here which could potentially be combined. The first is to use a hierarchical LDA algorithm (Blei et al, 2003b) to allow concepts to align to topics with varying degrees of granularity, from the very general (e.g. war) to the very specific (e.g. wild west). The second is to use constrained LDA approaches (Andrzejewski and Zhu, 2009; Hu et al., 2010) to attempt to force at least one topic to correspond to each of our seed concept lists.","A different approach would leave behind seed lists entirely. In our current approach, only about one third of the topics modeled by LDA are successfully aligned with a source concept from our hand-made list. However, some non-aligned LDA topics have properties similar to those that were chosen to represent source concepts. For instance, the topic whose highest ranked terms are [institute, professor, engineering, degree] is comprised of a set of semantically coherent and concrete terms, and could be assigned a reasonably accurate label such as higher education. If we were to choose LDA topics based on the terms’ coherence and concreteness (and perhaps other relevant, measura-ble properties), then assign a label using a method such as that in Mei et al. (2007), we would be able to leverage more of the concepts in the LDA model. This would increase the recall of our system, and also reduce some of the confusion associated with incorrect labeling of concepts in linguistic and conceptual metaphors. Applying Labeled LDA, as in Ramage et al. (2009), would be a similar approach.","8.3 Confusion of Literal and Metaphorical Usage of Source Concepts Another major problem was the confusion between literal and metaphorical usage of source terms. This is partly addressed by our document topics filter, but more sophisticated use of document context for this purpose would be helpful. A similar filter based on contexts across the test corpus might be useful. 8.4 Fixed Expressions Some of our errors were due to frequent fixed phrases which included a word strongly associated with a source topic, like Tea Party. Minimum de-scription length (MDL) phrase-finding or similar techniques could be used to filter these out. Initial experiments performed after the evaluations discussed above show promise in this regard. Using the MDL algorithm (Rissanen, 1978), we developed a list of likely multi-word expressions in the Wikipedia corpus. We then concatenated these phrases in the Wikipedia corpus before LDA modeling and in the test corpus before metaphor prediction. Though we did not have time to formally evaluate the results, a subjective analysis showed fewer of these fixed phrases appearing as indica-tors of metaphor (as words in or ). 8.5 Difficulty of Annotation A different method of presentation of metaphors to the subjects, for instance with annotations marking where in the sentence we believed metaphor to exist or with a suggestion of the source concept, may have improved agreement and perhaps the system’s evaluation score. 8.6 Summary We have presented a technique for linguistic and conceptual metaphor discovery that is crosslinguistically applicable and requires minimal linguistic resources. Our approach of looking for overlapping semantic concepts allows us to find metaphors of any syntactic structure. The frame-work of our metaphor discovery technique is flexi-ble in its ability to incorporate a wide variety of source and target concepts. The only linguistic resources the system requires are a corpus of general-knowledge text adequate for topic modeling and a small set of seed word lists. We could improve our system by applying new research in automatic topic modeling, by creating new filters and scoring mechanisms to discriminate between literal and figurative word usages, and by creating training data to allow us to automatically set certain system parameters.  65"]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["Supported by the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) via Department of Defense US Army Research Laboratory contract number W911NF-12-C0-0023.
