The decision to","paragraphs":["annotate generic noun phrases produces a significant decrease of inter-annotator agreement. On the other hand, neglect-ing coreference relations between generic expressions causes a significant loss of information on the text coherence that is primordially the reason for annotating coreference relations at all. It also causes the inconsistency of annotation guidelines: due to relatively vague definition of genericity, it is almost impossible to exclude all coreference relations between generics from the annotation.","In the Prague Dependency Treebank (henceforth PDT), we tried to distinguish coreference relations between nominal expressions with specific and generic reading. Comparing the inter-annotator agreement for these groups shows that the agreement for noun coreference with specific reading is significantly higher than the agreement for the coreference of generic NPs (F1-measure 0.705 for specific NPs and 0.492 for generics","1","). Moreover, the manual analysis of the cases of disagreement of specific NPs coreference demonstrates that most cases of disagreement are those where NPs in question may be interpreted generically.","Having formulated a set of criteria which help identifying generic expressions, there still remains a wide range of typical examples which can have generic interpretation, though not necessarily. In this paper, we try to delimit the set of generic NPs presenting the overview of some existing theories of genericity (Sections 2 and 3.1) and compare them to the stand-of-the-art coreference annotation guidelines (Section 3.2). Then we present our approach to annotating coreference with generic noun phrases in PDT where we apply the presented theories to coreference and bridging relations annotation (Section 4). We analyze typical problematic issues (Section 5) and discuss some possible solutions (Section 6)."]},{"title":"2 What are generics and can they co-refer?","paragraphs":["Generic reference is a term commonly used in linguistic semantics to describe noun-phrase reference to kinds of things ("]},{"title":"Carlson","paragraphs":["2005)."]},{"title":"In different languages, generic reference may be expressed by noun phrases with definite and indefinite articles and with determinerless expressions quite generally. In languages without articles, the determinerless form is typically used (Carlson 2005, Hlavsa 1975; Padučeva 1985, etc.). ","paragraphs":["1 F1-measure for generics is closer to inter-annotator agreement for bridging relations (0.460 for all annotated data). 103","Compare some typical examples for generic noun reference (different uses of a/the dog(s)) in English, German and Czech:","English: Dogs bark – The dog has evolved from the Jackal – A dog knows when it is time for his walk2",".","German: Hunde beißen. Der Hund stammt vom Schakal ab. Ein Hund weiß// Hunde wissen, wenn es Zeit für seinen Spaziergang ist.","Czech (non-article language): Psi štěkají. – Pes je šelma.","The examples above demonstrate that generic noun phrases cannot be recognized by their forms (this fact was pointed out in Lyons 1999, Carlson 2005, etc.). While in English the plural form of the definite can only marginally have generic reference, in German, which is closely related to English, the plural definite may imply generic reference quite easily. In Romance languages, the form of bare plural with generics is prohibited (Delfitto 2006) and even in languages without articles, generics with determiners are not so rare (see e.g. common examples with Czech in Nedoluzhko 2003) 3",". This leads to a suggestion that genericity is not a primitive category of semantic or syntactic description.","Theoretical studies like Carlson (1980) appeal to typical examples with noun phrases referring to specific objects. A discussion on his approach (Paducheva 1985, Delfitto 2006, Lyons 1999) concerns theoretical issues that are analyzed in similar typical cases.","When analyzing real corpus examples we encounter a lot of cases indicating that not all generic expressions are generic in the same way. Problems with processing generic expressions arise also from the lack of a universally accepted theory of genericity which would be applicable to the real texts analysis.","Generic reading is possible not only with referring nouns, but also with mass nouns, group nouns, abstract nouns, quantifiers and deverbatives. Look at the example (1). Everyone should probably agree that the homeless is a generic expression, but is the same true about the homeless population?  2 However, Carlson – Pelletier (1995) do not consider a dog in the last sentence to be generic, because it cannot be combined with kind-level predicates. 3 It may be possible to determine generics in sentences with so-called “kind-level predicates” (Carlson 2005), they interact with aspectual distinctions in verbs (Lyons 1999) etc, but these approaches are not applicable to real-text data. (1) Your comments implied we had discovered that the principal cause of homeless-ness is to be found in the large numbers of mentally ill and substance-abusing people in the homeless population. [...] The study shows that nearly 40% of the homeless population is made up of women and children and that only 25% of the homeless exhibits some combination of drug, alcohol and mental problems4","."]},{"title":"Another relevant question is if generic expressions referring to the same kind can be considered coreferent in the same sense as noun phrases with a specific reading. According to","paragraphs":["Carlson’s (1980) and Lyons‘ (1999) claim, generics refer to classes in the similar way as proper names refer to unique entities. In this sense, coreference of generic expressions appears to be obvious. On the other hand, Carlson’s observations seem to be quite language-specific. Arguing against a quantificational analysis of bare plurals with generic meaning, he claims that the sentence Miles wants to meet policemen cannot be assigned a reading according to which “there are certain policemen that Miles wants to meet,” whereas this interpretation is naturally available in the case of Miles wants to meet some policemen. This is not the case of languages without articles where plural forms can be assigned any reading regardless of the use of the quantifier5",". Generally, we suppose that quantificational (or predicative) interpretation of generic expressions in different languages is not impossible (see for example almost obligatory predicative reading of Czech exporters in (7)). However, this fact does not necessarily exclude the coreference relation between them. Eventually, the discourse deixis as reference to events is also often considered and annotated as coreference."]},{"title":"3 Recent research on generics","paragraphs":["We believe that it would not be a strong exaggeration to claim that theoretical and computational linguistics have different goals as concerns their approach to genericity. The challenge of linguistic research is to find out more about the essence of genericity. The aim of annotating is to  4 The example comes from the Prague English Dependency Treebank (PEDT, Hajič et al. 2009) 5 Actually, even in English not all bare plurals should necessarily refer to kinds. In modern journalistic texts, the tendency to omit articles appears to be quite strong. 104 make the group of generics as clear as possible, in order to reach higher agreement and better results of automatic processing.","It is also generally known that the features of an annotation must be adapted to the task it is designed for. However, the existing large-scale annotated corpora (especially those prepared on university basis) are often meant to be multipurpose. They serve both as train data for (different!) automatic tasks and as a rich manually annotated material for linguistic research.","In what follows, we complete the theoretical overview (started in section 2), present the annotation approach and look for the common points. 3.1 Linguistic research There is a rich variety of linguistic approaches to genericity. Even as concerns the terminology with generics, it is quite inconsistent and cannot be relied on with much certainty. According to different researchers, generic NPs are considered to be either referring to classes (Carlson – Pelletier 1995, Mendoza 2004) or non-referring (rather predicating) classifications over kinds (Paducheva 1985), beeing able to have specific and non-specific interpretation (Mendoza 2004, Smelev 1996) and divided from non-specific NPs as a separate group (Carlson – Pelletier 2005, Paducheva 1985).","Carlson (1980) represents the most influential approach to genericity that has been elaborated in the framework of formal semantics and generative grammar. Calson’s hypothesis is that generics are kind-referring expressions, roughly names for kinds, as opposed to individual-referring expressions that refer to individuals or groups of individuals. In his approach, there is a difference between generic reference and individual non-specific reference, i.e. reference to an open set of individual objects. For example, NP lions that have toothaches is not generic, its reference is individual (i.e. non-generic) and non-specific, which can be demonstrated by the fact that it cannot be substituted by the definite NP the lion that has toothache (such NP can have only individual reading). However, the problem with this criterion is that it is clearly language-specific (it cannot be applied at all to Czech, for instance).","3.2 Annotation coreference with generic expression Let’s now have a look on how generic NPs are processed in annotation projects with anaphoric and coreference annotation. In some projects, e.g. ARRAU and other corpora based on the MATE coreference annotation scheme (Poesio 2004), genericity is marked as a part of lexico-semantical information of the noun (an attribute generic-yes/no/undersp is applied to each noun). This information is contemplated in the annotation of identical coreference. Identical coreference for generics is also annotated in AnCora (Recasens 2010) and PDT (Nedoluzhko 2011).","In other projects, annotation of coreference with generic NPs may be excluded from annotation schemes that are geared towards a reliable annotation of large text quantities. For example, generics are not annotated for coreference in On-tonotes (Pradhan et al. 2007), TüBA-DZ (Hinrichs et al. 2004) and PoCoS (Krasavina-Chiarchos 2007).","However, even if an annotation scheme explicitly says that coreference of generic NPs is not annotated, there are some borderline cases where coreference can still be annotated quite systematically. So, TüBA annotates coreference with the nominal expression if it appears repeatedly in the text with the same interpretation. In Ontonotes, the explicit anaphora with it in the anaphoric position is commonly annotated for coreference: (2) Still, any change in East Germany has enormous implications, for both East and West. It raises the long-cherished hopes of many Germans for reunification6",".","Furthermore, systematic exclusion of generic expressions from the annotation will force the coders not to mark the cases like (3) and (4) 7",". From the point of view of applied tasks and automatic coreference resolvers it will lead to the loss of relevant information and to an essential complification of automatic tools. (3) The sterilizing gene is expressed just be-fore the pollen is about to develop and it deactivates the anthers of every flower in the plant. Mr. Leemans said this genetic manipulation doesn't hurt the growth of that plant. (4) A workshop needs to be planned carefully. Otherwise it may turn in a disaster.","As far as we know, there are no significant projects for annotating coreference separately for  6 This example is taken from PEDT, to which the On-tonotes coreference was applied. 7 Examples come from PEDT. 105 generic, unspecific non-generic and specific expressions."]},{"title":"4 Coreference annotation in Prague Dependency Treebank","paragraphs":["In this section we describe how generic expressions (or more precisely, what we decided to consider generic expressions) are annotated in the Prague Dependency Treebank.","Annotation of coreference and discourse relations is a project related to the Prague Dependency Treebank 2.5 (PDT; Bejček et al. 2011). It represents a new manually annotated layer of language description, above the existing layers of the PDT (morphology, analytic syntax and tectogrammatics) and it captures linguistic phenome-na from the perspective of discourse structure and coherence. This special layer of the treebank consists of annotation of nominal coreference and bridging relations (Nedoluzhko et al. 2009), discourse connectives, discourse units linked by them and semantic relations between these units (Mladová 2011).","Considering the fact that Czech has no definite article (hence no formal possibility to exclude non-anaphoric coreference), our annotation is aimed at coreference relations regardless to their anaphoricity.","Coreference relations are marked for noun phrases with specific and generic reference separately – coreference of specific noun phrases – type SPEC, coreference of generic noun phrases – type GEN 8",". Bridging relations, which mark some semantic relations between non-coreferential entities, are also annotated in PDT. The following types of bridging relations are distinguished: PART-OF (e.g. room - ceiling), SUBSET (students - some students) and FUNCT (state - president) traditional relations, CON-TRAST for coherence relevant discourse opposites (this year - last year), ANAF for explicitly anaphoric relations without coreference or one of the semantic relations mentioned above (rainbow - that word) and the further underspecified group REST9",".","As seen from the point of view of the annotated groups, generic NPs are explicitly marked  8 The reason for this decision is the lack of semantic information assigned to nouns themselves, as it is done e.g. for Gnome in MATE sceme (Poesio 2004). 9 For detailed classification of identity coreference and bridging relations used in PDT, see e.g. Nedoluzhko et al. 2011.","only with the second element of the coreference","relation. However, this distinction remains un-","registered by bridging relations. Moreover, it","appears to be possible (and even not so uncom-","mon) that a coreference relation was annotated","between a generic and a non-generic noun","phrase. These cases are interpreted as either (lin-","guistically) ambiguous or insufficiently classified","by the guidelines. For example, in (5), the specif-","ic noun phrase tento národ (=this nation) is core-","ferent with generic plural Romy (=the Gipsies): (5) Nic z toho se však nevyrovná míře neštěstí, které Romy postihlo v letech druhé světové války. Spolu se Židy byli označeni za méněcennou rasu a stali se objektem patologických fašistických opatření, jejichž cí- lem byla úplná genocida tohoto národa. (= Nothing of this, however, compares to the misfortune that befell the Gipsies during the Second World War. Together with the Jews, they were called an inferior race and be-came the object of pathological fascist measures, their purpose being the complete genocide of the nation.)","Annotation rules for generics in PDT are described in detail in sections 4.1-4.3. 4.1 Type coreference of generic NPs","Coreference relations between the same types are annotated as coreference of generic NPs (attribute coref_text, type GEN). Cf. (6) where antecedent generic drug is pronominalized in the anaphoric position: (6) Droga je tedy tak účinná, že ten, kdo ji užívá, se snadno dostane do „pohody“ kou- řením nebo šňupáním. (= The drug is so effective that the person who takes it can easily achieve the state of “coolness” by smok-ing or snorting.)","The “generic coreference” is more frequent for plural forms (7): (7) Nová striktní omezení vlády SR proti českým exportérům. Již několik dnů je všeobecně známo, že ochranářská opatření slovenské vlády proti českým exportérům se dotýkají zejména oblasti obchodu s potravinami a zemědělskými produkty. (= The new Slovak government's strict restrictions on Czech exporters. It’s commonly known for several days that protective measures of Slovakia's government against Czech exporters apply mostly to the trade of food and agricultural products.) 106","Textual coreference of type GEN is also annotated for the majority of abstract nouns (see more detail in Section 5.5), cf. (8): (8) Tímto faktorem je podnikatel-inovátor, který se snaží o zisk, a proto logicky nemůže existovat ve stavu statiky, která nezná ani zisk, ani ztrátu.

Another milestone is worth mentioning, that is the birth of a bubble gum.)","Annotating the SUBSET relation with generic expressions appears to be quite a serious problem.

[...] It is usually the case that the child does not even want for the family to know that he contacted us. The hotline should not replace the family, but to supplement it.)","There are also cases of non-specific non-generic NPs the referential value of which is provided by syntactic factors. These are so-called contexts with removed assertiveness, e.g. sentences with modal verbs (can, want, need), imperative sentences, future tense, questions, negations, disjunctions, irreality, uncertainty and so on. Non-specific NPs are often used with performative verbs, propositional attitudes (want, think, consider) and some constructions as e.g. in English such as, in Czech jde o (=lit. It is about), takový X (=such X), etc. These contexts can give a non-specific reading to an expression, even if it actually has a specific meaning. Cf (13), where 107","(13) Ale jedna věc je jistá - palác bude stavebně předáván letos na podzim. [...] Provoz tak obrovské budovy přijde ročně na desítky milionů korun. (=lit. But one thing is certain – the reconstruction of the palace will be finished this fall. [...] It will cost tens of millions crowns, to run such a huge building.)","5.2 Borderline cases between coreference of specific and generic NPs","In some cases, it is hard to decide if a noun phrase has a specific or a generic reading. Mostly, both interpretations are possible. There are no firm rules for an unambiguous assignment of the types in those cases; the type is chosen on the basis of the available context and the annotator’s consideration. Uncertainty of the choice between generic and specific reference is common with some typical groups of noun phrases, first of all with those that have or may have modifications. Cf. pořad (=TV show) in (14) that may have a temporal modification. The obligatoriness of this modification influences the annotator’s decision if (s)he should read it as a generic or a specific NP. For this case, the specific reading was chosen.","(14) K tématu pořadu TV NOVA TABU","“Zrak za bílou hůl” byl přizván ke kon-","zultaci Oldřich Čálek.

Also in this case, the specif-","ic reference is preferred in PDT: (15) U detergentu Toto jsme například řešili problém s udržením stálé kvality, protože jednotlivé partie byly nevyvážené. In-vestovali jsme dva miliony korun do nákupu pásových vah, zpřesnili dávkování a jakost pracího prášku stabilizovali. (=For example, with the Toto detergent we face problems with maintaining consistent quality... We invested two million crowns... and stabilized the quality of the detergent. )","5.3 Borderline cases between coreference of generic NPs and zero relation","There is also a borderline between the cases of coreference of the generic NPs and the cases where it makes no sense to mark a coreferential relation. We do not annotate “generic coreference” if noun phrases have different scope (i.e. they refer to different sets of objects), e.g. ženy (= women) – ženy v 19. století (= women in 19 th"," century). In this case, the bridging relation of the type SUBSET is annotated instead. In other problematic cases, annotators usually apply to their intuition and the text coherence. If both say no, no coreference is annotated.","5.4 Coreference with measure NPs and other NPs with a ‘container’ meaning","In PDT, a special group of numerals and nouns with a ‘container’ meaning is singled out. They have the modification in their valency frames denoting the content (people, things, substance etc.) of a container expressed by the governing noun. These ‘container’ expressions are e.g. nouns and numerals denoting groups, number or amount, sets, collections, portions, etc. (skupina lidí (=group of people), počet akcií (=number of stocks), stádo krav (=herd of cows), dostatek financí (=abundance of finance), milióny židů (=millions of Jews), sklenice piva (=glass of beer), deset procent obyvatel (=ten percent of population)).","The PDT convention on annotating coreference by NPs with a ‘container’ meaning follows the maximum-scope rule, i.e., if possible, the governing (‘container’) node is linked by a coreference link (16). The modifications of containers may be coreferential themselves independently of the ‘containers’ (17)","(16) Absolutní většina lidí závislých na her-","oinu je příliš mladá na to, aby si #PersPron","pamatovala rozklad a zesláblost generace","sedmdesátých let, takže odvrácenou stránku","„fantastického“ života si #PersPron","mnohdy vůbec neuvědomí.

(=In an average sam-108 ple from the seventies, there were only 3-4 percent of pure raw material. Currently, one can get packages containing up to 80 percent of pure heroin.)","Coreference of ‘containers’ can be problemat-","ic from the point of view of their generic or spe-","cific interpretation. Nouns referring to groups","may refer generically to the elements belonging","to that group or specifically to the group itself. In","the following example, there has been a disa-","greement between annotators concerning the ge-","neric/specific reading of the NP skupina","(=group). We believe that this kind of disagree-","ment could be solved by separating the group of","non-specific non-generic references. (18) Podle výzkumů ve vyspělých zemích se ukazuje, že lidí, kteří potřebují speciální služby, je daleko víc. U nás by tuto skupinu tvořilo asi tak 70000 osob. Jsou to hlavně starší lidé se zbytky zraku a slabozrací. Tato skupina stojí úplně mimo a má tak život ještě více ztížený, protože mnozí o těchto službách ani nevědí. (=According to the research in the developed countries, there are many more people who need special services. In our country, the group of such people would count about 70,000 individuals. They are mainly older people sighted and visually impaired. This group is completely off, their life being even more difficult, because they don’t even know about many of these services.) More complicated are the cases where coref-","erence chains for ‘containers’ and their modifica-","tions intersect. In (19), a coreference link for the","strikers in b. should lead to three and a half","thousand workers but in c., the number of strik-","ers changes, so the container modification work-","ers should be marked as coreferent with the","strikers in b. For such cases, coreference of type","GEN is used in PDT.","(19) a. Tří a půl tisíce dělníků vyhlásili","stávku. b. Stávkující žádají zvýšení platů o","šest procent. c. Do 8. března se počet","stávkujících může zdvojnásobit. (a. Three","and a half thousand workers went on strike.","b. The strikers demand six percent of salary","increase. c. By 8 March, the number of","strikers may double.)","However, in this case, the problem is rather specific. Here, počet stávkujících (=the number of strikers) does not actually refer to the strikers (as it would e.g. in tisíc stávkujících (=thousand strikers) but to the number itself and that is the reason for coreference annotation to strikers. In such cases, the number does not serve as a ‘container’ in proper sense. 5.5 Coreference with abstract nouns","Processing coreference of abstract nouns seems to be in some respects close to that of generics. Abstract nouns do not refer to a type, but to a notion. However, this notion is unique in the same way as type is unique to the generic expression which refers to it. Moreover, abstract nouns are close to predicative and quantificational interpretation and there are no formal rules distinguishing them from concrete NPs and deverbatives. They also result in high ambiguity when annotated for coreference.","There have been several changes in the guidelines for the annotation of coreference and bridging relations with abstract nouns. Finally, we decided to distinguish between “specific” and “generic” abstracts. If subjects to annotation have complements with specific reference, or they have unambiguously specific reference themselves, coreference between them is annotated as textual coreference, type SPEC (20). In case of even a little doubt, we annotate textual coreference, type GEN (8).","(20) Ve specifických podmínkách české","ekonomiky růst nezaměstnanosti v letech","1991–1993 značně zaostal za poklesem","HDP.

This year at least a two","percent growth of the Czech economy.) 5.6 Coreference with verbal nouns","With verbal nouns, both specifying and gener-","ic reference are possible as well. Textual corefer-","ence with verbal nouns is annotated according to","the following strategy:","- If both verbal nouns are specific, they refer to a specific situation and their possible arguments are coreferential, the relation between them is annotated as textual coreference, type SPEC, cf. (21);","- If both verbal nouns are generic, or rather if their arguments are generic, the relation between them is annotated as textual coreference, type GEN. Cf. (22);","- If both verbal nouns are specific, but their arguments are not coreferential, coreferen-109 tial relation between them is not annotated.;","- If one verbal noun is specific and the other is generic, coreferential relation between them is not annotated.

Moreover, deverbatives themselves may refer to specific events that has already happened (thus tending to type SPEC if coreferent) or to hypothetic or typical ones (then, in case of coreference, marked as GEN)."]},{"title":"6 Discussion","paragraphs":["Processing coreference of generic expressions, even in manual annotation, raises a number of problems, both theoretical and the applied, like complification of coreference resolving. As we have seen, the problem of generics is very language-specific. Each resolving system trying to process coreference for generics will have to be oriented towards the specific linguistic descrip-tion of the language in question. But even so, there are many possibilities of expressing generic expressions in every language, thus making the formal problem of extracting generics even in one separate language extremely difficult.","Generic expressions are analyzed relatively in more detail for English (Carlson 1980, Carlson - Pelletier 1995). However, this research relies heavily on language forms, it is not based on a large-scale corpus and it seems to be too theoretical to be easily adapted to a large corpus (manual or automatic) processing. On the other hand, Carlson’s classification of the reference reading of nouns could be used in practice for the distinction between generic and non-specific non-generic NPs. Using our experience, we believe that it would make the annotation more consistent: there would be less ambiguity between specific and generic readings. However, being helpful in resolving the cases from section 5.1, this decision would not resolve the majority of the remaining problematic cases. There still remain borderline cases with specific noun expressions with possible valency frames (see 5.2), coreference with abstract and verbal nouns and so on. Separating the group of NPs with non-specific reading, the coders should concentrate on quite specific semantic issues when annotating. Moreover, annotating more groups of nouns is always a costly and time-consuming task.","From the theoretical point of view, one could imagine a scale: from noun expressions with concrete meaning and specific reading (say named entities) up to abstract nouns and deverbatives with generic reading. However, such an approach will not help to process generic NPs in large-scale corpora."]},{"title":"7 Conclusion","paragraphs":["In this paper, we discussed the problem of annotating coreference with generic expressions. Considering theoretical approaches has revealed that they tend to be very language specific. State-of-the-art in annotating coreference relations for generic NPs needs unification but this is complicated, as the formal representation of genericity differs dramatically from language to language and can be hardly unified. We have presented an approach to annotation of generic expressions in PDT and analyzed some typical problematic examples. We consider this issue to be far from being solved. Both, theoretical research and large data approaches should be further investigated."," Acknowledgments We gratefully acknowledge support from the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic (grants P406/12/0658 and P406/2010/0875).  110"]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Eduard Bejček, Jan Hajič, Jarmila Panevová, Jan Popelka, Lenka Smejkalová, Pavel Straňák, Magda Ševčíková, Jan Štěpánek, Josef Toman and Zdeněk Žabokrtský. 2011.
