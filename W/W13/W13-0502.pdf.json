(ii) how should relevant information be inferred which is implicit in the data?

This paper concerns the annotation of such data, whether they are embedded in a text or presented alone. As its basic annotation scheme, it follows ISO-Space, a semantic annotation scheme which was proposed by Pustejvosky et al. (2012) for the annotation of spatial information in natural language. It is claimed that ISO-Space can be adequately applied to the annotation of non-textual data as well as text data in natural language.","Section 2 presents partial specification of ISO-Space, section 3 discusses making references to markables, section 4 deals with understanding conventions, section 5 illustrates multi-layered annotation, and section 6 makes concluding remarks."]},{"title":"2 Partial Specification of ISO-Space","paragraphs":["Given a text (fragment) tL of a language L, the annotation scheme ASisoSpace of ISO-Space can be defined formally as a quadruple <M, E, R, @>, where M is a nonempty finite set of (some selected) segments of tL, called markables, E a nonempty finite set of elements, called basic entities, which are either atomic or composite, R an n-ary (basically binary) relation over E, and @ a set of functions from a set of attributes to a set of values for each element e in E and each relation r in R. One particular attribute is an attribute, named @target, that anchors a basic atomic entity e in E to a markable m in M . For the general formulation of an annotation scheme AS, we basically follow Lee (2012), which is slightly different from that of Bunt (2010) or Bunt (2011).","The set M of markables consists of all the expressions, i.e., sequences of tokens or words in tL, that refer to all of the basic entities of each of the types defined by E. These entities include (1) spatial entities, tagged as PLACE and PATH or (2) entities that are not genuinely spatial, but involve spatial entities, tagged as EVENT, MOTION, SPATIAL NE (named entity) or SPATIAL SIGNAL. The set R of n-ary links over E include (1) qualitative spatial link, (2) orientation link, (3) movement link, and (4) metric link tagged as QSLINK, OLINK, MOVELINK, and MLINK, respectively.","The specification of sets of attribute-value pairs for each of the basic entity types and the links requires a complex listing. Each basic entity e in E and each link r in R has a unique ID, specified with the attribute @xml:id in XML representation.

Note that there are two types of basic entities, atomic and composite. Atomic basic entities are simply anchored to a markable in M , whereas composite basic entities are anchored to other basic entities as well as to markables. The entity type PLACE, for instance, is an atomic entity type, while the entity type PATH is a composite entity type, for the latter is anchored to PLACEs.","Instead of presenting ASisoSpace as a whole as is formally defined, we may introduce it only partially and also in an informal way with some illustrations. For this, consider the following text:","(1) Mia drove to Jeju International Airport yesterday. This sentence contains 8 tokens including a punctuation mark. Out of them, ISO-Space selects 6 tokens and treats them as four markables, “Mia”, “drove”, “to”, and “Jeju International Airport”, as shown below:","(2) Miatoken1 drovetoken2 totoken3 Jejutoken4 Internationaltoken5 Airporttoken6 yesterday. Corresponding to the four markables, four basic entities are introduced: SPATIAL NE, MOTION, SPATIAL SIGNAL and PLACE. A link is also introduced: <MOVELINK>. Each of them is specified with a list of appropriate attribute-value assignments with some modifications on the current list of ISO-Space, as is represented in XML as follows:1","(3) <isoSpace> <SPATIAL NE xml:id=\"sne1\" target=\"#token1\" type=\"PERSON\" form=\"NAME\"/> <MOTION xml:id=\"m1\" target=\"#token2\" motion type=\"MANNER\" motion class=\"MOVE EXTERNAL\"/> <SPATIAL SIGNAL xml:id=\"s1\" target=\"#token3\"/> <PLACE xml:id=\"pl1\" target=\"#(token4,token6)\"","1","We have introduced attribute-value pairs such as type= \"PERSON\" for the annotion of “Mia”, and also type=\"FAC\" and subtype=\"AIRPORT\" for that of “Jeju International Airport”. type=\"FAC\" subtype=\"AIRPORT\" form=\"NAME\"/> <MOVELINK xml:id=\"mvl1\" trigger=\"#m1\" goal=\"#pl1\" mover=\"#sne1\" goal reached=\"YES\"/> </isoSpace>","This annotation is then understood as conveying the information that there are four types of basic entities involving spatial information: spatial named entity, motion, spatial signal, and place, and that there is a relation of linking among these entities. Each entity is further specified with information provided by the assignment of a value to each relevant attribute. The place “Jeju International Airport” is, for instance, specified as FAC (facility type) being an airport. With the attribute @target specified as above, each of the four basic entity types <PLACE>, <MOTION>, <SPATIAL SIGNAL>, and <SPATIAL NE> refers to some markable (sequence of tokens) in the text.","The annotation given above then introduces one link, namely <MOVELINK>, among those four basic entities. This link is triggered by the motion (m1) of driving to its goal, the airport (pl1) named “Jeju International Airport”, with its agent (driver) being a person (sne1) named “Mia”. The link, as is annotated here, thus fully represents the information conveyed by the sentence given above. The annotation as a whole can be formally interpreted in first-order logic, as below:","(4) ∃{x, y, e}[person(x) ∧ named(x, M ia) ∧ airport(y) ∧ named(y, JejuInt.Airport) ∧ move external(e) ∧ agent(x, e) ∧ goal(y, e) ∧ reach(x, y)]"]},{"title":"3 Making References to Markables","paragraphs":["In annotating a text, each basic entity type can easily refer to a part of it as its markable because texts are considered to be sequences of character strings and can thus be tokenized.

In this section, we will show how making references to so-called markables in the"]},{"title":"16","paragraphs":["Figure 1: Deep Breathing c⃝Ghang Lee annotation of non-textual data requires techniques more than simply segmenting a text.","Consider Figure 1: Deep Breathing. This figure is introduced as part of a guidebook for teaching how to breathe deep down to the abdomen by expand-ing the diaphragm during the Zen meditation. This figure cannot be segmented into character offsets or tokens, for it contains no characters at all. It rather consists of several geometric objects: (1) an area to-tally enclosed with a boundary line and an open area outside of it, (2) a curved line located within the enclosed area, and (3) a directed line, namely, arrow entering the upper part of the enclosed area and then reaching that curved line located at the lower part of the enclosed area.","The description of these objects may have to be more explicit for the purposes of computing, perhaps requiring the use of such notions as pixels, coordinates, orientations or topological properties to make them referable as markables. From ordinary linguistic points of view, however, such a specification seems to go beyond the level of semantic representation. It is too complicated to focus on relevant information from the given figure. Instead, we can propose a conventionally more acceptable linguistic technique. Namely, it is to assign a unique name to each of these geometric objects, thus making them uniquely identifiable within a restricted domain and producing a figure such as Figure 2: Deep Breathing Annotated. Such a naming technique is especially plausible because the original figure is accompanied by a title that tells what is being depicted. Because of its title Deep Breathing, we can conjecture that the figure depicts the process of deep breathing, sometimes called diaphragmatic breathing, that undergoes the expansion of the diaphragm or the ab-Figure 2: Deep Breathing Annotated c⃝Ghang Lee domen.","With such knowledge, we can give names to (1) the two spatial areas: the enclosed area is named THE HUMAN BODY, that represents the shape of the human body with a sitting posture, whereas the open area outside it is named THE AIR; (2) the three relevant points: the first point is named NOSTRILS, which lies on the upper left boundary of the enclosed area, the second point, named LUNGS, which is located at the left middle part of the enclosed area, and the third point, named ABDOMEN, which is located at the mid-lower part of the same enclosed area; and (3) the two lines: the arrow is named IN PATH, which starts from THE AIR area, goes through the NOSTRILS and the LUNGS and terminates at the ABDOMEN, whereas the other line is named DIAPHRAGM, which is shown to be stretched to the ABDOMEN. We should also be able to recognize two motions: one motion is that of an object named air which follows through IN PATH, and the other motion is that of the DIAPHRAGM that expands from the LUNGS down to the ABDOMEN. Here, two moving objects, air and DIAPHRAGM can be treated of type SPATIAL NE, named entities involving motions in space.","With all these names specified as above, ISO-Space can now be applied to the annotation of the whole figure, as represented in XLM below .

We can also refer to each of those areas by drawing (Cartesian) coordinate lines, both horizontal and vertical, as detailed as necessary, over the whole photographed area, thus relying on other than linguistic knowledge or techniques such as word segmentation.4","In ordinary conversations, as was just claimed, we may prefer to talk about some areas with their specific names rather than their coordinate values. Naming is an important aspect of the ordinary use of language: for instance, naming places with street number, often framed in mapping coordinates, is found very useful especially when we travel to locate places. Knowing directions is also important. But photographs like Figure 3 do not have any place names or street numbers at all. It also fails to tell which is north or south and which is east or west, although they may allow us to measure a distance from one location to another. In section 5, we discuss multi-layered annotation, showing how such an approach combines various types of information, whether non-linguistic or linguistic, to enrich the annotation of non-textual data such as figures or maps. Note again that one particular layer deals with naming.","Here is a third example, Figure 4: Sistine Chapel.

Nevertheless, we still do not know how to enter it, except guessing that we might be able to enter it through the basilica. (Yes, you can, if you are a Vatican guard or dignitary.)

Knowing some conventions of printing out flight schedules, we get proper information about (1) the customer Ms Mia Lee, who was traveling from Gimpo Airport to Haneda Airport and then from Haneda back to Gimpo, (2) the respective departure and arrival dates and times of the on-going and return flights, and (3) the names of the carriers.","With such knowledge, we can annotate this table with ISO-Space, as shown below.","(6) <isoSpace xml:id=\"a3\"> <SPATIAL NE xml:id=\"sne1\" target=\"#table2:col1,row1: [token1,token3]\" form=\"NAME\" type=\"PERSON\"/> <SPATIAL NE xml:id=\"sne2\" target=\"#table2:col4,row2:token1\" form=\"NAME\" type=\"PLANE\" subtype/flightNo=\"JL0092\"/> <PLACE xml:id=\"pl1\" target=\"#table2:col1,row2:token1\" from=\"NAME\" type=\"FAC\" subtype=\"AIRPORT\" city=\"SEOUL\" country=\"KR\"/> <PLACE xml:id=\"pl2\" target=\"#table2:col1,row2:token3\" from=\"NAME\" type=\"FAC\" subtype=\"AIRPORT\" city=\"TOKYO\" country=\"JP\"/> <PATH xml:id=\"p1\" begingPoint=\"#pl1\" endPoint=\"#pl2\"/> 6","Strcitly speaking, these tables are only partially non-textual.

To annotate temporal information, it should be applied jointly with ISO-TimeML (2012). We can then make the example more interesting and sensible, by annotating various quantitative information of spatio-temporal measurements such as time amount, durations, frequency, distance, and also the tense and modal property of motions or events in general.

(2010) and is well proven by Google Earth map resources, no single map can provide all of the necessary geographic information, thus requiring several layers of a map.

On the other hand, if it is just an aerial photograph, it may not contain enough information, for instance, to tell which town is which and which road is which.

LAF (2012) thus requires standoff annotation, as opposed to in-line annotation, while allowing multi-layered annotation of linguistic information. Accordingly, we also argue that a multi-layered approach is not only suitable, but required for the annotation of non-textual data as well as textual data.","For illustration, consider again the figures of deep breathing. In section 3, we have discussed two figures, Figure 1:Deep Breathing and Figure 2:Deep Breathing Annotated. We have then argued how ISO-Space can be adequately applied to annotate the figure of deep breathing by making references to the entity names specified in the second figure. Nevertheless, one may argue that naming alone is not finegrained enough to identify regions and other spatial entities for some technical applications such as drawing cartoons or architectural designs or even annotating them. In addition to the technique of naming, we thus propose another technique as providing an additional layer of making it possible to refer to markables in both textual and non-textual data.","This technique is a well-known technique of segmenting data, whether textual or not, into smaller constituents. Just like maps with geo-coordinates, each (two-dimensional) figure in a text is to be treated like a Cartesian plane, divided into small areas with their coordinates specified.7","Then the character strings and some defining points of the region or its parts such as the nostrils, the lungs, the 7 Geo-coordinates or other map reading coordinates are par-","ticular instances of the Cartesian coordinate. Figure 6: Jeju Island-annotated diaphragm, and the abdomen should be identified strictly in terms of those coordinates, just as a text is segmented into tokens based on character offsets.","This technique can be illustrated with the figure of deep breathing. In addition to those two figures, introduced in 3, we can introduce one more figure, Figure 5: Deep Breathing Figure Segmented. This third figure treats the whole region as a two-dimensional Cartesian plane, segmented into 5 x 5 areas with unequal sizes.8","Horizontal and vertical lines are drawn in such a way that some relevant points can be identified with some of their intersections. The position of the nostrils, for in-stance, is identified with the point (1,4). The non-stretched diaphragm can also be identified as a line segment from (2,2) to (4,2), while its mid-point is being stretched to the point (3,1). Likewise, all of the relevant areas can also be identified by drawing additional lines, if necessary, that segment the whole area into much smaller areas. This then requires another layer of representing the whole figure.","For another illustration, consider the following map of Jeju Island, Figure 6: Jeju Island-annotated.9 Unlike the aerial photograph of Jeju, Figure 3, this new figure has names for several locations: (1) Mt.

In Figure 6, there is a little arrow on the left-most upper corner pointing to the north, providing directional information. With this information, we know that the airport is located in the north central boundary of the island.

In annotating such data, one difficulty was how to anchor such basic entities as PLACE and PATH to parts of the data, since pictures and figures, unlike texts, cannot be tokenized. Another difficulty arose from the understanding of various symbols or conventional cues in visual data.

We have thus avoided discussing any theoretical implications that may go beyond the domain of linguistic annotation, although we have not explicitly demarcated the line between what is linguistic and what is not. A question still remains whether the annotation of non-textual data or multimedia is part of linguistic work. For computing purposes, how-ever, more serious questions may be raised. One could ask how non-human agents can annotate such non-textual data for spatial or spatio-temporal information. Towards answering these questions, more work should be done on multimedia or motion tagging, as discussed in Mani and Pustejovsky (2012), and more serious references should be made to some initiatives that exist in GIS(Geographic Information System)-related communities."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["I own many thanks to Suk-jin Chang, Jae-Woong Choe, Roland Hausser, Hwan-Mook Lee, Ghang Lee, Chongwon Park, and four anonymous reviewers for their very constructive and detailed comments that helped improve the paper."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Berg, Mark de, Otfried Cheong, Marc van Kreveld and Mark Overmars. 2010.
