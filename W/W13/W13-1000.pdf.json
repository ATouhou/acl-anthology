The workshop has been held almost every year since 2003 in conjunction with ACL, EACL, NAACL, COLING and LREC. It provides an important venue for interaction, sharing of resources and tools and collaboration efforts for advancing the computational treatment of Multiword Expressions (MWEs), attracting the attention of an ever-growing community working on a variety of languages and MWE types. MWEs include idioms (storm in a teacup, sweep under the rug), fixed phrases (in vitro, by and large, rock’n roll), noun compounds (olive oil, laser printer), compound verbs (take a nap, bring about), among others. These, while easily mastered by native speakers, are a key issue and a current weakness for natural language parsing and generation, as well as real-life applications depending on some degree of semantic interpretation, such as machine translation, just to name a prominent one among many. However, thanks to the joint efforts of researchers from several fields working on MWEs, significant progress has been made in recent years, especially concerning the construction of large-scale language resources. For instance, there is a large number of recent papers that focus on acquisition of MWEs from corpora, and others that describe a variety of techniques to find paraphrases for MWEs. Current methods use a plethora of tools such as association measures, machine learning, syntactic patterns, web queries, etc. In the call for papers we solicited submissions about major challenges in the overall process of MWE treatment, both from the theoretical and the computational viewpoint, focusing on original research related to the following topics: • Manually and automatically constructed resources • Representation of MWEs in dictionaries and ontologies • MWEs and user interaction • Multilingual acquisition • Crosslinguistic studies on MWEs • Integration of MWEs into NLP applications • Lexical, syntactic or semantic aspects of MWEs Submission modalities included Long Papers and Short Papers. From a total of 27 submissions, 15 were long papers and 12 were short papers, and we accepted 7 long papers for oral presentation and 3 as posters: an acceptance rate of 66.6%. We further accepted 5 short papers for oral presentation and 3 1 http://multiword.sourceforge.net/mwe2013 2 http://www.siglex.org iii as posters (66.6% acceptance). The workshop also featured 3 invited talks, by Jill Burstein (Educational Testing Service, USA), Malvina Nissim (University of Bologna, Italy) and Martha Palmer (University of Colorado at Boulder, USA)."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["We would like to thank the members of the Program Committee for the timely reviews and the authors for their valuable contributions.
