Dell’ Amerlina Rı́os and Agustı́n Gravano Departamento de Computación, FCEyN Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina {mamerlin,gravano}@dc.uba.ar Abstract","paragraphs":["The topic of sentiment analysis in text has been extensively studied in English for the past 30 years. An early, influential work by Cynthia Whissell, the Dictionary of Affect in Language (DAL), allows rating words along three dimensions: pleasantness, activation and imagery. Given the lack of such tools in Spanish, we decided to replicate Whissell’s work in that language. This paper describes the Spanish DAL, a knowledge base formed by more than 2500 words manually rated by humans along the same three dimensions. We evaluated its usefulness on two sentiment analysis tasks, which showed that the knowledge base managed to capture relevant information regarding the three affective dimensions."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["In an attempt to quantify emotional meaning in written language, Whissell developed the Dictionary of Affect in Language (DAL), a tool for rating words and texts in English along three dimensions – pleasantness, activation and imagery (Whissell et al., 1986; Whissell, 1989, inter alia). DAL works by looking up individual words in a knowledge base containing 8742 words. All words in this lexicon were originally rated by 200 naı̈ve volunteers along the same three dimensions.","Whissell’s DAL has subsequently been used in diverse research fields, for example as a keystone for sentiment analysis in written text (Yi et al., 2003, e.g.) and emotion recognition in spoken language (Cowie et al., 2001). DAL has also been used to aid the selection of emotionally balanced word stimuli for Neuroscience and Psycholinguistics experiments (Gray et al., 2002). Given the widespread impact of DAL for the English language, it would be desirable to create similar lexicons for other languages.","In recent years, there have been efforts to build cross-lingual resources, such as using sentiment analysis tools in English to score Spanish texts after performing machine translation (Brooke et al., 2009) or to automatically derive sentiment lexicons in Spanish (Pérez-Rosas et al., 2012). The purpose of the present work is to create a manually annotated lexicon for the Spanish language, replicating Whissell’s DAL, aiming at alleviating the scarcity of resources for the Spanish language, and at determining if the lexicon-based approach would work in Spanish as well as it does in English. We leave for future work the comparison of the different approaches mentioned here. This paper describes the three steps performed to accomplish that goal: i) creating a knowledge base which is likely to have a good word coverage on arbitrary texts from any topic and genre (Section 2); ii) having a number of volunteers annotate each word for the three affective dimensions under study (Section 3); and iii) evaluat-ing the usefulness of our knowledge base on simple tasks (Section 4)."]},{"title":"2 Word selection","paragraphs":["The first step in building a Spanish DAL consists in selecting a list of content words that is representa-tive of the Spanish language, in the sense that it will have a good coverage of the words in arbitrary input texts from potentially any topic or genre. To accomplish this we decided to use texts downloaded from Wikipedia in Spanish1","and from an online collection of short stories called Los Cuentos.2","Articles from Wikipedia cover a wide range of topics and are gen-","1","http://es.wikipedia.org","2","http://www.loscuentos.net 21 erally written in encyclopedia style. We downloaded the complete set of articles in March, 2012, consisting of 834,460 articles in total. Short stories from Los Cuentos were written by hundreds of different authors, both popular and amateur, on various genres, including tales, essays and poems. We downloaded the complete collection from Los Cuentos in April, 2012, consisting of 216,060 short stories. 2.1 Filtering and lemmatizing words We extracted all words from these texts, sorted them by frequency, and filtered out several word classes that we considered convey no affect by themselves (and thus it would be unnecessary to have them rated by the volunteers). Prepositions, determinants, possessives, interjections, conjunctions, numbers, dates and hours were tagged and removed automatically using the morphological analysis function included in the Freeling toolkit (Padró et al., 2010).3","We also excluded the following adverb subclasses for the same reason: place, time, mode, doubt (e.g., quizás, maybe), negation, affirmation and amount.","Nouns and verbs were lemmatized using Freeling as well, except for augmentative and diminu-tive terminations, which were left intact due to their potential effect on a word’s meaning and/or affect (e.g., burrito is either a small donkey, burro, or a type of Mexican food). Additionally, proper nouns were excluded. Names of cities, regions, countries and nationalities were marked and removed using GeoWorldMap,4","a freely-available list of location names from around the world. Names of people were also filtered out. Proper names were manually inspected to avoid removing those with a lexical meaning, a common phenomenon in Spanish (e.g., Victoria). Other manually removed words include words in foreign languages (mainly in English), roman numbers (e.g., XIX) and numbers in textual form, such as seis (six), sexto (sixth), etc. Words with one or two characters were removed automatically, since we noticed that they practically always corresponded to noise in the downloaded texts. 2.2 Counting ⟨word, word-class⟩ pairs","We implemented a small refinement over Whissell’s","work, which consisted in considering ⟨word, word-3 http://nlp.lsi.upc.edu/freeling/ 4 http://www.geobytes.com/FreeServices.htm class⟩ pairs, rather than single words, since in Spanish the same lexical form may have different senses. Thus, to each word (in its lemmatized form) we at-tached one of four possible word classes – noun, verb, adjective or adverb. For example, bajoprep (under) or bajonoun (bass guitar).","For each input word w, Freeling’s morphological analysis returns a sequence of tuples ⟨lemma, POStag, probability⟩, which correspond to the possible lemmas and part-of-speech tags for w, together with their prior probability. For example, the analysis for the word bajo returns four tuples: ⟨bajo, SPS00 (i.e, preposition), 0.879⟩, ⟨bajo, AQ0MS0 (adjective), 0.077⟩, ⟨bajo, NCMS000 (noun), 0.040⟩, and ⟨bajar, VMIP1S0 (verb), 0.004⟩. This means that bajo, considered without context, has 87.9% chances of being a noun, or 0.04% of being a verb.","Using this information, we computed the counts of all ⟨word, word-class⟩ pairs, taking into account their prior probabilities. For example, assuming the word bajo appeared 1000 times in the texts, it would contribute with 1000 ∗ 0.879 = 879 to the frequency of bajoprep (i.e., bajo as a preposition), 77 to bajoadj, 40 to bajonoun, and 4 to bajarverb. 2.3 Merging Wikipedia and Los Cuentos This process yielded 163,071 ⟨word, word-class⟩ pairs from the Wikipedia texts, and 30,544 from Los Cuentos. To improve readability, hereafter we will refer to ⟨word, word-class⟩ pairs simply as words. Figure 1 shows the frequency of each word count in our two corpora. We note that both graphics are practically identical, with a majority of low-count words and a long tail with few high-count words.","To create our final word list to be rated by volunteers, we needed to merge our two corpora from Wikipedia and Los Cuentos. To accomplish this, we Figure 1: Frequency of word counts in texts taken from Wikipedia and Los Cuentos. 22 normalized all word counts for corpus size (normalized count(w) = count(w) / corpus size), combined both lists and sorted the resulting list by the normalized word count (for the words that appeared in both lists, we used its average count instead). The resulting list contained 175,413 words in total.","The top 10 words from Wikipedia were másadv, añonoun, ciudadnoun, poblaciónnoun, estadonoun, nombrenoun, veznoun, municipionoun, gruponoun and historianoun (more, year, city, population, state, name, time, as in ‘first time’, municipality, group and history, respectively). The 10 words most common from Los Cuentos were másadv, veznoun, vidanoun, dı́anoun, tanadv, tiemponoun, ojonoun, manonoun, amornoun and nochenoun (more, time, life, day, so, time, eye, hand, love and night). 2.4 Assessing word coverage Next we studied the coverage of the top k words from our list on texts from a third corpus formed by 3603 news stories downloaded from Wikinews in Spanish in April, 2012.5","We chose news stories for this task because we wanted a different genre for studying the evolution of coverage.","Formally, let L be a word list, T any text, and W (T ) the set of words occurring at least once in T . We define thecoverage of L on T as the percentage of words in W (T ) that appear in L. Figure 2 shows the evolution of the mean coverage on Wikinews articles of the top k words from our word list. In this figure we can observe that the mean coverage grows rapidly, until it reaches a plateau at around Figure 2: Mean coverage of the top k words from our list on Wikinews articles. 5 http://es.wikinews.org 80%. This suggests that even a low number of words may achieve a relatively high coverage on new texts. The 20% that remains uncovered, independently of the size of the word list, may be explained by the function words and proper names that were removed from our word list. Note that news articles normally contain many proper names, days, places and other words that we intentionally discarded."]},{"title":"3 Word rating","paragraphs":["After selecting the words, the next step consisted in having them rated by a group of volunteers. For this purpose we created a web interface, so that volunteers could complete this task remotely. 3.1 Web interface On the first page of the web interface, volunteers were asked to enter their month and year of birth, their education level and their native language, and was asked to complete a reCAPTCHA6","to avoid bots. Subsequently, volunteers were taken to a page with instructions for the rating task. They were asked to rate each word along the three dimensions shown in Table 1. These are the same three dimen-Pleasantness Activation Imagery","1 Desagradable Pasivo Difı́cil de imaginar (Unpleasant) (Passive) (Hard to imagine)","2 Ni agradable Ni activo Ni difı́cil ni fácil ni desagradable ni pasivo de imaginar (In between) (In between) (In between)","3 Agradable Activo Fácil de imaginar (Pleasant) (Active) (Easy to imagine) Table 1: Possible values for each of the three dimensions. sions used in Whissell’s work. Importantly, these concepts were not defined, to avoid biasing the judgments. Volunteers were also encouraged to follow their first impression, and told that there were no ‘correct’ answers. Appendix A shows the actual login and instructions pages used in the study.","After reading the instructions, volunteers proceeded to judge two practice words, intended to help them get used to the task and the interface, followed by 20 target words. Words were presented one per page. Figure 3 shows a screenshot of the page for rating the word navegarverb. Note that the word class","6","http://www.recaptcha.net 23 Figure 3: Screenshot of the web page for rating a word. (verb in this example) is indicated right below the word. After completing the first batch of 20 words, volunteers were asked if they wanted to finish the study or do a second batch, and then a third, a fourth, and so on. This way, they were given the chance to do as many words as they felt comfortable with. If a volunteer left before completing a batch, his/her ratings so far were also recorded. 3.2 Volunteers 662 volunteers participated in the study, with a mean age of 33.3 (SD = 11.2). As to their level of education, 76% had completed a university degree, 23% had finished only secondary school, and 1% had completed only primary school. Only volunteers whose native language was Spanish were allowed to participate in the study. Each volunteer was assigned 20 words following this procedure: (1) The 175,413 words in the corpus were sorted by word count. (2) Words that had already received 5 or more ratings were excluded. (3) Words that had already been rated by a volunteer with the same month and year of birth were excluded, to prevent the same volunteer from rating twice the same word. (4) The top 20 words were selected.","Each volunteer rated 52.3 words on average (SD = 34.0). Roughly 30% completed 20 words or fewer; 24% completed 21-40 words; 18%, 41-60 words; and the remaining 28%, more than 60 words. 3.3 Descriptive statistics A total of 2566 words were rated by at least 5 volunteers. Words with fewer annotations were excluded from the study. We assigned each rating a numeric value from 1 to 3, as shown in Table 1. Table 2 shows some basic statistics for each of the three dimensions.","Mean SD Skewness Kurtosis Pleasantness 2.23 0.47 −0.47 −0.06 Activation 2.33 0.48 −0.28 −0.84 Imagery 2.55 0.42 −0.90 0.18 Table 2: Descriptive statistics for the three dimensions.","The five most pleasant words, according to the volunteers, were jugarverb, besonoun, sonrisanoun, compañı́anoun and reirverb (play, kiss, smile, company and laugh, respectively). The least pleasant ones were asesinatonoun, caroadj, ahogarverb, heridanoun and cigarronoun (murder, expensive, drown, wound and cigar).","Among the most active words appear ideanoun, publicarverb, violentoadj, sexualadj and talentonoun (idea, publish, violent, sexual and talent). Among the least active, we found yacerverb, espiritualadj, quietoadj, esperarverb and cadáveradj (lay, spiritual, still, wait and corpse).","The easiest to imagine include sucioadj, silencionoun, darverb, peznoun and pensarverb (dirty, silence, give, fish and think). Finally, the hardest to imagine include consistirverb, constarverb, morfologı́anoun, piedadnoun and tendencianoun (consist, consist, morphology, compassion and tendency).","We conducted Pearson’s correlation tests between the different dimensions. Table 3 shows the correlation matrix. Correlations among rating dimensions were very weak, which supports the assumption that pleasantness, activation and imagery are three independent affective dimensions. These numbers are very similar to the ones reported in Whissell’s work.","Pleasantness Activation Imagery Pleasantness 1.00 0.14 0.10 Activation 0.14 1.00 0.11 Imagery 0.10 0.11 1.00 Table 3: Correlation between the different dimensions","Next, we computed Cohen’s κ to measure the degree of agreement above chance between volunteers (Cohen, 1968).7","Given that we used a three-point scale for rating each affective dimension, we used 7","This measure of agreement above chance is interpreted as follows: 0 = None, 0 - 0.2 = Small, 0.2 - 0.4 = Fair, 0.4 - 0.6 = Moderate, 0.6 - 0.8 = Substantial, 0.8 - 1 = Almost perfect. 24 a weighted version of κ, thus taking into account the distance on that scale between disagreements. For example, the distance between pleasant and un-pleasant was 2, and the distance between pleasant and in-between was 1. We obtained a weighted κ measure of 0.42 for pleasantness, 0.30 for activation, and 0.14 for imagery. Considering that these were highly subjective rating tasks, the agreement levels for pleasantness and activation were quite high. The imagery task seemed somewhat more difficult, although we still observed some agreement above chance. These results indicate that our knowledge base managed to, at least partially, capture information regarding the three affective dimensions."]},{"title":"4 Evaluation","paragraphs":["Next we proceeded to evaluate the usefulness of our knowledge base. For this purpose, we developed a simple system for estimating affect along our three affective dimensions, and evaluated it on two different sentiment-analysis tasks. The first task consisted in a set of texts labeled by humans, and served to compare the judgments of human labelers with the predictions of our system. The second task consisted in classifying a set of user product reviews into ‘positive’ or ‘negative’ opinions, a common application for online stores. 4.1 Simple system for estimating affect We created a simple computer program for automatically estimating the degree of pleasantness, activation and imagery of an input text, based on the knowledge base described in the previous sections.","For each word in the knowledge base, we calculated its mean rating for each dimension. Subsequently, for an input text T we used Freeling to generate a full syntactic parsing, from which we extracted all ⟨word, word-class⟩ pairs in T . The system calculates the value for affective dimension d using the following procedure: score ← 0 count ← 0 for each word w in T (counting repetitions):","if w is included in KB:","score ← score + KBd(w)","count ← count + 1 return score/count where KB is our knowledge base, and KBd(w) is the value for w in KB for dimension d.","For example, given the sentence “Mi amiga esperaba terminar las pruebas a tiempo” (“My femalefriend was hoping to finish the tests on time”), and assuming our knowledge base contains the numbers shown in Table 4, the three values are computed as follows. First, all words are lemmatized (i.e., mi amigo esperar terminar el prueba a tiempo). Second, the mean of each dimension is calculated with the described procedure, yielding a pleasantness of 2.17, activation of 2.27 and imagery of 2.53. word word-class mean P mean A mean I amigo noun 3.0 2.4 3 esperar verb 1.2 1 2.8 poder verb 2.8 2.8 2.2 terminar verb 2.2 3 2.8 prueba noun 1.8 2.4 2.2 tiempo noun 2 2 2.2","mean: 2.17 2.27 2.53 Table 4: Knowledge base for the example text (P = pleasantness; A = activation; I = imagery).","It is important to mention that this system is just a proof of concept, motivated by the need to evaluate the effectiveness of our knowledge base. It could be used as a baseline system against which to compare more complex affect estimation systems. Also, if results are good enough with such a simple system, this would indicate that the information contained in the knowledge base is useful, and in the future it could help create more complex systems. 4.2 Evaluation #1: Emotion estimation The first evaluation task consisted in comparing predictions made by our simple system against ratings assigned by humans (our gold standard), on a number of sentences and paragraphs extracted from Wikipedia and Los Cuentos. 4.2.1 Gold standard","From each corpus we randomly selected 15 sentences with 10 or more words, and 5 paragraphs with at least 50 words and two sentences – i.e. 30 sentences and 10 paragraphs in total. These texts were subsequently rated by 5 volunteers (2 male, 3 female), who were instructed to rate each entire text (sentence or paragraph) for pleasantness, activation 25 and imagery using the same three-point scale shown in Table 1. The weighted κ measure for these ratings was 0.17 for pleasantness, 0.17 for activation and 0.22 for imagery. Consistent with the subjectivity of these tasks, the degree of inter-labeler agreement was rather low, yet still above chance level. Note also that for pleasantness and activation the agreement level was lower for texts than for individual words, while the opposite was true for imagery. 4.2.2 Results","To evaluate the performance of our system, we conducted Pearson’s correlation test for each affective dimension, in order to find the degree of correlation between the system’s predictions for the 40 texts and their corresponding mean human ratings. Table 5 shows the resulting ρ coefficients. System \\ GS Pleasantness Activation Imagery Pleasantness 0.59 * 0.15 * −0.18 * Activation 0.13 * 0.40 * 0.14 * Imagery 0.16 0.19 0.07 Table 5: Correlations between gold standard and system’s predictions. Statistically significant results are marked with ‘*’ (t-tests, p < 0.05).","The coefficient for pleasantness presented a high value at 0.59, which indicates that the system’s estimation of pleasantness was rather similar to the ratings given by humans. For activation the correlation was weaker, although still significant. On the other hand, for imagery this simple system did not seem able to successfully emulate human judgments.","These results suggest that, at least for pleasantness and activation, our knowledge base successfully captured useful information regarding how humans perceive those affective dimensions. For imagery, it is not clear whether the information base did not capture useful information, or the estimation system was too simplistic. 4.2.3 Effect of word count on performance","Next we studied the evolution of performance as a function of the knowledge base size, aiming at as-sessing the potential impact of increasing the number of words annotated by humans. Figure 4 summarizes the results of a simulation, in which successive systems were built and evaluated using the top 250, 350, 450, ..., 2350, 2450 and 2566 words in our knowledge base.","The green line (triangles) represents the mean coverage of the system’s knowledge base on the gold standard texts; the corresponding scale is shown on the right axis. Similarly to Figure 2, the coverage grew rapidly, starting at 18% when using 250 words to 44% when using all 2566 words.","The blue (circles), red (squares) and purple (diamonds) lines correspond to the correlations of the system’s predictions and the gold standard ratings for pleasantness, activation and imagery, respectively; the corresponding scale is shown on the left axis. The black lines are a logarithmic function fit to each of the three curves (ρ2","= 0.90, 0.72 and 0.68, respectively). Figure 4: Evolution of the correlation between system predictions and Gold Standard, with respect to the knowledge base size.","These results indicate that the system performance (measured as the correlation with human judgments) grew logarithmically with the number of words in the knowledge base. Interestingly, the performance grew at a slower pace than word coverage. In other words, an increase in the proportion of words in a text that were known by the system did not lead to a similar increase in the accuracy of the predictions. An explanation may be that, once an emotion had been established based on a percentage of words in the text, the addition of a few extra words did not significantly change the outcome.","In consequence, if we wanted to do a substantial improvement to our baseline system, it would probably not be a good idea to simply annotate more 26 words. Instead, it may be more effective to work on how the system uses the information contained in the knowledge base. 4.3 Evaluation #2: Classification of reviews The second evaluation task consisted in using our baseline system for classifying user product reviews into positive or negative opinions. 4.3.1 Corpus","For this task we used a corpus of 400 user reviews of products such as cars, hotels, dishwashers, books, cellphones, music, computers and movies, extracted from the Spanish website Ciao.es.8","This is the same corpus used by Brooke (2009), who employed sentiment analysis tools in English to score Spanish texts after performing machine translation.","On Ciao.es, users may enter their written reviews and associate a numeric score to them, ranging from 1 to 5 stars. For this evaluation task, we made the assumption that there was a strong relation between the written reviews and their corresponding numeric scores. Following this assumption, we tagged reviews with 1 or 2 stars as ‘negative’ opinions, and reviews with 4 or 5 stars as ‘positive’. Reviews with 3 stars were considered neutral, and ignored. 4.3.2 Results","We used our system in a very simple way for predicting the polarity of opinions. First we computed M , the mean pleasantness score on 80% of the reviews. Subsequently, for each review in the remaining 20%, if its pleasantness score was greater than M , then it was classified as ‘positive’; otherwise, it was classified as ‘negative’.","After repeating this procedure five times using 5-fold cross validation, the overall accuracy was 62.33%. Figure 5 shows the evolution of the system’s accuracy with respect to the number of words in the knowledge base. The green line (triangles) represents the mean coverage of the system’s knowledge base on user review texts; the corresponding scale is shown on the right axis. The blue line (circles) corresponds to the classification accuracy; the corresponding scale is shown on the left axis. The black line is a logarithmic function fit to this curve (ρ2","= 0.80).","8","http://ciao.es Figure 5: Evolution of the classification accuracy with respect to the size of the knowledge base.","Notably, with as few as 500 words the accuracy is already significantly above chance level, which is 50% for this task. This indicates that our knowledge base managed to capture information on pleasantness that may aid the automatic classification of positive and negative user reviews.","Also, similarly to our first evaluation task, we observe that the accuracy increased as more words were added to the knowledge base. However, it did so at a logarithmic pace slower than the growth of the word coverage on the user reviews. This suggests that adding more words labeled by humans to the knowledge base would only have a limited impact on the performance of this simple system."]},{"title":"5 Conclusion","paragraphs":["In this work we presented a knowledge base of Spanish words labeled by human volunteers for three affective dimensions – pleasantness, activation and imagery, inspired by the English DAL created by Whissell (1986; 1989). The annotations of these three dimensions were weakly intercorrelated, indicating a high level of independence of each other. Additionally, the agreement between volunteers was quite high, especially for pleasantness and activation, given the subjectivity of the labeling task.","To evaluate the usefulness of our lexicon, we built a simple emotion prediction system. When used for predicting the same three dimensions on new texts, its output significantly correlated with human judgments for pleasantness and activation, but the results 27 for imagery were not satisfactory. Also, when used for classifying the opinion polarity of user product reviews, the system managed to achieve an accuracy better than random. These results suggest that our knowledge base successfully captured useful information of human perception of, at least, pleasantness and activation. For imagery, either it failed to capture any significant information, or the system we created was too simple to exploit it accordingly.","Regarding the evolution of the system’s performance as a function of the size of the lexicon, the results were clear. When more words were included, the system performance increased only at a logarithmic pace. Thus, working on more complex systems seems to be more promising than adding more human-annotated words.","In summary, this work presented a knowledge base that may come handy to researchers and de-velopers of sentiment analysis tools in Spanish. Additionally, it may be useful for disciplines that need to select emotionally balanced word stimuli, such as Neuroscience or Psycholinguistics. In future work we will compare the usefulness of our manually annotated lexicon and cross-linguistic approaches (Brooke et al., 2009; Pérez-Rosas et al., 2012)."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This work was funded in part by ANPCYT PICT-2009-0026 and CONICET.
