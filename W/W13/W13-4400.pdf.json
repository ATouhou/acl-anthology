Sponsored by the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) Special Interest Group on Chinese Language Processing (SIGHAN), this year’s SIGHAN-7 workshop is being held in Nagoya, Japan, on October 14, 2013, and is co-located with IJCNLP 2013. The workshop program includes a keynote speech, research paper presentations and a Chinese Spelling Check Bake-off. We hope that these events will encourage the participation of researchers and bring them together to share ideas and developments in various aspects of Chinese language processing. We are honored to welcome as our distinguished speaker Dr. Keh-Jiann Chen (Research Fellow, Academia Sinica, Taiwan). Dr. Chen will be speaking on “Lexical Semantics of Chinese Language”. We would also like to thank Shih-Hung Wu, Chao-Lin Liu and Lung-Hao Lee for their great efforts in organizing the Chinese Spelling Check Bake-off which will feature seventeen teams from China, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan and United Kingdom, and is expected to further the development of more accurate Chinese spelling checkers. Finally, we would like to thank all authors for their submissions. We appreciate your active participation and support to ensure a smooth and successful conference. The publication of these papers represents the joint effort of many researchers, and we are grateful to the efforts of the review committee for their work, and to the SIGHAN committee for their continuing support. We wish all a rewarding and eye-opening time at the workshop.
