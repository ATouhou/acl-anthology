In spite of several studies devoted to the subject, the tendencies that govern the disposition of words and constituents in the sentence still lack a comprehensive explanation. Strictly connected to the word-order issue is the relevant amount of discontinuous constituents, which even casual readers of AG texts can experience1",".","The dependency-based treebanks of Classical languages (AG and Latin) that have been recently made available enable us to reconsider this long debate in the light of the abundant work on non-projective structures in dependency trees. Non-projectivity (see 2 for a formal definition) is a","1","On AG word-order see more recently Dik (1995; 2007), with bibliography of previous studies. On discontinuous structures see Devine and Stephens (2000). key issue in dependency grammar, both from the formal point of view and from a more descriptive linguistic perspective. From the standpoint of natural language processing, non-projectivity is also known to affect the efficiency of dependency parsers.","In a first attempt to improve parsing performances on AG, Mambrini and Passarotti (2012) reported that the amount of non-projective arcs occurring in the available treebanks of Classical languages is significantly higher than that attested in the corpora of modern languages used for CoNLL-X (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006, 155, tab. 1) and CoNLL 2007 shared tasks (Nivre et al., 2007, 920, tab. 1). Furthermore, the non-projective rate in the Ancient Greek Dependency Treebank is higher than in Classical and Medieval Latin (Passarotti and Ruffolo, 2010, 920, tab. 1).","In this paper, we want to discuss this claim in depth and substantiate it by applying to AG data the standard metrics for the different kinds of non-projective constructions established in the literature.","The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a definition of the formal constraints considered and of the metrics that will be used: non-projectivity, planarity, well-nestedness, on the one hand, and gap-degree and edge-degree on the other. Section 3 introduces the corpus that will be tested, the Ancient Greek Dependency Treebank (AGDT).","Section 4 presents the evidence provided by the data. In 4.1 we report the results for the different constraints and metrics defined in section 2. Results for the distribution of non-projectivity in the different genres of the corpus are given and commented in 4.2.","In section 5, we discuss some of the linguistic issues that cause non-projectivity. Finally, section 6 reports our conclusions and sketches possible directions for additional research."]},{"title":"177 2 Non-projectivity","paragraphs":["A dependency tree is a rooted tree where the nodes represent the words of a sentence, the edges represent the syntactic dependencies and the linear order of the nodes stands for the sequence of words.","According to the so-called ‘treeness constraint’ (Debusmann and Kuhlmann, 2010), a dependency tree requires (a) that no word should depend on itself, not even transitively (i.e. the tree must be acyclic), (b) that each word should have at most one governor, and (c) that a dependency analysis should cover all the words in the sentence.","If a node j depends on a node i, j is called a ‘child’ of i, and, symmetrically, i is the ‘parent’ of j (we write i → j). On the other hand, we write i ↔ j whenever the edge is considered regardless of the direction of the relation (i can be either the parent or the child of j). If i precedes j in the word order, i lies to the left of j (we write i < j); conversely, j lies to the right of i (j > i). The set of all nodes that can be reached from a given node i by following a directed path of zero or more edges is called the set of ‘descendants’ of i. A subtree of a tree T at a node i is the restriction of T (nodes and edges) to the descendants of i.","The condition of projectivity, which was for-mally defined by Marcus (1965), requires each dependency subtree to cover a contiguous region of the sentence: a word and its transitive dependents must span a contiguous sequence in the linear order. We may define the constraint of projectivity with the following formula (Havelka, 2007, 609): i → j & v ∈ (i, j) =⇒ v ∈ Subtreei","which must be read in this way: let i be the parent of j (i → j); if a node v lies between i and j in the linear order of the sentence, then v be-longs to the subtree of i. If this condition does not hold, then the edge is non-projective and v is said to be in a gap (v ∈ Gapi↔j). Example 1 illustrates this construction with a simplified version of a sentence from the AGDT (the first sentence of the Iliad), which is also represented in fig. 12",". The edges mēnin-Achilēos and mēnin-ouloménēn are non-projective, since the nodes of áeide and theá are in a gap in both cases.","2","The Greek words and lemmata in the AGDT are written in Greek characters, transcribed according to an ASCII-based convention known as “Beta Code” (TLG, 2010). All the trees reported in this paper are transliterated in Latin script by the authors for ease of reading.

Several relaxations to the definition were subsequently introduced in order to better account for the linguistic data.","The condition of planarity involves two edges i1 ↔ j1 and i2 ↔ j2 and disallows any overlapping between them. Two edges are said to overlap if, for example, i1 > i2 > j1 > j2 or i1 < i2 < j1 < j2. Therefore, following Havelka (2007), a tree is non-planar if there are at least two edges i1 ↔ j1 and i2 ↔ j2 that meet the following condition: i1 ∈ (i2, j2) & i2 ∈ (i1, j1)","Example 2 (fig. 2) presents two non-planar edges from a tree of the AGDT.","(2) mýri’ countless.NEUT.PL Achaióis to-Achaeans.DAT álge’ grieves.NEUT.PL","éthēke","(it)-caused.3rd.SG (which) inflicted countless grieves to the Achaeans (Iliad 1.2)"]},{"title":"178","paragraphs":["Figure 2: Non-planar (well-nested) edges","In the tree reported in fig. 2, the edges éthēke → Achaióis and álge’ → mýri’ are non-planar, be-cause éthēke > álge’ > Achaióis > mýri’.","Well-nestedness introduces a further relaxation to projectivity. A (sub)tree is said to be well-nested if, for each pair of overlapping disjoint edges, the source node of one of the edges is a descendant of the source node of the other; conversely (Havelka, 2007), the (sub)tree is ill-nested if, for two edges i1 ↔ j1 and i2 ↔ j2: i1 ∈ Gapi2↔j2 & i2 ∈ Gapi1↔j1","One may note that the two edges in fig. 2 are well-nested, since álge’ is the child of éthēke.","In addition to these constraints, two metrics have become standard measures for non-projectivity.","Given a non-projective edge, edge-degree represents the number of nodes that are in the gap. This metric was introduced by Nivre (2006), but was named edge-degree by Kuhlmann and Nivre (2006) and it corresponds to component degree in Havelka (2007). The edge-degree can be estimated either by counting the edges that match the definition in a treebank, or by using the tree as a basis, the edge-degree of a tree T being equal to the highest edge-degree among the edges of T .","On the contrary, gap-degree is not based on a single edge, but rather on the ‘projection’ (or on the ‘blocks’) of a node, which is defined as the longest non-empty sequence of nodes that goes down to a terminal node in a chain succession from father to child3",".

It is important, therefore, to observe if the values reported above are at variance in the different genres included in the AGDT.","The frequencies of non-projective constructions in each of the three genres of the AGDT are reported in table 5. The most relevant fact is the difference between the poetic genres (epic and drama) on the one hand, and the philosophical dialogue in prose on the other. This difference can be appreciated especially when one looks at the rate on non-projective edges, which does not vary significantly between epic and drama (respectively, 15.30% and 15.09%), but it is quite different if prose is concerned (9.81%). Plato’s Euthyphro (the sole prose work included in the corpus at the","10","The maximum edge-degree found in the AGDT is the abnormal value of 45, which however results from an annotation error. moment) is the only text where the number of non-projective trees is less than 50%, although the incidence of non-projectivity is still sensibly higher than in corpora of modern languages, as reported above.","These distributions may lead to the claim that the high number of discontinuous constituents is due to poetic style and, possibly, to the metrical constraints that operate in poetic language11",". Unfortunately, no conclusions can be drawn on this matter. Limited as they are to one single author and text, the presently available data for prose language can hardly point to more than a working hypothesis for future research. It will be possible to test this hypothesis as soon as new texts of the same genre and/or author will be added to the corpus."]},{"title":"5 Discussion: linguistic causes of non-projective edges in the AGDT","paragraphs":["In this section we discuss some of the linguistic causes of non-projective edges in the AGDT.

It is well known that in AG clitics tend to stick to a fixed position in the sentence or clause, in accordance to the so-called “Wackernagel’s law”, which is common to many Indo-European languages (Wackernagel, 1892; Ruijgh, 1990). The words that belong to the class of postpositives (i.e. the clitics and a few other words that cannot occupy the clause-initial position) tend to be placed in second position, even when this collocation breaks a syntactic constituent. In example 4, the coordinating particle d’ (dé) is placed in second position and separates one of the two (non-coordinated) attributes (pollás) from the rest of the noun phrase (iphthı́mous psychás).","(4) pollás many.ACC.FEM d’ and iphthı́mous strong.ACC.FEM psychás souls.ACC.FEM Háidi to-Hades","proı́apsen","(it)-sent","and (it) sent forth to Hades many valiant","souls (Iliad 1.1)","This situation is normal also with the enclitic te (and, = Latin -que), which is regularly placed after the first word of coordinated clauses.

Figure 4: Iliad 1.53-4 Verb-headed edges: in the non-projective structures of the AGDT, verbal complementations precedes their verbal head in the 67.93% of the cases. Both arguments (subjects, predicatives and direct/indirect objects) and adjuncts (several kinds of adverbial modifications) are very frequently in-volved in such a movement of the complements to the left, which often results in non-projective constructions.","In Czech, this situation is produced notably by contrastive contextually bound elements moved towards the beginning of the clause. As the AGDT does not feature annotation of information structure yet, it is not easy for us to evaluate its quantitative impact in data, but a reading of the examples that can be extracted from the treebank suggests that the same tendency is at work also in AG14",".","In the two coordinated clauses of example 5 (fig. 4), for instance, the temporal complemen-","13","The value of this observation is very limited.

The importance of this pattern can be seen by measuring the distribution of verbal mood in the non-projective arcs. Indicative dominates in general (75% vs 14% of infintives), but if one considers the subset of cases with complement–head order and with a gap wider than one single clitic, then the rate of infinitives increases considerably (50% vs 42% of indicatives).","(5) ennēmar for-nine-days mén on-the-one-hand aná throughout stratón camp ōicheto went kēla arrows théoio, of-the-god, tēi (on-)the dekátēi tenth d’ while agorēnde to-assembly kaléssato called laón army","Achilléus","Achilles For nine days the arrows of the god swept throughout the camp; on the tenth, Achilles called the army to the assembly (Iliad 1.53-4)","(6) hoi they mén on-the-one-hand epépleon sailed-over hygrá watery kéleutha, paths, laoús men.ACC d’ while Atreı́dēs son-of-Atreus.NOM apolymáinesthai to-purify.INF.REFL ánōgen commanded So they sailed over the watery paths, while the son of Atreus commanded the men to purify themselves (Iliad 1.312-2, slightly simplified)","Example 6 (fig. 5) shows a combination of the two aforementioned phenomena: laoús, subject of the infinitiveapolymáinesthai, is moved to the left of the main verb of the clause, outside the subordinate governed by the infinitive.

The AGDT stands out for the relevant amount of both non-projective trees and edges, which are unmatched by the rate of discontinuous structures known from dependency treebanks of other languages and for the complexity of these constructions.","The edge-degree and gap-degree measures of non-projective trees from the AGDT are equally unmatched. In particular, the non-neglectable rates of trees with gap-degree ≥ 2 (which include more than 6% of the sentences in the AGDT) contradicts the assumptions that were inferable from other languages. On the other hand, in spite of these peculiarities, AG data confirm other conclusions that were drawn in previous literature, especially about the efficacy of the well-nestedness constraint.","The peculiar nature of these results may partially depend on the genres represented in the corpus, more than 98% of which is taken from poetic texts. The only prose work that is included in the collection shows a lesser degree of non-projective trees and edges, without conforming, however, to the rates known from other languages.","We have also isolated a number of specific constructions and we have tried to highlight some linguistic factors that can bring about syntactic discontinuity. Section 5 does not want to be an exhaustive classification of the linguistic aspects that stand behind non-projectivity: further work is required. Especially, on account of the well known influence of topic-focus articulation on AG word-order, this research would greatly benefit from the interaction of layers of syntax, pragmatics and information structure in annotated data."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["David Bamman, Francesco Mambrini, and Gregory Crane. 2009.
