Writing well in English is a challenge for non-native English speakers. When readers are unable to comprehend what they read they just give up reading and fail to get to the content. In this paper we describe problems encountered in the English writing of scientific abstracts by Brazilian Portuguese speakers. We collected and analyzed a corpus of 115 abstracts in which we identified specific language-related errors that affect comprehension. We show that students who must write scientific papers may benefit significantly with practice exercises, and computer-based tools. The use of such tools can enhance the students’ level of confidence and thus enable them to improve their writing."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["Academic researchers anywhere in the world must publish in English. However, their ability to produce well-written documents that get published is hindered by their linguistic capabilities. Researchers at Núcleo Interinstitucional de Linguística Computacional (NILC) have studied scientific writing over the last 20 years [Fontana et al. 1993; Aluísio and Oliveira 1995; Aluísio et al. 2001; 2005; Schuster et al. 2005; Dayrell et al. 2012]. They have developed techniques and software tools to assist novice researchers with their writing. Still, many students fail to publish their research findings because the grammatical and lexical errors in their writing interfere with their ability to convey their message clearly. Writing well is a pervasive problem among non-native speakers of English and several researchers [Han et al. 2006; Genoves et al. 2007; Lee 2009; Umezawa et al. 2013] have focused on this problem. This paper describes specific problem areas that can help students improve their writing. Section 2 describes our corpus-based approach. Section 3 discusses what we have learned from this analysis; we can turn these into teaching strategies to help writers."]},{"title":"2. Methods and materials: A Corpus-based Approach","paragraphs":["We collected 115 abstracts from students enrolled in five graduate scientific writing courses at several universities in Brazil, beginning in 2004 1 . Students came from various","disciplines, including pharmacy, chemistry, biology/genetics, physics, and computer  1 This corpus is available if asked for. Names of students were not included in order to preserve anonymity. 179 science. As part of the course’s requirements, the students had to write a research paper. The abstracts were collected from these final papers. 2.1 Tagging Errors A native English speaker who is a linguist and teaches English as a Second Language tagged 23 error categories in each abstract. The errors were organized into three groups: (1) mechanical, e.g., the use of punctuation (tagged as P), capitalization (CAP), and spelling (SP); (2) lexical; and (3) syntactic. Lexical use included word use errors (WU), the incorrect use of a word to express an intended meaning, such as “Mutants were availed” instead of “Mutants were used”; word use collocation errors (WUCol), the incorrect use of lexical items in idioms and common collocations, such as depend of instead of depend on; and word form errors (WF), the incorrect use of common word forms, such as this/these, that/those. Categories for syntactic accuracy included those dealing with article use (ART-, ART+, ART), word order (WO_NP, WO_ADJ, WO_S, WO), Subject-Verb-Object structure of the clause (S+VO, S-VO, SV-O), part-of-speech (POS), verb use (VU, VF, SVA), and the use of singular/plural in nouns and adjectives (S/PL, S/PL_ADJ). At times, abstract writers incorrectly used a Portuguese word or the Portuguese spelling of a technical term (PORT). These 23 categories comprehensively covered all the errors we found. Six error categories (WU, ART-, P, SP, WUCol, ART+) accounted for 66% of all errors. The distribution (Rank, Error, Count, Percent) was: 1, WU, 497, 25.8%; 2, ART-, 258, 13.4%; 3, P, 165, 8.6%; 4, SP, 147, 7.6%; 5, WUCol, 109, 5.7%; 6, ART+, 95, 4.9%. Total: 1271 errors, 66.0%."]},{"title":"3. Discussion: What can the results teach us?","paragraphs":["Here, we focus on errors related to lexical use (WU and WUCol) and those involving the incorrect use of articles (ART- and ART+). We discuss our results and suggest ways to correct writers’ errors. 3.1 Word-Use errors (WU) These errors result when an incorrect word is used. For example, let us compare the use of “amount” and “number” when describing a sequence of multiple steps called “alignments.” Since the number of steps is countable, the correct phrase would be “The number of alignments.” However, very often we encounter the incorrect use of “*The amount of alignments.”","2","On the other hand, the correct form, “the amount of information” (which cannot be counted) is often confused by non-native English speakers with the twice incorrect countable form, “*the number of informations.” Another common error is “*many researches,” which is a direct (but incorrect) translation from the Portuguese equivalent of “many papers.” Research cannot be counted, but papers can be. 3.2 Word Use-collocation errors (WUCol) Collocations are strings of words that go together. Many times, students use wrong word combinations. For example, they may use the wrong preposition such as: “* The search of genes responsible...” rather than “The search for genes responsible...”  2 Here we use the “*” as standard convention to mark an ungrammatical sentence. 180 3.3 Article errors (ART-, ART+) We have identified sentences in which the lack of an article (the words “the”, “a”) (ART-) interferes with the ability of the reader to understand the text and thus the content of the paper. For example: “* Pollen is Ø male gamete of higher plants...” instead of “Pollen is the male gamete of higher plants...” Our writers, however, generally tended to include an article where it should not be present (ART+). One Portuguese writer included a superfluous article, which introduced ambiguity in the text: “In this paper, we write about the protein. We discuss how the bacteria grows and we discover how the protein has ...” If specific protein or bacteria have not been mentioned beforehand, one correct form would be: “In this paper, we write about proteins. We discuss how bacteria grow and we discover how the proteins have ...” The definite and indefinite use of articles depend on several factors: (1) countability of the modified noun, (2) generality of the referent, (3) definiteness of the referent, and (4) possible previous mention of the referent. 3.3.1 Countable and General If the noun is countable and meant to refer to a general category, the most common choice is the plural noun without any article. For example, instead of “*The computer is equipment that can improve the math learning of *the students.” (first sentence in abstract), the correct sentence would not include the articles: “Computers are pieces of equipment that can improve math learning for students.” Computers and students are described in general but none of them have been specifically referred to before. 3.3.2 Uncountable and General If the noun is not countable and meant to refer to a general description, the most common choice is the singular noun without any article. For example, “Alcohol electrooxidation is a theme ... studied in electrocatalysis.” does not include the article as in “*The alcohol electrooxidation is a theme ... studied in the electrocatalysis.” The sentence refers to a process in general and not to a particular instance of its use. One explanation for finding so many (ART+) errors is that Romance languages tend to use the definite article in this case in which English does not. 3.3.3 Countable/Uncountable, Specific and Indefinite If there is a specific but indefinite reference for a noun and the noun is countable, the most common choice is the article “a”/”an”. For instance, “This work shows the necessity for a hole injection layer.” is the correct sentence instead of “*This work shows the necessity for Ø hole injection layer.” There is a specific instance of “a hole injection layer” mentioned for the first time, but it is not referring back to a particular one. If the noun is uncountable, no article is used, as in “Our results show the necessity for Ø further research on this topic.” 3.3.4 Countable/Uncountable, Specific and Definite: Anaphoric Use If specific reference to an instance(s) of a noun has been made using an indefinite article a/an/plural for countable nouns or nothing for uncountable nouns, the referent of that noun can be “pointed to” using the definite article the. For example (uncountable): “This work uses egg white ...to verify ... The egg white (anaphoric use) underwent two heating 181 rates.” instead of “This work uses egg white ...to verify ... * Ø Egg white underwent two heating rates.” This example (countable) includes the article, “A total of ... tests were conducted...The results of the tests indicated that ...” compared to the original with the missing article “*A total of ... tests were conducted...The results of Ø tests indicated that ...” This is called the “second mention” use of the definite article, or anaphoric use of the definite article. It can be explained as pointing backwards to the indefinite use of the noun. 3.3.5 Extension of Anaphoric Use of Definite Article If the referent of a noun has been introduced into the discourse, any part or process associated with the referent can be pointed to with the definite article, as in “We investigated the ... using an experiment that...The results demonstrated ...” 3.3.6 Cataphoric Use When both the referent and its associated part or process can be introduced within the same noun phrase (NP), this is called a cataphoric use. The definite noun indicating the part or process can occur before the noun that introduces the whole into the discourse. For example, an abstract could begin with “The results of an experiment testing ... demonstrated that ...” where the results are part of the experiment, first mentioned in an experiment. The article “the” in “the results” points forward to an experiment. The lack of cataphoric reference use with definite articles was so noticeable in our data that we find it necessary to teach the specifics of their use."]},{"title":"4. Concluding Remarks","paragraphs":["We have identified errors that can be taught to improve writing quality and readability. Computer-based tools are very useful. Errors related to lexical use (WU and WUCol) can be reduced by consulting the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA)3",". For example, no matching records are found for “*the number of information”. Students could search for a noun to replace “number” while keeping the intended meaning. A total of 171 instances are displayed for “the amount of information”; clearly, “amount” is the best choice. COCA can also help choose the right preposition. For example, we found 31 instances of “the search of”. In most cases, “of” is followed by a noun that indicates either data (major databases, the literature, records), location (the house, his computer, student luggage) or the agent performing the action (the Federal Police). Querying “what preposition follows ‘the search’?”, “for” yields 1,100 hits. The examples show that “the search for” is followed by a noun that refers to whatever you are looking for. Han [Han et al. 2006] and Genoves [Genoves et al. 2007] implemented machine-learning systems that automatically detect English article usage errors. Unfortunately, these are not yet available to users. We hope to make them available within our writing tools soon. We also plan to assess quality improvements in students’ writing after their using corpus-based tools such as COCA.  3 COCA is a 450-­‐million word corpus and includes academic texts, fiction, spoken language, popular magazines, and","newspapers.
