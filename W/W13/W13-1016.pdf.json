They also have interesting morphological properties and for all these reasons, they are important, but challenging for Natural Language Processing (NLP). Recent advances show that taking MWEs into account can improve NLP tasks such as dependency parsing (Nivre and Nilsson, 2004; Eryiğit et al., 2011), constituency parsing (Arun and Keller, 2005), text generation (Hogan et al., 2007), or machine translation (Carpuat and Diab, 2010).","The Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT) of Czech and the associated lexicon of MWEs Sem-Lex1","offer a unique opportunity for experimentation","1","http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/lexemann/mwe/semlex.zip with MWEs. In this paper, we focus on identification of their syntactic structures in the treebank using various levels of linguistic analysis and matching algorithms.2","We compare approaches operating on manually and automatically annotated data with various depth of annotation from two sources: the Prague Dependency Treebank and Czech National Corpus (CNC).","The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 describes the state of the art of in acquisition and identification of MWEs. Section 3 explains what we consider a MWE. In Section 4 we describe the data used for our experiments. Section 5 gives the details of our experiments, and in Section 6 we analyse and discuss the results. Conclusions from the analysis are drawn in Section 7."]},{"title":"2 Processing of Multiword Expressions and Related Work","paragraphs":["Automatic processing of multiword expressions includes two distinct (but interlinked) tasks. Most of the effort has been put into acquisition of MWEs appearing in a particular text corpus into a lexicon of MWEs (types) not necessarily linked with their occurrences (instances) in the text. The bestperforming methods are usually based on lexical association measures that exploit statistical evidence of word occurrences and co-occurrences acquired from a corpus to determine degree of lexical association between words (Pecina, 2005). Expressions that consist of words with high association are then","2","We do not aim at disambiguating the occurrences as figurative or literal. We have not observed enough literal uses to substantiate working on this step. There are bigger improvements to be gained from better identification of syntactic occurrences. 106 denoted as MWEs. Most of the current approaches are limited to bigrams despite the fact that higher-order MWEs are quite common.","The task of identification of MWE occurrences expects a list of MWEs as the input and identifies their occurrences (instances) in a corpus. This may seem to be a trivial problem. However, the complex nature of this phenomenon gives rise to problems on all linguistic levels of analysis: morphology, syntax, and semantics.","In morphologically complex languages, a single MWE can appear in a number of morphological variants, which differ in forms of their individual components; and at the same time, a sequence of words whose base forms match with base forms of components of a given MWE do not necessarily represent an instance of this MWE (Pracoval dnem i nocı́ / He’s been working day and night vs. Ti dva byli jako den a noc / Those two were as day and night).","MWEs differ in the level of syntactic fixedness. On the one hand, certain MWEs can be modified by inserting words in between their components or by changing word order. Such expressions can only be identified by matching their syntactic structures, but only if a reliable syntactic information is available in both the lexion and text (Po převratu padaly hlavy / After the coup, heads were rolling vs. Hlavy zkorumpovaných náměstků budou padat jedna za druhou / One head of a corrupt deputy will be rolling after the other). On the other hand, some MWEs can appear only as fixed expressions with no modifications allowed. In that case, the syntactic matching approach can miss-indicate their instances because of an inserted word or altered word order (Vyššı́ společnost / High society vs. *Vyššı́ bohatšı́ společnost / High rich society).","From the semantic point of view, MWEs are often characterized by more or less non-compositional (figurative) meaning. Their components, however, can also occur with the same syntax but compositional (literal) semantics, and therefore not acting as MWEs (Jedinou branku dal až v poslednı́ minutě zápasu / He scored his only goal in the last minute of the match. vs. Rozhodčı́ dal branku zpět na své mı́sto / The referee put a goal back to its place).","Automatic discrimination between figurative and literal meaning is a challenging task similar to word sense disambiguation which has been studied extensively: Katz and Giesbrecht (2006), Cook et al. (2007), Hashimoto and Kawahara (2008), Li and Sporleder (2009), and Fothergill and Baldwin (2011). Seretan (2010) includes MWE identification (based on a lexicon) in a syntactic parser and reports an improvement of parsing quality. As a by-product, the parser identified occurrences of MWEs from a lexicon. Similarly, Green et al. (2013) embed identification of some MWEs in a Tree Substitution Grammar and achieve improvement both in parsing quality and MWE identification effectiveness. None of these works, however, attempt to identify all MWEs, regardless their length or complexity, which is the main goal of this paper."]},{"title":"3 Definition of Multiword Expressions","paragraphs":["We can use the rough definition of MWEs put for-ward by Sag et al. (2002): “idiosyncratic interpretations that cross word boundaries (or spaces)”. We can also start from their – or Bauer’s (1983) – basic classification of MWEs as lexicalised or institutionalised phrases, where lexicalised phrases include some syntactic, semantic or lexical (i.e. word form) element, that is idiosyncratic. Institutionalised phrases are syntactically and semantically compositional, but still require a particular lexical choice, e.g. disallowing synonyms (mobile phone, but not *movable phone).","We need to make just one small adjustment to the above: “phrase” above must be understood as a sub-tree, i.e. it can have holes in the surface sentence, but not in terms of a dependency tree.","In reality there is no clear boundary, in particular between the institutional phrases and other collocations. Like many other traditional linguistic categories, cf. Manning (2003), this phenomenon seems to be more continuous than categorial.","For the purpose of this paper, however, it is not important at all. We simply try to find all instances of the expressions (subtrees) from a lexicon in a text, whatever form the expression may take in a sentence."]},{"title":"4 Data","paragraphs":["In this work we use two datasets: Czech National Corpus (CNC), version SYN2006-PUB, and the 107 Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT), version 2.5.

A sentence at the analytical layer is represented as a rooted ordered tree with labelled nodes. The dependency relation between two nodes is captured by an edge with a functional label.

In many languages including Czech it often contains word forms in other than the basic form for the given word on its own. E.g. “vysok é učenı́” contains a neuter suffix of the adjective “vysoký” (high) because of the required agreement in gender with the noun, whereas the traditional lemma of adjectives in Czech is in the masculine form.","LEMMATIZED – “Lemmatised BASIC FORM”, i.e. take the basic form of an entry and substitute each form with its morphological lemma. This attribute is used for the identification of MWEs on the morphological layer.

Given the annotated occurrences of MWEs in the t-layer and links from t-layer to a-layer, the extraction is straightforward. Since one tectogrammatical TS can correspond to several analytical TSs that contain auxiliaries and use morphological lemmas, we add a list of a-layer TSs with their frequency in data to each SemLex entry (MWE). In reality the difference between t-layer and a-layer is unfortunately not as big as one could expect. Lemmas of t-nodes still often include even minute morphological variants, which goes against the vision of tectogrammatics, as described in Sgall et al. (1986).7","Our methods would benefit from more unified t-lemmas, see also Section 6.2."]},{"title":"5 Methodology of Experiments","paragraphs":["SemLex – with its almost 8,000 types of MWEs and their 22,000 instances identified in PDT – allows us to measure accuracy of MWE identification on various layers, since it is linked with the different layers of PDT 2.5. In this section, we present the method for identification of MWEs on t-layer in comparison with identification on a-layer and m-layer. The","7","These variants are unified in FGD theory, but time consum-ing to annotate in practice. Therefore, this aspect was left out from the current version of PDT.","8","Indeed, there are expressions that are multiword, but “single-node”. E.g.: the preposition in bez váhánı́ (without hesitation) does not have its own node on t-layer; the phrase na správnou mı́ru (lit.: into correct scale) is already annotated as one phrasal node in PDT with the lemma “na správnou mı́ru”; the verbal expression umět si představit (can imagine) has again only one node for reflexive verb “p ředstavit si” plus an attribute for the ability (representing “um ět” as explained in Section 4.1). 109 idea of using tectogrammatical TS for identification is that with a proper tectogrammatical layer (as it is proposed in FGD, i.e. with correct lemmatisation, added nodes in place of ellipses, etc.), this approach should have the highest Precision.","Our approach to identification of MWEs in this work is purely syntactic. We simply try to find MWEs from a lexicon in any form they may take (including partial ellipses in coordination, etc.). We do not try to exploit semantics, instead we want to put a solid baseline for future work which may do so, as mentioned in Section 2. 5.1 MWE Identification on t-layer We assume that each occurrence of a given MWE has the same t-lemmas and the same t-layer structure anywhere in the text. During the manual con-struction of SemLex, these tectogrammatical “tree structures” (TSs) were extracted from PDT 2.5 and inserted into the lexicon. In general this approach works fine and for majority of MWEs only one TS was obtained. For the MWEs with more than one TS in data we used the most frequent one. These cases are due to some problems of t-layer, not deficiencies of the theoretical approach. See section 6.2 for the discussion of the problems.","These TSs are taken one by one and we try to find them in the tectogrammatical structures of the input sentences. Input files are processed in parallel. The criteria for matching are so far only t-lemmas and topology of the subtree.9","Comparison of tree structures is done from the deepest node and we consider only perfect matches of structure and t-lemmata. 5.2 MWE Identification on a-layer and m-layer We use identification of MWE occurrences on a-layer and m-layer mainly for comparison with our approach based on the t-layer.","9","It is not sufficient, though. Auxiliary words that are ignored on t-layer are occasionally necessary for distinguishing MWE from similar group of nodes. (E.g. “v tomto sm ěru” (“in this regard”) is an MWE whereas “o tomto sm ěru” (“about this direction”) is not.) There are also attributes in t-layer that are—although rarely—important for distinguishing the meaning. (E.g. words typeset in bold in “Leonardo dal svým gólem signál.” (“Leonardo signalled by his goal.” ) compose exactly the same structure as in “Leonardo dal gól.” (“Leonardo scored a goal.”). I.e., the dependency relation is “ dal governs gól” in both cases. The difference is in the dependency function of gól: it is either MEANS or DIRECT OBJECT (CPHR).)","We enhance SemLex with a-tree structures as explained in Section 4.4, and then a-layer is processed in the same manner as t-layer: analytical TS is taken from the SemLex and the algorithm tries to match it to all a-trees. Again, if more than one TS is offered in lexicon, only the most frequent one is used for searching.","MWE identification on the m-layer is based on matching lemmas (which is the only morphological information we use). The process is parametrised by a width of a window which restricts the maximum distance (in a sentence) of MWE components to span (irrespective of their order) measured in the surface word order. However, in the setting which does not miss any MWE in a sentence (100% Recall), this parameter is set to the whole sentence and the maximum distance is not restricted at all.","The algorithm processes each sentence at a time, and tries to find all lemmas the MWE consists of, running in a cycle over all MWEs in SemLex. This method naturally over-generates – it correctly finds all MWEs that have all their words present in the surface sentence with correct lemmatisation (high Recall), but it also marks words as parts of some MWE even if they appear at the opposite ends of the sentence by complete coincidence (false positives, low Precision).","In other experiments, the window width varies from two to ten and MWE is searched for within a limited context. 5.3 Automatic Analysis of Data Sets The three MWE identification methods are applied on three corpora:","• manually annotated PDT: This is the same data, from which the lexicon was created. Results evaluated on the same data can be seen only as numbers representing the maximum that can be obtained.","• automatically annotated PDT: These are the same texts (PDT), but their analysis (morphological, analytical as well as tectogrammatical) started from scratch. Results can be still biased – first, there are no new lexemes that did not appear during annotation (that is as if we had a complete lexicon); second, it should be evaluated only on eval part of the data – see discussion in Section 6.1.","• automatically annotated CNC: Automatic analysis from scratch on different sentences.

Thus the third column in Table 2 represents evaluation on a much smaller data set.

The reasons need to be analysed in more detail. Our hypotheses are:","• M-layer identification reaches the same results on both data. It is caused by the fact that the accuracy of morphological tagging is comparable to manual morphological annotation: 95.68% (Spoustová, 2008).","• Both a- and t-parsers have problems mostly in complex constructions such as coordinations, that very rarely appear inside MWEs.","There are generally two issues that hurt our accuracy and that we want to improve to get better results. First, better data can help. Second, the method can always be improved. In our case, all data are annotated—we do nothing on plain text—and it can be expected that with a better parser, but also possibly a better manual annotation we can do better, too. The room for improvement is bigger as we go deeper into the syntax: data are not perfect on the a-layer (both automatically parsed and gold data) and on the significantly more complex t-layer it gets even worse. By contrast, the complexity of methods and therefore possible improvements go in the opposite direction. The complexity of tectogrammatic annotation results in a tree with rich, complex attributes of t-nodes, but simple topology and generalised lemmas. Since we only use tree topology and lemmas, the t-layer method can be really simple. It is slightly more complex on the a-layer (with auxiliary nodes, for example); and finally on the m-layer there is virtually unlimited space for experiments and a lot of literature on that problem. As we can see, these two issues (improving data and improving the method) complement each other with changing ratio on individual layers.","It is not quite clear from Table 2 that MWE identification should be done on the t-layer, because it is currently far from our ideal. It is also not clear that it should be done on the m-layer, because it seems that the syntax is necessary for this task. 6.2 Error Analysis and Possible Improvements There are several reasons, why the t-layer results are not clearly better:","1. our representation of tree structures proved a bit too simple,","2. there are some deficiencies in the current t-layer parser, and","3. t-layer in PDT has some limitations relative to the ideal tectogrammatical layer.","Ad 1. We thought the current SemLex implementation of simple tree structures would be sufficient for our purpose, but it is clear now that it is too simple and results in ambiguities. At least auxiliary words and some further syntactico-semantic information (such as tectogrammatical functions) should be added to all nodes in these TSs.","Ad 2. Current tectogrammatical parser does not do several things we would like to use. E.g. it cannot 112 properly generate t-nodes for elided parts of coordinated MWEs that we need in order to have the same TS of all MWE occurrences (see below).","Ad 3. The total of 771 out of 8,816 SemLex entries, i.e. 8.75%, have been used with more than one tectogrammatical tree structure in the PDT 2.5. That argues against our hypothesis (stated in Section 5.1) and cause false negatives in the output, since we currently search for only one TS. In this part we analyze two of the most important sources of these inconsistent t-trees and possible improvements:","• Gender opposites, diminutives and lemma variations. These are currently represented by variations of t-lemma. We believe that they should rather be represented by attributes of t-nodes that could be roughly equivalent to some of the lexical functions in the Meaning-text theory (see Mel’čuk (1996)). This should be tackled in some future version of PDT. Once resolved it would allow us to identify following (and many similar) cases automatically.","– obchodnı́ ředitel vs. obchodnı́ ředitelka","(lit.: managing director-man vs. managing","director-woman)","– rodinný dům vs. rodinný domek","(lit.: family house vs. family little-house; but","the diminutive domek does not indicate that the","house is small)","– občanský zákon vs. občanský zákonı́k","(lit.: citizen law vs. citizen law-codex, meaning","the same thing in modern Czech) These cases were annotated as instances of the same MWE, with a vision of future t-lemmas disregard-ing this variation. Until that happens, however, we cannot identify the MWEs with these variations automatically using the most frequent TS only.","• Elided parts of MWEs in coordinations. Although t-layer contains many newly established t-nodes in place of elided words, not all t-nodes needed for easy MWE annotation were there. This decision resulted in the situation, when some MWEs in coordinations cannot be correctly annotated, esp. in case of coordination of several multiword lexemes like inženýrská, montážnı́ a stavebnı́ společnost (engineering, assembling and building company), there is only one t-node for company. Thus the MWE inženýrská společnost / engineering company is not in PDT 2.5 data and cannot be found by the t-layer identification method. It can, however, be found by the m-layer surface method, provided the window is large enough and MWEs can overlap."]},{"title":"7 Conclusions","paragraphs":["Identification of occurrences of multiword expressions in text has not been extensively studied yet although it is very important for a lot of NLP applications. Our lexicon SemLex is a unique resource with almost 9 thousand MWEs, each of them with a tree-structure extracted from data. We use this resource to evaluate methods for automatic identification of MWE occurrences in text based on matching syntactic tree structures (tectogrammatical – deep-syntactic, and analytical – surface-syntactic trees) and sequences of lemmas in the surface sentence.","The theoretically ideal approach based on tectogrammatical layer turned out not to perform better, mainly due to the imperfectness of the t-layer implemented in PDT and also due to the low accuracy of automatic tectogrammatical parser. It still shows very high Recall, as expected – due to simple topology of the trees – however Precision is not ideal. Morphology-based MWE identification guarantees high Recall (especially when no limits are put on the MWE component distance) but Precision of this approach is rather low. On the other hand, if the maximum distance is set to 4–5 words we get a very interesting trade-off between Precision and Recall. Using analytical layer (and thus introducing surface syntax to the solution) might be a good approach for many applications, too. It provides high Precision as well as reasonable Recall."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["This research was supported by the Czech Science Foundation (grant n.
