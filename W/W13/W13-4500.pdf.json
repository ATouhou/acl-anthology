Given the importance and urgency of response to these disasters, there has been a heightening interest in crisis informatics, or the use of information technology to improve the speed and effectiveness of disaster response. One particular area where information technology holds particular promise is in the processing of language. For example, in times of crisis, valuable information about the current state of events in disaster-affected areas is broadcast by various individuals or organizations, in disparate locations, and in varying forms, the majority of which involve some sort of natural language. In situations such as these, it is extremely important to be able to aggregate and filter every bit of available information, and deliver it as quickly and accurately as possible to those who could benefit by its provision. In this workshop, we hope to provide a venue to propose new techniques for processing language related to times of crisis. In particular, we place a focus on the role that language and language processing technology can play in crisis response, analysis of social dynamics in times of crisis, and increasing preparedness for crises that may occur in the future. vi Organizers: Kentaro Inui (Tohoku University, Japan) Hideto Kazawa (Google Japan) Graham Neubig (NAIST, Japan) Masao Utiyama (NICT, Japan) Program Committee/Reviewers: Eiji Aramaki (Kyoto University, Japan) Kevin Duh (NAIST, Japan) Atsushi Fujita (Future University Hakodate, Japan) Masato Hagiwara (Rakuten Institute of Technology, USA) Mai Miyabe (University of Tokyo, Japan) Robert Munro (Idibon, USA) Koji Murakami (Rakuten Institute of Technology, USA) Kiyonori Ohtake (NICT, Japan) Kate Starbird (University of Washington, USA) Irina Temnikova (Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Bulgaria) Kentaro Torisawa (NICT, Japan) vii"]},{"title":"Table of Contents","paragraphs":["An Evidence Based Earthquake Detector using Twitter Bella Robinson, Robert Power and Mark Cameron . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 Computer-assisted Structuring of Emergency Management Information: A Project Note","Yotaro Watanabe, Kentaro Inui, Shingo Suzuki, Hiroko Koumoto, Mitsuhiro Higashida, Yuji Maeda and Katsumi Iwatsuki . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 Rescue Activity for the Great East Japan Earthquake Based on a Website that Extracts Rescue Requests from the Net","Shin Aida, Yasutaka Shindo and Masao Utiyama . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 19","A Framework and Tool for Collaborative Extraction of Reliable Information Graham Neubig, Shinsuke Mori and Masahiro Mizukami . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 26","Extracting and Aggregating False Information from Microblogs Naoaki Okazaki, Keita Nabeshima, Kento Watanabe, Junta Mizuno and Kentaro Inui . . . . . . . . . . 36 Returning-Home Analysis in Tokyo Metropolitan Area at the time of the Great East Japan Earthquake using Twitter Data","Yusuke Hara . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 44 BahaBa: A Route Generator System for Mobile Devices","Ralph Vincent Regalado, Michael Benedict Haw, Matthew Alexis Martinez, Lowie Santiaguel and Patrick Lawrence Tamayo . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 51 ix"]},{"title":"Workshop Program Monday October 14, 2013 (11:00) Session 1","paragraphs":["An Evidence Based Earthquake Detector using Twitter Bella Robinson, Robert Power and Mark Cameron Computer-assisted Structuring of Emergency Management Information: A Project Note Yotaro Watanabe, Kentaro Inui, Shingo Suzuki, Hiroko Koumoto, Mitsuhiro Higashida, Yuji Maeda and Katsumi Iwatsuki (13:30) Session 2 Rescue Activity for the Great East Japan Earthquake Based on a Website that Extracts Rescue Requests from the Net Shin Aida, Yasutaka Shindo and Masao Utiyama A Framework and Tool for Collaborative Extraction of Reliable Information Graham Neubig, Shinsuke Mori and Masahiro Mizukami Extracting and Aggregating False Information from Microblogs Naoaki Okazaki, Keita Nabeshima, Kento Watanabe, Junta Mizuno and Kentaro Inui Returning-Home Analysis in Tokyo Metropolitan Area at the time of the Great East Japan Earthquake using Twitter Data Yusuke Hara BahaBa: A Route Generator System for Mobile Devices Ralph Vincent Regalado, Michael Benedict Haw, Matthew Alexis Martinez, Lowie Santiaguel and Patrick Lawrence Tamayo xi"]}]}
