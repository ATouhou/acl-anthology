A standard machine learning pipeline for the entity resolution problem consists of three major components: blocking, pairwise linkage, and clustering. The blocking step groups records by shared properties to determine which pairs of records should be examined by the pairwise linker as potential duplicates. Next, the linkage step assigns a probability score to pairs of records inside each block. If a pair scores above a user-defined threshold, the records are presumed to represent the same entity. Finally, the clustering step turns the input records into clusters of records (or profiles), where each cluster is uniquely associated with a single real-world entity. This paper describes the blocking and clustering strategies used to deploy a massive database of organization entities to power a major commercial People Search Engine. We demonstrate the viability of these algorithms for large data sets on a 50-node hadoop cluster."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["A challenge for builders of databases whose information is culled from multiple sources is the detection of duplicates, where a single real-world entity gives rise to multiple records (see (Elmagarmid, 2007) for an overview). Entity Resolution is the task of identifying which records in a database refer to the same entity. Online citation indexes need to be able to navigate through the different capitalization and abbreviation conventions that appear in bibliographic entries. Government agencies need to know whether a record for “Robert Smith” living on “Northwest First Street” refers to the same person as one for a “Bob Smith” living on “1st St. NW”. In a standard machine learning approach to this problem all records first go through a cleaning process that starts with the removal of bogus, junk and spam records. Then all records are normalized to an approximately common representation. Finally, all major noise types and inconsistencies are addressed, such as empty/bogus fields, field duplication, outlier values and encoding issues. At this point, all records are ready for the major stages of the entity resolution, namely blocking, pairwise linkage, and clustering. Since comparing all pairs of records is quadratic in the number of records and hence is intractable for large data sets, the blocking step groups records by shared properties to determine which pairs of records should be examined by the pairwise linker as potential duplicates. Next, the linkage step assigns a score to pairs of records inside each block. If a pair scores above a user-defined threshold, the records are presumed to represent the same entity. The clustering step partitions the input records into sets of records called profiles, where each profile corresponds to a single entity.","In this paper, we focus on entity resolution for the organization entity domain where all we have are the organization names and their relations with individuals. Let’s first describe the entity resolution for organization names, and discuss its significance and the challenges in more detail. Our process starts by collecting billions of personal records from three sources of U.S. records to power a major commercial People Search Engine. Example fields on these records might include name, address, birthday, phone number, (encrypted) social security number, relatives, friends, job title, universities attended, and organizations worked for. Since the data sources are heterogeneous, each data source provides different aliases of an organization including abbreviations, preferred names, legal names, etc. For example, Person A might have both “Microsoft”, “Microsoft Corp”, “Microsoft Corporation”, and “Microsoft Research” in his/her profile’s organization field. Person B might have “University of Washington”, while Person C has “UW” as the organization listed in his/her profile. Moreover, some organizations change their names, or are acquired by other in-"]},{"title":"70","paragraphs":["stitutions and become subdivisions. There are also many organizations that share the same name or abbreviation. For instance, both “University of Washington”, “University of Wisconsin Madison”, “University of Wyoming” share the same abbreviation, “UW”. Additionally, some of the data sources might be noisier than the others and there might be different kind of typos that needs to be addressed.","Addressing the above issues in organization fields is crucial for data quality as graphical representations of the data become more popular. If we show different representations of the same organization as separate institutions in a single person’s profile, it will decrease the confidence of a customer about our data quality. Moreover, we should have a unique representation of organizations in order to properly answer more complicated graph-based queries such as “how am I connected to company X?”, or “who are my friends that has a friend that works at organization X, and graduated from school Y?”.","We have developed novel and highly scalable components for our entity resolution pipeline which is customized for organizations. The focus of this paper is the graph-based blocking and clustering components. In the remainder of the paper, we first describe these components in Section 2. Then, we evaluate the performance of our entity resolution framework using several real-world datasets in Section 3. Finally, we conclude in Section 4."]},{"title":"2 Methodology","paragraphs":["In this section, we will mainly describe the blocking and clustering strategies as they are more graph related. We will also briefly mention our pairwise linkage model.","The processing of large data volumes requires highly scalable parallelized algorithms, and this is only possible with distributed computing. To this end, we make heavy use of the hadoop implementation of the MapReduce computing framework, and both the blocking and clustering procedures described here are implemented as a series of hadoop jobs written in Java. It is beyond the scope of this paper to fully describe the MapReduce framework (see (Lin, 2010) for an overview), but we do discuss the ways its constraints inform our design. MapReduce divides computing tasks into a map phase in which the input, which is given as (key,value) pairs, is split up among multiple machines to be worked on in parallel and a reduce phase in which the output of the map phase is put back together for each key to independently process the values for each key in parallel. Moreover, in a MapReduce context, recursion becomes iteration. 2.1 Blocking How might we subdivide a huge number of organizations based on similarity or probability scores when all we have is their names and their relation with people? We could start by grouping them into sets according to the words they contain. This would go a long way towards putting together records that represent the same organization, but it would still be imperfect because organizations may have nicknames, abbreviations, previous names, or misspelled names. To enhance this grouping we could consider a different kind of information like soundex or a similar phonetic algorithm for indexing words to address some of the limitations of above grouping due to typos. We can also group together the organizations which appear in the same person’s profile. This way, we will be able to block the different representations of the same organization to some extent. With a handful of keys like this we can build redundancy into our system to accommodate different types of error, omission, and natural variability. The blocks of records they produce may overlap, but this is desirable because it gives the clustering a chance to join records that blocking did not put together.","The above blocks will vary widely in size. For example, we may have a small set of records containing the word “Netflix” which can then be passed along immediately to the linkage component. However, we may have a set of millions of records containing the word “State” which still needs to be cut down to subsets with manage-able sizes, otherwise it will be again impractical to do all pairwise computations in this block. One way to do this is to find other common properties to further subdivide this set. The set of all records containing not only “State” but also a specific state name like “Washington” is smaller than the set of all records containing the word “State”, and intuitively records in this set will be more likely to represent the same organization. Additionally we could block together all the “State” records with the same number of words, or combination of the initials of each word. As with the original blocks, overlap between these sub-blocks is desirable. We do not have to be particularly artful in our choice of sub-blocking criteria: any property that seems like it might be individuating will do. As long as we have an efficient way to search the space, we can let the data dynamically choose different sub-blocking strategies for each oversize block. To this end, we use the ordering on block keys to define a binomial tree where each node contains a list of block keys and is the parent of nodes that have keys that come later in the ordering appended to the list. Figure 1 shows a tree for the oversize top-level set tTkn1 with three sub-blocking tokens sTkn1 < sTkn2 < sTkn3. With each node of the tree we can associate a block whose key is the list of blocks keys in that node and whose records are the intersection of the records in those blocks, e.g. the tTkn1 ∩ sTkn1 ∩ sTkn2 node represents all the records for organizations containing all these tokens. Because the cardinality of an intersected set is less than or equal to the cardinalities of the sets that were intersected, every block"]},{"title":"71","paragraphs":["tTkn1 tTkn1 ∩ sTkn3tTkn1 ∩ sTkn2 tTkn1 ∩ sTkn2 ∩ sTkn3 tTkn1 ∩ sTkn1 tTkn1 ∩ sTkn1 ∩ sTkn3tTkn1 ∩ sTkn1 ∩ sTkn2 tTkn1 ∩ sTkn1 ∩ sTkn2 ∩ sTkn3 Figure 1: The root node of this tree represents an oversized block for the name Smith and the other nodes represent possible sub-blocks. The sub-blocking algorithm enumerates the tree breadth-first, stopping when it finds a correctly-sized sub-block. in the tree is larger than or equal to any of its children. We traverse the tree breadth-first and only recurse into nodes above the maximum block size. This allows us to explore the space of possible sub-blocks in cardinality order for a given branch, stopping as soon as we have a small enough sub-block.","The algorithm that creates the blocks and sub-blocks takes as input a set of records and a maximum block size M . All the input records are grouped into blocks defined by the top-level properties. Those top-level blocks that are not above the maximum size are set aside. The remaining oversized blocks are partitioned into sub-blocks by sub-blocking properties that the records they contain share, and those properties are appended to the key. The process is continued recursively until all sub-blocks have been whittled down to an acceptable size. The pseudo code of the blocking algorithm is presented in Figure 2. We will represent the key and value pairs in the MapReduce framework as <key; value >. The input organization records are represented as < INPUT FLAG,ORGNAME >. For the first iteration, this job takes the organization list as input. In later iterations, the input is the output of the previous blocking iteration. In the first iteration, the mapper function extracts the top-level and sub-level tokens from the input records. It combines the organization name and all the sub-level tokens in a temp variable called newV alue. Next, for each top-level token, it emits this top-level token and the newValue in the following for-mat: < topT oken, newV alue >. For the later iterations, it combines each sub level token with the current blocking key, and emits them to the reducer. Also note that the lexicographic ordering of the block keys allows separate mapper processes to work on different nodes in a level of the binomial tree without creating redundant sub-blocks (e.g. if one mapper creates a International ∩ Business ∩ Machines block another mapper will not create a International ∩ Machines ∩ Business one). This is necessary because individual MapReduce jobs run independently without shared memory or other runtime communication mechanisms. In the reduce phase, all the records will be grouped together for each block key. The reducer function iterates over all the records in a newly-created sub-block, counting them to determine whether or not the block is small enough or needs to be further subdivided. The blocks that the reducer deems oversized become in-puts to the next iteration. Care is taken that the memory requirements of the reducer function are constant in the size of a fixed buffer because otherwise the reducer runs out of memory on large blocks. Note that we create a black list from the high frequency words in organization names, and we don’t use these as top-level properties as such words do not help us with individuating the records.","More formally, this process can be understood in terms of operations on sets. In a set of N records there are 1 2 N (N − 1) unique pairs, so an enumeration over all of them is O(N 2","). The process of blocking divides this original set into k blocks, each of which contains at most a fixed maximum of M records. The exhaustive comparison of pairs from these sets is O(k), and the constant factors are tractable if we choose a small enough M .In the worst case, all the sub-blocks except the ones with the very longest keys are oversize. Then the sub-blocking algorithm will explore the powerset of all possible blocking keys and thus have exponential runtime. However, as the blocking keys get longer, the sets they represent get smaller and eventually fall beneath the maximum size. In practice these two countervailing motions work to keep this strategy tractable. 2.2 Pairwise Linkage Model In this section, we give just a brief overview of our pairwise linkage system as a detailed description and evalua-tion of that system is beyond the scope of this paper.","We take a feature-based classification approach to predict the likelihood of two organization names <o1,o2 > referring to the same organization entity. Specifically, we use the OpenNLP1","maximum entropy (maxent) package as our machine learning tool.

Let’s, first clarify a set of terms/conditions that will help us describe the algorithms.","Definition (Connected Component): Let G = (V, E) be an undirected graph where V is the set of vertices and E is the set of edges. C = (C1,C2, ..., Cn) is the set of disjoint connected components in this graph where (C1 ∪ C2 ∪ ...∪ Cn) = V and (C1 ∩ C2 ∩ ...∩ Cn) = ∅.For each connected component Ci ∈ C, there exists a path in G between any two vertices vk and vl where (vk,vl) ∈ Ci.

Moreover, the problem of finding all connected components in a graph is finding the C satisfying the above conditions. □","Definition (Component ID): A component id is a unique identifier assigned to each connected component.","Definition (Max Component Size): This is the maximum allowed size for a connected component. □","Definition (Cluster Set): A cluster set is a set of records that belong to the same real world entity. □","Definition (Max Cluster Size): This is the maximum allowed size for a cluster. □","Definition (Match Threshold): Match threshold is a score where pairs scoring above this score are said to represent the same entity. □","Definition (No-Match Threshold): No-Match threshold is a score where pairs scoring below this score are said to represent different entities. □","Definition (Conflict Set): Each record has a conflict set which is the set of records that shouldn’t appear with this record in any of the clusters. □","The naive approach to clustering for entity resolution is transitive closure by using only the pairs having scores above the match threshold. However, in practice we might see many examples of conflicting scores. For example, (a,b) and (b,c) pairs might have scores above match threshold while (a,c) pair has a score below no-match threshold. If we just use transitive closure, we will end up with a single cluster with these three records (a,b,c). Another weakness of the regular transitive closure is that it creates disjoint sets. However, organizations might share name, or abbreviation. So, we need a soft clustering approach where a record might be in different clusters.","On the other hand, the large volume of our data requires highly scalable and efficient parallelized algorithms. However, it is very hard to implement par-"]},{"title":"73","paragraphs":["TC-Iterate TC-Dedup","Edge List Node -","ComponentID","mapping new P air > 0 no ye s ","iterationID =1","iterationID >1 Figure 4: Transitive Closure Component allelized clustering approaches with high precision for large scale graphs due to high time and space complexities (Bansal, 2003). So, we propose a two-step approach in order to build both a parallel and an accurate clustering framework. The high-level architecture of our clustering framework is illustrated in Figure 3. We first find the connected components in the graph with our MapReduce based transitive closure approach, then further, partition each connected component in parallel with our novel soft clustering algorithm, sClust. This way, we first combine similar record pairs into connected components in an efficient and scalable manner, and then further partition each connected component into smaller clusters for better precision. Note that there is a dangerous phenomenon, black hole entities, in transitive closure of the pairwise scores (Michelson, 2009). A black hole entity begins to pull an inordinate amount of records from an increasing number of different true entities into it as it is formed. This is dangerous, because it will then erroneously match on more and more records, escalating the problem. Thus, by the end of the transitive closure, one might end up with black hole entities with millions of records belonging to multiple different entities. In order to avoid this problem, we define a black hole threshold, and if we end up with a connected component above the size of the black hole threshold, we increment the match threshold by a delta and further partition this black hole with one more transitive closure job. We repeat this process until the sizes of all the connected components are below the black hole threshold, and then apply sClust on each connected component. Hence at the end of the entire entity resolution process, the system has partitioned all the input records into cluster sets called profiles, where each profile corresponds to a single entity. 2.4 Transitive Closure In order to find the connected components in a graph, we developed the Transitive Closure (TC) module shown in Figure 4. The input to the module is the list of all pairs having scores above the match threshold. As an output from the module, what we want to obtain is the mapping from each node in the graph to its corresponding componentID. For simplicity, we use the smallest node id in each connected component as the identifier of that component. Thus, the module should output a mapping table from each node in the graph to the smallest node id in its corresponding connected component. To this end, we designed a chain of two MapReduce jobs, namely, TC-Transitive Closure Iterate map(key, value) emit(key, value) emit(value, key)","reduce(key, < iterable > values) minV alue ← values.next() if(minV alue < key) emit(key, minV alue) for each (value ∈ values)","Counter.NewPair.increment(1)","emit(value, minV alue)","(a) Transitive Closure - Iterate Transitive Closure Dedup map(key, value) emit(key.append(STR + value),null) reduce(key, < iterable > values) String[] keyTokens ← key.split(STR) emit(keyT okens[0],keyTokens[1])","(b) Transitive Closure - Dedup Figure 5: Alg.3 - Transitive Closure Iterate, and TC-Dedup, that will run iteratively till we find the corresponding componentIDs for all the nodes in the graph.","TC-Iterate job generates adjacency lists AL = (a1,a2, ..., an) for each node v, and if the node id of this node vid is larger than the min node id amin in the adjacency list, it first creates a pair (vid,amin) and then a pair for each (ai,amin) where ai ∈ AL,andai ̸= amin.If there is only one node in AL, it means we will generate the pair that we have in previous iteration. However, if there is more than one node in AL, it means we might generate a pair that we didn’t have in the previous iteration, and one more iteration is needed. Please note that, if vid is smaller than amin, we don’t emit any pair.","The pseudo code of TC-Iterate is given in Figure 5- (a). For the first iteration, this job takes the pairs having scores above the match threshold from the initial edge list as input. In later iterations, the input is the output of TC-Dedup from the previous iteration. We first start with the initial edge list to construct the first degree neighborhood of each node. To this end, for each edge <a; b>,the mapper emits both <a; b>, and <b; a>pairs so that a should be in the adjacency list of b and vice versa. In the reduce phase, all the adjacent nodes will be grouped together for each node. Reducers don’t receive the values in a sorted order. So, we use a secondary sort approach to pass the values to the reducer in a sorted way with custom partitioning (see (Lin, 2010) for details). This way, the first value becomes the minValue. If the minValue is larger than the key, we don’t emit anything. Otherwise,"]},{"title":"74 Bring together all edges for each partition Phase-1","paragraphs":["map(key, value) if(key.equals(Conf lationOutput)) if ((value.score≤ NO MATCH THR)|| (value.score≥ MATCH THR))","emit(value.entity1,value) else //T CDedupOutput temp.entity1 ← value temp.entity2 ← null temp.score← null emit(key, temp) emit(value, temp)","reduce(key, < iterable > values) valueList ←∅ for each (value ∈ values) if(value.entity2=null) clusID ← value.entity1 else valueList.add(value) for each (value ∈ valueList) emit(clusID, value) Phase-2 map(key, value) emit(key, value) reduce(key, < iterable > values) valueList ←∅ for each (value ∈ values) valueList.add(value) emit(key, valueList) Figure 6: Alg.3 - Bring together all edges for each partition we first emit the <key; minV alue > pair. Next, we emit a pair for all other values as <value; minV alue >, and increase the global NewPair counter by 1. If the counter is 0 at the end of the job, it means that we found all the components and there is no need for further iterations.","During the TC-Iterate job, the same pair might be emit-ted multiple times. The second job, TC-Dedup, just deduplicates the output of the CCF-Iterate job. This job in-creases the efficiency of TC-Iterate job in terms of both speed and I/O overhead. The pseudo code for this job is given in Figure 5-(b).","The worst case scenario for the number of necessary iterations is d+1 where d is the diameter of the net-work. The worst case happens when the min node in the largest connected component is an end-point of the largest shortest-path. The best case scenario takes d/2+1 iterations. For the best case, the min node should be at the center of the largest shortest-path.","2.5 sClust: A Soft Agglomerative Clustering Approach After partitioning the records into disjoint connected components, we further partition each connected component into smaller clusters with sClust approach. sClust is a soft agglomerative clustering approach, and its main difference from any other hierarchical clustering method is the “conflict set” term that we described above. Any of the conflicting nodes cannot appear in a cluster with this approach. Additionally, the maximum size of the clusters can be controlled by an input parameter.","First as a preprocessing step, we have a two-step MapReduce job (see Figure 6) which puts together and sorts all the pairwise scores for each connected component discovered by transitive closure. Next, sClust job takes the sorted edge lists for each connected component as input, and partitions each connected component in parallel. The pseudo-code for sClust job is given in Figure 7. sClust iterates over the pairwise scores twice. During the first iteration, it generates the node structures, and conflict sets for each of these structures. For example, if the pairwise score for (a, b) pair is below the no-match threshold, node a is added to node b’s conflict set, and vice versa. By the end of the first iteration, all the conflict sets are generated. Now, one more pass is needed to build the final clusters. Since the scores are sorted, we start from the highest score to agglomeratively construct the clusters by going over all the scores above the match threshold. Let’s assume we have a pair (a, b) with a score above the match threshold. There might be 4 different conditions. First, both node a and node b are not in any of the clusters yet. In this case, we generate a cluster with these two records and the conflict set of this cluster becomes the union of conflict sets of these two records. Second, node a might already be assigned to a set of clusters C’ while node b is not in any of the clusters. In these case, we add node b to each cluster in C’ if it doesn’t conflict with b. If there is no such cluster, we build a new cluster with nodes a and b. Third is the opposite version of the second condition, and the procedure is the same. Finally, both node a and node b might be in some set of clusters. If they already appear in the same cluster, no further action needed. If they just appear in different clusters, these clusters will be merged as long as there is no conflict between these clusters. If there are no such unconflicting clusters, we again build a new cluster with nodes a and b. This way, we go over all the scores above the match threshold and build the cluster sets. Note that if the clusters are merged, their conflict sets are also merged. Additionally, if the max cluster size parameter is defined, this condition is also checked before merging any two clusters, or adding a new node to an existing cluster."]},{"title":"75 Clustering","paragraphs":["map(key, valueList)","for each (value ∈ valueList)","if(value.score≥ MATCH THR) nodes.insert(value.entity1) nodes.insert(value.entity2)","else node1Index ← find(value.entity1,nodes) node2Index ← find(value.entity2,nodes) nodes[node1Index].conf lictSet.insert(node2Index) nodes[node2Index].conf lictSet.insert(node1Index)","for each (value ∈ valueList)","if(value.score≥ MATCH THR) node1Index ← find(value.entity1,nodes) node2Index ← find(value.entity2,nodes) node1ClusIDLength ← nodes[node1Index].clusIDs.length node2ClusIDLength ← nodes[node2Index].clusIDs.length if((node1ClusIDLength =0)&&(node2ClusIDLength =0)) clusters[numClusters].nodes[0] ← node1Index clusters[numClusters].nodes[1] ← node2Index clusters[numClusters].conf Set←","mergeSortedLists(nodes[node1Index].conf Set, nodes[node2Index].conf Set) nodes[node1Index].clusIDs.insert(numClusters) nodes[node2Index].clusIDs.insert(numClusters) numClusters++ elseif(node1ClusIDLength =0) for each (node2ClusID ∈ nodes[node2Index].clusIDs) if(notContain(clusters[node2ClusID].conf Set, node1Index))","insertT oSortedList(clusters[node2ClusID].nodes, node1Index)","clusters[node2ClusID].conf Set←","mergeSortedLists(clusters[node2ClusID].conf Set, nodes[node1Index].conf Set)","nodes[node1Index].clusIDs.insert(node2ClusID) elseif(node2ClusIDLength =0) for each (node1ClusID ∈ nodes[node1Index].clusIDs) if(notContain(clusters[node1ClusID].conf Set, node2Index))","insertT oSortedList(clusters[node1ClusID].nodes, node2Index)","clusters[node1ClusID].conf Set←","mergeSortedLists(clusters[node1ClusID].conf Set, nodes[node2Index].conf Set)","nodes[node2Index].clusIDs.insert(node1ClusID) elseif(notIntersect(clusters[node1ClusID].clusIDs, clusters[node2ClusID].clusIDs)) for each (node1ClusID ∈ nodes[node1Index].clusIDs) for each (node2ClusID ∈ nodes[node2Index].clusIDs)","if( notIntersect(clusters[node1ClusID].conf Set, clusters[node2ClusID].nodes)&&","notIntersect(clusters[node2ClusID].conf Set, clusters[node1ClusID].nodes))","clusters[node1ClusID].nodes ←","mergeSortedList(clusters[node1ClusID].nodes, clusters[node2ClusID].nodes)","clusters[node1ClusID].conf Set←","mergeSortedLists(clusters[node1ClusID].conf Set, clusters[node2ClusID].conf Set)","for each (nodeIndex ∈ clusters[node2ClusID].nodes)","nodes[nodeIndex].clusIDs.insert(node1ClusID)","clusters[node2ClusID].isRemoved ← true","clusters[node2ClusID].nodes ← null","clusters[node2ClusID].confSet ← null Figure 7: Alg.4 - Clustering"]},{"title":"76","paragraphs":["(a) Block Dist.

Since transitive closure merges records transitively, it has very high recall but the precision is just 64%. Finally, we performed our sClust approach with the same match threshold.

We first evaluated the performance of our approach on truth data provided by freebase. Our clustering approach, sClust, significantly improved the recall of the pairwise classifier. Next, we demonstrated the viability of our framework on a large scale dataset on a 50-node hadoop cluster."]},{"title":"77 References","paragraphs":["A. K. Elmagarmid, P. G. Iperirotis, and V. S.
