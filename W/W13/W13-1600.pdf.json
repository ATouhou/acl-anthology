The growth in interest in these tasks was motivated by the birth and rapid expansion of the Social Web that made it possible for people all over the world to share, comment or consult content on any given topic. In this context, opinions, sentiments and emotions expressed in Social Media texts have been shown to have a high influence on the social and economic behaviour worldwide. The aim of the 4th Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment and Social Media Analysis (WASSA 2013) was to continue the line of the previous three editions, bringing together researchers in Computational Linguistics working on Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis and researchers working on interdisciplinary aspects of affect computation from text. Additionally, this year, we extended the focus to Social Media phenomena and the impact of affect-related phenomena in this context. WASSA 2013 was organized in conjunction to the 2013 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, on June 14, 2013, in Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America. At this fourth edition of the workshop, we received a total of 29 submissions, from a wide range of countries, of which 8 were accepted as long and another 8 as short papers. Each paper has been thoroughly reviewed by 2 members of the Program Committee. The accepted papers were all highly assessed by the reviewers, the best paper receiving an average punctuation (computed as an average of all criteria used to assess the papers) of 4.75 out of 5. The main topics of the accepted papers are related to affect in Social Media - the creation and evaluation of resources for subjectivity, sentiment and emotion in social media, cross-lingual and multilingual resource creation and use, the detection of sarcasm and spam and the detection of illegal activities in digital social settings. The invited talks reflected the multimodal and interdisciplinary nature of the research in affect-related phenomena, from topics related to multimodal methods for emotion detection, theories of emotion and applications of emotion detection in Social Media. This year’s edition has shown again that the topics addressed by WASSA are of high interest to the research community and that the contributions presented in this forum bring an important development both to the theoretical, as well as to the application-oriented scenarios. We would like to thank the NAACL-HLT 2013 Organizers for the help and support at the different stages of the workshop organization process. We are also especially grateful to the Program Committee members and the external reviewers for the time and effort spent assessing the papers. We would like to extend our thanks to our invited speakers – Prof. Rosalind Picard, Prof. Jonathan Gratch and Dr. Theresa Wilson, for accepting to deliver the keynote talks. Secondly, we would like to express our gratitude for the official endorsement we received from SIGNLL (the ACL Special Interest Group on Natural Language Learning) and SIGANN, the ACL Special Interest Group for Annotation. iii Further on, we would like to thank the Editors of the “Information Processing and Management”, published by Elsevier, for accepting to organize a Special Issue of this journal containing the extended versions of the best full papers accepted at WASSA 2013. We would like to express our gratitude to Yaniv Steiner, who created the WASSA logo and to the entire OPTIMA action team at the European Commission Joint Research Centre, for the technical support they provided. Last, but not least, we are grateful for the financial support given by the Academic Institute for Research in Computer Science of the University of Alicante (Instituto Universitario para la Investigación en Informática, Universidad de Alicante)."]},{"title":"Alexandra Balahur, Erik van der Goot and Andrés Montoyo WASSA 2013 Chairs","paragraphs":["iv Organizers: Alexandra Balahur European Commission Joint Research Centre Institute for the Protection and Security of the Citizen Erik van der Goot European Commission Joint Research Centre Institute for the Protection and Security of the Citizen Andrés Montoyo University of Alicante Department of Software and Computing Systems Program Committee: Nicoletta Calzolari, CNR Pisa (Italy) Erik Cambria, University of Stirling (U.K.) José Carlos Cortizo, European University Madrid (Spain) Fermin Cruz Mata, University of Seville (Spain) Michael Gamon, Microsoft (U.S.A.)
