We received 9 submissions. After one withdrawal, we chose to accept four long papers and four short papers, giving an long paper acceptance rate of 50%. Medical records are increasingly written on electronic media instead of on paper, which has radically increased the importance of information processing techniques in medical fields. Nevertheless, the state of usage of information and communication technologies in medical fields is said to 10 years behind that in other fields. By processing large amounts of medical records and obtaining knowledge from them, great potential exist in assisting more precise and timely treatments. Such assistance can save lives and provide better quality of life. Our goal is the promotion and support of implementation of practical tools and systems in the medical industry, which can support medical decisions and treatment by physicians and medical staff. A shortterm objective of this pilot task is to evaluate basic techniques of information extraction in medical fields, but the long-term objective is to offer a forum for achieving the goal with a community-based approach. We aim to gather people who are interested in this issue. Then we intend to facilitate their communication and discussion to clarify issues to be solved, while defining the necessary elemental technologies. Finally, we would like to express our gratitude to the following people who helped us. Thank you.
