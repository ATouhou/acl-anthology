The goal of this approach is to avoid the effort of acquiring and labeling new corpora to learn models when changing the language.

These graphs represent a set of hypotheses (a language) that is the input to the statistical semantic decoder that provides the meaning of the sentence.

They show the good behavior of the system, mainly when speech input is considered."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) is one of the key modules in many voice-driven humancomputer interaction systems. Many successful SLU systems that have been developed in the last few years are based on statistical models automatically learned from semantically labeled corpora (Maynard and Lefèvre, 2001; Segarra et al., 2002; He and Young, 2006; Lefèvre, 2007; De Mori et al., 2008). One of the advantages of statistical models is the capability of representing the variability of lexical realizations of concepts (meanings). On the other hand, they are usually plain models, that is, they can not represent a hierarchical semantic dependency, although there are some works in this area (He and Young, 2003). However, this is not a problem in most Spoken Dialog Systems since the semantic information to be extracted is not very hierarchically structured.","Another important aspect of these models is that they can be learned from corpora. The corpora used for training must be large enough to allow an accurate estimation of the probabilities, and it must represent the lexical and syntactic variability that is used in the language to express the semantics as much as possible. Although there are some approaches based on semi-supervised or un-supervised learning (Tür et al., 2005; Riccardi and Hakkani-Tür, 2005; Ortega et al., 2010), the most common approaches need to have a segmented and labeled training corpus. This is the case of discriminative models (like Conditional Random Fields (Hahn et al., 2010)), and generative models (such as Hidden Markov Models and Stochastic Finite State Automata (Segarra et al., 2002; Hahn et al., 2010)). In the case of supervised learning, it is necessary to define a set of concepts that represent the semantic domain of the task and to associate these concepts to the corresponding sequences of words in the sentences. This is the case of the French MEDIA corpus (Bonneau-Maynard et al., 2005), and the Spanish DIHANA corpus (Benedı́ et al., 2006). Since the corpus acquisition and labeling require a great manual effort, be-ing able to reuse the corpus generated for a task to easily develop SLU systems for other tasks, or languages, is an important issue.","This work focuses on the problem of SLU portability between languages (Garcı́a et al., 2012; He et al., 2013; Jabaian et al., 2013). We propose a semi-supervised approach for adapting the system to tackle sentences that are uttered in a new language. In order to learn a domain-specific translation model, a parallel corpus is automatically generated from the training set by using web translators. Due to the fact that the speech recognition and the translation phases can generate many errors, a mechanism to obtain the correct meaning despite these errors is needed. This can be performed by supplying many hypotheses between 193 the different stages, either as a set of n sentences or as a graph that represents not only the original sentences but also an adequate generalization of them. This graph can be obtained from a Grammatical Inference process. We have also developed a specific algorithm to perform the semantic decoding by taking graphs of words as the input and considering statistical semantic models. We have applied these techniques for the DIHANA corpus, which is a task to access the information of train timetables and fares in Spanish by phone. This corpus was originally generated in Spanish, and we have evaluated our system by using input sentences in French."]},{"title":"2 Description of the system","paragraphs":["One way of solving the SLU problem is to find the sequence of concepts Ĉ that best fits the semantics contained in an utterance A. Considering a stochastic modelization, it can be stated as:","Ĉ = argmax C p(C|A) (1)","In the case of Multilingual SLU, the user utters a sentence in a source language s, which is different to the language t of the original data of the SLU task. Thus, either the uttered sentence or the training data (or maybe both) should be translated into a common language in order to be able to apply the semantic decoding process to the input utterance. In our case, we recognize the input utterance by using an Automatic Speech Recognizer (ASR) in the source language, and we then translate the hypotheses provided by the ASR into the target language t by means of a statistical Machine Translation system (see Figure 1). Consequently, by considering both the input sentence Ws uttered by the user and its translation into the target language Wt, Equation (1) can be rewritten as:","Ĉ = argmax C max Ws,Wt p(C, Ws, Wt|A) (2)","Equation (2) can be decomposed into several factors, as shown in Equation (3). This is achieved by applying the Bayes’ Rule and making some reasonable assumptions about the independence of the variables.","Ĉ = argmax C max Ws,W","t","p(A|Ws) · p(Ws|Wt) · p(Wt|C) · p(C) p(A)","(3) To perform this maximization, we propose a de-","coupled architecture, which sequentially applies all the knowledge sources. One of the most important drawbacks of decoupled architectures is that the errors generated in one stage can not be recovered in following phases. To overcome this problem, we propose an architecture in which the communication between the modules is done by means of structures that provide more than one hypothesis, like n-best and graphs of words. A scheme of this architecture is shown in Figure 1. Its modules are the following:","1. First, the input utterance is processed by an ASR in the source language, providing as its output either the 1-best or a set of n-best transcriptions. We have used a general purpose, freely available web ASR, which means that the ASR has no specific information about the task.","2. These transcriptions are translated into the target language by means of a state-of-the-art Machine Translation system: MOSES (Koehn et al., 2007). The translation models have been trained without using any manually generated data. Instead, a set of freely available web translators was used to translate the training sentences of the corpus from the target language (the original language of the corpus sentences) into the source language (the language of the speaker), thereby building a parallel training corpus. MOSES provides as its output a set of candidate translations (n-best) of the transcriptions supplied by the ASR.","3. A graph of words is built from the n-best provided by the translator. This graph is built through a Grammatical Inference process. This way the graph not only represents the translations, but also a reasonable generalization of them. This makes it possible for the semantic decoder to consider some sentences that were not in the initial set but that are made of pieces of those sentences.","4. This graph of words is processed by a SLU module that is able to tackle graphs. The semantic model for this stage has been learned using only the training data in the target language. As an intermediate result, this process builds a graph of concepts, which is a compact representation of all the possible semantics contained in the language represented by 194 Speech Translation TEST TRAINING SLU","SLU Stage 1","SLU Stage 2 Graph of Concepts w1 ...wi:Concept1 wi+1...wj:Concept2","... wm+1...wn:ConceptkGraph of Words Graph of Words Builder","Frame Converter FRAME_NAME slot1:value1 slot2:value2","... slotm:valuem ASR Statistical Translator 1-best/ n-best 1-best/ n-best Spanish DIHANA Corpus (Training Set)","Translation Model Translation","Model Learning (MOSES) Semantic Model Learning","Web Translators Semantic Model Figure 1: Scheme of the decoupled architecture. the graph of words.

Finally, the segmentation obtained in the previous step is processed in order to convert it into a frame representation. This involves extracting the relevant information from the segmentation and representing it in a canoni-cal way.","Assuming that all the translations Wt that be-long to the language represented by the graph of words are a priori equiprobable in the target language, we can rewrite Equation (3) as follows:","Ĉ = argmax C max W s,W","t","p(A|Ws) · p(Ws) · p(Wt|Ws) · p(Wt|C) · p(C) p(A) (4)","The first three modules of the architecture can be viewed as a speech translation process, where the input is an utterance and the output is a set of possible translations of this utterance, represented as a graph of words.

This way each of the modules contributes to the computation of the global max-imization, but it is not completely performed until the end of the process."]},{"title":"3 Learning of the translation model","paragraphs":["It has been shown that statistical models achieve good performance in speech translation tasks (Mathias and Byrne, 2006). Also, they have the advantage that they can be adapted to a specific task, as long as a large enough amount of parallel training data is available in order to adequately train the parameters of the Machine Translation system. However, obtaining this task-specific training data by translating the original data by hand is very expensive and time-consuming. A solution to this problem is to use several generalpurpose web translators (which are available on 195 the Internet) to automatically translate the task-specific training sentences into another language. Although these translators can generate many errors, they are an interesting way to obtain several hypotheses for a translation without much effort. However, the use of these translators at testing time is not very convenient due to the fact that the system would depend on the Internet connection and the reaction time of the corresponding web pages. Another drawback is that it is impossible to adapt them to a specific task, which could generate many errors that are important to the task.","The approach that we propose attempts to take advantage of these resources, but for training purposes. In other words, given the training sentences in Spanish, they are translated into a new language (French in this case) by using several web translators. This way we build a parallel corpus where each sentence has different translations associated to it. From this parallel corpus, we train a statistical translator that is specific for the task. It should be noted that by means of this process, the learned translator can represent and modelize the variability generated by the different translators. However, due to the difficulty of the problem, this modelization may not be enough. Therefore we can not guarantee that the best translation obtained by the model is consistent with the meaning of the original sentence. This is why it is convenient to supply more than one hypothesis to the semantic decoding module in order to have the possibility of finding the correct semantic meaning even when some errors were generated in the recognition and translation processes. We think that separately process-ing the n-best translated sentences (for each input sentence) generated by the translator is not the best solution. In contrast, it would be better to adequately combine segments of different sentences. Thus, we have developed a Grammatical Inference mechanism to build a graph of words from a set of hypotheses as described in the following section."]},{"title":"4 Generating the graphs of words","paragraphs":["In this section, the process of obtaining the graphs of words in the target language from multiple translation hypotheses is explained. This process is divided into two steps:","1. The translation hypotheses are aligned using a Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) algorithm. The result of the MSA process is an alignment matrix.","2. The aligned sentences, represented by the alignment matrix, are used to obtain a weighted graph of words that will be the input to the graph-based SLU module.","A Multiple Sequence Alignment is a process of sequence alignment that involves more than two sequences. It takes a set of sequences of symbols (in our case, sequences of words) and provides the alignment of the elements of the set that minimizes the number of edit operations (substitutions, in-sertions, and deletions) among all the symbols of the sequences. In this work, a modification of the ClustalW (Larkin et al., 2007) Multiple Sequence Alignment software has been used.","The result of the MSA process is an alignment matrix. Each row in this matrix represents a different aligned sentence, and each column represents the alignment of each symbol. The total number of columns is usually greater than the length of the longest sequence, since not all the symbols can be aligned. The special symbol ’-’ is used to represent the positions of non-alignment points in a sentence.","A weighted directed acyclic graph of words is created from the MSA alignment matrix, The graph construction consists of creating as many nodes as columns in the alignment matrix plus one for the final state and as many arcs as cells in the matrix that contain a symbol different to ’-’. The arcs with the same source, destination, and symbol are joined, and the weights are obtained by normalizing these counters (Calvo et al., 2012).","Figure 2 shows a real example (extracted from the test set) of the full process of obtaining the graph of words. As the figure shows, the obtained graph of words (where the arcs are labeled with words and weighted with the normalized counters) represents a language which is a generalization of the individual translations of the original utterance. That is, this process is a Grammatical Inference mechanism that represents sentences with characteristics that are similar to those used to build the graph. A full path from the initial node to the final node in the graph may be seen as an alternative translation of the original utterance. For example, the correct translation of the utterance “ el precio del billete del tren de las seis treinta y cinco” was not among the candidates provided, but it can be recovered using this algorithm.","This graph builder module completes the sequence of modules that perform the speech trans-196 source le prix du billet de train de six heures trente-cinq utterance (the price of the train ticket for six thirty-five)","(el precio del billete del tren de las seis treinta y cinco)","le prix du billet train de sezer trente-cinq","multiple ASR le prix du billet train de six vers trente-cinq","outputs le prix du billet train de six onze trente-cinq","le prix du billet train des six heures trente cinq","el precio del billete de tren de sezer treinta y cinco","multiple el precio del billete de tren alrededor de las seis treinta y cinco","translations el precio del billete del tren de las seis once y treinta y cinco","el precio del billete de tren de las seis treinta de las cinco de la tarde","el precio del billete de tren - de sezer treinta - - - y cinco - - -","alignment el precio del billete de tren alrededor de las seis treinta - - y cinco - - -","matrix el precio del billete del tren - de las seis once y treinta y cinco - - -","el precio del billete de tren - de las seis treinta - de las cinco de la tarde","0","1e l ( 1 . 0 0 ) 2 p r e c i o ( 1 . 0 0 ) 3 d e l ( 1 . 0 0 ) 4 b i l l e t e ( 1 . 0 0 ) 5 d e ( 0 . 7 5 ) d e l ( 0 . 2 5 ) 6t","r","e","n","(","1",".","0","0",") 7a","l","r","e","d","e","d o r","(","0",".","2","5 )","8d e ( 0 . 7 5",") d","e","(","1",".","0","0",") 9","l","a","s","(","0",".","7","5",")","s","e","ze","r","(","0",".","2","5",") 1","0s e i s ( 0 . 7 5",") t r e i n","t","a ( 0 . 2 5",") 1 1 o n c e ( 0 . 2 5 ) t r e i n t a ( 0 . 5 0 ) 1","4","y","(","0",".","2","5",") 1 2","y","(","0",".","3","3",")","1","3d e ( 0 . 3 3 )","y","(","0",".","3","3",") t r e i n t a ( 1 . 0 0 ) l a s ( 0 . 5 0 ) y ( 0 . 5 0 ) 1","5c","i","n","c","o","(","0",".","2","5",")","1","8c i n c o ( 0 . 7 5 ) 1 6 d e ( 1 . 0 0 ) 1 7 l a ( 1 . 0 0 ) t a r d e ( 1 . 0 0 ) Figure 2: Steps for obtaining the graph of words from the original utterance le prix du billet de train de six heures trente-cinq, (the price of the train ticket for six thirty-five). lation process. This process takes as its input an utterance and outputs a weighted graph of words, which represents the probability distribu-tion p(Wt|A). In other words, each full path in the graph of words (from the initial to the ending node) is a candidate translation of the input utterance, and is weighted with the probability of the translation given the utterance."]},{"title":"5 Performing the semantic decoding","paragraphs":["Our semantic decoding process is based on the idea of finding segments of words contained in the graph of words that are relevant to each of the concepts of the task. In order to compactly represent this set of segments and the concepts they are relevant to, a second graph is created, which we have called a graph of concepts. This graph has the same set of nodes as the graph of words, but each arc represents that there is a path in the graph of words between the initial and ending node of the arc, which induces a sequence of words that is relevant to some of the concepts of the task. Thus, each of these arcs is labeled with the corresponding sequence of words and the concept they represent. To assign a proper weight to the arcs, both the weights represented in the graph of words and the semantic model are considered. As the set of nodes is the same as in the graph of words, we will say that for every two nodes i, j, it stands that i < j if i comes before j in the topological order of the nodes in the graph of words (there is a topological order because the graph of words is directed and acyclic).","As stated in Equation (5), one of the important factors in this approach is the probability of the sequence of words in the target language given the sequence of concepts p(Wt|C). This probability can be decomposed as the product of the probabilities assigned by each concept of the sequence of concepts C to the segment of words that is attached to it; that is, ∏","∀ck∈C p(Wtk |ck), where Wtk is the sequence of words corresponding to the concept ck in the segmentation. To compute these probabilities, our semantic model includes a set of bigram Language Models (LMs), one for each concept in the task, which provide the probability of any sequence of words given the concept. To train these LMs, the training sentences of the corpus in the target language must be segmented and labeled in terms of the concepts of the task. The consequence of defining the semantic model this way is that every arc from node i to node j in the graph of concepts represents the probability p(W i,j t |A)·p(W i,j t |c), where W","i,j","t and c are the sequence of words and the concept attached to the arc, respectively. Furthermore, each full path (from the initial to the ending node) in the graph of concepts represents the probability 197 p(Wt|A) · p(Wt|C), for the sequence of concepts C and the sentence Wt induced by the path.","The set of arcs of the graph of concepts can be built by means of a Dynamic Programming (DP) algorithm that finds the sequence of words that maximizes the combined probability stated above, for each pair of nodes i, j and each concept c. Only the arc that represents the sequence of words of maximum probability is needed because this information will afterwards be combined with the probability of the sequence of concepts to find the path of maximum probability (see Equation (5)), and if there are many arcs between nodes i and j corresponding to the concept c only the one with maximum probability will be considered. This allows us to prune the arcs of the graph of concepts without any loss of information. For the DP algorithm, we will consider a representation of the LM corresponding to each concept as a Stochastic Finite State Automaton (SFSA). Then, in the DP process, for each concept c we will obtain the best path from node i to node j in the graph of words such that its underlying sequence of words arrives to the state qc in the SFSA LMc (the LM of the concept c). This can be achieved by means of the following algorithm: M(i, j, qc) =                  1 if i = j ∧ qc is the initial state of LMc 0 if i = j ∧ qc is not the initial state of LMc 0 if j < i","max ∀a∈E","GW :dest(a)=j ∀(q′ c,wd(a),q","c)∈LM","c","M(i, src(a), q′ c) · p(q′","c, wd(a), qc) · wt(a) otherwise (6) where dest(a) stands for the destination node of the arc a in the graph of words, src(a) refers to its source node, and wd(a) and wt(a) refer to the word and the weight attached to the arc, respectively. Also, (q′","c, wd(a), qc) represents a transition from the state q′","c to the state qc labeled with wd(a) in the SFSA that represents LMc.","It is worth noting that this process must be performed for each concept in the task. Also, it is important for the algorithm to keep track of the words that constitute the paths that maximize the expression for each cell. When this matrix has been filled for a specific conceptc, the cell that maximizes M (i, j, qc) for each pair i and j becomes an arc in the graph of concepts between nodes i and j. This arc is labeled with the sequence underlying the winning path and the concept c and is weighted with the score (probability) contained in M (i, j, qc).","This process shapes the first stage of the SLU process, which provides the graph of concepts as a result. Then, this graph of concepts is processed by a second stage. This second stage finds the path in the graph that maximizes the combination of its probability and the probability that a LM of bigrams of concepts gives to the sequence of concepts underlying the path. The LM of bigrams of concepts is also part of the semantic model, and to train it we take advantage of the segmentation and labeling in term of concepts provided by the training corpus. Finding the best path this way completely fulfills what is stated in Equation (5). Also, this best path in the graph of concepts provides the best sequence of concepts Ĉ, the underlying sequence of words W̃t, and a segmentation of W̃t according to Ĉ."]},{"title":"6 The DIHANA task and the semantic representation","paragraphs":["The DIHANA task consists of a telephone-based information service for trains in Spanish. A set of 900 dialogs was acquired by using the Wizard of Oz technique. The number of user turns was 6,280 and the vocabulary was 823. As in many other dialog systems (Minker, 1999), the semantic representation chosen for the task is based on a frame representation. Therefore, the final output of the understanding process is one or more frames with their corresponding attributes.","Even though the frame representation is the output of the system, we propose an intermediate semantic labeling that consists of assigning concepts to segments of the sentence in a sequential way. This is the output provided by the graph-based SLU module.","In order to represent the meaning of the utterances in terms of this intermediate semantic language, a set of 31 concepts was defined. Some of them are: query, affirmation, origin city, and courtesy.","Each concept represents the meaning of words (or sequences of words) in the sentences. For example, the semantic unit query can be associated to “can you tell me”, “please tell me”, “what is”, etc. This way, each sentence (sequence of words) has a semantic sentence (sequence of concepts) associated to it, and there is an inherent segmentation.

Since the intermediate language is close to the frame representation, only a small set of rules are required to build the frame. This phase consists of the following: the deletion of irrelevant segments (such as courtesies), the reordering of the relevant concepts and attributes that appeared in the segmentation following an order which has been defined a priori, the automatic instantiation of certain task-dependent values, etc.","Table 1 shows an example of the semantic representation in terms of the intermediate semantic segmentation provided by the SLU module and the final frame representation."]},{"title":"7 Experiments and results","paragraphs":["To evaluate this architecture, we performed a set of experiments with the DIHANA corpus. The user turns of the corpus were split into a set of 4889 turns for training and 1227 turns for test. To train the translation models, the training set was automatically translated from Spanish into French by four freely available web translators (Apertium, Bing, Google, Lucy), which provided us a parallel training corpus. The semantic model was learned from the segmentation and labeling provided in the DIHANA corpus for the training sentences in Spanish. All the Language Models in the semantic model were bigram models trained using Witten-Bell smoothing.","For evaluation purposes, all the test set was manually translated into French, and 500 turns were uttered by four native French speakers. Thus, we have carried out experiments both considering as the input to our system the correct sentences in French (which is the same than assuming a perfect ASR) and the utterances. To recognize the utterances the Google ASR was used, which for this test set provides a Word Error Rate of 21.9% considering only the 1-best recognized sentence.","For this experimentation we have considered three kinds of ASR outputs, namely, a Perfect ASR (text input), the 1-best output, and finally the n-best hypotheses (with n ranging from 1 to 20).","Also, we have configured the system in two different ways:","• Configuration 1: The output of the statistical translation system are the n-best translations for the input. Note that these n-best could contain repeated translations, which may lead to the reinforcement of some paths in the graphs of words.","• Configuration 2: The output of the statistical translation system is the set formed by the best n different (unique) translations that it can provide for the given input.","When the output of the ASR are n-best, we have only considered the Configuration 1.","We have evaluated each experiment using two measures: the Concept Error Rate (CER), which corresponds to errors in the output of the SLU module, and the Frame-Slot Error Rate (FSER), which corresponds to errors in the slots of the frames in the final output of the system.","Figures 3, 4, and 5 show the results obtained for each of the ASR outputs and configurations considered. The horizontal axis represents the number of hypotheses provided by the statistical translator.","As expected, in all the cases the FSER is lower than the CER, as some errors at level of the concept sequence are not relevant for the frame conversion (for example, courtesies). In the case of text input (Fig. 3), the best results are achieved when just one or two hypotheses are provided by the translator. This is because the translation model has also been learned using correct sentences, which makes the translation system more robust for this kind of input. However, when considering speech as input (Figs. 4 and 5), the generalization provided by the graphs obtained using a relatively large set of n-best translations leads to 199 a better behavior. This is due to the fact that the errors introduced by the recognition of the speech input increases the errors in the translation stage. Thus, working with different alternatives makes it possible to recover some of the errors. Table 2 shows the results obtained when optimizing the FSER, and the number of hypotheses n used to build the graphs that provide the best results.","Figures 3 and 4 also show that the parameters that optimize FSER and CER may not be the same. This behavior is due to the different nature of both measures. While CER is defined in terms of the sequence of concepts extracted by the SLU module, FSER only takes into account those segments that have relevant information.","It can be seen in Figures 3 and 4 that, for Configuration 2, whenn takes the value 18, both error measures descend. However, after this, the errors continue with their ascending tendency. The reason for this is that with these parameters, the translations provided by the translator generate a graph of words that allows the semantic model to better recover the semantics of the sentence. However, this effect is spurious, as for higher values of n the error measures present higher values. 15 20 25 1 5 10 15 20 error n-best CER-Text Config. 1 FSER-Text Config. 1 CER-Text Config. 2 FSER-Text Config. 2 Figure 3: Results obtained with the text input.
