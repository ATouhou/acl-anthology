The mix between the two started small, with graph theoretical framework providing efficient and elegant solutions for NLP applications that focused on single documents for part-of-speech tagging, word sense disambiguation and semantic role labeling. It then got progressively larger with ontology learning and information extraction from large text collections, and have reached web scale through the new fields of research that focus on information propagation in social networks, rumor proliferation, e-reputation, multiple entity detection, language dynamics learning and future events prediction to name but a few. The 8th edition of the TextGraphs workshop aimed to be a new step in the series, focused on issues and solutions for large-scale graphs, such as those derived for web-scale knowledge acquisition or social networks. We encouraged the description of novel NLP problems or applications that have emerged in recent years which can be addressed with graph-based solutions, as well as novel graph-based solutions to known NLP tasks. Continuing to bring together researchers interested in Graph Theory applied to Natural Language Processing, provides an environment for further integration of graph-based solutions into NLP tasks. A deeper understanding of new theories of graph-based algorithms is likely to help create new approaches and widen the usage of graphs for NLP applications. This edition of the TextGraphs workshop took place on October 18th",", 2013, in Seattle, WA, immediately preceding the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing – EMNLP 2013. This volume contains papers accepted for presentation at the workshop. We issued calls for regular papers, short late–breaking papers, and demos. After careful review by the program committee of the 15 submissions received – 12 regular papers, 2 short papers and 1 demo – 8 regular papers, 2 short papers and 1 demo were accepted for presentation. The accepted papers address varied problems – from theoretical and general considerations, to NLP and also \"real-world\" applications - through interesting variations in known and also novel graph-based methods. We are thankful to the members of the program committee, who have provided high quality reviews in a timely fashion despite the holiday season, and all submissions have benefited from this expert feedback. We were lucky to have two excellent speakers for this year’s event. We thank Oren Etzioni and Pedro Domingos for their enthusiastic acceptance and presentations.
