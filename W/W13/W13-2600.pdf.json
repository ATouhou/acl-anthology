The CMCL workshop series provides a unique venue for work on the interdisciplinary field of computational psycholinguistics, described by ACL Lifetime Achievement Award recipient Martin Kay as “build[ing] models of language that reflect in some interesting way on the ways in which people use language”. This workshop series builds on the tradition of earlier meetings, including the 1997 computational psycholinguistics meeting at the 1997 Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society in Berkeley, CA, and on the Incremental Parsing workshop held in 2004 at the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics. We received nineteen submissions to the 2013 CMCL workshop, of which we accepted eleven for final appearance in the conference program. The overall quality of workshop submissions was extremely strong, reflecting the perennially increasing quality of work in this field. This year we also expanded the workshop by including keynote talks from two invited speakers, Dr Sharon Goldwater from the University of Edinburgh and Professor Rick Lewis from the University of Michigan, leading researchers in computational psycholinguistics. We would like to thank all submitting authors for allowing us to consider their work, the program committee for an outstanding job in reviewing and discussing submissions, and of course our invited speakers. We also gratefully acknowledge funding from the Cognitive Science Society for the Best Student Paper award, and to the Cluster of Excellence on “Multimodal Computing and Interaction” for assisting with funding of our invited speakers. Many thanks to all of you for your continued support of this workshop.
