Each domain is allocated a separate section of the workshop. The three domains are:","• Multilingual multi-document summarization: Summarization, especially from multiple documents, has received increasing attention during the last years. This is mostly due to the increasing volume and redundancy of available online information. Recently, more and more interest arises for methods that will be able to function on a variety of languages. Multilingual multi-document summarization is the domain that researches such methods and studies their requirements and intricacies.","• Multilingual summary evaluation: Summary evaluation has been an open question for several years, even though there exist methods that correlate well to human judgment, when called upon to compare systems. In the multilingual setting, it is not obvious that these methods will perform equally well to the English language setting. In fact, some preliminary results have shown that several problems may arise in the multilingual setting [1]. This section of the workshop aims to cover and discuss these research problems and corresponding solutions.","• Multilingual summarization data collection and exploitation: The collection of multi-lingual corpora for summarization and summarization evaluation offers a challenge in itself. This section of the workshop works towards well-defined practices for the collection of such data, as well as the implementation and use of community tools for the support of the collection process. Furthermore, this section will include a discussion on how we can maximize the effect of the generated corpora in favor or the scientific community."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["[1] Giannakopoulos, G., El-Haj, M., Favre, B., Litvak, M., Steinberger, J., and Varma, V.
