The rules of the translation models are usually learned from word aligned parallel corpora. Synchronous grammars also induce alignments between words in the bitext when simultaneously recognizing words via the application of a synchronous rule (Wu, 1997). Due to their central role, it is important that a synchronous grammar formalism is powerful enough to generate all alignment configurations that occur in hand-aligned parallel corpora (i) a b c d b d a c (ii) a b a1 b1 a2 b2 (iii) a1 b a2 b1 a b2 Figure 1: (i) inside-out alignment (Wu, 1997); (ii) cross-serial discontinuous translation unit (Søgaard and Kuhn, 2009); (iii) bonbon alignment (Simard et al., 2005) that are taken to be a gold standard of translational equivalence (Wellington et al., 2006).","The empirical adequacy of phrase-based and SCFG-based translation models has been put into question (Wellington et al., 2006; Søgaard and Kuhn, 2009; Søgaard and Wu, 2009; Søgaard, 2010) because they are unable to induce certain alignment configurations. In the alignments in Figure 1, the translation units a, b, c, and d cannot be independently generated by a binary SCFG. Due to a reordering component, phrase-based systems can handle (i), but neither (ii) nor (iii). Those phenomena however occur relatively frequently in hand-aligned parallel corpora. Wellington et al. (2006) found that complex structures such as inside-out alignments occur in 5% of English-Chinese sentence pairs and in the study of Søgaard and Kuhn (2009) between 1.6% (for Danish-English data) and 12.1% (for Danish-Spanish data) of all translation units are discontinuous, i.e. not derivable by ITGs in normal form.","As Wellington et al. (2006) already noted for inside-out alignments, discontinuous constituents are required for binary synchronous derivations of the alignment configurations under consideration. This is illustrated in Figure 2: the yields of A 2 68 (i) (iii)A 4 A 3 A 2 A 1 a b c d b d a c A 1 A 2 A 3 A 4 A 3 A 2A 1 a1 b a2 b1 a b2 A 1A 2 A 3 Figure 2: Synchronous derivations: co-indexed non-terminals are generated synchronously. Note that many other derivations that induce the same alignment structures are possible, but all of them involve at least one discontinuous constituent. and A 3 in (i) are discontinuous on the target side, in (iii) the yield of A 1 is discontinuous on the source side and the yield of A 2 is discontinuous on the target side. We therefore propose to augment tree-based approaches such that they can account for discontinuous constituents in the source and/or target derivation. This implies going beyond the power of context-free grammars.","In the monolingual parsing community, linear context-free rewriting systems (LCFRS) have been established as an appropriate formalism for the modeling of discontinuous structure (Maier and Lichte, 2011; Kuhlmann and Satta, 2009). LCFRS is an extension of CFG, in which non-terminals can span k ≥ 1 continuous blocks of a string. k is termed the fan-out of the non-terminal. If k = 1 for all non-terminals, the grammar is a CFG. Recent work shows that probabilistic data-driven parsing with LCFRS is indeed feasible and gives acceptable results (Maier, 2010; Evang and Kallmeyer, 2011; van Cranenburgh, 2012; Maier et al., 2012; Kallmeyer and Maier, 2013). It seems timely to transfer these findings to statistical machine translation.","In this work, we introduce the notion of synchronous LCFRS for translation and show how the alignments in Figure 1 are induced. Since the parsing complexity of LCFRS, and thus of synchronous LCFRS as well, depends directly on k, the number of blocks that a non-terminal in the grammar may span, an investigation concerning the empirically required k is carried out on manually aligned data. For this purpose, we present a parallel parser for an all-accepting synchronous LCFRS that is used to validate hierarchical alignments for a given k. This extends the work of Wellington et al. (2006) and Søgaard (2010) from a methodological point of view, as will be explained in Section 5. In particular, we will revise the results that Søgaard (2010) presented concerning the coverage of ITG. Our experiments furthermore include data sets that have not been used in previous similar studies."]},{"title":"2 Synchronous LCFRS for Translation 2.1 LCFRS","paragraphs":["An LCFRS1","(Vijay-Shanker et al., 1987; Weir, 1988) is a tuple G = (N, T, V, P, S) where N is a finite set of non-terminals with a function dim: N → N determining the fan-out of each A ∈ N ; T and V are disjoint finite sets of terminals and variables; S ∈ N is the start symbol with dim(S) = 1; and P is a finite set of rewriting rules","A(α1, . . . , αdim(A)) → A1(X (1) 1 , . . . , X (1) dim(A1)) · · · Am(X (m) 1 , . . . , X (m) dim(Am)) where A, A1, . . . , Am ∈ N , X","(i)","j ∈ V for 1 ≤ i ≤ m, 1 ≤ j ≤ dim(Ai) and αi ∈ (T ∪ V )∗","for 1 ≤ i ≤ dim(A), for a rank m ≥ 0. For all r ∈ P , every variable X in r occurs exactly once in the lefthand side (LHS) and exactly once in the right-hand side (RHS) of r. r describes how the yield of the LHS non-terminal is computed from the yields of the RHS non-terminals. The yield of S is the language of the grammar. Figure 3 shows a sample LCFRS with more explanations.","The rank of G is the maximal rank of any of its rules, and its fan-out is the maximal fan-out of any of its non-terminals. G is called a (u, v)-LCFRS if it has rank u and fan-out v. 2.2 Synchronous LCFRS We define synchronous LCFRS (SLCFRS) in parallel to synchronous CFG, see for example Satta 1 We use the syntax of simple range concatenation grammars","(Boullier, 1998), a formalism that is equivalent to LCFRS. 69","A(ab, cd) → ε ⟨ab, cd⟩ in yield of A","A(aXb, cY d) → A(X, Y ) if ⟨X, Y ⟩ in yield of A,","then also ⟨aXb, cY d⟩ in","yield of A","S(XY ) → A(X, Y ) if ⟨X, Y ⟩ in yield of A,","then ⟨XY ⟩ in yield of S","Figure 3: Sample LCFRS for L = {an","bn cn","dn","| n > 0} and Peserico (2005). An SLCFRS is a tuple G = (Ns, Nt, Ts, Tt, Vs, Vt, P, Ss, St) where Ns, Ts, Vs, Ss, resp. Nt, Tt, Vt, St are defined as for LCFRS. They denote the alphabets for the source and target side respectively. P is a finite set of synchronous rewriting rules ⟨rs, rt, ∼⟩ where rs and rt are LCFRS rewriting rules based on Ns, Ts, Vs and Nt, Tt, Vt respectively, and ∼ is a bijective mapping of the non-terminals in the RHS of rs to the non-terminals in the RHS of rt. This link relation is represented by co-indexation in the synchronous rules. During a derivation, the yields of two co-indexed non-terminals have to be explained from one synchronous rule. ⟨Ss, St⟩ is the start pair.","We call the tuple (Ns, Ts, Vs, Ps, Ss) the source side grammar Gs and (Nt, Tt, Vt, Pt, St) the target side grammar Gt where Ps is the set of all rs in P and Pt is the set of all rt in P . The rank u of G is the maximal rank of Gs and Gt, and the fan-out v of G is the sum of the fan-outs of Gs and Gt. We will sometimes write vvGs|vG","t","to make clear how the fan-out of G is distributed over the source and the target side. As in the monolingual case, a corresponding grammar G is called a (u, v)-SLCFRS.","As an example consider the rules in Figure 4. They translate cross-serial dependencies into nested ones. The rank of the corresponding grammar is 2 and its fan-out 42|2.","Note that instead of defining an SLCFRS, one could also set the fan-out of each non-terminal in an LCFRS to ≥ 2, set dim(S) = 2, and formulate synchronization between the arguments of the non-terminals. The main disadvantage is that this requires Ns = Nt. Furthermore, this seems less perspicuous than SLCFRS when moving from SCFG to mild context-sensitivity. Generalized Multitext Grammar (Melamed et al., 2004) is another weakly equivalent grammar formalism.","In correspondence to ITG and normal-form ITG (NF-ITG) (Søgaard and Wu, 2009), we say an ⟨A(a, c) → ε , C(a, c) → ε⟩ ⟨B(b, d) → ε , D(bd) → ε⟩ ⟨A(aX, cZ) → A 1 (X, Z) , C(aX, Zc) → C 1 (X, Z)⟩ ⟨B(bY, dU) → B 1 (Y, U) , D(bY d) → D 1 (Y )⟩ ⟨S(XY ZU) → A 1 (X, Z)B 2 (Y, U) , S(XY Z) → C 1 (X, Z)D 2 (Y )⟩","Figure 4: Sample SLCFRS for L =","{⟨an","bm","cn dm , an","bm","dm","cn","⟩ | n, m > 0} SLCFRS G is in normal form if the following two conditions hold: (a) the rank of G is at most 2 and (b) for all r ∈ P it holds that the LHS arguments of rs and rt contain either terminals or variables, but no mixture of both. The grammar in Figure 4 is not in normal form.","While ITGs constrain the order of the non-terminals in the RHS of the target side to be in the same or in the reverse order compared to the non-terminals in the RHS of the source side, we do not impose such ordering constraints (on the variables) for SLCFRS. However, it is obvious that a (2, 21|1)- SLCFRS is equivalent to an ITG of rank 2 and that a (2, 21|1)-SLCFRS in normal form is equivalent to a NF-ITG. 2.3 Alignment Capacity A translation unit is a maximally connected subgraph of a given alignment structure. Typically this is the smallest unit from which translation models are learned. During a synchronous derivation, we interpret simultaneously recognized terminals as aligned (Wu, 1997). They thus correspond to a translation unit. We call the synchronous derivation tree a hierarchical alignment. Many-to-many alignments are interpreted conjunctively. This means that to induce a given translation unit, a grammar has to be able to generate the complete translation unit, and not just one of the corresponding word alignments. The last point has been argued for in Søgaard and Kuhn (2009).","SLCFRS are able to induce the alignment structures under consideration (in Figure 1). This is exemplified by the rules given in Figure 5.","Clearly, there exist many different possible hierarchical alignments for a given alignment structure. The underlying constraints for the grammars in Figure 5 are (a) each translation unit is represented by 70 (i) ⟨A(a) → ε , A(a) → ε⟩ ⟨A(Xb) → A 1 (X) , A(b, Y ) → A 1 (Y )⟩ ⟨A(Xc) → A 1 (X) , A(Y1, Y2c) → A 1 (Y1, Y2)⟩ ⟨A(Xd) → A 1 (X) , A(Y1dY2) → A 1 (Y1, Y2)⟩ (ii) ⟨A(a) → ε , A(a1, a2) → ε⟩ ⟨A(Xb) → A 1 (X) , A(Y1b1Y2b2) → A 1 (Y1, Y2)⟩ or ⟨A(b) → ε , A(b1, b2) → ε⟩ ⟨A(aX) → A 1 (X) , A(a1Y1a2Y2) → A 1 (Y1, Y2)⟩ (iii) ⟨A(a1, a2) → ε , A(a) → ε⟩ ⟨A(X1bX2) → A 1 (X1, X2) , A(b1Y b2) → A 1 (Y )⟩ or ⟨A(b) → ε , A(b1, b2) → ε⟩ ⟨A(a1Xa2) → A 1 (X) , A(Y1aY2) → A 1 (Y1, Y2)⟩ Figure 5: SLCFRS rules that induce the alignments in Figure 1. For (i) there are many other derivations possible, since there are 4! possibilities to combine the translation units in a binary way. The shown rules correspond to Figure 2(i). exactly one rule and (b) each rule aligns exactly one translation unit and combines it with at most one already established synchronous constituent.","ITG and NF-ITG do not generate the same class of alignments (Søgaard and Wu, 2009). In parallel, a (2, v)-SLCFRS in normal form does not generate the same class of alignments as an unrestricted (2, v)-SLCFRS. Consider, for example, a discontinuous translation unit d with two gaps on the source side and a grammar G with fan-out 32|1. G in normal form cannot induce d. In general, for generating x gaps, a fan-out of x + 1 is required. However, without the normal form requirement, G can possibly induce d with a rule that combines the terminals of d with the constituents that fill the gaps. 2.4 Parsing Complexity LCFRS in normal form can be parsed in O(n3k",") where k is the fan-out of the grammar (Seki et al., 1991). This result can be transferred to SLCFRS: An SLCFRS with fan-out v is essentially an LCFRS with fan-out v + 1. However, because of the start non-terminal S with dim(S) = 2, all non-terminals A ∈ N with dim(A) ≥ 2 and the special interpretation of the source/target side meaning that variables occur either on the source or target side but ⟨T (αs) → ε , T (βt) → ε⟩ ⟨A(α1) → T 1 (α1) , A(β1) → T 1 (β1)⟩ ⟨A(α1) → A 1 (α2)A 2 (α3) , A(β1) → A 1 (β2)A 2 (β3)⟩","where αs ∈ (Ts∗ )k 0",", β","t ∈ (Tt∗ )k′ 0",", αi ∈ (Vs+ )k j , β i ∈","(Vt+ )k′ j","for 0 < kj ≤ ks, 0 < k′ j ≤ kt, 0 < i ≤ 3, 0 ≤ j ≤ 3 Figure 6: All-accepting SCLFRS in normal form with fan-out v = ks + kt cannot change sides, no items that cross or involve the additional gap have to be built during parsing. Bitext parsing with SLCFRS in normal form can therefore also be performed in O(n3v",") where n = max(ns, nt), or more specifically O(n 3vGs s n 3vG","t t )","where ns, nt are the lengths of the source and tar-","get input strings respectively."]},{"title":"3 Empirical Investigation","paragraphs":["Since parsing complexity with SLCFRS is determined by the fan-out v of the grammar, we conduct an investigation to find out which v would be required to fully cover the alignment configurations that occur in manually aligned parallel corpora. 3.1 Bottom-Up Hierarchical Aligner Our study is based on alignment validation (Søgaard, 2010), i.e. we check whether an alignment structure can be generated by an all-accepting SLCFRS with a specific v. Such a grammar is depicted in Figure 6. Note in particular that it leaves open how to compose the yield of the LHS non-terminal from the two RHS constituents. To be able to use the grammar for parsing, one would have to spell out all combination possibilities.","Instead, we use the idea of a bottom-up hierarchical aligner (Wellington et al., 2006). It works very much like a synchronous parser, but the constraints for inferences are the word alignments and potentially other things, and not the rewriting rules of a grammar. Initial constituents are built from the word alignments, then constituents are combined with each other. The goal is to find a constituent that completely covers the input. In our case, the constraints for the hierarchical aligner come from the translation units, the fan-out vks|kt of the simulated grammar and possibly a normal-form requirement.","We specify the hierarchical aligner in terms of a deduction system (Shieber et al., 1995). Deduc-71 tion rules have the form A1...Am","B C where A1 . . . Am and B are items, i.e. intermediate parsing results, and C is a list of conditions on A1 . . . Am and B. The interpretation is that if A1 . . . Am can be deduced and conditions C hold, then B can be deduced. Our items have the form ⟨[Xs, ρs], [Xt, ρt]⟩ where Xs ∈ Ns and Xt ∈ Nt of the simulated grammar. All-accepting grammars usually have only one non-terminal symbol, but we need a distinction between pre-terminal constituents T and general constituents A for simulating SLCFRS in normal form as well as the full class. ρs and ρt characterize the spans of the synchronous constituent on the source and target side respectively. We view them as bit vectors where ρs(i) = 1 means that si is in the yield of Xs, and ρt(i′",") = 1 that t","i′ is in the yield of Xt. ⟨s0...n, t0...n′⟩ is the input sentence pair that is segmented into m disjoint translation units ⟨D (m) s , D (m) t ⟩ based on the given word alignment","structure. D (m) s and D","(m)","t are sets of word indices into s and t respectively. We furthermore specify some useful operations for bit vectors. The ∪ operator combines bit vectors of the same length to a new bit vector by an elementwise or operation, while the intersection ∩ of two bit vectors is the elementwise and operation. 0l","is a bit vector ρ such that ρ(i) = 0 for all 0 ≤ i ≤ l. The function b(ρ) returns the number of blocks of ρ, i.e. the number of continuous sequences of 1s in ρ.","Figure 7 shows the deduction rules of the hierarchical aligner that simulate an all-accepting SLCFRS in normal form. Scan builds T items from translation units, Unary creates A items from T items, and Binary combines two A items to a larger A item. Via the side conditions, A items are only created if they respect the specified fan-out vks|kt of the all-accepting grammar. If the hierarchical aligner finds an A item that spans ⟨s, t⟩, the alignment structure of ⟨s, t⟩ is valid, i.e. can be induced by an SLCFRS in normal form with fan-out vks|kt.","Since we are also interested in the empirical alignment capacity of SLCFRS without normal-form restriction, we present an extended deduction system in Figure 8. The additional rules lead to the simu-lation of an SLCFRS of rank 2 where terminals and variables can be combined in the arguments of the LHS non-terminals of the rewriting rules. Note in particular that the generation of T items is not constrained by a maximally allowed vks|kt.","For the computation of the items, we use standard chart parsing techniques, maintaining a chart and an agenda. 3.2 Data We use manually aligned parallel corpora for our study.2","Data sets that have already been previously used in similar experiments, e.g. in Wellington et al. (2006), Søgaard and Wu (2009), and Søgaard (2010), are those from Martin et al. (2005) for English-Romanian and English-Hindi, the English-French data from Mihalcea and Pedersen (2003), the Europarl data set described in Graca̧ et al. (2008) for the six combinations of English, French, Portuguese and Spanish, the English-German Europarl data that was created for Padó and Lapata (2006), and data sets with Danish as the source language that are part of the Parole corpus of the Copenhagen Dependency Treebank (Buch-Kromann et al., 2009).","We furthermore perform our study on data sets that, to the best of our knowledge, have not been evaluated in a similar setting before. Those are English-Swedish gold alignments documented in Holmqvist and Ahrenberg (2011), the English-Inuktitut data used in Martin et al. (2005), more English-German data3",", the English-Spanish data set in Lambert et al. (2005) and English-Dutch alignments that are part of the Dutch Parallel Corpus (Macken, 2010). Characteristics about the data sets are presented in the last columns of Table 1. 3.3 Method We apply the bottom-up hierarchical alignment algorithm in various configurations to each manually aligned sentence pair. If a goal item is found, the alignment structure can be induced with the formalism in question. We measure the number of sentence pairs for which a hierarchical alignment was reached over the total number of sentence pairs. Søgaard (2010) refers to this as alignment reachability, which is the inverse of parse failure rate (Wellington et al., 2006). 2 Whenever there are sure (S) and possible (P) alignments","annotated, we use both. 3 By T.

The numbers in parentheses are the sentence length cut-offs used in our experiments. The results marked with * are not directly comparable to ours because different versions of the data sets were used. 73 3.4 Results Table 1 shows the results. It confirmes that NF-ITG is not capable of generating the majority of alignment configurations. However, when allowing discontinuous constituents with maximally two blocks on each side (v = 42|2), NF-SLCFRS in-duces all alignments present in six of the data sets, and reaches scores > 97 for the other data sets, except two of them for which scores are still > 94.7.","For grammars without normal-form constraint, alignment reachability is generally higher. We tested grammars of rank 2 and found that over 90% of the sentence pairs in each data set can be induced without the necessity of discontinuous constituents (except data set Schoen.). Such grammars roughly correspond to successfully applied translation models, e.g. in Hiero (Chiang, 2007). Nevertheless, our experiments show that the gold alignments contain a proportion of structures that cannot be generated by ITGs. With a (2, 42|2)-SLCFRS, all occurring alignment configurations are captured. For some data sets, a fan-out of 3 is enough to induce all alignments. This is indicated by 1|2","and","2|1.","Going back to grammars in normal form, the sentence pairs that cannot be induced with a grammar of fan-out 42|2 all display translation units that require three (or very rarely four) blocks on at least the source or the target side. An interesting observa-tion is that only the English-Inuktitut data can nevertheless be generated with fan-out 4, by distribut-ing the allowed discontinuity unequally: with a NF-SLCFRS with fan-out 43|1, the alignment reachability is 100. This is not surprising given the fact that Inuktitut is a polysynthetic language.","Previous results by Søgaard (2010) concerning the coverage of ITG and NF-ITG on hand-aligned data, repeated for convenience in Table 1, are much lower than ours and therefore present a highly distorted picture concerning the empirical need of discontinuous constituents. This is due to the fact that the implementation4","used for the experiments handles unaligned words incorrectly. They are added deterministically to the first constituent that encounters them, which leads to false negatives as further explained in Figure 9. After fixing this issue, the same results as for NF-SLCFRS with v = 21|1 are 4 http://cst.dk/anders/itg-search.html [ ] 6 [ ] 5 [ ] 4 [ ] 1 [ ] 2 [ ] 3 a b c d a’ b’ c’ d’ [ ] 1 [ ] 2 [ ] 3 [ ] 4 [ ] 5 [ ] 6 Figure 9: Synchronous ITG parse chart provided by the implementation from Søgaard (2010): c “belongs to” constituent 6 while c’ “belongs to” constituent 5 . When trying to combine 4 and 3 , c and c’ are not considered as unaligned because they are already part of a constituent, and neither 5 nor 6 can be combined with 3 without creating a discontinuous constituent. The algorithm cannot find a larger continuous constituent, the alignment validation therefore returns false. However, this simple alignment structure lies within the power of NF-ITG and ITG. obtained. Another problem of the implementation concerns discontinuous translation units. Søgaard’s alignment validation returns false if the words in the gap are aligned, although such configurations are induced by unrestricted ITG, see Søgaard and Wu (2009, Section 3.2.1)."]},{"title":"4 Discussion","paragraphs":["Our experiments show that by moving from synchronous grammars with only continuous constituents to grammars that allow two blocks per constituent, (almost) all manual alignments can be generated, depending on whether the normal-form is enforced or not. Given the parsing complexity that comes with allowing discontinuities, this is a promising finding since it has already been shown for monolingual parsing that restricting the fan-out to 2 drastically reduces parsing times (Maier et al., 2012). In the future, we might also investigate whether refraining from ill-nested structures (Maier and Lichte, 2011) is a reasonable option for tree-based machine translation in order to reduce complexity (Gómez-Rodrı́guez et al., 2010).","Even though bitext parsing complexity for SLCFRS is prohibitively high, we expect that, given the techniques that have been developed for translation with SCFG, SLCFRS finds its application as a 74 translation model. In practice, only source side parsing is performed for translation and various prun-ing methods are applied to reduce the search space (e.g. in Chiang (2005), Yamada and Knight (2002) and many others).","It should also be mentioned that it is not clear yet how alignment reachability scores relate to machine translation quality and evaluation. We can nevertheless infer from the presented results that what is considered as translationally equivalent by the annotators of the data sets and their guidelines is beyond the search space of SCFG. A supplementary study could furthermore investigate translation unit error rates (Søgaard and Kuhn, 2009) for the data sets, under the assumption of a hierarchical SLCFRS alignment with a specific fan-out."]},{"title":"5 Related Work","paragraphs":["Our empirical investigation extends previous studies, and thus provides new insights. Both Wellington et al. (2006) and Søgaard (2010) use a bottom-up hierarchical alignment algorithm with the goal of investigating the alignment complexity of manually aligned parallel corpora. Søgaard (2010) is however only interested in the alignment reachability of ITG and NF-ITG, and nothing beyond. We have furthermore revealed that the presented results underestimate the alignment capacity of ITG and NF-ITG.","The study of Wellington et al. (2006) is very similar to ours in that the number of blocks in discontinuous constituents that are required for hierarchical alignment are investigated. The word alignments are however treated disjunctively, which means that in the case of n-to-m alignments with n, m ≥ 1, it is enough to induce one of the involved alignments. With this methodology a large class of discontinuities we are interested in, e.g. cross-serial discontinuous translation units, is ignored. The failure rates they present are therefore much lower than ours. Wellington et al. (2006) also show that when constraining synchronous derivations by monolingual syntactic parse trees on the source and/or target side, allowing discontinuous constituents becomes even more important for inducing gold alignments.","We are of course not the first to propose a translation model that is expressive enough to induce the alignments in question in Figure 1. Following up on a translation model proposed by Simard et al. (2005), Galley and Manning (2010) extend the phrase-based approach in that they allow for discontinuous phrase pairs. Their system outperforms a phrase-based system and a system based on SCFG of rank 2. In a way, our proposal to use SLCFRS is the syntax-based counterpart to their approach. Methods to integrate linguistic constituency information into the so far only formal tree-based approach can be directly transferred from the SCFG-based approaches to SLCFRS. In constrast, it is not obvious how to include such information into the phrase-based systems.","Søgaard (2008) proposes to use an even more expressive formalism than LCFRS, namely range concatenation grammar, and to exploit its ability to copy substrings during the derivation. The downsides of this approach are already mentioned in Søgaard and Kuhn (2009); for example, no tight probability estimation is possible for such a grammar.","The necessity of going towards mildly contextsensitive formalisms for translation modeling has also been advocated by Melamed (Melamed et al., 2004; Melamed, 2004). This step was however not motivated by the induction of specific complex translation units, but rather by the general observation that discontinuous constituents are necessary for synchronous derivations using linguistically motivated grammars. Discontinuous constituents also emerge when binarizing synchronous grammars of continuous yields with rank ≥ 4 (Melamed, 2003; Rambow and Satta, 1999)."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion","paragraphs":["Motivated by the finding that synchronous CFG cannot induce certain alignment configurations, we suggest to use synchronous LCFRS instead, which allows for discontinuities. Even though our empirical investigation shows that with exclusively continuous derivations more manual alignments can be captured than previously reported, there are still many aligned sentence pairs that can only be generated when setting the fan-out of the translation grammar to > 2. It remains to determine how such more accurate and more expressive models relate to translation quality. 75"]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["I would like to thank Laura Kallmeyer and Wolfgang Maier for discussions and comments, the reviewers for their suggestions, Anders Søgaard for discussions concerning ITG and his implementation, and Zdeněk Žabokrtský for helping with the CDT data.
