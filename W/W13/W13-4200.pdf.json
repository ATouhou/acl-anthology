SocialNLP is a new inter-disciplinary area of natural language processing (NLP) and social computing. We consider three plausible directions of SocialNLP: (1) addressing issues in social computing using NLP techniques; (2) solving NLP problems using information from social networks or social media; and (3) handling new problems related to both social computing and natural language processing. Through this workshop, we anticipate to provide a platform for research outcome presentation and head-to-head discussion in the area of SocialNLP, with the hope to combine the insight and experience of prominent researchers from both NLP and social computing domains to contribute to the area of SocialNLP jointly. Also, we have come to an agreement with International Journal of Computational Linguistics and Chinese Language Processing (IJCLCLP) to select some high quality papers from SocialNLP to publish in this journal. The submissions to this year workshop were again of high quality and we had a competitive selection process. We received 19 submissions, and due to a rigorous review process, we only accept 6 of them. Thus the acceptance rate is 31%. The accepted papers cover a broad range of SocialNLP-related topics, such as audience prediction, sentiment analysis, metaphor detection, opinion mining, and trust evaluation. We have totally 20 reviewers. We appreciate our PC members for the timely reviews and constructive comments. We are delighted to have Prof. Yohei Seki, from University of Tsukuba, as our keynote speaker. We especially thanks the Workshop Committee Chairs Prof. Naoaki Okazaki and Dr. Scott Wen-tau Yih. We hope you enjoy the workshop!
