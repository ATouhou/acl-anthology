SPMRL is endorsed by the ACL SIGPARSE and SIGLEX interest groups and provides a forum for research in parsing morphologically-rich languages, with the goal of identifying cross-cutting issues in the annotation and parsing methodology for such languages, which typically have more flexible word order and/or higher word-form variation than English. SPMRL has also been host to discussions on realistic and appropriate evaluation methods that can be applied in the face of morphological and/or segmentation ambiguities; these discussions have culminated in the first shared task for parsing morphologically-rich languages, co-located with SPMRL 2013. The proceedings include nine contributions to the workshop as well as the system descriptions from the shared task. The workshop included keynote talks by Julia Hockenmaier from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and by Jinho Choi from IPSoft (New York). We would like to thank all submitting authors for their contributions, the program committee for their fine work on reviewing the submissions, the participants of the shared task for their contributions and of course our invited speaker. For their precious help preparing the SPMRL 2013 Shared Task and for allowing their data to be part of it, we warmly thank and the Linguistic Data Consortium, the Knowledge Center for Processing Hebrew (MILA), the Ben Gurion University, Columbia University, Institute of Computer Science (Polish Academy of Sciences), Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, University of the Basque Country, University of Lisbon, Uppsala University, University of Stuttgart, University of Szeged and University Paris Diderot (Paris 7). Finally, we would also like to thank the ACL SIGPARSE and SIGLEX interest groups for their endorsement, for the support of INRIA’s Alpage project, and everybody who participated in the workshop and contributed to the discussions.
