Following the first three very successful ACL workshops on issues in teaching computational linguistics and natural language processing (in 2002, 2005 and 2008, http://www.teachingnlp.org), we meet together again to discuss the recent advances in educational tools and methodologies for this field and our contributors’ experience with novel assignments, targeting various student populations, and integrating the teaching of computational linguistics into other courses and classroom activities. In view of the fact that this year’s ACL is held in Bulgaria, the second country (after the Soviet Union) to introduce linguistic Olympiads for secondary school students as a way of acquainting them and the general public with the science of language and the associated applied areas, this workshop has a special focus on Olympiads in linguistics and especially computational linguistics. We will talk about the basics, the composition of problems, the experience of some countries that have joined the linguistic Olympic community relatively recently and of the challenges of the young but dynamic International Linguistics Olympiad. We will discuss how computational linguistic problems illustrate fundamental or applied issues in natural language processing, rather than individual languages or linguistic theory. Although this variety of the self-sufficient linguistic problem has always had a presence at linguistic contests, in the US and the other Anglophone countries it has become a primary feature, and its development is of eminent interest. In addition to six papers in the special section on Olympiads in (Computational) Linguistics and seven in the general one on Teaching Natural Language Processing, the program of the workshop includes two panels. We thank all authors who submitted papers to the workshop as well as the members of the program committee and the panelists.
