The motivation for convening the Workshops is clear. On one hand, the languages from the Balto-Slavic group play an important role due to their widespread use and diverse cultural heritage. The languages are spoken by over 400 million speakers worldwide. The recent political and economic developments in Central and Eastern Europe bring Balto-Slavic societies and their languages into new focus in terms of rapid technological advancement and expanding consumer markets. In the context of the European Union, the Balto-Slavic group today constitutes about one third of its official languages. On the other hand, research on theoretical and applied NLP in many of the Balto-Slavic languages is still in its early stages. The advent of the Internet in the 1990’s established the dominant role of English in science, popular culture, and other areas of on-line activity, which further weakened the presence of Balto-Slavic languages. Consequently, in comparison to English, there is a dire lack of resources, processing tools and applications for most of these languages, especially the smaller ones. Despite this “minority” status, the Balto-Slavic languages offer a wealth of fascinating scientific and technical challenges for researchers to work on. The linguistic phenomena specific to Balto-Slavic languages—such as rich morphological inflection and relatively free word order—present highly intriguing and non-trivial problems for construction of NLP tools for these languages, and require richer morphological and syntactic resources to be exploited. In this direction, the invited talk by Kiril Simov on “Ontologies and Linked Open Data for Acquisition and Exploitation of Language Resources” presents methods for acquisition of language resources from different types of on-line and off-line data sources. The goal of this Workshop was to bring together academic researchers and industry practitioners who work on NLP for Balto-Slavic languages. It is our hope that the Workshop would further stimulate research on NLP for these languages and foster the creation of tools for them. The Workshop gives the researchers a forum for exchange of ideas and experience, for discussion difficult-to-tackle problems, and for making new resources more widely-known. One fascinating aspect of this sub-family of languages is their structural similarity, as well as an easily recognisable lexical and inflectional inventory spanning the entire group, which—despite the lack of mutual intelligibility—creates a special environment in which researchers can fully appreciate the shared problems and solutions, and communicate in a natural way. This Workshop continues the proud tradition established by previous BSNLP Workshops: 1. the First BSNLP Workshop, held in conjunction with ACL 2007 Conference in Prague;","2. the Second BSNLP Workshop, held in conjunction with IIS 2009: Intelligent Information Systems, in Kraków, Poland;","3. the Third BSNLP Workshop, held in conjunction with TSD 2011, 14th International Conference on Text, Speech and Dialogue in Plzeň, Czech Republic. This year we received 31 submissions—a 50% increase over the First BSNLP Workshop in 2007. Of these, 16 were accepted for presentation (resulting in an acceptance rate of 51%). Compared to the previous BSNLP workshops, this year we have more papers about higher-level tasks, such as information extraction and sentiment analysis. This hopefully shows a trend towards building useroriented applications for Balto-Slavic languages, in addition to working on lower-level NLP tools. Three papers discuss approaches to sentiment analysis and opinion mining. Five are about classic information extraction tasks: three on named entity recognition and two on event extraction. Two papers iii are about WordNets for different Slavic languages. Two papers are about morphological processing and parsing. The rest of the papers cover different topics, including acquisition of resources, keyword extraction, and lexicon analysis. The papers together cover nine different languages: 5 on Croatian, 4 on Russian, 2 each on Bulgarian, Polish and Slovene, and one each on Czech, Lithuanian and Serbian. We also accepted an interesting paper about named-entity recognition for Estonian—which, although it does not belong to the Balto-Slavic group, does belong to the Baltic area, and has morphological complexity at least matching that of the Baltic and Slavic languages. It is our sincere hope that this work will help further stimulate the growth of this rich and exciting field.","BSNLP Organizers: Jakub Piskorski (Polish Academy of Sciences) Lidia Pivovarova (University of Helsinki) Hristo Tanev (Joint Research Centre) Roman Yangarber (University of Helsinki) iv Organizers: Jakub Piskorski, Polish Academy of Sciences Lidia Pivovarova, University of Helsinki, and St.Petersburg State University, Russia Hristo Tanev, Joint Research Centre of the European Commission, Ispra, Italy Roman Yangarber, University of Helsinki, Finland Program Committee: Tania Avgustinova, University of Saarland, Germany Kalina Bontcheva, University of Sheffield, UK Pavel Braslavski, Kontur labs, and Ural Federal University, Russia Boris Dobrov, Moscow State University, Russia Tomaž Erjavec, Jozef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana, Slovenia Katja Filippova, Google, Zurich, Switzerland Radovan Garabik, Comenius University in Bratislava Tatiana Gornostay, Tilde, Riga, Latvia Maxim Gubin, Facebook Inc., Menlo Park CA Mikhail Kopotev, University of Helsinki, Finalnd Vladislav Kuboň, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic Olga Mitrofanova, St.Petersburg State University, Russia Karel Pala, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic Maciej Piasecki, Wrocław University of Technology, Poland Jakub Piskorski, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, Poland Lidia Pivovarova, Univeristy of Helsinki/St.Petersburg State University, Russia Adam Przepiórkowski, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, Poland Agata Savary, Université François Rabelais, Tours, France Kiril Simov, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Bulgaria Joseph Steinberger, University of West Bohemia, Plzeň, Czech Republic Pavel Straňák, Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic Stan Szpakowicz, University of Ottawa, Canada Marko Tadic, University of Zagreb, Croatia Hristo Tanev, Joint Research Centre, Ispra, Italy Roman Yangarber, University of Helsinki, Finalnd Invited Speaker: Kiril Simov, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Bulgaria v"]},{"title":"Table of Contents","paragraphs":["Invited Talk: Ontologies and Linked Open Data for Acquisition and Exploitation of Language Resources Kiril Simov . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1","A Comparison of Approaches for Sentiment Classification on Lithuanian Internet Comments Jurgita Kapočiutė-Dzikien ė, Algis Krupavičius and Tomas Krilavičius . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2","Evaluating Sentiment Analysis Systems in Russian Ilia Chetviorkin and Natalia Loukachevitch . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12","Aspect-Oriented Opinion Mining from User Reviews in Croatian Goran Glavaš, Damir Korenčić and Jan Šnajder . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 18","Frequently Asked Questions Retrieval for Croatian Based on Semantic Textual Similarity Mladen Karan, Lovro Žmak and Jan Šnajder . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 24","Parsing Russian: a hybrid approach Dan Skatov, Sergey Liverko, Vladimir Okatiev and Dmitry Strebkov . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 34","GPKEX: Genetically Programmed Keyphrase Extraction from Croatian Texts Marko Bekavac and Jan Šnajder . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 43","Lemmatization and Morphosyntactic Tagging of Croatian and Serbian Željko Agić, Nikola Ljubešić and Danijela Merkler . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 48","Modernizing historical Slovene words with character-based SMT Yves Scherrer and Tomaž Erjavec . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 58","Improving English-Russian sentence alignment through POS tagging and Damerau-Levenshtein distance Andrey Kutuzov . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 63","Identifying false friends between closely related languages Nikola Ljubešić and Darja Fišer . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 69","Named Entity Recognition in Estonian Alexander Tkachenko, Timo Petmanson and Sven Laur . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 78","On Named Entity Recognition in Targeted Twitter Streams in Polish.
