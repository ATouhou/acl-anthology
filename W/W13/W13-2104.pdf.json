(2007) extended the overgenerate-and-rank methodology (Langkilde and Knight, 1998; Mellish et al., 1998; Walker et al., 2002; Nakatsu and White, 2006) to complex information presentation tasks involving variation in rhetorical structure. They illustrated their approach by developing SPaRKy (Sentence Planning with Rhetorical Knowledge), a sentence planner for generating restaurant recommendations and comparisons in the context of the MATCH (Multimodal Access To City Help) system (Walker et al., 2004), and showed that SPaRKY can produce texts comparable to those of MATCH’s template-based generator.","Despite the evident importance of expressing contrast clearly in making comparisons among restaurants, Nakatsu (2008) surprisingly found that most of the examples involving contrastive connectives in the SPaRKy Restaurant Corpus (SRC) received low ratings by the human judges. Even though the low ratings were not necessarily directly attributable to the use of a contrastive connective in many cases, Nakatsu conjectured that the large proportion of low-rated examples containing contrastive connectives would make it difficult to train a ranker to learn to use contrastive connectives effectively without augmenting the corpus with better examples of contrast. Subsequently, Nakatsu and White (2010) proposed a set of enhancements to the SRC intended to better express contrast—including ones employ-ing multiple connectives in the same clause that are problematic for RST (Mann and Thompson, 1988)—and showed how they could be generated with Discourse Combinatory Categorial Grammar (DCCG), an extension of CCG (Steedman, 2000) designed to enable multi-sentence grammar-based generation. However, Nakatsu and White did not evaluate empirically whether these contrast enhancements were successful.","In this paper, we show that Nakatsu & White’s (2010) proposed SRC contrast enhancements do indeed make it possible to generate better texts: in particular, we present an initial experiment that shows that the oracle best restaurant recommendations including the contrast enhancements have significantly higher human ratings for naturalness than comparable texts without these enhancements, and which suggests that even a basic n-gram ranker trained on the enhanced recommendations can select texts with higher ratings. The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we review Nakatsu & White’s proposed enhancements to the SRC for better expressing contrast—including the use of structural connectives together with discourse adverbials—and how they can be generated with DCCG. In Sec-30 tion 3, we first present a validation experiment showing that naturalness ratings gathered on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (AMT) are comparable to those for the same texts in the original SRC; then, we present our method of generating and selecting a sample of new restaurant recommendation texts with and without the contrast enhancements for rating on AMT. In Section 4, we describe how we trained discriminative n-gram rankers using cross validation on the gathered ratings. In Section 5, we present the oracle and cross validation results in terms of mean scores of the top-ranked text. In Section 6, we analyze how the individual contrast enhancements affected the naturalness ratings and discuss issues that may be still hampering naturalness. Finally, in Section 7, we conclude with a summary and a discussion of possible ways of creating improved rankers in future work."]},{"title":"2 Enhancing Contrast with Discourse Combinatory Categorial Grammar","paragraphs":["Figure 1 (Nakatsu, 2008) shows examples from the SRC where some of the SPaRKy realizations are clearly more natural than others. In Nakatsu’s experiments, she found that the use of contrastive connectives was negatively correlated with human ratings, and that an n-gram ranker learned to disprefer texts containing these connectives. In an-alyzing these unexpected results, Nakatsu noted two factors that appeared to hamper the naturalness of the contrastive connective usage. First, consistent with Grote et al.’s (1995) observation that however and on the other hand (unlike but and while) signal that the clause they attach to is the more important one, we might expect realizations to be preferred when these connectives appear with the more desirable of the contrasted qualities. Such preferences do indeed appear to be present in the SRC: for example, in Figure 1, alts 8 & 13—where the better property is ordered second— are rated highly, while alts 7 & 11—where the better property is ordered first—are rated poorly. Nakatsu further observed that in human-authored comparisons, when the second clause expresses the lesser property, it is often qualified by only or just; consistent with this observation, alts 7 & 11 do seem to improve with the inclusion of these modifiers.","The second factor noted by Nakatsu that may contribute to the awkwardness of however and on the other hand is that both of these connectives seem to be rather “grand” for the rather simple contrasts in Figure 1, and may sound more natural when used with heavier arguments.","Based on these observations, Nakatsu and White (2010) proposed a set of enhancements to the SRC, all of which are exemplified in Figure 2.1 The enhancements include (i) optional summary statements that give an overall assessment of each restaurant based on the average of their property values, thereby allowing contrasts to be expressed over larger text spans; (ii) adverbial modifiers only, just and merely to express a lesser value of a given property than one mentioned earlier;2","(iii) the modifers also and too to signal the repetition of the same value for a given property (Striegnitz, 2004); and (iv) contrastive connectives for different properties of the same restaurant, exemplified here by the contrast between decent decor and mediocre food quality for Bienvenue.","In the text plan in Figure 2, <1>–<4> correspond to the propositions in the original SRC text plan and (1’)–(2’) are the new summary-level propositions. Following Webber et al. (2003), Nakatsu and White (2010) take only, merely, just, also, and too to be discourse adverbials, whose discourse relations are allowed to cut across the primary tree structure established by the other relations in the figure. Note that in addition to go-ing beyond RST’s limitation to tree-structured discourses, the example also contains clauses employing multiple discourse connectives, where one is a structural connective (such as however or while) and the other is a discourse adverbial.","To realize such texts, Nakatsu & White introduce Discourse Combinatory Categorial Grammar (DCCG), an extension of CCG (Steedman, 2000) to the discourse level. DCCG follows Discourse Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar (Webber, 2004) in providing a lexicalized treatment of structural connectives and discourse adverbials, but differs in doing so in a single CCG, rather than separate sentence-level and discourse-level grammars whose interaction is not straightforward. As such, DCCG requires no changes to the OpenCCG realizer (White, 2006b; White, 2006a; White and Ra-","1","In the text, words intended to help indicate similarities and contrasts are italicized.

During this process, a clause-combining operation may insert 1 of 7 connectives according to the RST relation that holds between two discourse units (i.e. inserting since or because for a JUSTIFY relation; and, however, on the other hand, while, or but for a CON-TRAST relation; or and for an INFER relation).","After each sentence plan is generated, it is realized by the RealPro surface realizer and the resulting realization is rated by two judges on a scale of 1-5, where 5 is highly preferred. These ratings are then averaged, producing a range of 9 possible ratings from {1, 1.5, ..., 5}. 2.2 Ratings/Connectives Correlation From the ratings of the examples in Figure 1, we can see that some of the SPaRKy sentence plan realizations seem more natural than others. Upon further analysis, we noticed that utterances containing many contrastive connectives seemed less preferred than those with fewer or no contrastive connectives.","To quantify this observation, we calculated the average number of connectives (aveci) used per realization with rating i, using aveci = T otalci/Nri, where T otalci is the total number of connectives in realizations with rating i, and Nri is the number of realizations with rating i.","We use Pearson’s r to calculate each correlation (in each case, df =7). For both COMPARE strategies (represented in Figure 2(a) and 2(b)), we find a significant negative correlation for the average number of connectives used in realizations with a given rating (C2: r = −0.97, p<0.01; and C3: r = −0.93, p<0.01). These correlations indicate that judges’ ratings decreased as the average frequency of the connectives increased.","Further analysis of the individual correlations used in the comparative strategies show that there is a significant negative correlation for however (C2: r = −0.91, p<0.01; and C3: r = −0.86, p<0.01) and on the other hand (C2: r = −0.89, p<0.01; and C3: r = −0.84, p<0.01) in both COMPARE strategies. In addition, in COMPARE-3, the frequencies of while and but are also significantly and strongly negatively correlated with the judges’ ratings (r = −0.86, p<0.01 and r = −0.90, p<0.01, respectively), though there is no such correlation between the use of these connectives and their ratings in COMPARE-2.","Added together, all the contrastive connectives show strong, significant negative correlations between their average frequencies and judges’ ratings for both comparative strategies (C2: r = −0.93, p<0.01; C3:r = −0.88, p<0.01).","Interestingly, unlike in the COMPARE strategies, there is a positive correlation (r =0.73,p > 0.05) between the judges’ ratings and the average frequency of all connectives used in the RECOMMEND strategy (see Figure 2(c)). Since this strategy only uses and, since, and because and does not utilize any contrastive connectives, this gives further evidence that only contrastive connectives are dispreferred. 2.3 N-gram Ranker and Features To acertain whether these contrastive connectives are being learned by the ranker, we re-implemented the n-gram ranker using SVM-light (Joachims, 77 Figure 1: Some alternative (Alt) realizations of SPaRKy sentence plans from a COMPARE2 (C2) plan, with averaged human ratings (Rating; 5 = highest rating) and ranks (Rank; 1 = top ranked) assigned by an n-gram ranker (Nakatsu, 2008) Generating with Discourse Combinatory Categorial Grammar /53 contrast",""," evidence",""," evidence",""," nucleus:(1’)","assert-summary (mod:good) infer","","","nucleus:(2’) assert-summary (mod:mediocre) {infer|contrast} "," nucleus:<1> assert-com-decor (mod:decent)","nucleus:<3> assert-com-food-","quality (mod:very good)  nucleus:<2> assert-com-decor (mod:decent)","nucleus:<4> assert-com-food-","quality (mod:mediocre)  merely additive merely","FIGURE 31 SPaRKy tp-tree altered with new relations and summary statements, corresponding to Example 50."]},{"title":"in bold font.

In general, as Webber (2006) observes, discourse grammars vary in their theoretical style, from wholly based on dependency relations (e.g. Halliday and Hasan 1976) to adherence to a completely constituent-based model (e.g. Rhetorical Structure Theory [RST], Mann and Thompson 1988; Linguistic Discourse Model, Polanyi 1988, Polanyi and van den Berg 1996). Dependency-based discourse theories are advantageous because they allow discourse relations to exist between non-adjacent discourse units, lifting restrictions on which clauses can serve as discourse arguments of a given relation.

As noted in the preceding section, the lexicalized categories for connectives offered therein suggest that there is no problem in principle with devising a purely lexicalized approach to discourse connectives; accordingly, the cue threading approach presented in this section appears to yield grammars with coverage equivalent to purely lexicalized alternatives. Nevertheless, as we have seen, the purely lexicalized approach leads to a proliferation of lexical category ambiguity, and while lexical rules might be employed to systematically assign the necessary lexical categories, the cue threading approach is clearly more economical. Similar considerations led Hockenmaier and Steedman (2002, 2007) to make extensive use of type-changing rules in their broad coverage grammar of English, indicating that such rules have an important role to play in practical grammars. Hockenmaier and Steedman further argued that the formal power of the system is unaffected as long as (i) only a finite number of unary rules are employed and (ii) the rules are designed so that they cannot recursively apply to their own output, as is the case here.

To illustrate how DCCG accomplishes this, consider (1) from Section 2, repeated below:","(1) b1: Bienvenue is a mediocre restaurant. h1: It has poor decor and mediocre food quality. b3: However, Sonia Rose is a good restaurant. h2: While it also has poor decor, h3: it has excellent food quality. As illustrated by the derivation of the clause for h2 in Figure 17, the preverbal modifier category for also in (40c) below takes a VP category se,CUE\\np as its argument and returns a VP category as its result, adding an additive relation to the semantics.","(40) a. also ⊢ se,CUE/⋄se,CUE/∗punc, :","@e(⟨Mod⟩(a ∧ additive-rel ∧⟨Arg1⟩e1))","b. also ⊢ se,CUE\\⋄se,CUE\\∗punc, :","@e(⟨Mod⟩(a ∧ additive-rel ∧⟨Arg1⟩e1))","c. also ⊢ se,CUE\\np/⋄(se,CUE\\np):","@e(⟨Mod⟩(a ∧ additive-rel ∧⟨Arg1⟩e1)) Since discourse adverbials such as also do not necessarily find their discourse arguments in structurally adjacent text segments, they do not use cue threading. Instead, the cue value on discourse adverbials is left underspecfied, as seen in all the lexical entries for also in (40). These underspecified values then unify with the cue value of the input category, threading any undischarged structural connectives through. In this way, a discourse adverbial and a structural connective can appear on the same clause (e.g. However, Bienvenue also has good decor ). In our example, the underspecified cue value of the argument category in (40c) is unified with the nil cue value from the input category Figure 4: DCCG derivation of a clause with the discourse adverbial also (Nakatsu and White, 2010) jkumar, 2009) in order to generate texts that vary in size from single sentences to entire paragraphs.","In DCCG, the technique of cue threading is used to allow structural connectives—including paired ones such as on the one hand . . . on the other hand—to project beyond the sentence level, while allowing no more than one to be active at a time. In this way, structural connectives can be nested, as sketched in Figure 3, but cannot cross. In the figure, the value of the cue feature for each text segment (ts) is shown (where ot1h and otoh abbreviate on the one hand and on the other hand); these cue values can be propagated through a derivation, allowing the discourse relations to project, but must be discharged (to nil) in a complete derivation, thereby ensuring that the intended discourse relations are actually realized. By contrast, discourse adverbials introduce their relations anaphorically and are transparent to cue threading, as sketched in Figure 4, making use of typical adverb categories syntactically. See Nakatsu and White (2010) for further details."]},{"title":"3 Crowd Sourcing Ratings","paragraphs":["To collect human judgements from a diverse group of speakers of US English, we used Amazon’s Mechanical Turk service (AMT) to run two experiments. In the first experiment, subjects rated the naturalness of 174 passages used in Walker et al.’s (2007) study. As detailed in Section 5, this validation experiment confirmed that the judgements collected on AMT correlate with those of the raters in Walker et al.’s (2007) study. Our second experiment collected ratings on 300 passages realized with modifications for better contrast expression (WITHMODS) and 300 passages without these modifications (NOMODS), both realized using OpenCCG. While this does not admit a direct comparison to the realizations produced by Walker et al. (2007), this controls for differences between the generators other than the variable of interest: the contrastive enhancements. In addition to these materials, five passages from the SRC were seen by all subjects to control for anomalous subject be-havior. 3.1 Survey Format Each survey used demographic questions to determine the native speaker status of the subject. Instructions for completing comprehension questions and rating realizations followed the demographic questions.3","Each subject saw fifteen stimuli, each consisting of a sample user query and the target passage as in Figure 5. After reading the stimulus, the subject answered a yes-or-no comprehension question (see §3.2). Finally the subject rated the naturalness of the passage on a sevenpoint Likert scale ranging from very unnatural to very natural. At the survey’s conclusion, the subject could offer free-form feedback, explain their responses, or ask questions of the researchers. The average completion time across all experiments was about ten minutes.","Passage selection is detailed in §3.3 and §3.4. 3.2 Quality Control We used three strategies to filter out low-quality responses from AMT subjects.","Comprehension Questions A template-based yes-or-no question (exemplified in Figure 5) followed each passage. Subjects who answered less than 75% of these questions correctly were rejected and not paid, in accordance with the protocol approved by our human subjects review board. Responses from three subjects were excluded from analysis on this basis.","Uniform Ratings When a subject gave the same rating for all passages in a given survey (and in disagreement with other subjects), we took this to mean that the subject was paying attention only","3","These materials, along with the generated passages and their ratings are available at http://www.ling. ohio-state.edu/m̃white/data/enlg13/. 33 Figure 5: Sample survey stimulus and comprehension question Method # subjects excluded Comprehension Questions 3 Uniform Answers 1 SAME5 0 Native Speaker Status 2 Table 1: Number of subjects excluded based on quality control measures or native language. to the comprehension questions that ensured payment. Only one subject was excluded on this basis, though they were still paid for answering the comprehension questions correctly.","SAME5 Passages Five passages were chosen from the original SRC realizations for which the original ratings (from Walker et al. 2007) were identical for both judges. The passages were selected such that the first and third authors of this paper agreed with the general valence and relative rankings of the passages. That is, we took two unambiguously bad realizations, two unambiguously good realizations, and one realization near the middle of the spectrum to represent a gold standard for rating to compare subjects against. If any subject’s ratings on these five passages were clear outliers, we could remove that subject’s data for anomalous behavior, but this measure proved unnecessary for the subjects in the present study. 3.3 Validating AMT Data Selection In this experiment, we sampled 174 of the 1757 realizations from the SRC rated by subjects A and B in Walker et al.’s (2007) experiment.","The SRC realizations were divided randomly into two groups. Within one group, realizations were labelled by subject A’s rating for that realization. Subject B’s rating was used for the other group. Taking the poles of the rating scale and its midpoint, the realizations were further partitioned into six sets: realizations rated 1, 3, and 5 by subject A and realizations rated 1, 3, and 5 by subject B. This division of the data ensured that the realizations used would cover the full spectrum of ratings while being representative of the SRC ratings with respect to, e.g., inter-annotator ratings correlations.","From each of these six sets, we chose 10 COMPARE2, 10 COMPARE3, and 10 RECOMMEND realizations,4","each of these groups representing a different realization task in the SRC. The COMPARE2 and COMPARE3 tasks involved the comparison of two restaurants or three or more restaurants, respectively. In the RECOMMEND context, the sytem had to generate a recommendation for a single restaurant.","Subject Demographics Thirty-six subjects responded to this survey initially, but one was rejected based on a failure to answer the comprehension questions and data from another had to be excluded for non-native speaker status. Two additional subjects were recruited to replace their data. This resulted in a subject pool with a mean age (std. dev.) of 34.67 (9.35) years. Twenty-four subjects identified as female and twelve identified as male. Each subject received $2.50 for the survey, estimated to take approximately 20 minutes. 3.4 Rating OpenCCG Realizations Data Selection We selected 15 content plans (CPs) from the SRC where the use of the contrastive modifiers was licensed: five COMPARE2, five COMPARE3, and five RECOMMEND CPs. Each of the 112 textplans (TPs) that produced","4","Except that subject A used the rating ‘5’ less than subject B. To compensate, we used as many 5-point ratings as were available from subject A and then filled in the remainder of the 10 slots with realizations rated ‘4’. We mirrored these selections in the data from subject B for consistency. 34 the SRC realizations for these CPs was then preprocessed for realization in OpenCCG both with contrast enhancements (WITHMODS) and without them (NOMODS).","Both structural choices and ordering choices are encoded in these TPs.5","Structural choices include decisions about how to group the restaurant properties to be expressed, such as deciding whether to describe one restaurant in its entirety and then the other (i.e. a serial structure) or alternating between one restaurant and the other, directly contrasting particular attributes (i.e. a back-and-forth structure). Ordering choices fixed the order of presentation of restaurant attributes in serial plans and the order of presentation of attribute contrasts in back-and-forth plans. As discussed in §6, there turn out to be interesting interactions between these aggregation choices and the contrast enhancements, interactions which we did not explore directly in this experiment.","Processing each TP produced a different LF for each possible combination of aggregation choices and contrastive modifications, resulting in approximately 41k logical forms (LFs) for the TPs WITHMODS and 88k LFs for the TPs with NOMODS.6","Each realization received two language model (LM) scores, one based on the semantic classes used during realization (LMSC ) and one based on the Gigaword corpus (LMGW ). LMSC used a trigram model over modified texts based on the SRC where specific entities (e.g. restaurant names like Caffe Buon Gusto) were replaced with their semantic class (e.g. RESTAURANT). The LM scores were normalized by CP, such that the scores for a given CP summed to 1 in each LM. These were then linearly combined with weights slightly preferring the LMSC score to produce a combined LM score for each realization.","Sampling then proceeded without replacement, weighted by the combined LM score for each realization. For the NOMODS sample, 20 realizations were chosen this way, but, in the WITHMODS sample, a series of regular expression filters were used to ensure adequate representation of the modifications in the surveys. These filters selected (without","5","This differs from Walker et al. (2007), wherein reorder-ings were allowed in mapping from tp-trees to sp-trees and d-trees.","6","In future work we will explore a probabilistic rather than exhaustive mapping algorithm to produce only LFs that are more likely to result in more fluent realizations—not unlike the weighted aggregation done by Walker et al.’s (2007) sentence plan generator. replacement) 10 realizations such that every contrastive modification licensed by a particular CP was represented, leaving 10 realizations to be selected by weighted sampling without replacement.","This process resulted in 300 passages in each of the two conditions (WITHMODS, NOMODS): 20 realizations for each of the 15 CPs. Each survey included 5 realizations WITHMODS paired by CP with 5 realizations with NOMODS as well as the SAME5 realizations. As noted earlier, pairing realizations in this way helps to control for differences in the variety of aggregation choices and surface realizations used in the SRC as opposed to our SRC-inspired grammar for OpenCCG.","Subject Demographics Sixty-eight subjects responded to these 180 surveys initially. Subjects were allowed to complete up to six distinct surveys. One subject’s data was excluded for non-native status and another’s was excluded on the basis of uniform ratings (as detailed in §3.2). To compensate for the eight surveys completed by these subjects and ten surveys mistakenly administered in draft format, we recollected data for 18 of the 180 surveys. This resulted in a final pool of 80 subjects with an average (std. dev.) age 37.15 (13.5) years. Forty identified as female, thirtynine identified as male, and one identified as nongendered.","Because subjects in the validation study completed the survey in about 10 minutes on average with a standard deviation of about 5 minutes, we scaled the pay to $2.00 per survey in this experiment.

On this basis we conclude that using AMT workers as subjects to rate sentences for their naturalness is at least as reasonable as having two expert annotators labelling realizations for their overall quality.","SAME5 Comparison There was no significant difference (p = 0.16, using Welch’s t-test) between the scores given to the SAME5 stimuli in the two experiments,8","indicating that subjects used the rating scale similarly in both experiments. The mean ratings for the rest of the validation realizations was 5.31 (1.43) and the mean for the OpenCCG-based realizations in the ranking experiment was 4.96 (1.51), which is significantly lower according to Welch’s t-test (p < 0.01). This high-lights the underlying differences between the two generation systems, validating our choice to use OpenCCG for both the WITHMODS and NOMODS realizations to better examine the impact of the contrast enhancements.","Ranking Table 2 reports the oracle results, along with our ranker’s results, using the TopRank metric. Most indicative of the benefit of the contrastive enhancements is the performance of the oracle score for the BOTH (6.61) condition compared to the NOMODS condition (6.49), which is significantly higher according to a paired t-test (p = 0.01).","We also found that the bigram ranker with the averaged raw ratings was better at predicting the top rank of the combined (BOTH) corpus (6.00 vs. oracle-best of 6.61) than either of the other two, and better on the WITHMODS condition (5.62) than on the NOMODS condition (5.51). However, a two-tailed t-test revealed that the difference was not quite signficant between BOTH and NOMODS at the conventional level (p = 0.06), though the p-value did meet the 0.1 threshold sometimes employed in small-scale experiments.

The coefficients and corpus counts appear in Table 3. The results show that the discourse adverbials were effective some of the time, especially when used sparingly and in conjunction with while. The “heavier” contrastive connectives however and on the one/other hand were dispreferred, perhaps in part because they ended up appearing too often with small, single-restaurant contrasts, as there were relatively few examples of summary statements, most of which were somewhat disfluent due to a medial choice for overall / on the whole.","Table 4 shows examples that illustrate both successes and remaining issues. At the top, two pairs of examples are given where the normalized average ratings are higher with the inclusion of just and only, and where the rating drops off greatly when however is used with a lesser value and no adverbial of this kind, as expected. At the bottom, the first example shows one instance where the use of multiple adverbials is dispreferred.

Finally, the last example shows a realization that receives a relatively high rating despite the use of two adverbials; note, however, that since this passage uses a back-and-forth text plan, the antecedents of the adverbials are all very local.10","Turning to the survey feedback, many subjects provided insightful comments regarding the task. The most frequent comment pointed out that our comprehension questions sometimes precipitated a false implicature: when asked if a restaurant had decent decor, subjects commented that they felt that answering “no” meant implying that it had terrible decor. Similar problems occurred when a restaurant had, e.g., very good decor and the subjects were asked if it had good decor. Despite occasional deviations from our intended exact-match interpretation of these questions, no subjects were excluded for scoring too low as a result of this.","10","As one reviewer points out, there’s also an interaction between how attributes are aggregated and the ability to express contrast. For example, contrasting the attributes for which a restaurant scores highly with those for which it scores poorly requires the aggregation of attributes with like valence, as in “This restaurant has superb decor and very good service but only mediocre food quality.” Our future work on aggregation will explore this interaction as well. 37","Strategy Mods?

Table 4: Examples illustrating successful and problematic contrast enhancements","In order to elicit rankings at a variety of points on the naturalness scale, our selection included a number of realizations with lower quality overall, which subjects picked up on. For example, one subject commented that, “Repeatedly using the name of each restaurant over and over in simple sentences make[s] almost all of these excerpts sound horrifyingly awkward,” while another observed, “The constant [use] of more sentences, in-stead of using conjunction words . . . makes it seem as if the system is rambling and lost in though[t] process.”","Several subjects also pointed out that it would be more natural to discuss the cost of an average meal at a restaurant than to state that a restaurant’s price is some particular number of dollars. Though these domain-specific lexical preferences are tangential to the focus of this paper, they suggest that exploring options to expand the range of realizations for more naturally expressing these properties might be a fruitful direction for future work.","In addition to expressing an explicit preference for serial rather than back-and-forth textplans, subjects also commented that higher level contrastive adverbials like however work better when they are used sparingly at a high level, reinforcing the findings in our regressions. We also received suggestions for future work improving the expression of contrast: some subjects suggested that using better and worse to make explicit comparisons between restaurants would improve the naturalness, and one subject suggested explicitly stating which restaurant is (say) the cheapest as in White et al. (2010)."]},{"title":"7 Conclusions and Future Work","paragraphs":["In this paper, we have shown using ratings gathered on AMT that Nakatsu & White’s (2010) proposed enhancements to the SPaRKy Restaurant Corpus (Walker et al., 2007) for better expressing contrast do indeed make it possible to generate better texts, and an initial experiment suggested that even a basic n-gram ranker can do so automatically. A regression analysis further revealed that while using a few discourse adverbials sparingly was effective, using too many discourse adverbials had a negative impact, with antecedent distance potentially an important factor. In future work, we plan to improve upon this basic n-gram ranker to take these observations into account and validate these initial findings on a larger dataset. In the process we will explore the interaction between contrast expression and aggregation and seek to better model the felicity conditions for “weighty” top level adverbials such as however."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This work was supported in part by NSF grant IIS-1143635.
