This diversity of expression presents a major challenge for many NLP applications. Thus, automatic paraphrase identication and generation can benet a broad range of NLP tasks, including machine translation, summarization, information retrieval, question answering, generation, and authoring and reading assistance.","Given this background, the workshop has been organized with the aim of connecting a broader range of research activities related to paraphrase identication and generation and stimulating intensive discussions on a special topic paraphrase acquisition. We also hope that succeeding workshops will be placed in a series establishing a new research eld.","From a initial slate of 26 papers submitted, the program committee selected 14 papers in a blind refereeing process, 13 papers of which are included in the proceedings with one paper withdrawn. We deeply and sincerely thank all our reviewers for doing an excellent job within the very short time available to them.","We would like to thank Graeme Hirst for accepting our invitation to speak at the workshop. His presentation Paraphrases Paraphrased will give participants a broad perspective on paraphrases, which we hope will establish a good common ground for fruitful discussions throughout the workshop. The discussion at the end of the workshop will include future directions of paraphrasing research as well as paraphrase resource building and sharing. We plan to include a paper version of the invited talk and highlights of the discussion on the workshop website at: http://nlp.nagaokaut.ac.jp/IWP2003/","Finally, we most gratefully acknowledge the exceptional cooperation of our organizing committee members.
