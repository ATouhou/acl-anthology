Our new naive Bayes text classification model assumes that a document is generated by a multivariate Poisson model while the previous works consider a document as a vector of binary term features based on the presence or absence of each term. We also explore the use of feature weighting for the naive Bayes text classification rather than feature selection, which is a quite costly process when a small number of the new training documents are continuously provided. Experimental results on the two test collections indicate that our new model with the proposed parameter estimation and the feature weighting technique leads to substantial improvements compared to the unigram language model classifiers that are known to outperform the original pure naive Bayes text classifiers."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["The naive Bayes classifier has been one of the core frameworks in the information retrieval research for many years. Recently, naive Bayes is emerged as a research topic itself because it sometimes achieves good performances on various tasks, compared to more complex learning algorithms, in spite of the wrong independence assumptions on naive Bayes.","Similarly, naive Bayes is also an attractive approach in the text classification task because it is simple enough to be practically implemented even with a great number of features. This simplicity enables us to integrate the text classification and filtering modules with the existing information retrieval systems easily. It is because that the frequency related information stored in the general text retrieval systems is all the required information in naive Bayes learning. No further complex generaliza-tion processes are required unlike the other machine learning methods such as SVM or boosting. More-over, incremental adaptation using a small number of new training documents can be performed by just adding or updating frequencies.","Several earlier works have extensively studied the naive Bayes text classification (Lewis, 1992; Lewis, 1998; McCallum and Nigam, 1998). However, their pure naive Bayes classifiers considered a document as a binary feature vector, and so they can’t utilize the term frequencies in a document, resulting the poor performances. For that reason, the unigram language model classifier (or multinomial naive Bayes text classifier) has been referred as an alternative and promising naive Bayes by a number of researchers(McCallum and Nigam, 1998; Dumais et al., 1998; Yang and Liu, 1999; Nigam et al., 2000). Although the unigram language model classifiers usually outperform the pure naive Bayes, they also have given the disappointing results compared to many other statistical learning methods such as nearest neighbor classifiers(Yang and Chute, 1994), support vector machines(Joachims, 1998), and boosting(Schapire and Singer, 2000), etc.","In the real world, an operational text classification system is usually placed in the environment where the amount of human-annotated training documents is small in spite of the hundreds of thousands classes. Moreover, re-training of the text classifiers is required since a small number of new training documents are continuously provided. In this environment, naive Bayes is probably the most appropri-ate model for the practical systems rather than other complex learning models. Therefore, more intensive studies about the naive Bayes text classification model are required.","In this paper, we revisit the naive Bayes framework, and propose a Poisson naive Bayes model for text classification with a statistical feature weighting method. Feature weighting has many advantages compared to the previous feature selection approaches, especially when the new training examples are continuously provided. Our new model assumes that a document is generated by a multivariate Poisson model, and their parameters are estimated by weighted averaging of the normalized and smoothed term frequencies over all the training documents. Under the assumption, we have tested the feature weighting approach with three measures: information gain,","","-statistic, and newly introduced probability ratio. With the proposed model and feature weighting techniques, we can get much better performance without losing the simplicity and efficiency of the naive Bayes model.","The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The next section presents a naive Bayes framework for the text classification briefly. Section 3 describes our new naive Bayes model and the proposed technique, and the experimental results are presented in Section 4. Finally, we conclude the paper by suggesting possible directions for future work in Section 5."]},{"title":"2 Naive Bayes Text Classification","paragraphs":["A naive Bayes classifier is a well-known and highly practical probabilistic classifier, and has been employed in many applications. It assumes that all attributes of the examples are independent of each other given the context of the class, that is, an independent assumption. Several studies show that naive Bayes performs surprisingly well in many domains(Domingos and Pazzani, 1997) in spite of its wrong independent assumption. In the context of text classification, the probability of class","given a document","","is calculated by Bayes’ theorem as follows:","","    ","","","","","    ","","","","","   "," ","","","    ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","  ","","","","","","","","",""," ","","","    ","","","     ","","","","","","","","    ","","","     ","","","","","","","",""," (1)","Now, if we define a new function ",",","    ","","    ","","","     "," (2) then, Equation (1) can be rewritten as","","   ","","","","","  ","","","","","","","    ","","","","(3)","Using Equation (3), we can get the posterior probability","","","","","","","by obtaining","",", which is a form of log ratio similar to the BIM retrieval model(Jones et al., 2000). It means that the linked independence assumption(Cooper et al., 1992), which explains that the strong independent assumption can be relaxed in the BIM model, is sufficient for the use of naive Bayes text classification model.","With this framework, two representative naive Bayes text classification approaches are well introduced in (McCallum and Nigam, 1998). They designated the pure naive Bayes as multivariate Bernoulli model, and the unigram language model classifier as multinomial model. Instead, we introduce multivariate Poisson model to improve the pure naive Bayes text classification in the next section."]},{"title":"3 Poisson Naive Bayes Text Classification 3.1 Overview","paragraphs":["The Poisson distribution is most commonly used to model the number of random occurrences of some phenomenon in a specified unit of space or time, for example, the number of phone calls received by a telephone operator in a 10-minute period. If we","think that the occurrence of each term is a random","occurrence in a fixed unit of space (i.e. a length","of document) the Poisson distribution is intuitively","suitable to model the term frequencies in a given","document. For that reason, the use of Poisson model","is widely investigated in the IR literature, but it is","rarely used for the text classification task(Lewis,","1998). It motivates us to adopt the Poisson model","for learning the naive Bayes text classification. Our model assumes that","","is generated by multi-","variate Poisson model. In other words, a document","  is a random vector which consists of the Poisson","random variables","",", and","","has the value of within-","term-frequency","","for the","-th term","",". Thus, if we","assume the independence among the terms in","",",a","probability of","","is represented by,","   ","  ","   ","","","  ","","","","(4)","where,  ","is a vocabulary size, and each","","","","","","","","is given by,","","","  ","","","","","  ","","    (5)","where,","is the Poisson mean.","As a result, the","","function of Equation (2) is","rewritten using Equations (4) and (5) as follows:  ","        ","","","","  ","","","","","","","","","  ","","","","         ","   ","   ","","   ","","(6)","where,  and","","is the Poisson mean for","","in class","","and class ",", respectively.","The most important issues of this work are as fol-","lows:","","How to decide the frequency ","representing","the characteristic of document  ?","","How to estimate the model parameter","","and","","representing the characteristic of each class? We propose the possible answers in the next subsec-tion. 3.2 Parameter Estimation Since","","is a frequency of a term","in a document  ","with a fixed length according to the definition of Poisson distribution, we should normalize the actual term frequencies in the documents with the different length. In addition, many earlier works in NLP and IR fields recommend that smoothing term frequencies is necessary in order to build a more accurate model.","Thus, we estimate","","as the normalized and smoothed frequency of actual term frequency","",", represented by,","",""," ","","","","","","  ","","  ","(7)","where","is a laplace smoothing parameter,","is any","huge value which makes all the","","","in our model an","integer value1 , and"," is the length of","",".","Conceptually,","","","can be regarded as the value es-","timated by the following steps : 1) Add","of all","","","terms to the document  , 2) Scale","","up to","","","whose","total length is","without changing the proportion of","frequency for each term  , 3) Count","","in","","",".","Then, Poisson mean  , which represents an aver-","age number of occurrence of","","in the documents be-","longing to class",", is estimated using the normalized","and smoothed","","","values over the training documents","as follows:   "," ","   ","","","","","   ","","","","","(8)","where","","is the set of training documents belonging","to class",", and","","","","","","","2","is the interpolation of the","uniform probability and the probability proportional","to the length of the document, and the interpolation","is calculated as follows:","","","    ","","    ","",""," ","","","  ","","   ",""," (9)","Simple averaging of","","",", the case of","=1, seems to","be correct to estimate","",".

Consequently,   is a weighted average over all training documents belonging to the class",", and","","for the class","","can be estimated in the same manner. 3.3 Feature Weighting Feature selection is often performed as a preprocess-ing step for the purpose of both reducing the feature space and improving the classification performance. Text classifiers are then trained with various machine learning algorithms in the resulting feature space. (Yang and Pedersen, 1997) investigated some measures to select useful term features including mutual information(MI), information gain(IG), and  ","-statistics(CHI), etc. On the contrary, (Joachims, 1998) claimed that there is no useless term features, and it is preferable to use all term features. It is clear that learning and classification become very efficient when the feature space is considerably reduced. However, there is no definite conclusion about the contribution of feature selection to improve overall performances of the text classification systems. It may considerably depend on the employed learning algorithm. We believe that proper external feature selection or weighting is required to improve the performances of naive Bayes since the naive Bayes has no framework of the discriminative optimizing process in itself. Of the two possible approaches, feature selection is very inefficient in case that the additional training documents are provided continuously. It is because the feature set should be redefined according to the modified term statistics in the new training document set, and classifiers should be trained again with this new feature set. For that reason, we prefer to use feature weighting to improve naive Bayes rather than feature selection. With the feature weighting method, our","","is redefined as follows:  ","  ","      W   ","","     ","   ","","     ","","","(10)","where, ","is the weight of feature for the class",",","and W is the normalization factor, that is,","   ","","",".","In our work, three measures are used to weight Table 1: Two-way contingency table","presence of","","absence of","","labeled as ab","not labeled as cd each term feature: information gain,","","-statistics and probability ratio. Information gain (or average mutual information) is an information-theoretic measure defined by the amount of reduced uncertainty given a piece of information. We use the information gain value as the weight of each term for the class",", and the value is calculated using a document event model as follows:","","","","","","","  ","","","","","","","(11)  ","","","   "," ","","","     ","","","","","  ","","","","","","   ","","","","","    ","","","","where, for example,","","","","is the number of docu-","ments belonging to the class","divided by the total","number of documents, and","","","","is the number of","documents without the term","divided by the total","number of documents, etc.","Second measure we used is","","- statistics devel-","oped for the statistical test of the hypothesis.

(Yang and Pedersen, 1997) compared the various feature selection methods, and concluded that these two measures are most effective for their kNN and LLSF classification models. Finally, we introduce a new measure - probability ratio. Probability ratio is defined by,  ","","","    ","","","","    "," ","","","    ","","","    "," (13) This measure calculates the sum of the ratio of two class-conditional probabilities from each class and its reciprocal. The former term and the latter term are representing the degree of predicting positive and negative class respectively. The weight using this measure always has a positive value higher than 2.","We have conducted the experiments with these three measures for the feature weighting test, and the results are given in Section 4. 3.4 Implementation Issues","By a couple of simple arithmetic operations, our fi-","nal","","function can be rewritten as follows:  ","  W","","","","  ","","",""," ","  ","(14) where,"," ","      ","","   ","","","   ","  ","  ","     ","         "," ","","   ","","   ","               "," ","   ","","","    ","","    ","","","","","  ","","","","","In this equation,  ","and","","","are just weighted av-","erage of","-dropped","","",", that is,","","","","","","","","","","",".","",",","","and","","","are the class-specific constants, and","is a con-","stant over all the classes and documents.

There are 90 categories, and each document has one or more of the categories.","We have built another benchmark collection - KoreanNews2002 collection.

The clear observation from this result is that feature weighting is highly effective in the bins of the classes with a small number of training documents, but hardly contributes the performances for the bins of the classes with sufficiently many training documents. In the bins with enough training documents, simple PNB classifiers show the similar performances to the PNB with feature weighting methods. This tendency is more clearly captured in the Reuters21578 collection, where a third of the classes have fewer than 10 training documents. In contrast, two thirds of the classes in the KoreanNews2002 collection have more than a hundred of training documents. Among the feature weighting methods, PNB-PrR performs stably than PNB-IG and PNB-CHI. PNB-IG or PNB-CHI somewhat degrades the performance in the classes with the large number of training documents, while PNB-PrR maintains the good performances in those classes on both of the collections. On the other hand, PNB-IG and PNB-CHI considerably improve the performances in the rare categories though the improvement is somewhat different from the two collections. For example, PNB-CHI significantly improves the simple PNB on the Reuters21578 collection while PNB-IG is very effective on the KoreanNews2002 collection. Thus, we can realize that the proper feature weighting method depends on the characteristics of the collection, and different feature weighting strategies should be adopted to improve the naive Bayes text classification.","From these observations, we tested another classifier PNB","which employ different feature weighting method for each bin to obtain the near optimal performances. Table 4 and 5 show the summary of the performances including PNB","on the both collections. Our proposed model with feature weighting methods are very effective compared to the baseline UM method. Moreover, the performance of bin-optimized PNB","in Reuters21578 collection shows that Poisson naive Bayes with feature weighting methods can achieve the state-of-the-art performances achieved by SVM or kNN which are reported in (Yang and Liu, 1999; Joachims, 1998)."]},{"title":"5 Conclusion and Future Work","paragraphs":["In this paper, we propose a Poisson naive Bayes text classification model with feature weighting.
