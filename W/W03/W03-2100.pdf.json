We would like to in particular acknowledge the financial support that the Workshop has received from the following organizations: the Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence, Support Center for Advanced Telecommunications Technology Research, International Communications Foundation, Inoue Communications Foundation and Sapporo International Communication Plaza Foundation. The preparations for the Workshop would have been more difficult without the valuable advice and guidance provided by Laila Dybkjær and David Traum. For this we thank them.
