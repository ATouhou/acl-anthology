The tools developed at the NLP Laboratory FI MU, have been used, particularly the morphological analyser ajka and the program I par for processing and maintaining the morphological database."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["In this paper we report on an exploration of the relations between inflection and word derivation (WD) in Czech. At first the inflectional morphology has to be mentioned which deals with formation of word forms by inflection, i. e. by morphological processes like the declension of nouns, adjectives, pronouns and numerals, the conjuga-tion of verbs, and also forming degrees of adjectives and adverbs. The inflectional morphology (in Czech) is formally quite well described and at present we have reliable software tools at our disposal that make it possible both to generate and recognise arbitrary Czech word forms. They are ajka a morphological analyser and generator (Sedláček and Smrž, 2001) and I par a program for morphological database (Veber, 2002).","The second area is derivational morphology, i. e. word derivation as such – it describes the processes of the derivation of new words (one word expressions) as distinct from basic ones (word bases). These processes operate on the morpheme level whose results follow from the ways of combining morphemes (prefixes, stems or roots, in-fixes, suffixes) using suffixation, prefixation and stem alterations (infixation). We have to bear in mind that the consequences of these formal processes have a semantic nature.","The relations between the WD processes and inflectional morphology have been extensively studied in Czech linguistic literature, see e. g. (Dokulil, 1962; Karlı́k et al., 1995; Petr, 1986) where one may find informal descriptions of the WD processes using terms like “fundace” (basic derivation), as well as mutation, transposition, modification, adaptation, and others.","The most interesting linguistic analyses link the derivation patterns with the inflectional ones. For example, in Karlı́k (1995) it is pointed out that the nouns with the suffix -tel having agentive meaning belong to the inflectional paradigm muž (man). In other words, it is possible to say that some inflectional patterns determine the sets of derivational suffixes forming semantically consistent groups of nouns.","In this paper we set it as our task to map the relations between inflectional and word derivational patterns. In comparison with previous research we present the exploration of a large collection of data: our stem dictionary for Czech contains 385,066 items. The association of selected inflectional and WD patterns has been performed semi-automatically with the tool I par and the Czech morphological database which contains all the necessary information about the inflectional paradigms in Czech (2,042 paradigms for all 10 POS).","The WD relations as they are described in the linguistic WD theories can be, after some modifications, appropriately linked to the semantic relations as they are used in contemporary ontologies and then applied within the inference engines that form a necessary part of the natural language processing mechanisms.","However, it is true that algorithmic descriptions of WD relations have been worked out only recently and they do not cover the WD processes in all their complexity but just at the basic level."]},{"title":"2 Inflectional analysis","paragraphs":["The inflectional analysis is a part of the complex morphemic decomposition of a word and its first task is to identify in a given word form the stem and ending. If the word form is not a lemma (basic form of the word) it is necessary to associate the stem with its respective ending. It has to be kept in mind that the derivational analysis deals only with lemmata and not with the individual word forms.","For the purpose of this work we perform inflectional analysis with the tool (program) ajka (Sedláček, 1999) which is further developed in the NLP Laboratory (Sedláček and Smrž, 2001) at FI MU. It is also used as a standard tool for lemmatization (identification of the basic word forms) and as a morphological tagger."]},{"title":"3 The Basic WD Relation = “fundace”","paragraphs":["In the Czech WD theory all words belonging to a given word stock are classified either as motivated or non-motivated.","For motivated words we are able to describe their meaning using another word or words, e. g. cvičiště (exercising ground, drill square) is a place where exercising is done. Non-motivated words cannot be described in the same way. Their meaning consists only in signifying the thing, which is why they are sometimes called words-signs, as e. g. stůl (table), tráva (grass). Thus it is obvious that when making WD analyses we are more interested in motivated words, since only they display the derivational structure from which we are able to reconstruct the process of their formation.","Formation of motivated word follows the basic WD relation called “fundace” (Dokulil, 1962). When we find the “fundace”-relation for all motivated words we obtain a complex of relations that form a hierarchical structure. In WD theory this structure is usually called word derivation nest, word derivation lattice and word derivation sequence. Word derivation nests (WDN) will be our principal focus.","WDN can be defined as a set of all related words that gather around a common stem. The core of WDN is a root of the non-motivated word and other words in WDN are derived from it either directly as in led (ice)→led-ový (icy) or indirectly through another related word. In this way word derivation sequences are created, such as led (ice)→led-ový (icy)→ledov-ec (glacier)→ledovcový (glacial).","The appropriate formal apparatus for representing these relations and structures are graphs. For this purpose the special types of graphs (see Fig. 1), particularly graph-trees are used which further link up into forests. Strictly speaking we are dealing mainly with forests.","The tree nodes are labelled with lemmata, and the next node is created dependent on its predecessor. The individual trees then represent the WDN, the WD unions have just one level, subtrees and sequence correspond to the paths in the graph."]},{"title":"4 The Semantic Aspects of the Basic WD Relation","paragraphs":["The semantic component of the “fundace”- relation consists in the fact that meaning of “funded” words can be derived from the meaning of the “funding” one, that they are semantically linked and that language users know these relations and use them in understanding language and also in enriching their knowledge about the universe. Thus učitel (teacher) je ten, kdo učı́ (is the one who teaches), zoubek (small tooth) je malý zub (is a tooth of small size). The meaning that follows from the WD relations is usually labelled as word derivation or internal meaning. This is a rather narrow point of view, typical of linguistic WD theories, since there is no reason to introduce separate semantic relations – they are the same as other semantic relations, for example the Internal Language Relations defined within EuroWordNet 1, 2 (Vossen, 1998).","For the computer processing of the word meanings, it is necessary to bear in mind that semantic relations have a common nature irrespective of the forms by which they are expressed. From this point of view, it is obvious that there is no relevant difference between WD meaning and ’normal’ lexical meaning as it is treated within the framework of semantic networks that are nowadays so popular in NLP and Language Engineer-ing. Thus WDN can be understood as semantic networks of a special sort that will soon become relevant in the area of knowledge representation."]},{"title":"5 Word Derivation Analysis","paragraphs":["The purpose of WD analysis is to find out the WD structure of the “funded” word by applying the basic WD relation, i. e. to find out its WD base and the respective formant (see below).","WD base can be defined as the part of the “funded” word that is taken over from the “fund-ing” word. Typically it is an identical string that occurs in both “funded” and “funding” word – various phonological alternations can take place here, of course. For example, pole (field)→pol-nı́ (field-ADJ).","The procedure works in the following way: an element is added to the WD base of the word (typically root or stem) and together they form a new word. The added element is usually called formant in Czech WD theory (Dokulil, 1962) and can be formed by one or more morphemes. A formant can be","• a suffix kotel-na (boiler room), which classi-","fies a word as belonging to a more general se-","mantic group (here the Czech suffix -na with","the inflectional morpheme -a at its end cre-","ates the names of places),","• the ending zkáz-a (destruction) where the in-","flectional morpheme also operates as deriva-","tional morpheme or the derivational mor-","pheme can be considered to be empty,","• prefix s-lepit (glue back together) which just","modifies the meaning of the word but does","not change its POS and inflectional paradigm. Compound formants are also possible, and may consist either of a prefix combined with suffix, e. g. in přı́-ruč-nı́ (reference) or prefix combined with an ending před-měst-ı́ (suburb)."]},{"title":"6 Relations between Inflection and Derivation","paragraphs":["The data that can be found in the existing resources, e. g. (Karlı́k et al., 1995) are limited in number – they contain selected examples only and show only the main types of WD processes. In-formation about the functional load of the individual suffixes is either missing or is only outlined by means of expressions like “very frequent”, “frequent”, “less frequent” without giving any numbers.","To explore the situation more adequately we used a more representative collection of data, particularly the morphological database I par together with the stem dictionary which is a part of the morphological analyser ajka.","In other words, all the items in the stem dictionary are associated with their respective inflectional paradigm(s), e. g. for nouns there are 746 inflectional paradigms that presently cover 131,188 noun stems. The number of the noun paradigms looks quite large but one should bear in mind that in our algorithmic description of Czech inflection we deal with a detailed hierarchical subclassifica-tion of the noun paradigms which, however, is just based on the 14 main paradigms as they are given in standard grammars of Czech.","The present data allow us to find the functional load defined as the number of nouns with the given suffix and particular semantic feature, e. g. agentive, instrument or property etc. First we have to know for a certain suffix how many lemmata occur with the given suffix, Table 1 shows that -ák has 1,379 occurrences. However, it is more important to know the specific semantic features that indicate which semantic classes the nouns ending with -ák belong to – this is obtained in the process of finding which nouns belong in which inflectional paradigms. If we look at the tags we can see that Czech nouns with the suffix -ák fall into two large groups – those denoting agentives and other animate beings (total 733 nouns) and those denoting inanimate things such as instruments and others (total 633, not classified 13). In the case of -ák its functional load is distributed evenly. freq. % pattern gender sem. feature 641 47.1 vlk MANIM. agentives 326 23.6 flok MINAN. 263 19.1 krk MINAN. 77 5.6 Štěrbák MANIM. family names 16 1.2 dupák MINAN. 10 0.7 Azték MANIM. names of tribes 10 0.7 hřibák MINAN. 7 0.5 pulčı́k MINAN. names of fungi 6 0.4 kozák MINAN. 5 0.4 dubák MINAN. 5 0.4 Batak MANIM. ethnic groups 13 1.0 various not classified Σ 1,379 Table 1: SUBST MASK, suffix: -ák freq. % pattern gender sem. feature 908 93.9 učitel MANIM. agentives 15 1.6 bez MINAN. not classified 11 1.1 mocnitel MINAN. math. expr. 8 0.8 součinitel MINAN. math. expr. 7 0.7 hotel MINAN. hotels 5 0.5 cı́l MINAN. not classified 4 0.4 stroj MINAN. not classified 4 0.4 soutěž FEMIN. not classified 3 0.3 obyvatel MANIM. inhabitants 2 0.2 strašpytel MANIM. not classified Σ 967 Table 2: SUBST, suffix: -tel"]},{"title":"7 Rules for WD Processes","paragraphs":["So far we have been talking about the derivation of word forms in terms of morphemes, stems, roots, lemmata, etc. More formally, WD processes employ strings of letters (morphemes) carrying grammatical and lexical information. It can be observed that the WD processes have quite a regular nature, thus one can express them by means of certain rules (WD patterns)","WD is a hierarchically structured process, which will be reflected in the construction of the rules (WD patterns) – we will build them as cascades going from simpler to more complicated patterns.","We start from a linguist’s hypothesis which defines a pattern capturing the changes between the word forms and other constraints on the form of grammatical tags associated with the searched entries. Then we can automatically look up n-The following n-tuple has to be searched for:","form POS-tag condition 1. S-zace SUBST FEM 2. S-stický ADJ 3. S-sta SUBST MAS ANIMAL 4.

The linguist can take the derived list of n-tuples and determine which n-tuples are correct and which not. The list of the positive examples will arise together with the list of exceptions not matching the formulated hypothesis, e. g. přı́t → přı́tel, word form přı́tel (friend) is derived from “přát (to wish sb well)”, not “přı́t se (to argue with sb)”.","It is now clear that by using a hierarchical connection of the new pattern to the original one (for the individual members of the n-tuple) it is possible to derive from a single entry not only the neighbouring entries in the n-tuple but also other word forms (generated from the entries included in the n-tuple by means of the respective original patterns).","If the changes in the word form put into effect by the (new) pattern express1","a well-defined semantic relation, the entries can be “virtualized”, 1 for the newly generated word form it is also possible to","derive algorithmically (infer) lexical meaning 1st member 2nd member 3rd member 4th member","Patterns: růže otrocký P husita P komunismus","realizace realistický realista realismus centralizace centralistický centralista centralismus humanizace humanistický humanista humanismus idealizace idealistický idealista idealismus komunizace komunistický komunista komunismus",". . . . . . . . . . . .","Patterns: růže starořecký P husita P komunismus romanizace romanistický romanista romantismus spiritualizace spiritualistický spiritualista spiritualismus synchronizace synchronistický synchronista synchronismus kolektivizace kolektivistický kolektivista kolektivismus modernizace modernistický modernista modernismus",". . . . . . . . . . . .

We will reduce the lexicon using the description","of the WD process which yields the predictable","changes in the semantics of the derived entries. The WD process can be illustrated by the Fig. 1.","It can be seen that the sub-entries humanizace (hu-","manisation), humanisticky (humanistically ADV),","humanistický (humanistic ADJ), humanistčin (hu-","manist’s FEM POSS ADJ), humanistka (human-","ist FEM), humanistův (humanist’s MAS POSS","ADJ), humanista (humanist MAS), humanismus","(humanism), can be assigned: 1. either to the respective infl. paradigms:","humanizace:růže","humanisticky:otrocky","humanistický:otrocký","humanistčin:matčin","humanistka:matka","humanistův:otcův","humanista:husita","humanismus:komunismus 2. or to:","humanizace:růže","humanistický:otrocký P","humanista:husita P","humanismus:komunismus 3. or to a deriv. pattern (meta-pattern):","humanismus:komunismus P In the second and third cases, the reduction of the lexicon can be observed. The pattern komunismus P derives the word forms by exchanging the string at the end of the basic (motivating) word form: smus → zace, sticky, sta, smus and the corresponding change of the attributes of the constructed tag.","For an implementation of these WD patterns, a parallel with Finite State Automata (FST) is useful. The property of chaining (Roche and Schabes, 1997) is very suitable here – it allows us to build WD patterns as hierarchical modules. This property makes it possible to limit the duplicity of the stored information and increase their lucidity. 7.1 WD Relation Mining We explained how to extend the morphological database employing the regular changes of word forms that can be observed in the course of the WD processes (Osolsobě et al., 2002). We have shown that if the WD processes are described by the rules it is possible to reduce our stem dictionary and eventually to obtain a dictionary of roots.","To make the process of searching for the discrete description of WD processes simpler we have implemented an algorithm that looks up the relations between the strings corresponding to the individual entries in the morphological database.","The input for the algorithm is a description of the variations of the individual word forms together with conditions placed on the attributes of the respective grammatical tags. komunismus P humani⊕smus komunismus humanismus husita P humanist⊕a husita humanista otcův humanistův matka P humanist⊕ka matka humanistka matčin humanistčin otrocký P humanistick⊕ý otrocký humanistický otrocky humanisticky","růže humanizace",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",". . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".","............","............ smus",".",". . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ....... . . . . . . ............sta",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",". . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..... . . . . . . . . ............a................................................ . . . . . . . . . . . ...........ův","............................................................",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".","..",".",".",".",".",".......","ka .",".",".",".",". . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".......",".",".",".",".",".",". ............ka","........................................ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .........","čin","......................................................... . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . .....","sticky . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .... . . . . . . . . . ............ý","............................. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..........y",".................................................................................................................................... . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . .","zace Figure 1: Using the derivational pattern to reduce the stem dictionary To describe the variations of the word forms we","will use: • variables $1, $2, . . .

Those word forms, strings and pairs will be called located. The word forms that we can determine from the located ones after substitution values for the variables in the strings will be labelled as inferred.","We can speak here about free and bound occur-rences of the variables. Free variables will be determined during the computation of the same automaton in which they take place. Bound variables are dependent on the computation of other automata. The values are instantiated for bound variables before the computing the automaton in which the variables occur. Thus we can work with them in a given automaton as with the constants – this simplifies the automaton.","When a given word form is accepted by the transducer (for string Si) we obtain the respective evaluation variables included in Si as an output. If the same variables occur also in other strings they can be substituted (instantiated) by the values.","Thus step by step we will construct the respective FS automata for located strings Si using the instantiation of the variables. If the automaton does not contain any free variables it is obvious that the respective pair is inferred (it can be located at the same time) – these will be labelled as inferred+located).","The order in which the individual automata will be applied can be optimised. A certain part of the state space being searched can be eliminated in advance based on conditions Ci, i. e. it is enough to search/eliminate entries associated with the patterns which guarantee/eliminate some attributes of the tag.","We suppose that by means of located strings all the variables used in the inferred strings can be instantiated in such a way that we will be able to determine correctly inferred word forms relying only on the knowledge of the located word forms, i. e. in the cases where the inferred strings do not contain free variables. In the opposite case the algorithm has to stop prematurely.","The optimisation will determine the order in which the individual automata containing free variables will be applied.","We will start with the first automaton following the order determined by the optimisation. Step by step we will go through all the entries and then for all possible evaluations we will instantiate the variables and continue with searching the entries acceptable for the next automaton (according to the given ordering), i. e. we look for the next element of the respective n-tuple.","If we succeed in the instantiation of all variables and determine all inferred word forms and if all inferred+located word forms are found in the database then the currently determined n-tuple can be sent to the output."]},{"title":"8 The First Results from our Data","paragraphs":["Table 5 displays the individual steps taken during forming the respective WD nest. The step A (see Table 5) consisted in the derivation of masculine possessives using suffix -ův. It is obvious that this derivation is regular, the number of lemmata has not changed – all of them have been assigned to the paradigm for the possessives otcův (father’s). In the step B the gender of noun is changed from masculine to feminine using suffix -ka. Moreover, in this step the paradigms neumětel a Kocáb nM have been removed. Also the number of lemmata assigned to the paradigm učitel (teacher) has been reduced to half, i. e. from 908 to 454. This means that according to our data (our morphological database) half of the agentives cannot form the feminine counterpart and this result can be expected to be confirmed by examin-ing a larger corpus. The step C is again regular – it consists in the derivation of feminine possessives using suffix -in with a number of lemmata not being changed. In the step D the adjectives are formed by means of suffix -ský and this process is less regular. From the possible 454 lemmata belonging to the paradigm učitel the adjectives are derived only from 113+21+16=150. Moreover, these adjectives split into three adjective paradigms pražský (Prague), společenský (social) and kremžský (Crems) depending on whether they form a comparative and adverb or not. The following step is again regular – it involves the derivation of adverbs from adjectives by shorten-ing the last vowel from ý to y. It can be seen that from the adjectives belonging to the paradigm kremžský such adverbs cannot be formed at all. The step E is irregular as well and it involves the derivation of the nouns from the respective adjectives by replacing the suffix -ský for -stvı́."]},{"title":"9 Conclusions","paragraphs":["The purpose of the paper is to show how selected word derivation relations in Czech can be described using the morphological analyser ajka and the program I par which works with the Czech morphological database.
