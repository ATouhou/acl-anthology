An attempt at constructing such a tagset for Polish is presented."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["The aim of this article is to address one of the objectives of the EACL 2003 workshop on Morphological Processing of Slavic Languages, namely, to try to reveal lexical structures necessary for morphological analysis and. . . discuss standardization efforts in the eld that can, for instance, enable transfer of applied methods from one language to the other or inform the annotation of morphological information in corpora.","One admirable standardization effort in the eld of Slavic part of speech (POS) tagging has been the Multext-East project (Erjavec, 2001), one of whose aims was to construct mutually compatible tagsets for 8 European languages, including 4 Slavic languages (originally Bulgarian, Czech and Slovene, later extended to Croatian); additionally, a Multext-East-style tagset for Russian was constructed at the University of Tbingen (http: //www.sfb441.uni-tuebingen.de/c1/ tagset.html). Those tagsets are based on a common repertoire of grammatical classes (POSs; e.g., ‘verb’, ‘noun’, ‘adjective’, etc.) and grammatical categories (e.g., ‘case’, ‘person’, ‘gender’, etc.), and each tagset uses just a subset of those grammatical classes and categories.","Despite the considerable success of Multext-East, and the apparent uniformity of the result-ing tagsets, certain weaknesses of this approach are clear. First of all, the relative uniformity of the POS classes across the 8 languages was at-tained at the cost of introducing the grammatical category ‘type’ whose values reect the considerable differences between POS systems of the languages involved. Second, it is not clear that various grammatical categories and their values have the same interpretation in each language; for example, it is rather surprising that only the Romanian tagset explicitly mentions strong and weak pronominal forms, it is not clear whether negative pronouns in Romanian, Slovene, Czech and Bulgarian are negative in the same sense of participat-ing in Negative Concord, it is not clear why Romanian has negative adverbs while, say, Czech lacks them, etc. Finally, and most importantly from our point of view, the approach adopted by Multext-East does not clearly reect cross-linguistic correspondences, such as the one mentioned in (Erjavec, 2001), that in the Romanian case system the value ‘direct’ conates ‘nominative’ and ‘accusative’, while the value ‘oblique’ conates ‘genitive’ and ‘dative’. Such correspondences are not exceptional, e.g., the at least three masculine genders of Polish (Ma ·nczak, 1956; Saloni, 1976) are mapped into the single masculine gender of many other languages, the dual and the plural numbers of some languages (Slovene, Czech) are mapped to plural of other languages, etc.","In more general terms, we have identied the following features of currently used tagsets for Slavic in general and Polish in particular which seem problematic from the point of view of their reusability and cross-linguistic applicability:"," uncritical adoption of traditional and sometimes ill-dened POS classes, such as ‘pronoun’ or vaguely delimited classes such as ‘verb’ or ‘noun’ (it is often not clear whether gerunds are ‘verbs’ or ‘nouns’ in such classications);"," POS classes and categories are often chosen on the basis of a mix of morphological, syntactic and semantic criteria, e.g., ‘gender’ in Slavic is sometimes dened on the basis of mixed morphosyntactic and semantic properties, and so are ‘pronoun’ and ‘numeral’;"," mixing morphosyntactic annotation with what might be called dictionary annotation; e.g., tagsets often include tags for proper names or morphosyntactically transparent collocations, which in our opinion do not belong to the realm of POS annotation;"," sometimes the priorities of such mixed criteria are unclear, e.g., should the preposition of in District of Columbia be tagged as an ordinary preposition, or should it have the ‘proper’ tag as it is a part of a proper name?"," ignoring the ner points of the morphosyntactic system of a given language, e.g., the multitude of genders in languages such as Polish, or categories such as ‘post-prepositionality’ and ‘accommodability’ (see below);"," unclear segmentation rules (should so-called analytic tenses or reexive verbs be treated as single units for the purpose of annotation?).","The main thesis of this paper is that, in order for a tagset to be reusable and comparable with similar tagsets for related languages, it must be based on a homogeneous set of clear formal (morphological and morphosyntactic) criteria. Only once such criteria for delimiting grammatical classes and categories are presented in detail, can those classes and categories be mapped to grammatical classes and categories of other similarly constructed tagsets.","The remainder of the paper presents such a tagset for Polish, developed within a Polish corpus project1","and deployed by a stochastic tagger of Polish (Debowski, 2003)."]},{"title":"2 A Flexemic Tagset for Polish","paragraphs":["The tagset presented in this section is based on the following design assumptions:"," what is being tagged is a single orthographic word or, in some well-dened cases, a part thereof; multi-word constructions, even those sometimes considered to be morphological formations (so-called analytic forms) or dictionary entries (proper names), should be considered by a different level of process-ing;2","cf. 2.1;"," grammatical categories reect various oppositions in the morphological system, even those oppositions which pertain to single grammatical classes and are not recognized by traditional grammars; cf. 2.2;"," the main criteria for delimiting grammatical classes are morphological (how a given form inects; e.g., nouns inect for case, but not for gender) and morphosyntactic (in which categories it agrees with other forms; e.g., Polish nouns do not inect for gender but they agree in gender with adjectives and verbs); semantic criteria are eschewed; cf. 2.3. 2.1 Segmentation By segmentation, or tokenization, we mean the task of splitting the input text into tokens, i.e., seg-","1","An Annotated Internet-Accessible Corpus of Written Polish (with Emphasis on NLP Applications), a 3-year project nanced by the State Committee for Scientic Research.","2","In case of proper names, there exist many dedicated algorithms and systems for nding them in texts, often developed within the Message Understanding Conference series. ments of texts which are subject to morphosyntactic tagging. We propose the following guidelines for segmentation (for a more complete discussion see our other article in this volume):"," tokens do not contain white space;"," tokens either are punctuation marks or do not contain any punctuation marks;"," an exception to the previous guideline are certain words containing the hyphen (e.g., mass-media, s-ka = an abbreviation of spka ‘company’, etc.) and apostrophe used in Polish when inecting foreign names (e.g. Lagrange’a); they are given by a list.","Those guidelines do not preculde the situation where an orthographic word is split into several POS tokens. For example, in the case of Polish past tense nite verbs, the morpheme bearing information on person and number can be attached to the verb itself (1a) or to some other word within the sentence (1b). For that reason we always consider such a ‘oating inection’ morpheme as a separate segment.3","(1) a. Dlaczego Why mi I-dat nie not","powiedziaa·s?","told be-you ‘Why haven’t you told me?’","b. Dlaczego·s Why be-you mi I-dat nie not powiedziaa? told 2.2 Morphological Categories Although we proposed ignoring some information often present in tagsets, e.g., the ‘proper noun’ vs. ‘common noun’ distinction, we argue that morphological categories should be taken seriously and should be as detailed as possible.","What follows is the complete list of morphological categories assumed in the proposed tagset:"," number: sg, pl ;"," case: nom, acc, gen, dat , inst , loc, voc;  gender: masculine personal m1 (facet), masculine animate m2 (ko·n), masculine inanimate m3 (st), feminine f (kobieta, zyrafa, 3 Segmentation, as understood in the present context, is","discussed at length in (Przepirkowski and Woli·nski, 2003). ksi azka), two neuter genders n1 (dziecko), n2 (okno), and three plurale tantum genders p1 (wujostwo), p2 (drzwi), p3 (okulary);"," person: pri , sec, ter;"," degree: pos, comp, sup;"," aspect : imperf , perf ;"," negation: aff , neg;"," accentability (Pol.: akcentowo·s·c): akc, nakc;"," post-prepositionality (Pol.: poprzyimkowo·s·c): praep, npraep;"," accommodability (Pol.: akomodacyjno·s·c): congr, rec;"," agglutination (Pol.: aglutynacyjno·s·c): nagl , agl ;"," vocability (Pol.: wokaliczno·s·c): wok , nwok .","It may seem surprising, at rst, to see 9 gender values in an Indo-European language (as opposed to, say, a Bantu language), but this position is well argued for by (Saloni, 1976), who distinguishes those genders on the basis of agreement with adjectives and numerals;4","we will not attempt to further justify this position here.","Negation is a category of various de-verbal classes, e.g., participles. Since we assume that the words pisz acy ‘writing’ and niepisz acy ‘not writ-ing’ have the same lemma pisa·c ’to write’, these words have to be distinguished with this morphological category.","The category of accentability is used to differentiate accented forms of nominal pronouns (e.g. jego, mnie) from weak forms (go, mi). It roughly corresponds to the category of clitic used in Multext-East.","Post-prepositionality is another category of nominal pronouns. It differentiates special forms","4","Elsewhere, we propose reducing the number of genders, essentially, by factoring out the number information (Woli·nski, 2001) or the information about agreement with numerals (Przepirkowski et al., 2002), but for the purposes of this tagset we assume the original repertoire of genders proposed by Saloni. used only directly after a preposition (e.g., niego, -·n) from forms that can be used in other contexts (jego, go).","The category of accomodability is important for the description of Polish numeral-nominal phrase. Some Polish numerals have forms that agree in case with noun (marked congr), as well as forms that require a noun in genitive case (marked rec):","(2) Przyszli came dwaj two-nom.congr chopcy. boys-nom ‘Two boys came.’","(3) Przyszo came dwch/dwu two-nom.rec chopcw boys-gen ‘Two boys came.’","The need for the category of agglutination is a result of the way past tense verb forms are segmented (cf. (1) in sec. 2.1). For the majority of Polish verbs the form used for the rst and the second person is the same as the third person form:","(4) a. Ty you przyszede·s. came","b. On he przyszed. came But for some verbs these forms differ:","(5) a. Ty you nios(nagl )e·s. carried","b. On he nis(agl ). carried","Vocability distinguishes those ‘oating’ forms of the verb by·c ‘to be’ which attach to consonantnal forms (wok , e.g., -em) from the forms which attach to vowel-nal forms (nwok , e.g., -m).","Various non-standard categories used above, such as post-prepositionality, accomodability and agglutination, are based on important work by Zygmunt Saloni and his colleagues (Saloni, 1976; Saloni, 1977; Gruszczy ·nski and Saloni, 1978; Bie·n and Saloni, 1982). 2.3 Morphological Classes Morphological classes, or parts of speech, assumed within various tagsets are usually taken over more-or-less verbatim from traditional grammars. For example, the Multext-East tagset for Czech assumes the following parts of speech: noun, verb, adjective, pronoun, adverb, adposition, conjunction, numeral, interjection, residual, abbreviation and particle.","While tagsets based on such POSs are well-grounded in linguistic tradition, they do not represent a logically valid classication of wordforms in the sense that the criteria which seem to underlie these classes do not always allow to uniquely classify a given word. We will support this criticism with two examples.","Let us rst of all consider the classes pronoun and adjective. The former is morphosyntactically very heterogeneous:"," some pronouns inect for gender (e.g., the demonstrative pronoun ten, the possessive pronoun mj, but not the interrogative pronoun kto or the negative pronoun nikt);"," some pronouns, but not all, inect for person;"," some pronouns, but not all, inect for number;"," the short reexive pronoun sie does not overtly inect at all, although it may be construed as a weak form of the anaphoric pronoun siebie. It seems that the class of pronouns is dened mainly, if not solely, on the basis of semantic in-tuition. On the other hand, adjectives are well-dened morphosyntactically, as the forms inecting for gender, number and case, but not, say, person or voice.","Now, according to these denitions, it is not clear, whether so-called possessive pronouns, such as mj ‘my’ should be classied as pronouns or adjectives: semantically they belong to the former class, while morphosyntactically to the latter. (Traditionally, it is classied as a pronoun, of course.)","Another, and perhaps more serious example concerns so-called -nie/-cie gerunds, i.e., substantiva verbalia (Puzynina, 1969) such as pi·c::picie ‘to drink::drinking’, browsowa·c::browsowanie ‘to browse::browsing’.5","These are nominal forms in the sense that they have gender (always n2 ) and inect for case and, potentially, for number, but they are also productively related to verbs, have the category of aspect and inect for negation. As such, they do not comfortably t into the traditional class noun, whose members do not have aspect or negation, nor do they belong to the class verb, whose members have no case. A similar difculty is encountered also in case of adjectival participles, which apart from the adjectival inectional categories of gender, number and case also inect for negation and have aspect .","For this reason, and following the general approach of (Saloni, 1974) and (Bie ·n, 1991), we propose to derive the notion of grammatical class from the notion of exeme introduced by Bie ·n, where exeme is understood as a morphosyntactically homogeneous set of forms belonging to the same lexeme.","For example, a typical Polish verbal lexeme contains a number of personal forms, a number of impersonal forms, as well as, depending on a particular understanding of the notion of lexeme, various deverbal forms, such as participles and gerunds. These forms have very different morphosyntactic properties: nite non-past tense forms have the inectional categories of person and number, adjectival participles have the inectional properties of non-gradable adjectives and, additionally, inect for negation and have aspect, gerunds inect for case and, at least potentially, for number, but not for person, etc. Ideally, exemes are subsets of such lexemes consisting of those forms which have the same inectional properties: all verbal forms of given lexeme with the inectional category of person and number are grouped into one exeme, other forms belonging to this lexeme, but with adjectival inectional properties, are grouped into another exeme, those forms, which inect for case but not for gender are grouped into a gerundial exeme, etc. Each of such exemes is characterized by a set of grammatical categories it inects for and, perhaps, a set of grammatical categories it has lexically set (e.g., 5","The second pair illustrates the productivity of the gerundial derivational rule: browsowa·c is, of course, a very recent borrowing. the gender of nouns).","Now, given the notion of exeme, it is natural to dene grammatical classes as exemic classes, i.e., classes of exemes with the same inectional characteristics. For example, the grammatical class non-past verb contains exactly those exemes which inect for person and number, and nothing else, and which also have the lexical category of aspect; the class noun contains exactly those exemes which inect for number and case, and have gender; the class gerund contains exactly those exemes which inect for number, case and negation, and have lexical gender (always neuter, n2 , in case of gerunds) and aspect; etc.","It should be noted that, despite the way exemes have been dened above, the notion of lexeme is of only secondary importance here: it is invoked for the purpose of assigning a lemma to a given form (e.g., a gerundial form such as przyj·sciem ‘coming-inst ’ will be lemmatized to the in-nitival form przyj·s·c ‘to come’: even though the form przyj·s·c does not belong to the exeme of przyj·sciem, it does belong to the lexeme containing przyj·sciem). Moreover, just as in case of decid-ing whether two forms belong to the same lexeme, also classication of two wordforms to the same exeme requires some semantic intuition: thus, e.g., pies ‘dog-nom’ and psem ‘dog-inst ’ belong to the same (f)lexeme, and so do rok ‘year-sg’ and lata ‘year-pl ’, but pies ‘dog’ and suka ‘bitch’ do not.","The basic classication of exemes into grammatical (‘exemic’) classes is given by the following decision tree: Inflects for case? YES: Inflects for negation?","YES: Inflects for gender?","YES: 1. adjectival participle","NO: 2. gerund","NO: Inflects for gender?","YES: Has person?","YES: 3. nominal pronoun","NO: Inflects for number?","YES: 4. adjective","NO: 5. numeral","NO: 6. noun NO: Inflects for gender?","YES: 7. l-participle","NO: Inflects for number?","YES: 8. (inflecting verbal forms)","NO: 9. (‘non-inflecting’ verbal","forms, adverbs, prepositions,","conjunctions)","Note that most of the classes in the ‘inects for case’ branch of the tree already are reason-able POSs, i.e., they correspond to traditional POSs (noun, adjective, numeral) or to their well-dened subsets (nominal pronoun, gerund, adjectival participle). It is important to realize, however, that these classes are dened mainly on the basis of the inectional properties of their members; e.g., the class numeral is much narrower here than traditionally, as it does not include so-called ordinal numerals (which, morphosyntactically, are adjectives).","On the other hand, in the ‘does not inect for case’ branch, only the ‘inects for gender’ class corresponds to an intuitive set of forms, namely, to so-called l-participles or past participles, i.e., verbal forms hosting ‘oating inections’; cf. powiedziaa in (1) above.","The class 8. above can be further partitioned according to the following criteria: 8. Has a ter (i.e., 3rd person) form?","YES: 8.1. non-past forms","NO: Has a pri sg form?","YES: 8.2. agglutinate","(-(e)m, -(e)·s, -·smy, -·scie)","NO: 8.3. imperative Non-past verb forms correspond to present tense for imperfective verbs (e.g., ide ‘I am going’) and future tense for perfective ones (e.g., pjd e ‘I will go’).","Further, we will remove from the class of nouns the exeme of the strong reexive pronoun siebie, which does not inect for number and does not have overt gender: 6. Inflects for number?","YES: 6.1. true noun","NO: 6.2. siebie Moreover, inectional class marked as 9. can","be further split according to non-inectional mor-","phosyntactic properties of its members in the fol-","lowing way:","9. Has aspect? YES: 9.1. non-inflecting verbal forms NO: Inflects for degree or derived","from adjective?","YES: 9.2. adverb","NO: 9.3. preposition, conjunction,","etc. In order to arrive at a class close to the traditional class of adverbs, we had to dene this class disjunctively; it should contain all adverbs inecting for degree, at least one of which does not seem to be derived from an adjective (bardzo ‘very’), as well as all de-adjectival adverbs, some of which do not (synthetically) inect for degree (e.g., antywirusowo ‘anti-virus-like’, *antywirusowiej).","If our purpose were to dene a purely exemic tagset for Polish, we would have to stop here (and remove the ‘derived from adjective’ disjunct from the subtree above). For example, it is impossible to distinguish the impersonal -no/-to form, the innitive, and adverbial participle of the same lexeme on the basis of their morphosyntactic properties alone: they all lack any inectional categories and have the lexical category of aspect . For this reason, we will further partition the class 9.1. above on the basis of purely orthographic (or phonetic) information: 9.1. Ends in -no or -to?","YES: 9.1.1. impersonal -no/-to forms","(e.g., chodzono ‘one used to","walk/go’, pito ‘one used to","drink’)","NO: Ends in - ac or -szy?","YES: 9.1.2. adverbial participle","(e.g., czytaj ac ‘reading’,","przeczytawszy ‘having read’)","NO: 9.1.3. innitive form (e.g.,","i·s·c ‘to go’); should end","in -c or -·c","Finally, the class 9.3. consists of those wordforms which do not inect, and do not have aspect , i.e.: 9.3.1. conjunction 9.3.2. preposition 9.3.3. particle-adverb The rst two classes are closed classes, which can be dened extensionally, by enumerating them. All other non-inecting, non-aspectual and nonde-adjectival single-form exemes fall into the particle-adverb class.","The table on the next page presents the complete repertoire of grammatical classes and their respective inectional (‘ ","’) and lexical (‘","’) categories. Some more ephemeral classes not mentioned in the decision tree are briey described below (a more complete description of a previous version of this tagset is available in (Woli ·nski and Przepirkowski, 2001)).","For Polish nouns of masculine personal (m1 ) gender a stylistically marked form is possible be-sides a ‘regular’ form for nominative and vocative","number","case gender","person","de gree","aspect ne gation","accent.","post-prep. accom.","aggl.","v ocab . noun","   depreciative noun   adjective","","",""," ad-adjectival adjective post-prepositional adjective adverb  numeral"," "," pronoun (non-3rd person)","    pronoun (3rd person)"," "," ","  pronoun siebie  non-past verb","   future by·c","   agglut. by·c","    l-participle","    imperative","   -no/-to innitive adv. pres. prtcp. adv. anter. prtcp. gerund"," ","   adj. act. prtcp."," ","   adj. pass. prtcp."," ","   winien-like verb","   predicative preposition conjunction particle-adverb alien (nominal)","   alien (other) case in plural (e.g., profesory vs. profesorowie). These special forms do not t in the scheme of regular nominal inection, and so were moved to a separate exeme for depreciative noun.","Ad-adjectival adjectives are special forms of adjectives used in compounds like angielskopolski ‘English-Polish’. Moreover, some adjectives (e.g., polski) have a special form that is required after some prepositions (e.g., po polsku ‘in Polish’). This form constitutes post-prepositional adjective exeme.","A few verbs (e.g., powinien ‘should’) inect in an atypical way and lack some verbal exemes (e.g., imperative and l-participle). Winien-like exeme gathers present tense forms of these verbs (which accept ‘oating inection’).","The class of predicatives consists of verbs which do not inect at all (e.g., warto ‘be worth’, mozna ‘can/may’, trzeba ‘must’)."]},{"title":"3 Conclusions","paragraphs":["Two tagsets can be compared and respective correspondences between their grammatical classes and categories can be found more easily when the denitions of those classes and categories are stated explicitly and formulated in terms of easily veriable formal properties of particular wordforms, such as their inectional, morphosyntactic and derivational characteristics, and their phono-logical or orthographic makeup.","We presented a tagset for Polish constructed with such criteria in mind. In particular, grammatical classes are understood as classes of exemes, i.e., they are dened on the basis of, rst of all, inectional and, secondly, morphosyntactic properties of wordforms. Further distinctions, such as those between non-inecting forms of verbal lexemes, are also made with the avoidance of any recourse to the semantic or pragmatic properties of such forms. This allowed us to evade the controversial issues of the exact extent of such semantically-dened traditional POSs as numeral and pronoun.","Despite the evasion of semantic criteria, the resulting set of grammatical classes bears surprising afnity to traditional POSs, with classes such as noun and adjective corresponding directly to traditional POSs, and other classes, such as non-past verb, l-participle or gerund being proper subclasses of such traditional POSs as verb. Because of this ne-grainedness of the current tagset we were able to evade the controversial issues of whether to classify gerunds as nouns or as verbs, and whether to classify adjectival participles as adjectives or as verbs."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["The tagset described here was highly inuenced by many discussions with ukasz Debowski, by the insightful comments we received from Zygmunt Saloni, and by the various remarks from Elzbieta Hajnicz, Monika Korczakowska and Beata Wierzchoowska.
