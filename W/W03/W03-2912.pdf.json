In the last 15 years Russian computational morphology has advanced at a great rate from first quite restricted systems towards large-scale practical morphological analyzers ( Ashmanov I., 1995; Belonogov, Zelenkov, 1989; Belyaev, Surcis, Yablonsky, 1993; Bolshakov, 1990; Mikheev, Liubushkina, 1995; Segalovich, 1995). This paper attempts to introduce results of 15 years ongoing project on developing of Russian resources and software for building advance Russian language morphological analyzers and their applications that enable a different forms of text indexing and retrieval, and a direct benefit from the Russian morphological analyzers in:","information-acquisition tools,","authoring tools,","language-learning tools,","translation-tools,","summarizers,","semantic web etc. The objectives of this project are not unique. Several analogous projects have been carried out to different stages. In the late eighties of XX century we developed one of the first Russian morphologic analyzers on PC (Yablonsky S., 1990; Belyaev B.M., Surcis A.S., Yablonsky S.A., 1993; Yablonsky S.A., 1998; Yablonsky S.A., 1999). Now we are developing a set of platform independent Internet/Intranet Russian language processing tools based on Java and Oracle technologies."]},{"title":"2 Russian Resources for Morphology","paragraphs":["Russicon company has such main counterparts","(Yablonsky S.A., 1998) for Russian morphology","software development:","- Russian lexicon which is formed from the intersection of the perfect set of Russicon Russian grammatical dictionaries with inflection paradigms (200.000 paradigms that produce more then 6.000.000 inflection word forms).

Linguistic Model (LM) of the language consists of all declarative knowledge about the language, which is concentrated in the set of dictionaries and linguistic tables. The number of word forms P for Slavic inflection languages is rather high (P>>1) for some parts of speech. For example, in Russian language P > 100 for verbs. For the formal description of inflection morphology model the set theory is used. It is one of the best ways for description of inflection morphology (Bider, Bolshakov, 1976), (Kulagina, 1986). We present the general set model that permits to define mostly all sides of inflection morphology. It is realized in the Russian and Ukrainian morphological analyzers. In this model some concepts for the first time and other have new or more full meaning. We use defini-tions from (Yablonsky, 1999). Let H = { h1, h2, ... , hNh } be the set of part-of-speech (pos) categories and P = { p1, p2, ... , pNp } — lexical categories (LC) of gender, number etc. Each element pi ∈ P, where i = 1, Np , represents the set of concrete realizations of lexical category pi = {pi,1, pi,2, ... ,pi,Ni}. Let us chose one element in P (for definiteness p1) named type and denoted by T (T = p1, T ∈ P), T = {t1, t2,..., tNt}. For example, Russian language model includes: H1","= {h1 = \"noun\", h2 = \"adjective\", h32","= \"verb\", h4 = \"particle\", h5 = \"parenthetic word\", h6 = \"modal word\", h7 = \"adverb\", h8 = \"conjunction\", h9 = \"interjection\", h10 = \"preposition\", h11 = \"abbreviation\", h12 = \"unit of measure\", h13 = \"pronoun\", h14 = \"numeral\", h15 = \"adverbial participle“, h16 = \"composition or special prefix\"}. P = {p1 = \"case\", p2 = \"gender\", p3 = \"number\", p4 = \"time\", p5 = \"person\", p6 = \"degree\", p7 = \"voice\", p8 = \"aspect\", p9 = \"mood\", p10 = \"form\", p11 = \"transitivity\", p12 = \"reflexive\", p13 = \"animate\"}, where p1 = {\"nominative\", \"genitive\", \"dative\", \"accusative\", \"instrumental\", \"prepositional\"}, p2 = {\"masculine\", \"feminine\", \"neuter\", masculine/feminine\"}, p3 = {\"singular\", \"plural \"}, p4 = {\"present\", \"past\", future\", present / future \"}, p5 = {\"1st person\", \"2nd person\", \"3rd person \"}, p6 = {\"superlative\", \"comparative\"}, p7 = {\"active \", \"passive\"}, p8 = {\"imperfective\", \"perfective\", \"perfective and imperfective\"}, p9 = {\"indicative\", \"imperative\"}, p10 = {\"full\", \"short (predicative)\", \"infinitive\"}, p11 = {\"transitive \", \"intransitive\"}, p12 = {\"reflexive\", \"irrevocable\"}, p13 = {\"animate\", \"inanimate\"}. We take that (∀hk : hk∈H) (∃Tk : Tk ⊂ T, Tk ≠ ∅), i.e. at least one type exists for each  1 Our model for Russian slightly differs from the classic: we include in the sets H and P some additional elements. 2 In the paradigm of the verb we include participle and adverbial participle. part of speech and is named ordinary, and also Tk = {tk,1, tk,2, ... , tk,Nk}, where k = 1, Nh . For example, in Russian for h1 = \"noun\", T1 = {\"ordinary\", \"invariable\", \"substantival\"}. For (hk, tk,j) = (\"noun\", \"ordinary\"): P1k,t = {\"gender\"}, P2k,t = {\"case\",\"number\"}, P3k,t = {\"animate\"}, Xk,t = (X*k,t = {\"nominative case\", \"singular number\"}, {\"genitive case\", \"singular number\"}, {\"dative case\", \"singular number\"}, {\"accusative case\", \"singular number\"}, {\"instrumental case\", \"singular number\"}, {\"prepositional case\", \"singular number\"}, {\"nominative case\", \"plural number\"}, {\"genitive case\", \"plural number\"}, {\"dative case\", \"plural number\"}, {\"accusative case\", \"plural number\"}, {\"instrumental case\", \"plural number\"}, {\"prepositional case\", \"plural number\"}, {\"2-nd genitive case\", \"singular number\"}, {\"2-nd instrumental case\", \"singular number\"}, {\"2-nd prepositional case\", \"singular number\"}, {\"2-nd accusative case\", \"singular number\"}, {\"2-nd accusative case\", \"plural number\"}). Then (∀hk∀tk,j : hk∈H, tk,j∈Tk, k=1, Nh , j=1, Nk ) (∃ Pk,t : Pk,t ⊂ P, t Nk k=1 Nh =1UU Pk,t = P ), i.e. for each part of speech exists it's own, may be empty, set of LC. Elements of Pk,t are named LC of t-type hk. For all Pk,t exists partition on three nonoverlapping and may be empty subsets, named P1","k,t, P2 k,t, P3","k,t: (∀Pk,t : Pk,t⊂P) (∃P1 k,t∃P2 k,t∃P3 k,t : P1 k,t U P2 k,t U P3 k,t=Pk,t , P1 k,t I P2k,t I P3 k,t = ∅). Elements of P1 k,t are named as ordinary LC, elements of P2 k,t — special LC, elements of P3","k,t — individual LC of t-type hk. For each Pk,t set, if Pk,t ≠ ∅, there exists ordered sequence of sets Xk,t = (X1","k,t, X2","k,t, ... , XNxkt k,t). That is, if P2 k,t = {p2 k,t,1,","p2 k,t,2, ... , p2 k,t,Nkt2}, then Xl k,t = {x,j : x,j ∈ p2 k,t,i, i = 1, Nk t2 }, where l = 1, Nxk t , and if P2 k,t = ∅, then it is considered that Xk,t = (∅). We shall call sequence Xk,t s the sequence of lexical categories of word inflective paradigm of t-type hk. One of lexical categories, usually the first, is named X*t,k and called normalized. There exists a single pair (hk,tk,j), (hk∈H, tk,j∈Tk, k = 1, Nh , j = 1, Nk ) for every lexeme and, therefore, ordered list of LC Xk,t. Let us define function fl→W(l), l = 1, Nx ,with range of values W'I = WI ∪ {ε}, where ε – dummy, nonexistent word form. Thereby, for every lexeme WI an ordered sequence of word-forms YWi = (y1, y2, ... , yNx) (yj∈WI for j = 1, Nx ) could be formed. Such sequence is called word changing paradigm of lexeme Wi (WCP). If for lexeme WI exists such l, that fl→W(l) = ε, it is said that lexeme WI has a dummy word changing paradigm (Apresyan, 1989). If the pair (hk, tk,j) corresponds to lexeme WI and for some l = l* from 1, Nx conditions: fl→X(l*) = X*k,t and y* = fl→W (l*) (y*∈YWi, y*≠ε), are fulfilled, then we shall call the word form y* as normalized form or lemma of lexeme Wi. Usually y* = y1. As a rule, infinitive is a lemma for the verb etc. Let YWi – WCP of lexeme Wi. Then word form's inflections of paradigm YWi form ordered sequence denoted by YFLCi. Inflection class (FC) number I denoted by FCI is the five:  FCI = < hk, tk,j, P1 k,t, Xk,t, YFLCi > (1),  where hk – some part of speech; tk,j – some realization of LC type for corresponding part of speech; P1","k,t – ordinary LC, corresponding to tk,j; Xk,t – sequence of special LC of WCP, corresponding to tk,j; YFLCi – some I-th sequence of inflections, also called WCP of FC, where |Xk,t| = |YFLCi|. Inflection class concept was first used by (Belonogov, Zelenkov, 1985), although inflection class was understood only as ordered sequence of inflections. Let for lexeme W WIS* = (b*1, b*2, ... , b*NWIS*) and exists WISm = ( b1, b2, ... , bNWIS), where m = 1÷|Xk,t|, such, that WISm ≠ WIS*. Consequently, exists natural number N0, N0 = 0÷min (NWIS, NWIS*), such, that (b*1, b*2, ... , b*No) = (b1, b2, ... , bNo); (b*No+1, ... , b*NWIS*) ≠ (bNo+1, ... , bNWIS). Let us call the ordered sequence zs","I,m = ((bNo+1, ... , bNWIS), (b*No+1, ... , b*NWIS*)), allowing to obtain lemma WIS from some word form WIS, direct substitution. Here I is a FC number, m – position number in WIS FC, s – exact pair number among other pairs in the m-th position. For each I-th FC is defined ordered set ZI (may be empty): ZI = {zI,1, zI,2, ... , zI,Nzi}, где Nzi = |Xk,t|. Each zI,m= {z1 I,m, z2","I,m, ... , zNzim","I,m}, where","m = 1÷|Xk,t|, also is a set of pairs of direct substi-","tutions (may be empty). If the pair zs","I,m = (bm",",b*)","is a direct substitution, then the pair (b*,bm",") is","called reverse substitution. Reverse substitution","allows obtaining some m-th word form WIS","from lemma WIS. There is one-to one corre-","spondence between the sets B* = {..., b*, ...}","and Bm","= {..., bm",", ...}. Thus, |B*| = |Bm","|; if (b*,","bm","1) and (b*, bm","2), then bm","1= bm","2; if (b*1, bm",") and (bm",", b*2) , then b*1= b*2. The letters from the constant part of WIS could be added to the be-ginnings of such character sequences for achievement of this term. For example, the genitive of the plural noun КОПЕЙКА (copeck) with lexeme WIS* = (КОПЕЙК) is WIS 7 = (КОПЕЕК). Direct substitution should be (ЕК, ЙК), but for the lexeme of the same inflexion class (FC = 154) «ПУЛЬКА» (kitty or pellet or pool) direct substitution in the same position must be (ЕК, ЬК). This generates ambiguity. Therefore, two pairs of direct substitutions: (ЕЕК, ЕЙК) и (ЛЕК, ЛЬК) are formed in the morphology model for inflexion class 154 and m = 7. Thus, for some inflection classes the set of direct substitutions should be formed. So, for obtaining word form of WCP with given LC it is enough to define WIS of the lemma, number of the inflexion class and the number of word form in WCP, thus the three < WIS*, FC, l>. If Yl = '–', then for given FC and, accordingly, for given lexeme the word form with such LC does not exist. However, even if Yl ≠ '–', paradigm of the given lexeme could be dummy. Such situation is described with the help of the set P3","k,t of individual LC of given lexeme. For example, lexemes «ДЕЛАТЬ» (do) and «СДЕЛАТЬ» have the same inflection class 175 and, hence, the same realization of ordinary and special LC, but they have different value of aspect: verb «ДЕЛАТЬ» – imperfective aspect, verb «СДЕЛАТЬ» – perfective aspect. So LC aspect should be the individual LC for this pair. Additionally, the individual LC could impose restriction on the existence of some inlections of the word. In the above example for FC = 175 FLC44 = «ЫЙ» и Z175,44 = («ЕМ», ~), where sign '~' designates empty sequence. For the verb «ДЕЛАТЬ» WIS* = «ДЕЛА» → y44 = «ДЕЛА- ЕМЫЙ». For the verb «СДЕЛАТЬ»: WIS* = «СДЕЛА» → y44 = «СДЕЛАЕМЫЙ». This contradicts with Russian language standard. So in the morphologic model should be the rules “rejecting“ some inflection forms according their individual LC information. Such exclusion for given lexeme could be set explicitly by indicating the number of concrete inflection. For example, for lexeme «МЕЧТА» (dream) there is no y8 – plural genitive inflection. The set of individual LC realizations of lexeme inflections and numbers of forbidden inflections of WIP are considered to be individual feature of lexeme and are marked by I. Thus, LC of every lexeme Wi could be given by three: ","Wi = < WIS*i, FC, Ii >. (2)"," Linguistic tables (LT) form the second counter-part of the model FC (1). The structure of each LT depends on its utility type. For example, let us describe LT of ordinary LC (table of inflection classes). Table structure is simple:"," TableFC→FLC = { <FC1,Lc1>, <FC2Lc2>, ...,<FCm,Lcm>},  where m – general number of FC; Lc – 8-bit code of general LC. The interpretation of general LC in 8-bit code (d1,...d8) is like this: 4 low digits (d1-d4) depend on the value of 4 high digits (d5-d8) that distinguish part of speech. For example, the values d1=0, d2=0, d3=0, d4=0 define a noun, d1=0, d2=0, d3=0, d4=1 – an adjective. For nouns other 4 bits could be interpreted as thus: d7=1, d8=0 – ordinary noun, d7=0, d8=1 – substantial noun, d7=1, d8=1 –unchangeable noun. Bits d5, d6 are defined only for ordinary nouns and define gender p2 = {{\"masculine\", \"feminine\", \"neuter\", masculine/ feminine\"}: d5=0, d6=0 – masculine, d5=0, d6=1 – femine, d5=1, d6=0 – neutur, d5=1, d6=1 – masculine/feminine. General set model of inflection morphology we presented (Yablonsky S., 1999) permits to define mostly all sides of inflection morphology for Russian, Ukrainian and other Slavic languages."]},{"title":"4 Russian Lexical Databases for Mor-phology","paragraphs":["The morphological analyzer has two main parts:  • dictionary with declarative linguistic knowl-","edge of the language; • program realization of morphologic model's","algorithms.

The UML is an object-oriented methodology that standardizes modeling language and notation, not a particular method. Using UML enhances communication between linguistic experts, workflow specialists, software designers and other professionals with different backgrounds. We introduced simplified UML data model (see figure 1) for word-dictionary database and developed a table-based UML mapping according to UML notations. There are two main tablesin database. Relational table LEMMA is destined for storing lemma’s linguistic information and has such attributes: L_NUM – lemma’s index; L_NAME – lemma; FK_NUM – number of inflection class; L_PREF_LEN – length of prefixes; L_ROOT_LEN – length of root; L_SUF_LEN – length of suffixes; L_FLEX_LEN – length of inflection; L_TRANSCR – transcribtion; L_ACCENT – number of accent letter; L_BYTE – byte of additional linguistic information.
