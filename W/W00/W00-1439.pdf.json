Only lexical meaning components, necessary in any case for interpretation, can project structure. In our approach, the lexicon is not a separate level of representation with its own restrictions; we offer a structural account for what has hitherto been accounted for in terms of argument (number) specification, theta-roles, and mapping conditions. Each lexical semantic component projects a V-complement structure, the complement typically realizing the categorical type of the component, as shown:"]},{"title":"V V V / \\ / \\ / V N V A V I I I VM VS VL M = manner/means/instrument \\ S = state P L = location","paragraphs":["The full projections correspond roughly to the Vendler-Dowty aspectual classes: process/ change-of-state/ activity achievement cause + change of state/ accomplishment V V"]},{"title":"I \\ I \\ I","paragraphs":["D V D V"]},{"title":"I /\\ /\\ I \\","paragraphs":["Jane V N the vase V A"]},{"title":"I I I I","paragraphs":["laugh [laugh]M break [break]s [break].

Transitivity thus follows from the number of projected meaning components and crucially from the availability of an interpretation for each component in a particular projection. Unprojected components are aspectually defocussed (backgrounded) and are interpreted as modifiers. Such aspectual defocussing also accounts for the variety of constructions in which different verbs can occnr, e.g. the contrast between break and cut, which does not allow *The cake cut. We demonstrate how a combination of semantic component projection and aspectual focus accounts for the possibilities of verbal distribution and interpretation. 272"]}]}
