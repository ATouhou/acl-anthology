General architecture of the animation system","The planner uses information from the general schema, such as pre-conditions and post-assertions, as well as information derived from the agents' capabilities and the objects properties to fill in these gaps in several ways:","• to select the way (activity) in which the instruction is performed (enter by walking, by swimming, etc.);","• to determine the prepartory actions that must be completed before the instruction is carried out, (for example, in order for an agent to open the door, the door has to be reachable and that may involve a locomotion process);","• to decompose the action into smaller units (put the glass on the table, involves getting the glass, planning a route to the table, etc.)","The output of the planner for the input instruction is a complete description of the actions involved, in-cluding participants, preparatory specifications, termination conditions, manner, duration, etc. Participants bring with them a list of inherent properties of the agent (e.g. agent capabilities) or physical objects (e.g., object configurations) and other characteristics, such as 'how to open' for an object such as a door. This complete description refers to a set of animation PARS which can be immediately animated.","In this way, a PAR schema for the action enter may actually translate into an animation PAR for walking into a certain area. One way to differentiate between action PAR schemas and instantiated animation PARs is to consider what it is possible to motion capture 4 (by attaching sensors to a moving human figure). For example, the enter action and the put action are quite general and underspecified and could not be motion captured. However, characteristic activities such as walking and swimming could be. For further details about the animation PARs and the animation system see (Badler et al., 1999) and (Bindiganavaie et al., 2000). 4 PAR as anIL The PAR representation for an action can be seen as a general template. PAR schemas include, as part of the basic sub-categorization frame, properties of","4There are several other ways to generate motions, for example, through inverse kinematics, dynamics and keyframing. the action that can occur linguistically either as the main verb or as adjuncts to the main verb phrase. This captures problems of divergences, such as the ones described by Talmy (Talmy, 1991), for verb-framed versus satellite-framed languages.","New information may come from a sentence in natural language that modifies the action's inherent properties, such as in John hit the ball slowly, where 'slowly' is not part of the initial representation of the action 'hit'. This new information is added to the PAR schema. Verb- versus Satellite-framed languages Verb-Framed Languages (VFL) map the motion (path or path + ground location) onto the verb, and the manner either onto a satellite or an adjunct, while Satellite-Framed Languages (SFL) map the motion into the satellite, and the manner onto the main verb.","English and other Germanic languages are considered satellite-framed languages, expressing the path in the satellite; Spanish, among other Romance languages, is a verb-framed language and expresses the path in the main verb. The pairs of sentences (1) and (2) from Talmy (1991) show examples of these divergences. In (1), in English, the exit of the bottle is expressed by the preposition out, in Spanish the same concept is incorporated in the main verb salir (to exit). In (2), the concept of blowing out the candle is represented differently in English and Spanish.","(1) The bottle .floated out La boteUa sali6 flotando (the bottle exited floating)","(2) I blew out the candle Apagud la vela sopldndola (I extinguish the candle blowing) 4.1 Motion In order to capture generalizations about motion actions, we have a generalized PAR schema for motion, and our hierarchy includes different types of motion actions such as inherently directed motion and manner of motion actions that inherit from the more general schema, as shown in Figure 4. Directed motion actions, such as enter and exit, don't bring with them the manner by which the action is carried out but they have a inherent termination condition. For example, 'enter a room' may be done by walking, crawling or flying depending on the agents' ca-"]},{"title":"14 motion/(par: motion)","paragraphs":["directed_motion manner_raotion enter/(term: in (0B J) ) exit/(term: out (0B J) ) crawl/(act : crawl) float/(act ::float) Figure 4: PAR schema hierarchy for motion actions pabilities, but it should end when the agent is in the room. In contrast, manner of motion verbs express the action explicitly and don't have an intrinsic termination condition.","Motion is a type of framing event where the path is in the main verb for VFLs and in the satellite for SFLs. In (3), we see the English sentence expressing the 'enter' idea in the preposition into whereas the Spanish sentence expresses it in the main verb entrar (to enter).","(3) The bottle floated into the cave La botella entr5 flotando a la cueva (the bottle entered floating the cave)","The PAR schemas don't distinguish the representation for these sentences, because there is a single schema which includes both the manner and the path without specifying how they are realiized linguistically. Mappings from the lexical items to the schemas or to constraints in the schemas can be seen in Figure 5. 5 Independent of which is the source language, the PAR schema selected is motion, the activity field, which determines how the action is performed (in this case, by floating), is filled by float (the main verb in English, or the adjunct in Spanish). The termination condition, which says that action ends when the agent is in the object, is added from the preposition in English and is part of the semantics of the main verb to enter in Spanish.","EN float/[par:motion,activity:float] into/[term:in(AG,OBJ)]","SP entrar/[par:motion,term:in(AG,OBJ)] flotar/[activity :float] Figure 5: Entries for the example sentences in (3)","Because all of the necessary elements for a translation are specified in this representation, it is up","5A lexical item may have several mappings to reflect its semantics: For instance, float in English can be used also in the non-motion sense, in which case there will be two entries to capture that distinction.

Comparison with other work Our approach now diverges considerably from the approach outlined in Palmer et al. (1998) which discusses the use of Feature-Based Tree Adjoining Grammars, (Joshi, 1985; Vijay-Shanker and Joshi, 1991) to capture generalizations about manner-of-motion verbs. They do not propose an interlingua but use a transfer-based mechanism expressed in Synchronous Tree Adjoining Grammars to capture divergences of VFL and SFL through the use of semantic features and links between the grammars. The problem of whether or not a prepositional phrase constitutes an argument to a verb or an adjunct (described by Palmer et al.) does not constitute a problem in our representation, since all the information is recovered in the same template for the action to be animated.","The PAR approach is much more similar to the Lexical Conceptual Structures (LCS) approach, (Jackendoff, 1972; Jackendoff, 1990), used as an interlingua representation (Doff, 1993). Based on the assumption that motion and manner of motion are conflated in a matrix verb like swim, the use of LCS allows separation of the concepts of motion, direc-tion, and manner of motion in the sentence John swam across the lake. Each one of these concepts is"]},{"title":"15","paragraphs":["represented separately in the interlingua representation, as GO, PATH and MANNER, respectively. Our approach allows for a similar representation and the end result is the same, namely that the event of swimming across the lake is characterized by separate semantic components, which can be expressed by the main schema and by the activity field. In addition, our representation also incorporates details about the action such as applicability conditions, preparatory specifications, termination conditions, and adverbial modifiers. It is not clear to us how the LCS approach could be used to effect the same commonality of representation. 4.2 Instrument The importance of the additional information such as the termination conditions can be more clearly illustrated with a different set of examples. Another class of actions that presents interesting divergences involves instruments where the instrument is used as the main verb or as an adjunct depending on the language. The sentence pair in (4) shows this divergence for English and Portuguese. Because Portuguese does not have a verb for to spoon, it uses a more general verb colocar (to put) as the main verb and expresses the instrument in a prepositional phrase. Unlike directed motion actions, a put with hand-held instrument action (e.g., spoon, scoop, ladle, etc.) leaves the activity field unspecified in both languages. The specific action is generated by taking the instrument into account. A simplified schema is shown in Figure 7.","(4) Mary spoons chocolate over the ice cream Mary coloca chocolate sobre o sorvete coma colher (Mary puts chocolate over the ice cream with a spoon) PUT3 PAR activity : - participants :","agent: Mary","objects: chocolate,","icecresm,","spoon preparatory_spec : get(Mary, spoon) termination_cond : over(chocolate, icecream) Figure 7: Representation of the sentences in (4)","Notice that the only connection between to spoon and its Portuguese translation would be the termination condition where the object of the verb, chocolate, has a new location which is over the ice cream. 5 Conclusion We have discussed a parameterized representation of actions grounded by the needs of animation of instructions in a simulated environment. In order to support the animation of these instructions, our representation makes explicit many details that are often underspecified in the language, such as start and end states and changes in the environment that happen as a result of the action.","Sometimes the start and end state information provides critical information for accurate translation but it is not always necessary. Machine translation can often simply preserve ambiguities in the translation without resolving them. In our application we cannot afford this luxury. An interesting question to pursue for future work will be whether or not we can determine which PAR slots are not needed for machine translation purposes.","Generalizations based on action classes provide the basis for an interlingua approach that captures the semantics of actions without committing to any language-dependent specification. This framework offers a strong foundation for handling the range of phenomena presented by the machine translation task.","The structure of our PAR schemas incorporate into a single template the kind of divergence presented in verb-framed and satellite-framed languages. Although not shown in this paper, this representation can also capture idioms and noncompositional constructions since the animations of actions - and therefore the PARs that control them - must be equivalent for the same actions described in different languages.","Currently, we are also investigating the possibility of building these action representations from a class-based verb lexicon which has explicit syntactic and semantic information (Kipper et al., 2000).
