Comparable corpora gather texts sharing common features (domain, topic, genre, discourse) without having a source text-target text relationship. They are considered by human translators more trustworthy than parallel corpora (Bowker and Pearson, 2002). Moreover, they are available for any written languages and not only for pairs of languages involving English. The compilation of specialized dictionaries should take into account multi-word terms (MWTs) that are more precise and specic to a particular scientic domain than single-word terms (SWTs). The standard approach is based on lexical context analysis and relies on the simple observation that a SWT or a MWT and its translation tend to appear in the same lexical contexts. Correct results are obtained for SWTs with an accuracy of about 80% for the top 10-20 proposed candidates using large comparable corpora (Fung, 1998; Rapp, 1999; Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002) or 60% using small comparable corpora (D·ejean and Gaussier, 2002). In comparison, the results obtained for MWTs are disappointing. For instance, (Morin et al., 2007) have achieved 30% and 42% precision for the top 10 and top 20 candidates in a 0.84 million-word French-Japanese corpus. These results could be explained by the low frequency of MWTs compared to SWTs, by the lack of parallelism between the source and the target MWT extraction systems, and by the low performance of the alignment program. For SWTs, the process is in two steps: looking in a dictionary, and if no direct translation is available, starting the contextual analysis. Looking in the dictionary gives low results for MWTs: 1% compared to 30% for French and 20% for Japanese SWTs (Morin and Daille, 2006). To extend the coverage of the bilingual dictionary, an in-termediate step is added between looking in the dictionary and the contextual analysis that will propose several translation candidates to compare with the target MWTs. These candidate translations are obtained thanks to a compositional translation method (Melamed, 1997; Grefenstette, 1999). This method reveals some limits when MWTs in the source and the target languages do not share the same syntactic patterns. In this paper, we put forward an extended compo-"]},{"title":"95","paragraphs":["sitional method that bridges the gap between MWTs of different syntactic structures through morphological links. We experiment within this method of French-Japanese lexical alignment, using multilingual terminology mining chain made up of two terminology extraction systems; one in each language, and an alignment program. The term extraction systems are publicly available and both extract MWTs. The alignment program makes use of the direct context-vector approach (Fung, 1998; Rapp, 1999). The results show an improvement of 33% in the translation of MWTs that demonstrate the efciency of the morphologically based-method for lexical alignment."]},{"title":"2 Multilingual terminology mining chain","paragraphs":["Taking a comparable corpora as input, the multilingual terminology mining chain outputs a list of single- and multi-word candidate terms along with their candidate translations (see Figure 1). This chain performs a contextual analysis that adapts the direct context-vector approach (Rapp, 1995; Fung and McKeown, 1997) for SWTs to MWTs. It consists of the following ve steps:","1. For each language, the documents are cleaned, tokenized, tagged and lemmatized. For French, Brill’s POS tagger1","and the FLEM lemmatiser2 are used, and for Japanese, ChaSen3",". We then extract the MWTs and their variations using the ACABIT terminology extraction system available for French4","(Daille, 2003), English and Japanese5","(Takeuchi et al., 2004). (From now on, we will refer to lexical units as words, SWTs or MWTs).","2. We collect all the lexical units in the context of each lexical unit","and count their occurrence frequency in a window of","words around",". For each lexical unit","of the source and the target languages, we obtain a context vector 1 http://www.atilf.fr/winbrill/ 2 http://www.univ-nancy2.fr/pers/namer/ 3 http://chasen-legacy.sourceforge.jp/ 4 http://www.sciences.univ-nantes.fr/","info/perso/permanents/daille/ and release for","Mandriva Linux. 5 http://cl.cs.okayama-u.ac.jp/rsc/","jacabit/"," which gathers the set of co-occurrence units  associated with the number of times that ","and occur together ","",". In order to identify specic words in the lexical context and to reduce word-frequency effects, we normalize context vectors using an association score such as Mutual Information (Fano, 1961) or Log-likelihood (Dunning, 1993).","3. Using a bilingual dictionary, we translate the lexical units of the source context vector. If the bilingual dictionary provides several translations for a lexical unit, we consider all of them but weigh the different translations by their frequency in the target language.","4. For a lexical unit to be translated, we compute the similarity between the translated context vector and all target vectors through vector distance measures such as Cosine (Salton and Lesk, 1968) or Jaccard (Tanimoto, 1958).","5. The candidate translations of a lexical unit are the target lexical units closest to the translated context vector according to vector distance. In this approach, the translation of the lexical units of the context vectors (step 3 of the previous approach), which depends on the coverage of the bilingual dictionary vis-a-vis the corpus, is the most important step: the greater the number of elements translated in the context vector, the more discriminating the context vector in selecting translations in the target language. Since the lexical units refer to SWTs and MWTs, the dictionary must contain many entries which occur in the corpus. For SWTs, combining a general bilingual dictionary with a specialized bilingual dictionary or a multilingual thesaurus to translate context vectors ensures that much of their elements will be translated (Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002; D·ejean et al., 2002). For a MWT to be translated, steps 3 to 5 could be avoided thanks to a compositional method that will propose several translation candidates to directly compare with the target MWTs identied in step 1. Moreover, the compositional method is useful in step 3 to compensate for the bilingual dictionary when the multi-word units of the context vector are not directly translated."]},{"title":"96 dictionarybilingual","paragraphs":["Japanese documents French documents terminology extraction terminology extraction lexical context extraction lexical context extraction process translatedterms to be translationscandidate haversting lexical alignment The Web documents Figure 1: Architecture of the multilingual terminology mining chain"]},{"title":"3 Default compositional method","paragraphs":["In order to increase the coverage of the dictionary for MWTs that could not be directly translated, we generated possible translations by using a default compositional method (Melamed, 1997; Grefenstette, 1999).","For each element of the MWT found in the bilingual dictionary, we generated all the translated combinations identied by the terminology extraction system.

For instance, the French SWT hypertension (hypertension) is translated by the Japanese MWT","(here the kanji ","(taka) means high and the term","(ketsuatsu) means blood pressure).","Pattern switching MWTs in the source and the target language do not share the same syntactic patterns. For instance, the French MWT cellule graisseuse (fat cell) of N ADJ structure is translated by the Japanese MWT","of N N structure where the French noun cellule is translated by the Japanese noun","(saiboo - cellule - cell) and the French adjective graisseuse by the Japanese noun","(shiboo - graisse - fat).","Foreign name When a proper name is part of the MWT, it is not always translated: within the French MWT syndrome de Cushing (Cushing syndrome), Cushing is either transliterated  or remains unchanged Cushing ",". The foreign name Cushing is of course not present in the dictionary.","The pattern switching problem involves the Adjective/Noun and the Noun/Verb part-of-speech switches. The Adjective/Noun switch commonly involves a relational adjective (ADJR). According to grammatical tradition, there are two main categories among adjectives: epithetic adjectives such as important (signicant) and relational adjectives such as sanguin (blood). The former cannot have an agentive interpretation in contrast to the latter: the adjective sanguin (blood) within the MWT acidit·e sanguine (blood acidity) is an argument to the predicative noun acidit·e (acidity) and this is not the case for the adjective important (signicant) within the noun phrase acidit·e importante (signicant acidity). Such adjectives hold a naming func-tion (Levi, 1978) and are particularly frequent in scientic elds (Daille, 2001). Relational adjectives are either denominal adjectives, morphologically derived from a noun thanks to a sufx, or adjectives having a noun usage such as math·ematique (mathematical/mathematics). For the former, there are appropriate adjective-forming sufxes for French that lead to relational adjectives such as -ique, -aire, -al. For a noun, it is not possible to guess the adjective-forming sufx that will be employed as well as the alternation of the noun stem that could occur. Relational adjectives part of a MWT are often translated by a noun whatever the target language is. From French to Japanese, the examples are numerous: prescription m·edicamenteuse (","- medicinal prescription), surveillance glyc·emique (  - glycemic monitoring), bre alimentaire ( ","- dietary bre), produit laitier (","- dairy product), fonction r·enale (","- kidney func-tion).","The problem of fertility could only be solved thanks to a contextual analysis in contrast to the foreign name problem that could be solved by an heuristic. We decided to concentrate on the MWT pattern switching problem."]},{"title":"5 Morphologically-based compositional method","paragraphs":["When it is not possible to directly translate a MWT i.e. i) before performing the steps 3 to 5 of the contextual analysis for a multi-word term to be translated or ii) during step 3 for the translation of multi-word units of the context vector , we rst try to translate the MWT using the default compositional method.

We generate all possible forms of ","as matching stripping-recoding rules and keep those that belong to the biligual dictionary such as glyc·em-ie. Thus, we have created a morphological link between the MWT controle glyc·emique (glycemic control) of N ADJ structure and multi-word unit (MWU) of N Prep N structure contr ole de la glyc·emie (lit. control of glycemia). Since it has not been possible to translate all the parts of the MWT contr ole glyc·emique, because glyc·emique was not found in the dictionary, we use the morpholocally-linked MWU contr ole de la glyc·emie of which all the parts are translated. The morpholocally-linked MWU could be seen as a canonical lexical form in the translation process that possibly does not exist in the source language. For instance, if index glyc·emique (glycemic index) is a French MWT, the MWU index de la glyc·emie (lit. index of the glycemia) does not appear in the French corpus.","The stripping-recoding rules could be manually encoded, mined from a monolingual corpus using a learning method such as (Mikheev, 1997), or supplied by a source terminology extraction system that handles morphological variations. For such a system, a MWT is a canonical form which merges several synonymic variations. For instance, the French MWT exces pond·eral (overweight) is the canonical form of the following variants: exces pond·eral (overweight) of N ADJ structure, exces de poids (overweight) of N PREP N structure. It is this last method that we used for our experiment."]},{"title":"6 Evaluation","paragraphs":["In this section, we will outline the different linguistic resources used for our experiments. We then evaluate the performance of the default and morphologically-based compositional methods. 6.1 Linguistic resources In order to obtain comparable corpora, we selected the French and Japanese documents from the Web. The documents were taken from the medical domain, within the sub-domain of ‘diabetes’ and ‘nutrition’. Document harvesting was carried out by a domain-based search, then by manual selection. A search for documents sharing the same domain can be achieved using keywords reecting the specialized domain: for French alimentation, diab ete and ob·esit·e (food, diabetes, and obesity); for Japanese, ","and","(diabetes, and overweight). Then the documents were manually selected by native speakers of each language who are not domain specialists. These documents (248 for French and 538 for Japanese) were converted into plain text from HTML or PDF, yielding 1.5 million-word corpus (0.7 million-word for French and 0.8 million-word for Japanese).","The French-Japanese bilingual dictionary used in the translation phase was composed of four dictionaries freely available on the Web (","dico 1","7",",  dico 2","8",",","dico 3","9",", and","dico 4","10","), and the French-Japanese Scientic Dictionary (1989) (called  dico 5",").

We proposed an extended compositional method that bridges the gap between MWTs of different syntactic structures through morphological links. We experimented with the method on MWTs of N ADJ structure involving a relational adjective. By the use of a list of stripping-recoding rules conjugated with a terminology extraction system, the method was more efcient than the default compositional method. The evaluation proposed at the end of the paper shows that 170 French-Japanese MWTs were extracted with a high precision (88.2%). This increases the coverage of the French-Japanese terminology of MWTs that can be obtained by the bilingual dictionary or the default compositional method. We are aware that the efciency of this method relies on the completeness of the morphological ressources, dictionaries and stripping-recoding rules. Such resources need to be up todate for new domains and corpus.","In this study, we have observed that MWTs are of a different nature in each language: French patterns cover nominal phrases while Japanese patterns focus on morphologically-built compounds.
