Most NLP systems have difficulties in dealing with synonyms, which are different representations that have the same meaning in a language. Information retrieval (IR) could leverage synonyms to improve the coverage of search results (Qiu and Frei, 1993). For example, when we input the query ‘transportation in India’ into an IR system, the system can expand the query to its synonyms; e.g. ‘transport’ and ‘railway’, to find more documents.","This paper proposes a method for the automatic identification of bilingual synonyms in a bilingual lexicon, with spelling variation clues. A bilingual synonym set is a set of translation-equivalent term pairs sharing the same meaning. Although a number of studies have aimed at identifying synonyms, this is the first study that simultaneously finds synonyms in two languages, to our best knowledge.","Let us consider the case where a user enters the Japanese query ‘kōjō’ (, industrial plant) into a cross-lingual IR system to find English documents. After translating the query into the English translation equivalent, ‘plant,’ the cross-lingual IR system may expand the query to its English synonyms, e.g. ‘factory,’ and ‘workshop,’ and retrieve documents that include the expanded terms. However, the term ‘plant’ is ambiguous; the system may also expand the query to ‘vegetable,’ and the system is prevented by the term which is different from our intention. In contrast, the system can easily reject the latter expansion, ‘vegetable,’ if we are aware of bilingual synonyms, which indicate synonymous relations over bilingual lexicons: (kōjō, plant) ∼ (kōjō, factory) and (shokubutsu1",", plant) ∼ (shokubutsu, vegetable)2","(See Figure 1). The expression of the translation equivalent, (kōjō, plant), helps a cross-lingual IR system to retrieve documents that include the term ‘plant,’ used in the meaning for kōjō, or industrial plants.","We present a supervised machine learning approach for identifying bilingual synonyms. Design-ing features for bilingual synonyms such as spelling variations and bilingual associations, we train a classifier with a manually annotated bilingual lexicon with synonymous information. In order to evaluate the performance of our method, we carried out experiments to identify bilingual synonyms by two approaches: the direct identification of bilingual synonym pairs, and bilingual synonym pairs merged from two monolingual synonym lists. Experimental results show that our approach achieves the F-scores 1 Shokubutsu () means botanical plant. 2 ‘∼’ represents the synonymous relation."]},{"title":"457","paragraphs":["Figure 1: An example of an ambiguous term ‘plant’, and the synonyms and translation equivalents (TE) 89.3% in the former approach and 91.4% in the latter, thus outperforming the baseline method that employs only bilingual relations as its clues.","The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

Two main resources for synonym extraction are large text corpora and dictionaries.","Many studies extract synonyms from large monolingual corpora by using context information around target terms (Croach and Yang, 1992; Park and Choi, 1996; Waterman, 1996; Curran, 2004). Some researchers (Hindle, 1990; Grefenstette, 1994; Lin, 1998) classify terms by similarities based on their distributional syntactic patterns. These methods often extract not only synonyms, but also semantically related terms, such as antonyms, hyponyms and coordinate terms such as ‘cat’ and ‘dog.’","Some studies make use of bilingual corpora or dictionaries to find synonyms in a target language (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Shimohata and Sumita, 2002; Wu and Zhou, 2003; Lin et al., 2003). Lin et al. (2003) chose a set of synonym candidates for a term by using a bilingual dictionary and computing distributional similarities in the candidate set to extract synonyms. They adopt the bilingual information to exclude non-synonyms (e.g., antonyms and hyponyms) that may be used in the similar contexts. Although they make use of bilingual dictionaries, this study aims at finding bilingual synonyms directly.","In the approaches based on monolingual dictionaries, the similarities of definitions of lexical items are important clues for identifying synonyms (Blondel et al., 2004; Muller et al., 2006). For instance, Blondel et al. (2004) constructed an associated dictionary graph whose vertices are the terms, and whose edges from v1 to v2 represent occurrence of v2 in the definition for v1. They choose synonyms from the graph by collecting terms pointed to and from the same terms.","Another strategy for finding synonyms is to consider the terms themselves. We divide it into two approaches: rule-based and distance-based.","Rule-based approaches implement rules with language-specific patterns and detect variations by applying rules to terms. Stemming (Lovins, 1968; Porter, 1980) is one of the rule-based approaches, which cuts morphological suffix inflections, and obtains the stems of words. There are other types of variations for phrases; for example, insertion, dele-tion or substitution of words, and permutation of words such as ‘view point’ and ‘point of view’ are such variations (Daille et al., 1996).","Distance-based approaches model the similarity or dissimilarity measure between two terms to find similar terms. The edit distance (Levenshtein, 1966) is the most widely-used measure, based on the minimum number of operations of insertion, deletion, or substitution of characters for transforming one term into another. It can be efficiently calculated by using"]},{"title":"458","paragraphs":["Term pairs Concept p1 = (shōmei (), light) c1 p2 = (shōmei, lights) c1 p3 = (karui (), light) c2 p4 = (raito (), light) c1, c2 p5 = (raito, lights) c1 p6 = (raito, right) c3 p7 = (migi (), right) c3 p8 = (raito, right fielder) c4 p9 = (kenri (), right) c5 p10 = (kenri, rights) c5 Table 1: An Example of a bilingual lexicon and synonym sets (concepts)","J terms E terms Description c1 shōmei, raito light, lights illumination c2 karui, raito light lightweight c3 migi, raito right right-side c4 raito right fielder (baseball) c5 kenri right, rights privilege Table 2: The concepts in Table 1 a dynamic programming algorithm, and we can set the costs/weights for each character type."]},{"title":"3 Bilingual Synonyms and Translation Equivalents","paragraphs":["This section describes the notion of bilingual synonyms and our method for identifying the synonymous pairs of translation equivalents. We consider a bilingual synonym as a set of translation-equivalent term pairs referring to the same concept.","Tables 1 and 2 are an example of bilingual synonym sets. There are ten Japanese-English translation-equivalent term pairs and five bilingual synonym sets in this example. A Japanese term ‘raito’ is the phonetic transcription of both ‘light’ and ‘right,’ and it covers four concepts described by the three English terms. Figure 2 illustrates the relationship among these terms. The synonymous relation and the translation equivalence are considered to be similar in that two terms share the meanings. Following synonymous relation between terms in one language, we deal with the synonymous relation between bilingual translation-equivalent term pairs","Figure 2: Relations among terms in Table 2 Solid lines show that two terms are translation equivalents, while dotted lines show that two terms are (monolingual) synonyms. as bilingual synonyms.

After identifying the pairs, we can construct bilingual synonym sets by assuming that the converse of the condition (4) is true, and finding sets of bilingual lexical items in which all paired items are bilingual synonyms. We can see this method as the complete-linkage clustering of translation-equivalent term pairs. We can adopt another option to construct them by assuming also that the bilingual synonymous relation has transitivity: p ∼ p0","∧ p0","∼ p00","=⇒ p ∼ p00",", and this can be seen as simplelinkage clustering. This simplified method ignores the ambiguity of terms, and it may construct a bilingual synonym sets which includes many senses. In spite of the risk, it is effective to find large synonym sets in case the bilingual synonym pairs are not sufficiently detected. In this paper we focus only on identifying bilingual synonym pairs and evaluating the performance of the identification.","We employ a supervised machine learning technique with features related to spelling variations and so on.

We described the notion of bilingual synonyms, and presented two approaches for identifying them: one is to directly predict the relation, and another is to merge monolingual synonyms identified, according to the bilingual lexicon. Our experiments showed that the proposed method significantly outperformed the method that did not use features primarily with spelling variations; the proposed method extracted bilingual synonyms with high precision and recall. In addition, we found that merging monolingual synonyms by the dictionary is effective for finding bilingual synonyms; there occur few errors through the assumption described in Section 3.2.1.","Our future work contains implementing more features for identifying synonymous relations, constructing bilingual synonym sets, and evaluating our method for specific tasks such as thesaurus construction or cross-lingual information retrieval.","Currently, the features used do not include other clues with spelling variations, such as the weighted edit distance, transformation patterns, stemming and so on. Another important clue is distributional information, such as the context. We can use both monolingual and bilingual corpora for extracting distributions of terms, and bilingual corpora are expected to be especially effective for our goal.","We did not perform an experiment to construct bilingual synonym sets from synonym pairs in this paper. Described in Section 3.1, bilingual synonym sets can be constructed from bilingual synonym pairs by assuming some approximations. The approximation that permits transitivity of bilingual synonymous relations increases identified bilingual synonyms, and thus causes an increase in recall and decrease in precision. It is an open problem to find appropriate strategies for constructing bilingual synonym sets.","Finally, we plan to evaluate our method for specific tasks. For data-driven machine translation, it is expected that data sparseness problem is alleviated by merging the occurrences of low-frequency terms. Another application is cross-lingual information retrieval, which can be improved by using candidate expanded queries from bilingual synonym sets."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This work was partially supported by Grant-in-Aid for Specially Promoted Research (MEXT, Japan) and Japanese/Chinese Machine Translation Project in Special Coordination Funds for Promoting Science and Technology (MEXT, Japan).
