However, creating a large labeled training corpus is very expensive and time-consuming in some real-world cases such as word sense disambiguation (WSD).","Active learning is a promising way to minimize the amount of human labeling effort by building an system that automatically selects the most informative unlabeled example for human annotation at each annotation cycle. In recent years active learning has attracted a lot of research interest, and has been studied in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as text classification (TC) (Lewis and Gale, 1994; McCallum and Nigam, 1998), chunking (Ngai and Yarowsky, 2000), named entity recognition (NER) (Shen et al., 2004; Tomanek et al., 2007), part-of-speech tagging (Engelson and Dagan, 1999), information extraction (Thompson et al., 1999), statistical parsing (Steedman et al., 2003), and word sense disambiguation (Zhu and Hovy, 2007).","Previous studies reported that active learning can help in reducing human labeling effort. With selective sampling techniques such as uncertainty sampling (Lewis and Gale, 1994) and committee-based sampling (McCallum and Nigam, 1998), the size of the training data can be significantly reduced for text classification (Lewis and Gale, 1994; McCallum and Nigam, 1998), word sense disambiguation (Chen, et al. 2006; Zhu and Hovy, 2007), and named entity recognition (Shen et al., 2004; Tomanek et al., 2007) tasks.","Interestingly, deciding when to stop active learning is an issue seldom mentioned issue in these studies. However, it is an important practical topic, since it obviously makes no sense to continue the active learning procedure until the whole corpus has been labeled. How to define an adequate stopping criterion remains an unsolved problem in active learning. In principle, this is a problem of estimation of classifier effectiveness (Lewis and Gale, 1994). However, in real-world applications, it is difficult to know when the classifier reaches its maximum effectiveness before all unlabeled examples have been annotated. And when the unlabeled data set becomes very large, full annotation is almost impossible for human annotator.","In this paper, we address the issue of a stopping criterion for active learning, and propose a new statistical learning approach, called minimum ex-"]},{"title":"366","paragraphs":["pected error strategy, that defines a stopping criterion through estimation of the classifier’s expected error on future unlabeled examples.

However, there are two open problems. The first question is how to measure the performance of a classifier in active learning. The second one is how to know when the resulting classifier reaches the highest or adequate performance. It seems feasible that a separate validation set can solve both problems. That is, the active learning process can end if there is no significant performance improvement on the validation set. But how many samples are required for the pregiven separate validation set is an open question. Too few samples may not be adequate for a reasonable estimation and may result in an incorrect result. Too many samples would cause additional high cost because the separate validation set is generally constructed manually in advance."]},{"title":"3 Statistical Learning Approach 3.1 Confidence-based Strategy","paragraphs":["To avoid the problem of performance estimation mentioned above, Zhu and Hovy (2007) proposed a confidence-based framework to predict the upper bound and the lower bound for a stopping criterion in active learning.

In order to extract the linguistic features necessary for the ME model in WSD tasks, all sentences containing the target word are automatically part-of-speech (POS) tagged using the Brill POS tagger (Brill, 1992). Three knowledge sources are used to capture contextual information: unordered single words in topical context, POS of neighboring words with position information, and local collocations. These are same as the knowledge sources used in (Lee and Ng, 2002) for supervised automated WSD tasks.","The data used for comparison experiments was developed as part of the OntoNotes project (Hovy et al., 2006), which uses the WSJ part of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993). The senses of noun words occurring in OntoNotes are linked to the Omega ontology (philpot et al., 2005). In OntoNotes, at least two human annotators manually annotate the coarse-grained senses of selected nouns and verbs in their natural sentence context. In this experiment, we used several tens of thousands of annotated OntoNotes examples, covering in total 421 nouns with an inter-annotator agreement rate of at least 90%. We find that 302 out of 421 nouns occurring in OntoNotes are ambiguous, and thus are used in the following WSD experiments.
