In our method, the weightings of the Weighted Finite State Transducer (WFST) are designed on two levels and simpler than those for conventional WFST-based methods. Therefore, our method needs much fewer training data, which enables rapid prototyping of LU modules. We evaluated our method in two different domains.

This shows that our method is appropriate for rapid prototyping of LU modules."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["The language understanding (LU) of spoken dialogue systems in the early phases of their development should be trained with a small amount of data in their construction. This is because large amounts of annotated data are not available in the early phases. It takes a great deal of effort and time to transcribe and provide correct LU results to a Figure 1: Relationship between our method and conventional methods large amount of data. The LU should also be robust, i.e., it should be accurate even if some automatic speech recognition (ASR) errors are contained in its input. A robust LU module is also helpful when collecting dialogue data for the system because it suppresses incorrect LU and unwanted behaviors. We developed a method of rapidly prototyping LU modules that is easy to construct and robust against various expressions. It makes LU modules in the early phases easier to develop.","Several methods of implementing an LU module in spoken dialogue systems have been proposed. Using grammar-based ASR is one of the simplest. Although its ASR output can easily be transformed into concepts based on grammar rules, complicated grammars are required to understand the user’s utterances in various expressions.

However, numerous complicated rules similarly need to be manually prepared. Unfortunately, neither method is robust against ASR errors.","To cope with these problems, corpus-based (Sudoh and Tsukada, 2005; He and Young, 2005) and Weighted Finite State Transducer (WFST)-based methods (Potamianos and Kuo, 2000; Wutiwiwatchai and Furui, 2004) have been proposed as LU modules for spoken dialogue systems. Since these methods extract concepts using stochastic analysis, they do not need numerous complicated rules. These, however, require a great deal of training data to implement the module and are not suitable for constructing new domains.","Here, we present a new WFST-based LU module that has two main features.","1. A statistical language model (SLM) for ASR and a WFST for parsing that are automatically generated from the domain grammar description.","2. Since the weighting for the WFST is simpler than that in conventional methods, it requires fewer training data than conventional weighting schemes. Our method accomplishes robust LU with less effort using SLM-based ASR and WFST parsing. Figure 1 outlines the relationships between our method and conventional schemes. Since rule- or grammar-based approaches do not require a large amount of data, they take less effort than stochastic techniques. However, they are not robust against ASR errors. Stochastic approaches, on the contrary, take a great deal of effort to collect data but are robust against ASR errors. Our method is an intermediate approach that lies between these. That is, it is more robust than rule- or grammar-based approaches and takes less effort than stochastic techniques. This characteristic makes it easier to rapidly prototype LU modules for a new domain and helps development in the early phases."]},{"title":"2 Related Work and WFST-based Approach","paragraphs":["A Finite State Transducer (FST)-based LU is explained here, which accepts ASR output as its input. Figure 2 shows an example of the FST for a video recording reservation domain. The input, \", means that a transition with no input is permitted at the state transition. In this example, the LU module returns the concept [month=2, day=22] for the utterance It is February twenty second please. Here, a FILLER transition in which any word is accepted is appropriately allowed between phrases. In Figure 2, ‘F’ represents 0 or more FILLER transitions. A FILLER transition from the start to the end is inserted to reject unreliable utterances. This FILLER transition enables us to ignore unnecessary words listed in the example utterances in Table 1. The FILLER transition helps to suppress the insertion of incorrect concepts into LU results.","However, many output sequences are obtained for one utterance due to the FILLER transitions, because the utterance can be parsed with several paths.

They obtained the n-grams from several thousands of annotated utterances. However, it takes a great deal of effort to transcribe and annotate a large corpus. Our method enables prototype LU modules to be rapidly constructed that are robust against various expressions with SLM-based ASR and WFST-based parsing. The SLM and WFST are generated automatically from a domain grammar description in our toolkit. We need fewer data to train WFST, because its weightings are simpler than those in conventional methods.

The rst is a weighting for ASR outputs, which is set to select paths that are reliable at a surface word level. The second is a weighting for concepts, which is used to select paths that are reliable on a concept level. The weighting for concepts reects correctness at a more abstract level than the surface word level. The weighting for ASR outputs consists of two categories: a weighting for ASR N-best outputs and one for accepted words. We will describe the denitions of these weightings in the following subsections. 4.1 Weighting for ASR N-Best Outputs The N-best outputs of ASR are used for an input of a WFST. Weights are assigned to each sentence in ASR N-best outputs. Larger weights are given to more reliable sentences, whose ranks in ASR N-best are higher. We dene this preference as wi s = e\\fscore i","PN j e\\fscore j ; where wi","s is a weight for the i-th sentence in ASR N-best outputs, \\f is a coefcient for smoothing, and scorei is the log-scaled score of the i-th ASR output. This weighting reects the reliability of the ASR output. We set \\f to 0.025 in this study after a preliminary experiment. 4.2 Weighting for Accepted Words Weights are assigned to word sequences that have been accepted by the WFST. Larger weights are given to more reliable sequences of ASR outputs at the surface word level. Generally, longer sequences having more words that are not llers and more reliable ASR outputs are preferred. We dene these preferences as the weights: 1. word(const.): ww = 1:0, 2. word(#phone): ww = l(W ), and 3. word(CM): ww = CM (W ) w.","The word(const.) gives a constant weight to all accepted words. This means that sequences with more words are simply preferred. The word(#phone) takes the length of each accepted word into consideration. This length is measured by its number of phonemes, which are normalized by that of the longest word in the vocabulary. The normalized values are denoted as l(W ) (0 < l(W ) 1). By adopting word(#phone), the length of sequences is represented more accurately. We also take the reliability of the accepted words into account as word(CM). This uses condence measures (Lee et al., 2004) for a word, W , in ASR outputs, which are denoted as CM (W ). The w is the threshold for determining whether word W is accepted or not. The ww obtains a negative value for an unreliable word W when CM (W ) is lower than w. This represents a preference for longer and more reliable sequences. 4.3 Weighting for Concepts In addition to the ASR level, weights on a concept level are also assigned. The concepts are obtained from the parsing results by the WFST, and contain several words. Weights for concepts are dened by using the measures of all words contained in a concept.","We prepared three kinds of weights for the concepts: 1. cpt(const.): wc = 1:0, 2. cpt(avg): wc = P","W (CM (W ) c) #W ; and 3. cpt(#pCM(avg)): wc = P","W (CM (W ) l(W ) c) #W ; where W is a set of accepted words, W , in the corresponding concept, and #W is the number of words in W .","The cpt(const.) represents a preference for sequences with more concepts. The cpt(avg) is dened as the weight by using the CM (W ) of each word contained in the concept. The cpt(#pCM(avg)) represents a preference for longer and reliable sequences with more concepts. The c is the threshold for the acceptance of a concept."]},{"title":"213","paragraphs":["Table 3: Examples of weightings when parameter set is: word(CM) and cpt(#pCM(avg))","ASR onput No, it is February twenty second LU output FILLER it is February twenty second CM (W ) 0.3 0.7 0.6 0.9 1.0 0.9 l(W ) 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.9 0.6 0.5 Concept - - - month=2 day=22 word - 0:7 w 0:6 w 0:9 w 1:0 w 0:9 w cpt - - - (0:9 0:9 c)=1 (1:0 0:6 c + 0:9 0:5 c)=2 ’ & $ % Reference From June third please ASR output From June third uhm FIT please LU result CM (W ) 0.771 0.978 0.757 0.152 0.525 0.741 LU reference From June third FILLER FILLER FILLER month:6, day:3 Our method From June third FILLER FILLER FILLER month:6, day:3","Keyword spotting From June third FILLER FIT please month:6, day:3, car:FIT (‘FIT’ is the name of a car.)

The sum of weights for concepts is c(1:335 2c) because the weight for month=2 is c(0:81 c) and the weight for day=22 is c(0:525 c). Therefore, cumulative weight wi","for this input sequence is wi","s + w(4:1 5w) + c(1:335 2c).","In the training phase, various combinations of parameters are tested, i.e., which weightings are used for each of ASR output and concept level, such as N = 1 or 10, coefcient w;c = 1.0 or 0, and threshold w;c = 0 to 0.9 at intervals of 0.1, on the training data. The coefcient w;c = 0 means that a corresponding weight is not added. The optimal parameter settings are obtained after testing the various combinations of parameters. They make the concept error rate (CER) minimum for a training data set. We calculated the CER in the following equation: CER = (S + D + I)=N , where N is the number of concepts in a reference, and S, D, and I correspond to the number of substitution, deletion, and insertion errors.","Figure 4 shows an example of LU with our method, where it rejects misrecognized concept [car:FIT], which cannot be rejected by keyword spotting."]},{"title":"5 Experiments and Evaluation 5.1 Experimental Conditions","paragraphs":["We discussed our experimental investigation into the effects of weightings in Section 4.

We used 10000 example sentences in the video and 40000 in the rent-a-car domain. The number of the generated sentences was determined empirically. The vocabulary size was 209 in the video and 891 in the rent-a-car domain. The average ASR accuracy was 83.9% in the video and 65.7% in the rent-a-car domain. The grammar in the video domain included phrases for dates, times, channels, commands. That of the rent-a-car domain included phrases for dates, times, locations, car classes, options, and commands. The WFST parsing module was implemented by using the MIT FST toolkit (Hetherington, 2004). 5.2 Performance of WFST-based LU We evaluated our method in the two domains: video and rent-a-car. We compared the CER on test data, which was calculated by using the optimal settings for both domains. We evaluated the results with 4-fold cross validation. The number of utterances for training was 3139 (=4186*(3/4)) in the video and 2523 (=3364*(3/4)) in the rent-a-car domain.","The baseline method was simple keyword spotting because we assumed a condition where a large amount of training data was not available.

In this experiment, we calculated the CER in the test data by increasing the number of utterances for training.
