In our method, we use CRFs as basic training model, use active learning method to generate combined features so as to make existed features used more effectively; at last, we proposed a novel clustering algorithm which used both the linguistics knowledge and the statistical knowledge. We built a coreference resolution system based on the proposed method and evaluate its performance from three aspects: the contributions of active learning; the effects of different clustering algorithms; and the resolution performance of different kinds of NPs. Experimental results show that additional performance gain can be obtained by using active learning method; clustering algorithm has a great effect on coreference resolution’s performance and our clustering algorithm is very effective; and the key of coreference resolution is to improve the performance of the normal noun’s resolution, especially the pronoun’s resolution."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Coreference resolution is the process of determin-ing whether two noun phrases (NPs) refer to the same entity in a document. It is an important task in natural language processing and can be classified into pronoun phrase (denoted as PRO) resolution, normal noun phrase (denoted as NOM) resolution, and named noun phrase (denoted as NAM) resolution. Machine learning approaches recast this problem as a classification task based on constraints that are learned from an annotated corpus. Then a separate clustering mechanism is used to construct a partition on the set of NPs.","Previous machine learning approaches for coreference resolution (Soon et al, 2001; Ng et al, 2002; Florian et al, 2004, etc) usually selected a machine learning approach to train a classification model, used as many as possible features for the training of this classification model, and finally used a clustering algorithm to construct a partition on the set of NPs based on the statistical data obtained from trained classification model. Their experimental results showed that different kinds of features had different contributions for system’s performance, and usually the more features used, the better performance obtained. But they rarely focused on how to make existed features used more effectively; besides, they proposed their own clustering algorithm respectively mainly used the statistical data obtained from trained classification model, they rarely used the linguistics knowledge when clustering different kinds of NPs. Also, there were fewer experiments conducted to find out the effect of a clustering algorithm on final system’s performance.","In this paper, we propose a new hybrid machine learning method for coreference resolution. We use NP pairs to create training examples; use CRFs as a basic classification model, and use active learning method to generate some combined features so as to make existed features used more effectively; at last, cluster NPs into entities by a novel cascade clustering algorithm.","The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents our coreference resolution sys-24 Sixth SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language Processing tem in detail. Section 3 is our experiments and discussions. And at last, we conclude our work in sec-tion 4."]},{"title":"2 Coreference Resolution","paragraphs":["There are three basic components for a coreference resolution system that uses machine learning approach: the training set creation, the feature selection, and the coreference clustering algorithm. We will introduce our methods for these components respectively as follows. 2.1 Training Set Creation Previous researchers (Soon et al., 2001, Vincent Ng et al., 2002, etc) took different creation strategies for positive examples and negative examples. Because there were no experimental results showed that these kinds of example creation methods were helpful for system’s performance, we create both positive examples and negative examples in a unified NP pair wise manner.","Given an input NP chain of an annotated document, select a NP in this NP chain from left to right one by one, and take every of its right side’s NP, we generate a positive example if they refer to the same entity or a negative example if they don’t refer to the same entity. For example, there is a NP chain n1-n2-n3-n4 found in document, we will generate following training examples: (n1-n2, 1± ), (n1-n3, ), (n1-n4, ), (n2-n3,1± 1± 1± ), (n2n4, ), and (n3-n4, ). Where denotes that this is a positive example, and denotes that this is a negative example.","1± 1± 1+ 1− 2.2 Feature Sets In our system, two kinds of features are used. One is atomic feature, the other is combined feature. We define the features that have only one genera-tion condition as atomic features, and define the union of some atomic features as combined features. 2.2.1 Atomic Features All of the atomic features used in our system are listed as follows. String Match Feature (denoted as Sm): Its possible values are exact, left, right, included, part, alias, and other. If two NPs are exactly string matched, return exact; if one NP is the left substring of the other, return left; if one NP is the right substring of the other, return right; if all the characters in one NP are appeared in the other but not belong to set {left, right}, return included; if some (not all) characters in one NP are appeared in the other, return part; if one NP is the alias of the other, return alias; if two NPs don’t have any common characters, return other. Lexical Similarity Features (denoted as Ls): compute two NP’s similarity and their head words’ similarity using following formula 1. 12 12 12"]},{"title":"2( (, ) () ( )SameChar n n Sim n n Len n Len n,)× = +","paragraphs":["(1) Here means the common characters’ number in and ; is the total characters’ number in . (, )12SameChar n n 1n 2n ()Len ni","ni Edit Distance Features (denoted as Ed): compute two NP’s edit distance and their head words’ edit distance (Wagner and Fischer, 1974), and the possible values are true and false. If the edit distance of two NPs (or the head words of these two NPs) are less than or equal to 1, return true, else return false. Distance Features (denoted as Dis): distance between two NPs in words, NPs, sentences, paragraphs, and characters. Length Ratio Features (denoted as Lr): the length ratio of two NPs, and their head words. Their possible values belong to the range"]},{"title":"(0","paragraphs":["."]},{"title":",1] NP’s Semantic Features","paragraphs":["(denoted as Sem): the POSs of two NPs’ head words; the types of the two NPs (NAM, NOM or PRO); besides, if one of the NP is PRO, the semantic features will also include this NP’s gender information and plurality information. Other Features (denoted as Oth): whether two NPs are completely made up of capital English characters; whether two NPs are completely made up of lowercase English characters; whether two NPs are completely made up of digits.","2.2.2 Combined Features Generated by Active Learning During the process of model training for coreference resolution, we found that we had very fewer available resources compared with previous researchers. In their works, they usually had some extra knowledge-based features such as alias table, abbreviation table, wordnet and so on; or they had 25 Sixth SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language Processing some extra in-house analysis tools such as proper name parser, chunk parser, rule-based shallow coreference resolution parser, and so on (Hal Daume III, etc, 2005; R.Florian, etc, 2004; Vincent Ng, etc, 2002; etc). Although we also collected some aliases and abbreviations, the amounts are very small compared with previous researchers’. We hope we can make up for this by making existed features used more effectively by active learning method.","Formally, active learning studies the closed-loop phenomenon of a learner selecting actions or making queries that influence what data are added to its training set. When actions or queries are selected properly, the data requirements for some problems decrease drastically (Angluin, 1988; Baum & Lang, 1991). In our system, we used a pool-based active learning framework that is similar as Manabu Sassano (2002) used, this is shown in figure 1. ","Figure 1: Our Active Learning Framework","In this active learning framework, an initial classifier is trained by CRFs [1","] that uses only atomic features, and then two human teachers are asked to correct some selected wrong classified examples independently. During the process of correction, without any other available information, system only shows the examples that are made up of features to the human teachers; then these two human teachers have to use the information of some atomic features’ combinations to decide whether two NPs refer to the same entity. We record all these atomic features’ combinations that used by both of these human teachers, and take them as combined features.","For example, if both of these human teachers correct a wrong classified example based on the knowledge that “if two NPs are left substring 1 http://www.chasen.org/~taku/software/CRF++/ matched, lexical similarity feature is greater than 0.5, I think they will refer to the same entity”, the corresponding combined feature would be described as: “Sm(NPs)-Ls(NPs)”, which denotes the human teachers made their decisions based on the combination information of “String Match Features” and “Lexical Similarity Features”.  Figure 2: Selection Algorithm 1. Select all the wrong classified examples whose","CRFs’ probability belongs to range [0.4, 0.6] 2. Sort these examples in decreasing order. 3. Select the top m examples","In figure 1, “information” means the valuable data that can improve the system’s performance after correcting their classification. The selection algorithm for “informative” is the most important component in an active learning framework. We designed it from the degree of correcting difficulty. We know 0.5 is a critical value for an example’s classification. For a wrong classified example, the closer its probability value to 0.5, the easier for us to correct its classification. Following this, our selection algorithm for “informative” is designed as shown in figure 2.","1. Build an initial classifier","2. While teacher can correct examples based on","feature combinations a) Apply the current classifier to training ex-","amples b) Find m most informative training examples c) Have two teachers correct these examples","based on feature combinations d) Add the feature combinations that are used","by both of these two teachers to feature","sets in CRFs and train a new classifier.","When add new combined features won’t lead to","a performance improvement, we end active learn-","ing process. Totally we obtained 21 combined fea-","tures from active learning. Some of them are listed","in table 1.","Table 1: Some Combined Features Sm(NPs)-Sm(HWs)-Ls(NPs)-Ls(HWs)","Sm(NPs)-Sm(HWs)-Ls(NPs)","Sm(NPs)-Sm(HWs)-Ls(HWs) Sm(NPs)-Sm(HWs)-Lr(NPs)-Lr(HWs)","Sm(NPs)-Sm(HWs)-Lr(NPs) Sm(NPs)-Sm(HWs)-Sem(HW1)-Sem(HW2) Sm(NPs)-Sm(HWs)-Sem(NP1)-Sem(NP2)","Sm(NPs)-Sm(HWs)-Lr(HWs) ......","Here “Sm(NPs)” means the string match feature’s value of two NPs, “Sm(HWs)” means the string match feature’s value of two NPs’ head words. “HWs” means the head words of two NPs. Combined feature “Sm(NPs)-Sm(HWs)-Ls(NPs)” means when correcting a wrong classified example, both these human teachers made their decisions based on the combination information of Sm(NPs), Sm(HWs), and Ls(NPs) . Other combined features have the similar explanation. 26 Sixth SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language Processing","And at last, we take all the atomic features and the combined features as final features to train the final CRFs classifier. 2.3 Clustering Algorithm Formally, let"]},{"title":"{:","paragraphs":["be NPs in a document.

But","this can’t guarantee it would make a performance 28 Sixth SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language Processing improvement at anytime. Active learning method provides us a way that makes this combined features’ selection process goes in a proper manner. Generally, a system can obtain an obvious performance improvement after several active learning iterations. We still noticed that the contributions of active learning for different kinds of documents are different. In ACE04 corpus, both kinds of documents’ performance obtained almost equal improvements; in ACE05 corpus, there is almost no performance improvement for newswire documents, but broadcast documents’ performance and web log documents’ performance obtained greater improvements. We think this is because for different kinds of documents, they have different kinds of correcting rules (these rules refer to the combination methods of atomic features) for the wrong classified examples, some of these rules may be consistent, but some of them may be conflicting. Active learning mechanism will balance these conflicts and select a most appropriate global optimization for these rules. This can also explain why ACE04 corpus obtains more performance improvement than ACE05 corpus, because there are more kinds of documents in ACE05 corpus, and thus it is more likely to lead to rule conflicts during active learning process.","Experimental results in table 5 show that if other experimental conditions are the same, there are obvious differences among the performances with different clustering algorithms. This surprised us very much because both algorithm1 and algorithm2 worked very well in their own learning frameworks. We know R.Florian et al. (2004) first proposed algorithm2 using maximum entropy model. Is this the reason for the poor performance of algorithm2 and algorithm1? To make sure this, we conducted other experiments that changed the CRFs model to maximum entropy model [2","] without changing any other conditions and the experimental results are shown in table 7.","The experimental results are the same: our clustering algorithm achieved better performance. We think this is mainly because the following reason, that in our clustering algorithm, we notice the fact that different kinds of NPs have different abilities of acting as antecedents in an entity, and take different clustering strategy for them respectively, 2 http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/s0450736/maxent_toolkit.html this is obvious better than the methods that only use statistical data.

We think this maybe because that the combined features are obtained under CRFs model, thus they will be more suitable for CRFs model than for maximum entropy model, that is to say these obtained combined features don’t play the same role in maximum entropy model as they do in CRFs model.","Experimental results in table 6 surprised us greatly. PRO resolution gets so poor a performance that it is only about 1/3 of the NAM resolution’s performance. And NOM resolution’s performance is also pessimistic, which reaches about 80% of the NAM resolution’s performance. After analyses we found this is because there is too much confusing information for NOM’s resolution and PRO’s resolution and system can hardly distinguish them correctly with current features description for an example. For example, in a Chinese document, a NOM “总统” (means president) may refer to a person A at sometime, but refer to person B at another time, and there is no enough information for system to distinguish A and B. It is worse for PRO resolution because a PRO can refer to any NAM or NOM from a very long distance, there is little information for the system to distinguish which one it really refers to. For example, two PROs that both of whom are “他” (means he) , one refers to person A, the other refers to person B, even our human can hardly distinguish them, not to say the system.","Fortunately, generally there are more NAMs and NOMs in a document, but less PROs. If they have similar amounts in a document, you can image how poor the performance of the coreference resolution system would be."]},{"title":"4 Conclusions","paragraphs":["In this paper, we present a hybrid machine learning approach for coreference resolution task.
