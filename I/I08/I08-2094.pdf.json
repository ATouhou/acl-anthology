It is expected for various applications, such as information retrieval, machine translation and a reading/writing aid.","Automatic paraphrasing of Japanese text has been studied by many researchers after the first interna-tional workshop on automatic paraphrasing (Sato and Nakagawa, 2001). Most of them focus on paraphrasing of content words, such as noun phrases and verb phrases. In contrast, paraphrasing of functional expressions has less attention. A functional expression is a function word or a multi-word expression that works as a function word. For generating a wider variety of phrasal paraphrases in Japanese, as shown in Fig. 1, it is necessary to paraphrase functional expressions as well as content expressions, because almost all phrases in Japanese include one or more functional expressions. In this paper, we focus on paraphrasing of Japanese functional expressions.","In several applications, such as a reading aid, in paraphrasing of Japanese functional expressions, control of readability of generated text is important, because functional expressions are critical units that determine sentence structures and meanings. In case a reader does not know a functional expression, she fails to understand the sentence meaning. If the functional expression can be paraphrased into an easier one, she may know it and understand the sentence meaning. It is desirable to generate expressions with readability suitable for a reader because easier functional expressions tend to have more than one meaning.","A remarkable characteristic of Japanese functional expressions is that each functional expression has many different variants. Each variant has one of four styles. In paraphrasing of Japanese functional expressions, a paraphrasing system should accept style specification, because consistent use in style is required. For example, the paraphrase (b) in Fig. 1 is not appropriate for a document in normal style because the expression has polite style.","Paraphrasing a functional expression into a semantically equivalent one that satisfies style and readability specifications can be realized as a combination of the following two processes:","1. Transforming a functional expression into another one that is semantically equivalent to it, often with changing readability."]},{"title":"691 A phrase","paragraphs":["keQtei-se / zaru-wo-e-nai  Paraphrasing of content expressions Paraphrasing of functional expressions kimeru sadameru keQtei-wo-suru",": shika-nai shika-ari-mase-N yori-hoka-nai",":"]},{"title":"× ⇓ Phrasal paraphrases","paragraphs":["(a) kimeru shika-nai (b) kimeru shika-ari-mase-N (c) sadameru shika-nai (d) sadameru yori-hoka-nai",": Figure 1: Generation of a wider variety of phrasal paraphrases.","2. Rewriting a functional expression to a variant of it, often with changing style.","We propose a method of paraphrasing of Japanese functional expressions using a dictionary with two hierarchies: a morphological hierarchy and a semantic hierarchy. The former hierarchy provides a list of all variants specified with style for each functional expression, which is required for the above process 2. The latter hierarchy provides semantic equivalence classes of functional expressions and readability level for each functional expression, which are required for the above process 1."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["A few studies on paraphrasing of Japanese functional expressions have been conducted. In order to implement automatic paraphrasing, some studies (Iida et al., 2001; Tsuchiya et al., 2004) use a set of paraphrasing rules, and others (Tanabe et al., 2001; Shudo et al., 2004) use semantic equivalence classes.","All of these studies do not handle variants in a systematic way. In case a system paraphrases a functional expression f into f ′",", it also should generate all variants of f ′","in potential. However, any proposed system does not guarantee this requirement. Output selection of variants should be determined according to the given style specification. Any proposed system does not have such selection mechanism.","Controlling readability of generated text is not a central issue in previous studies. An exception is a study by Tsuchiya et al.

Table 1 summarizes these nine levels. The number of entries in L1","(headwords) is 341, and the number of leaf nodes in L9","(surface forms) is 16,801. For each surface form in the hierarchy, we specified one of four styles (normal, polite, colloquial, and stiff) and connectability (what word can be to the left and right of the expression). 3.2 Semantic hierarchy There is no available set of semantic equivalence classes of Japanese functional expressions for paraphrasing. Some sets are described in books in linguistics (Morita and Matsuki, 1989; Tomomatsu et al., 1996; Endoh et al., 2003), but these are not for paraphrasing. Others are proposed for paraphrasing in natural language processing (Tanabe et al., 2001; Shudo et al., 2004), but these are not available in public.","For 435 entries in L2","(headwords with unique meaning) of the morphological hierarchy, from the viewpoint of paraphrasability, we have designed a semantic hierarchy with three levels according to the semantic hierarchy proposed by a book (Morita and Matsuki, 1989).

The procedure is as follows:","1. Find the functional expression in L2","for a given surface form according to the morphological hierarchy.","2.

In this paper, we define a phrase as follows. Let ci be a content word, and fj a functional expression. Then, a phrase is formulated as the following: Phrase = c1c2 ···cmf1f2 ···fn, (1) where c1c2 ···cm is the content part of the phrase and f1f2 ···fn is the functional part of it.","Paraphrasing of a functional part of a phrase is performed as a combination of the following five types of paraphrasing:","1→1 Substituting a functional expression with another functional expression (f → f ′","). Paraphrasing type Num 1→1 only 214 (61%) 1→N(and1→1) 69 (20%) N→1(and1→1) 18 ( 5%) M→N(and1→1) 8( 2%) Otherwise 44 (12%) Sum 353 (100%) Table 2: Number of paraphrases produced by a native speaker of Japanese.","1→N Substituting a functional expression with a sequence of functional expressions (f → f ′ 1f ′","2 ···f ′","N ).","N→1 Substituting a sequence of functional expressions with one functional expression (f1f2 ···fN → f ′",").","M→N Substituting a sequence of functional ex-","pressions with another sequence of functional","expressions (f1f2 ···fM → f ′","1f ′","2 ···f ′","N ).","f⇒c Substituting a functional expression with an expression including one or more content words.","In a preliminary experiment, we investigated which type of the above a native speaker of Japanese tended to use in paraphrasing a functional part. Table 2 shows the classification result of 353 paraphrases produced by the subject for 238 source phrases.1","From this table, it was found out that paraphrasing of “1→1” type was major in that it was used for producing 61% of paraphrases.","Because of dominance of paraphrasing of “1→1” type, we construct a system that paraphrases Japanese functional expressions in a phrase by substituting a functional expression with a semantically equivalent expression. This system paraphrases a phrase defined as the form in Eq.

The system accepts a phrase in Japanese and generates a list of ranked alternative expressions for it. The system also accepts style and readability specifications.","Fig. 2 shows an overview of our system. This system consists of three modules: analysis, paraphrase generation, and ranking. 5.1 Analysis Some methods have been proposed for detecting Japanese functional expressions based on a set of detection rules (Tsuchiya and Sato, 2003) and machine learning (Uchimoto et al., 2003; Tsuchiya et al., 2006). However, because these methods detect only a limited number of functional expressions (and their variants), we cannot apply them to the analysis of a phrase. Another method is to add a list of about 17,000 surface forms of functional expressions to a dictionary of an existing morphological analyzer and determine connecting costs based on machine learning. However, it is infeasible because there is no large corpus in which all of these surface forms have been tagged.","Instead of these methods, we use a different method of decomposing a given phrase into a sequence of content words and functional expressions. Our method uses two analyzers.","We constructed a functional-part analyzer (FPA). This is implemented using a morphological analyzer MeCab2","with a special dictionary containing only functional expressions. FPA can decompose a functional part (string) into a sequence of functional expressions, but fails to decompose a string when the string includes one or more content words. In order to extract a functional part from a given string, we use original MeCab.","First, original MeCab decomposes a given string into a sequence of morphemes m1m2 ···mk. Next, we suppose that m1 is a content part and m2m3 ···mk is a functional part. If FPA can decompose m2m3 ···mk into a sequence of functional expressions f1f2 ···fn, then we obtain c1f1f2 ···fn asshowninEq.(1)asananalyzed result, where c1 = m1. Otherwise, we suppose that m1m2 is a content part and m3m4 ···mk is a functional part. If FPA can decompose m3m4 ···mk into a sequence of functional expressions f1f2 ···fn, then we obtain c1c2f1f2 ···fn as an analyzed result, where c1 = m1 and c2 = m2. This procedure is continued until FPA succeeds in decomposition. 5.2 Paraphrase generation This module accepts an analyzed result c1c2 ···cmf1f2 ···fn and generates a list of alternative expressions for it.","First, the module obtains a surface form f ′","1 that is semantically equivalent to f1 from the dictionary in section 3. Next, it constructs c1c2 ···cm−1c′","mwf ′","1","by connecting f ′ 1 to c1c2 ···cm by the method de-","scribed in section 4. Then, it obtains a surface","form f ′","2 that is semantically equivalent to f2 and","constructs c1c2 ···cm−1c′","mwf ′","1f ′","2 in similar fashion.","This process proceeds analogously, and finally, the","module constructs c1c2 ···cm−1c′","mwf ′","1f ′","2 ···f ′","n as an alternative expression.","Because in practice the module obtains more than one surface form that is semantically equivalent to 2 http://mecab.sourceforge.net/"]},{"title":"694","paragraphs":["Top 1 Top1to2 Top1to3 Top1to4 Top1to5 Closed 177 (74%) 197 (83%) 210 (88%) 213 (90%) 213 (90%) Closed (Perfect analysis) 196 (82%) 211 (89%) 219 (92%) 221 (93%) 221 (93%) Open 393 (63%) 461 (73%) 496 (79%) 500 (80%) 501 (80%) Open (Perfect analysis) 453 (72%) 508 (81%) 531 (85%) 534 (85%) 534 (85%) Table 3: Evaluation of paraphrases generated by the paraphrasing system fj by the method described in subsection 3.3, it generates more than one alternative expression by considering all possible combinations of these surface forms and excluding candidates that include two adjacent components that cannot be connected properly.","If the module generates no alternative expression, it uses the semantic equivalence classes in the upper level reluctantly. 5.3 Ranking Because a functional expression seems to be more standard and common as it appears more frequently in newspaper corpus, we use frequencies of functional expressions (strings) in newspaper corpus in order to rank alternative expressions. We define a scoring function as the product of frequencies of functional expressions in a phrase."]},{"title":"6 Evaluation","paragraphs":["We evaluate paraphrases generated by our paraphrasing system for validating our semantic equivalence classes, because the dictionary that the system uses guarantees by the method described in subsection 3.3 that the system can generate all variants of a functional expression and accept style and readability specifications. 6.1 Methodology We evaluated paraphrases generated by our paraphrasing system from the viewpoint of an application to a writing aid, where a paraphrasing system is expected to output a few good alternative expressions for a source phrase.","We evaluated the top 5 alternative expressions generated by the system for a source phrase by classifying them into the following three classes:","Good Good alternative expression for the source phrase.","Intermediate Expression that keeps the meaning roughly that the source phrase has. Bad Inappropriate expression. Then, we counted source phrases for which at least one of the alternative expressions of the top 1 to n was judged as “Good”. One of the authors performed the judgment according to books (Morita and Matsuki, 1989; Endoh et al., 2003).","As a closed test set, we used 238 example phrases for 140 functional expressions extracted from a book (Foundation and of International Education, Japan, 2002), which we had used for development of our semantic equivalence classes. As an open test set, we used 628 example phrases for 184 functional expressions extracted from a book (Tomomatsu et al., 1996). We used the Mainichi newspaper text corpus (1991-2005, about 21 million sentences, about 1.5 gigabytes) for ranking alternative expressions. 6.2 Results Table 3 shows the results. The rows with “Perfect analysis” in the table show the results in analyzing source phrases by hand. Because the values in every row of the table are nearly saturated in “Top 1 to 3”, we discuss the results of the top 1 to 3 hereafter.","Our system generated appropriate alternative expressions for 88% (210/238) and 79% (496/628) of source phrases in the closed and the open test sets, respectively.
