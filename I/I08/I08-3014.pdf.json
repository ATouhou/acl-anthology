In natural languages, sentences are usually part of discourse units just as words are part of sentences. Anaphora resolution plays a significant role in discourse analysis for chopping larger discourse units into smaller ones. This process is done for the purpose of better understanding and making easier the further processing of text by computer. This paper is focused on the discussion of various factors and their optimal order that play an important role in personal anaphora resolution in Urdu. Algorithms are developed that resolves pronominal anaphoric devices with 77-80% success rate. 1 Introduction In written text, cohesion occurs when some elements in a discourse are dependent on others and that refer to items backward in the text, both in the spoken or written text (Halliday and Hassan, 1976). Consider the following example  (1.1) Shah Rukh Khan is off to one of his favorite cities- London, with his family. Now he is looking for another destination, not so much for holidaying though","paragraphs":[".

These referring terms are called anaphors or anaphoric devices (ADs). Halliday and Hassan described anaphora as ‘cohesion which points back to some previous items’ (Halliday and Hassan, 1976). The ‘pointing back’ words or phrases are called the anaphors (Halliday and Hassan, 1976) and the entities to which these point are called antecedents and the procedure of determining the antecedents of anaphors and subsequent replacement in some particular discourse is called anaphora resolution. According to Halliday and Hassan when anaphors are replaced by their corresponding antecedents, cohesion no more exists. Personal anaphoric devices (ADs) are the most widely used variety of ADs in Urdu text. These are further classified as first person, second person and third person anaphoric devices. Examples of first person ADs are ،ںيم ،اريم ،یريم وکمه ،یرامه ،ارامه ،مه ،وکهجم ،ےهجم،،ںيمه ےرامه","paragraphs":["([mæIri], [mæIra], [mæñ], [mʊʤheI], [mʊʤhkəƱ], [hΛm], [hΛmɒrɒ], [hΛmɒri], [hΛmkəƱ], [hΛmeIñ], [hΛmɒreI])."]},{"title":"Examples of second person ADs are،مت وکمت ،یراهمت ،اراهمت، اهمت،ںيهمت،ےروکپآ ،یکپآ ،اکپآ ،پآ","paragraphs":["([tʊm], [tʊmhɒrɒ], [tʊmhɒri], [tʊmkƏƱ], [tʊmheIñ], [tʊmhɒreI], [a:p] [a:pkɒ], [a:pki], [a:pkƏƱ])."]},{"title":"Examples of third person ADs are ،ہو ،ےسا ،اکسا ،یکسا ،ےکسا ،وکسا ،نا ،یکنا ،ےکنا ،اکنا ںيهنا","paragraphs":["([vәƱh], [ʊseI], [ʊskɒ], [ʊski], [ʊskeI], [ʊskƏƱ], [ʊn], [ʊnki], [ʊnkeI], [ʊnkɒ], [ʊnheIñ]). "]},{"title":"A lot of work has been done in English for the purpose of anaphora resolution and various 81        algorithms have been devised for this purpose (Aone and Bennette, 1996; Brenan , Friedman and Pollard, 1987; Ge, Hale and Charniak, 1998; Grosz, Aravind and Weinstein, 1995; McCarthy and Lehnert, 1995; Lappins and Leass, 1994; Mitkov, 1998; Soon, Ng and Lim, 1999). Work has also been done in South Asian Languages such as Hindi and Malayalam for the purpose of anaphora resolution (Prasad and Strube, 2000; Sobha, 1998). Prasad and Strube (2000) worked on anaphora resolution in Hindi. Their approach relies on the discourse salience factors and is primarily inspired by the central idea of Centering theory (Grosz, Aravind and Weinstein, 1995). Centering theory has also guided the development of pronoun resolution algorithms, such as the BFP algorithm (Brenan, Friedman and Pollard, 1987) and the S-list algorithm developed by Strube (Strube, 1998). Prasad and Strube (2000) applied these algorithms to the resolution of pronouns in Hindi texts. They showed that the BFP algorithm cannot be successfully implemented for pronoun resolution in Hindi. They argued that better results can be obtained with an algorithm that does not use the Centering notions of the backward-looking center and the centering transitions for the computation of pronominal antecedents, such as the S-list algorithm (Prasad and Strube, 2000). Prasad and Strube used well established approaches for Hindi anaphora resolution. Sobha (1998) used knowledge poor rule based approach for reference resolution in Hindi and Malayalam languages that stands on very limited syntactic information. In Urdu language very little work has been done on discourse level especially in the field of anaphora resolution. Although, most of the anaphoric devices in Urdu and Hindi are same but the style and organization of discourses are bit different that causes the difference in anaphora resolution. Kulsoom et al worked on Urdu anaphora resolution but it appears to be the tip of an iceberg (Kalsoom and Rashida, 1993). Kulsoom et al (1993) only considered the morphological and lexical filters for the resolution of anaphora in Urdu discourses. However, these filters are not sufficient for Urdu anaphora resolution.  The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section-2 describes the factors that play a vital role in Urdu anaphora resolution. Section-3 presents algorithms, implementation and evaluation for the resolution of personal anaphora; this is followed by the conclusion. 2 Factors that play vital role in Urdu anaphora resolution Factors that can play a very important role in Urdu anaphora resolution beside morphological and lexical filters are topicalized structures, subject preferences, object preferences, repetitions, section heading and distance. How these factors are helpful in anaphora resolution in English language was worked out by Mitkov (Mitkov, 1998), but their role in Urdu discourse for the resolution of personal pronouns is more cherished. How these factors are helpful in the resolution of anaphoric devices in Urdu is done by Khan et al (Khan, Ali and Aamir, 2006). Ali et al also worked on these factors for the resolution of demonstrative ADs in Urdu discourse (Ali, Khan and Aamir, 2007). 2.1 Morphological and lexical filters Consider an example in which anaphora is resolved on the basis of morphological filters.

Examine the next clause in the discourse. If no clause exists then finish. 2. If the current clause consists of first person anaphoric devices then go to step-3 else go to step-1. 3. Access the previous clause. 4. If the current clause consists of section headings, noun phrase followed by certain words then assign weight to these filters else assign priority to noun or noun phrase appearing as a subject of the clause. 5. If no subject exists then go to step-3. Similarly, an informal algorithm for the resolution of second person ADs is as follows:  1. Examine the next clause in the discourse. If no clause exists then finish. 2. If the current clause consists of second person anaphoric devices then go to step-3 else go to step-1. 3. Access the previous clause. 4. If the current clause consists of topicalized structures then assign weight to these filters else assign priority to noun or noun phrase appearing as an object of the clause. 5. If no object exists then go to step-3.  In the same way an informal algorithm for the resolution of third person ADs is as follows:  1. Examine the next clause in the discourse and if no clause exists then go to step-9. 2. If the current clause consists of third person anaphoric devices then go to step-3 else go to step 1. 3. Access the previous clause. 4. Apply the lexical and morphological filters to assign the weight to nouns or noun phrases that follow the morphological and lexical filters. 5. If current clause consists of section headings or topicalized structures or noun phrase preceded / followed by certain class of words then assign the weight of these filters. 6. If current clause consists of noun or noun phrase as subject and objects (direct, indirect) then assign the weight value for these filters. 7. If the current clause does not consists noun or noun phrase as subject, object or contains no section headings, topicalized structures and noun phrase preceded by certain words then go to step- 3. 8. Find the repetitions of all noun or noun phrases and increment their corresponding weights for each repetition. 9. Record the results and Finish  Algorithms are implemented in Visual C++. Implemented algorithm gets the input that is constructed manually. For this purpose each discourse is divided into clauses and is stored as Unicode text file for input to anaphora resolution 86        program. For better understanding, consider the example of discourse 2.8 and its division into clauses.

Similarly, Table-2 for second person anaphoric devices, exhibits that weights will be assigned in descending order (left – right). It means that the leftmost filter that is topicalized structure will get the highest weight for second person ADs.
