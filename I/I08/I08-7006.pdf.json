{"sections":[{"title":"Myanmar Word Segmentation using Syllable level Longest Matching Hla Hla Htay, Kavi Narayana Murthy Department of Computer and Information Sciences University of Hyderabad, India hla hla htay@yahoo.co.uk, knmuh@yahoo.com Abstract In Myanmar language, sentences are clearly delimited by a unique sentence boundary marker but are written without necessarily pausing between words with spaces. It is therefore non-trivial to segment sentences into words. Word tokeniz-ing plays a vital role in most Natural Language Processing applications. We observe that word boundaries generally align with syllable boundaries. Working directly with characters does not help. It is therefore useful to syllabify texts first. Syllabification is also a non-trivial task in Myanmar. We have collected 4550 syllables from available sources . We have evaluated our syllable inventory on 2,728 sentences spread over 258 pages and observed a coverage of 99.96%. In the second part, we build word lists from available sources such as dictionaries, through the application of morphological rules, and by generating syllable n-grams as possible words and manually checking. We have thus built list of 800,000 words including inflected forms. We have tested our algorithm on a 5000 sentence test data set containing a total of (35049 words) and manually checked for evaluating the performance. The program recognized 34943 words of which 34633 words were correct, thus giving us a Recall of 98.81%, a Precision of 99.11% and a F-Measure is 98.95%.

It is a tonal language, that is to say, the meaning of a syllable or word changes with the tone. It has been classified by linguists as a mono-syllabic or isolating language with agglutinative features. According to history, Myanmar script has originated from Brahmi script which flourished in India from about 500 B.C. to over 300 A.D (MLC, 2002). The script is syllabic in nature, and written from left to right.","Myanmar script is composed of 33 consonants, 11 basic vowels, 11 consonant combination symbols and extension vowels, vowel symbols, devowelizing consonants, diacritic marks, specified symbols and punctuation marks(MLC, 2002),(Thu and Urano, 2006). Myanmar script represents sequences of syllables where each syllable is constructed from consonants, consonant combination symbols (i.e. Medials), vowel symbols related to relevant consonants and diacritic marks indicating tone level.","Myanmar has mainly 9 parts of speech: noun, pronoun, verb, adjective, adverb, particle , conjunction, post-positional marker and interjection (MLC, 2005), (Judson, 1842).","In Myanmar script, sentences are clearly delimited by a sentence boundary marker but words are not always delimited by spaces. Although there is a general tendency to insert spaces between phrases, inserting spaces is more of a convenience rather than The 6th Workshop on Asian Languae Resources, 2008 41 a rule. Spaces may sometimes be inserted between words and even between a root word and the associated post-position. In fact in the past spaces were rarely used. Segmenting sentences into words is therefore a challenging task.","Word boundaries generally align with syllable boundaries and syllabification is therefore a useful strategy. In this paper we describe our attempts on syllabification and segmenting Myanmar sentences into words. After a brief discussion of the corpus collection and pre-processing phases, we describe our approaches to syllabification and tokenization into words.","Computational and quantitative studies in Myanmar are relatively new. Lexical resources available are scanty. Development of electronic dictionaries and other lexical resources will facilitate Natural Language Processing tasks such as Spell Checking, Machine Translation, Automatic Text summarization, Information Extraction, Automatic Text Categorization, Information Retrieval and so on (Murthy, 2006).","Over the last few years, we have developed monolingual text corpora totalling to about 2,141,496 sentences and English-Myanmar parallel corpora amounting to about 80,000 sentences and sentence fragments, aligned at sentence and word levels. We have also collected word lists from these corpora and also from available dictionaries. Currently our word list includes about 800,000 words including inflected forms."]},{"title":"2 Myanmar Words","paragraphs":["Myanmar words are sequences of syllables. The syllable structure of Burmese is C(G)V((V)C), which is to say the onset consists of a consonant optionally followed by a glide, and the rhyme consists of a monophthong alone, a monophthong with a consonant, or a diphthong with a consonant 1",".

As of now, our corpus includes 2,141,496 sentences.","The downloaded corpora need to be cleaned up to remove hypertext markup and we need to extract text if in pdf format. We have developed the necessary scripts in Perl for this. Also, different sites use different font formats and character encoding standards are not yet widely followed.

Word lists and dictionaries in electronic form are of great value in computational linguistics and NLP. Here we describe our efforts in developing a large word list for Myanmar. 4.1 Independent Words As we keep analyzing texts, we can identify some words that can appear independently without combining with other words or suffixes. We build a list of such valid words and we keep adding new valid words as we progress through our segmentation process, gradually developing larger and larger lists of valid words. We have also collected from sources such as Myanmar Orthography(MLC, 2003), CD versions of English-English-Myanmar (Student’s Dictionary)(stu, 2000) and English-Myanmar Dictionary (EMd, ) and Myanmar-French Dictionary (damma sami, 2004). Currently our word list includes 800,000 words. 4.2 Stop Word Removal Stop words include prepositions/post-positions, conjunctions, particles, inflections etc. which appear as suffixes added to other words. They form closed classes and hence can be listed. Preliminary studies therefore suggested that Myanmar words can be recognized by eliminating these stop words. Hopple (Hopple, 2003) also notices that particles ending phrases can be removed to recognize words in a sentence. We have collected stop words by analyzing official newspapers, Myanmar grammar text books and CD versions of English-English-Myanmar (Student’s Dictionary)(stu, 2000), English-Myanmar Dictionary (EMd, ) and The Khit Thit English-Myanmar dictionary (Saya, 2000). We have also looked at stop word lists in English (www.syger.com, ) and mapped them to equivalent stop words in Myanmar. See Table 1. As of now, our stop words list contains 1216 entries. Stop words can be prefixes of other stop words leading to ambiguities. However, usually the longest matching stop word is the right choice.","Identifying and removing stop words does not","Nominative personal pronouns","I [kjun do],","[kja","̄","ma.], \\b\\t [nga],","\\f","[kjou ′ ],","[kja","̄","no], \\f [kja","̄","nou ′ ],"," [kja","̄ ma.]","Possessive pronouns and adjectives","my \\f [kjou ′","i.],","","","","[kjun do i.],"," [kja ̄","ma. i.], [kja","̄","nou ′ i.],"," [kja","̄ ma. i.],\\b\\t","[nga i.],\\f","[kjou ′","i.],","\\f","[kjou ′","je.],","[kjun do je.],","","[kja ̄","ma. je.], [kja","̄","nou ′ je.],"," [kja","̄ ma. je.],\\b\\t","[nga je.],","\\f","[kjou ′","je.],","[kjun do.],","","[kja ̄","no.]","Indefinite pronouns and adjectives","some [a ̄","chou.], [a ̄ chou. tho:],"," [ta ̄","chou.], [a ̄ chou. tho:],"," [ta ̄","chou.ta ̄ chou.],"," [ta ̄","chou.ta ̄ lei] Table 1: Stop-words of English Vs Myanmar always necessarily lead to correct segmentation of sentences into words.

Interestingly, almost every syllable has a meaning in Myanmar language. This can also be seen from the work of Hopple (Hopple, 2003).","Myanmar Natural Language Processing Group has listed 1894 syllables that can appear in Myanmar texts (Htut, 2001). We have observed that there are more syllables in use, especially in foreign words including Pali and Sanskrit words which are widely used in Myanmar.

This program is quite fast and it took only a few minutes on a desktop PC in order to process 3.5M bytes of Myanmar texts. We have used “-type=word” option treating syllables as words. We had to modify this program a bit since Myanmar uses zero (as “(0) wa ” letter) and the other special characters ( “,”, “<”, “>”, “.”, “&”, “[”,“]” etc.) which were being ignored in the original Text::Ngrams software. We collect all possible words which is composed of n-grams of syllables up to 5-grams. Table 1 shows some words which are collected through n-gram analysis. Almost all monograms are meaning-ful words. Many bi-grams are also valid words and as we move towards longer n-grams, we generally get less and less number of valid words. See Table 3. Further, frequency of occurrence of these n-grams is a useful clue. See Table 4.","By analyzing the morphological structure of words we will be able to analyze inflected and derived word forms. A set of morphemes and morphological forms have been collected from (MLC, 2005) and (Judson, 1842) . See Table 5. For example, the four-syllable word in Table 3 is an adverb “","” [htu: htu: ke: ke:] outstanding derived from the verb “","”. See Table 3.","Statistical construction of machine readable dictionaries has many advantages. New words which appear from time to time such as Internet, names of medicines, can also be detected. Compounds words also can be seen. Common names such as names of persons, cities, committees etc. can be also mined. Once sufficient data is available, statistical analysis can be carried and techniques such as mutual information and maximum entropy can be used to hypothesize possible words. 4.4 Words from Dictionaries Collecting words using the above three mentioned methods has still not covered all the valid words in our corpus. We have got only 150,000 words. Words collected from n-grams needs exhaustive human effort to pick the valid words. We have therefore collected words from two on-line dictionaries - the English-English-Myanmar (Student’s Dictionary) (stu, 2000), English-Myanmar Dictionary (EMd, ) and from two e-books - French-Myanmar(damma sami, 2004), and Myanmar Orthography (MLC, 2003).

Many researchers have used longest string matching (Angell et al., 1983),(Ari et al., 2001) and we follow the same approach.","The first step in building a word hypothesizer is syllabification of the input text by looking up syllable lists. In the second step, we exploit lists of words (viewed as n-grams at syllable level) for word segmentation from left to right. 5.1 Syllabification As an initial attempt we use longest string matching alone for Myanmar text syllabification. Examples are shown in Table 7.","Pseudo code Here we go from left-to-right in a greedy manner: sub syllabification{ Load the set of syllables from syllable-file Load the sentences to be processed from sentence-file Store all syllables of length j in Nj where j =10..1 for-each sentence do","length ← length of the sentence The 6th Workshop on Asian Languae Resources, 2008 45","pos ← 0","while (length > 0) do for j =10..1 do","for-each syllable in Nj do","if string-match sentence(pos, pos + j) with syllable","Syllable found.

These texts were syllabified using the longest matching algorithm over our syllable list and we observed that only 0.04% of the actual syllables were not detected. The Table 6 shows that different typing sequences of syllables were also detected. Here are some examples of failure:","[rkdCf;]and ","[rkdvf;] which are seldom used in text.
