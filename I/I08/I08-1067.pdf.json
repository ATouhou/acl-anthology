Two simple and computationally inexpensive ideas have proven to be surprisingly effective: (i) reordering the English source sentence as per Hindi syntax, and (ii) using the suffixes of Hindi words. The former is done by applying simple transformation rules on the English parse tree. The latter, by using a simple suffix separation program. With only a small amount of bilingual training data and limited tools for Hindi, we achieve reasonable performance and substantial improvements over the baseline phrase-based system. Our approach eschews the use of parsing or other sophisticated linguistic tools for the target language (Hindi) making it a useful framework for statistical machine translation from English to Indian languages in general, since such tools are not widely available for Indian languages currently."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Techniques for leveraging syntactic and morphological information for statistical machine translation (SMT) are receiving a fair amount of attention nowadays. For SMT from English to Indian languages, these techniques are especially important for the following three reasons: (i) Indian languages differ widely from English in terms of word-order; (ii) Indian languages are morphologically quite rich; and (iii) large amounts of parallel corpora are not available for these languages, though smaller amounts of text in specific domains (such as health, tourism, and agriculture) are now becoming accessible. It might therefore be expected that using syntactic and morphological information for English to Indian language SMT will prove highly beneficial in terms of achieving reasonable performance out of limited parallel corpora. However, the difficulty in this is that crucial tools, such as parsers and morphological analyzers, are not widely available for Indian languages yet.","In this paper, we present our work on incorporating syntactic and morphological information for English to Hindi SMT. Our approach, which eschews the use of parsing and other tools for Hindi, is twopronged:","1. Incorporating syntactic information by combining phrase-based models with a set of structural preprocessing rules on English","2. Incorporating morphological information by using a simple suffix separation program for Hindi, the likes of which can be created with limited effort for other Indian languages as well Significant improvements over the baseline phrase-based SMT system are obtained using our approach. Table 1 illustrates this with an example 1",". Since only limited linguistic effort and tools are required for the target language, we believe that the framework we propose is suitable for SMT from English to other Indian languages as well. 1","This example is discussed further in section 4"]},{"title":"513","paragraphs":["input For a celestial trip of the scientific kind, visit the planetarium. reference e e, ae। vaigyaanika tariike ke eka divya saira ke lie, taaraamandala aaem scientific kind of a celestial trip for, planetarium visit (come) baseline , । ke svargiiya yaatraa ke vaigyaanika prakaara, kaa taaraagruha hai of celestial trip of scientific kind, of planetarium is baseline+syn e, । vaigyaanika prakaara ke svargiiya yaatraa ke lie, taaraagruha hai scientific kind of celestial trip for, planetarium is baseline+syn+morph e, । vaigyaanika prakaara ke svargiiya yaatraa ke lie, taaraagruha dekhem scientific kind of celestial trip for, planetarium visit (see) Table 1: Effects of Syntactic and Morphological Processing (reference: human reference translation; baseline: phrase-based system; syn: with syntactic information; morph: with morphological information)","The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 outlines related work.

(1990) to syntax-based and phrase-based techniques.","The beginnings of phrase-based translation can be seen in the alignment template model introduced by Och et al. (1999). A joint probability model for phrase translation was proposed by Marcu and Wong (2002). Koehn et al. (2003) propose certain heuristics to extract phrases that are consistent with bidirectional word-alignments generated by the IBM models (Brown et al., 1990). Phrases extracted using these heuristics are also shown to perform better than syntactically motivated phrases, the joint model, and IBM model 4 (Koehn et al., 2003).","Syntax-based models use parse-tree representations of the sentences in the training data to learn, among other things, tree transformation probabilities. These methods require a parser for the target language and, in some cases, the source language too. Yamada and Knight (2001) propose a model that transforms target language parse trees to source language strings by applying reordering, insertion, and translation operations at each node of the tree. Graehl and Knight (2004) and Melamed (2004), propose methods based on tree-to-tree mappings. Imamura et al. (2005) present a similar method that achieves significant improvements over a phrase-based baseline model for Japanese-English translation.","Recently, various preprocessing approaches have been proposed for handling syntax within SMT. These algorithms attempt to reconcile the word-order differences between the source and target language sentences by reordering the source language data prior to the SMT training and decoding cycles. Nießen and Ney (2004) propose some restructuring steps for German-English SMT. Popovic and Ney (2006) report the use of simple local transformation rules for Spanish-English and Serbian-English translation. Collins et al. (2006) propose German clause restructuring to improve German-English SMT.","The use of morphological information for SMT has been reported in (Nießen and Ney, 2004) and (Popovic and Ney, 2006).

(2003)) computes the translation model p(f |e) by using a phrase translation probability distribution. The decoding process works by segmenting the input sentence f into a sequence of I phrases f","I","1. A uniform probability distribution over all possible segmentations is assumed. Each phrase f i is translated into a target language phrase ei with probability φ(f i|ei). Reordering is penalized according to a simple exponential distortion model.","The phrase translation table is learnt in the following manner: The parallel corpus is word-aligned bidirectionally, and using various heuristics (see (Koehn et al., 2003) for details) phrase correspondences are established. Given the set of collected phrase pairs, the phrase translation probability is calculated by relative frequency: φ(f |e)= count(f,e)","∑ f count(f, e)","Lexical weighting, which measures how well words within phrase pairs translate to each other, validates the phrase translation, and addresses the problem of data sparsity.","The language model p(e) used in our baseline system is a trigram model with modified Kneser-Ney smoothing (Chen and Goodman, 1998).","The weights for the various components of the model (phrase translation model, language model, distortion model etc.) are set by minimum error rate training (Och, 2003). 3.2 Syntactic Information As mentioned in section 2, phrase-based models have emerged as the most successful method for SMT. These models, however, do not handle syntax in a natural way. Reordering of phrases during translation is typically managed by distortion models, which have proved not entirely satisfactory (Collins et al., 2006), especially for language pairs that differ a lot in terms of word-order. We use a preprocessing approach to get over this problem, by reordering the English sentences in the training and test corpora before the SMT system kicks in. This reduces, and often eliminates, the ‘distortion load’ on the phrase-based system.","The reordering rules that we use for preprocessing can be broadly described by the following transformation rule going from English to Hindi word order (Rao et al, 2000): SSmVVmOOmCm → C′ mS′","mS′ O′","mO′ V ′ mV ′ where, S: Subject O: Object V : Verb Cm: Clause modifier X′",": Corresponding constituent in Hindi, where X is S, O,orV Xm: modifier of X Essentially, the SVO order of English is changed to SOV order, and post-modifiers are converted to pre-modifiers.

Table 2 illustrates this with an example. 3.3 Morphological Information If an SMT system considers different morphological forms of a word as independent entities, a crucial source of information is neglected. It is conceivable that with the use of morphological information, especially for morphologically rich languages, the requirement for training data might be much reduced. This is indicated, for example, in recent work on German-English statistical MT with limited bilingual training data (Nießen and Ney, 2004), and also in other applications such as statistical part-of-speech tagging of Hindi (Gupta et al., 2006).","The separation of morphological suffixes conflates various forms of a word, which results in higher counts for both words and suffixes, thereby countering the problem of data sparsity. As an example, assume that the following sentence pair is part of the bilingual training corpus: English: Players should just play. Hindi: e। khilaadiyom ko kevala khelanaa caahie Hindi (suffix separated): i e। khilaada iyom ko kevala khela naa caahie","Now, consider the input sentence, “The men came across some players,” which should be translated as “a ”(aadmiyom ko kucha khilaadii mile).

Also, the general relationship between the oblique case (indicated by the suffix i(iyom)) and the case marker (ko) is not learnt, but only the specific relationship between (khilaadiyom) and (ko). This indicates the necessity of using morphological information for languages such as Hindi.","To incorporate morphological information, we use a morphological analyzer (Minnen et al., 2001) for English, and a simple suffix separation program for Hindi. The suffix separation program is based on the Hindi stemmer presented in (Ananthakrishnan and Rao, 2003), and works by separating from each word the longest possible suffix from table 3. A detailed analysis of noun, adjective, and verb inflections that were used to create this list can be found in (McGregor, 1977) and (Rao, 1996). A few examples of each type are given below:","Noun Inflections: Nouns in Hindi are inflected based on the case (direct or oblique), the number (singular or plural), and the gender (masculine or feminine3","). For example, (ladakaa -boy) becomes (ladake) when in oblique case, and the plural (ladake - boys) becomes (ladakom). The feminine noun (ladakii - girl) is inflected as (ladakiyaam - plural direct) and (ladakiyom - plural oblique), but it remains uninflected in the singular direct case.","Adjective Inflections: Adjectives which end in a(aa)ora(aam) in their direct singular masculine form agree with the noun in gender, number, and case. For example, the singular direct a(accha) is inflected as a(acche) in all other masculine forms, and as a(acchii) in all feminine forms. Other adjectives are not inflected.","Verb Inflections: Hindi verbs are inflected based on gender, number, person, tense, aspect, modality, formality, and voice. (Rao, 1996) provides a complete list of verb inflection rules.","The overall process used for incorporating syntactic and morphological information, as described in this section, is shown in figure 1. 3 Hindi does not possess a neuter gender"]},{"title":"517","paragraphs":["Technique","Evaluation Metric","BLEU mWER SSER roughly understandable+ understandable+ baseline 12.10 77.49 91.20 10% 0% baseline+syn 16.90 69.18 74.40 42% 12% baseline+syn+morph 15.88 70.69 66.40 46% 28% Table 4: Evaluation Results (baseline: phrase-based system; syn: with syntactic information; morph: with morphological information)"]},{"title":"4 Experimental Results","paragraphs":["The corpus described in the table below was used for the experiments.","#sentences #words Training 5000 120,153 Development 483 11,675 Test 400 8557 Monolingual (Hindi) 49,937 1,123,966","The baseline system was implemented by training the phrase-based system described in section 3 on the 5000 sentence training corpus.","For the Hindi language model, we compared various n-gram models, and found trigram models with modified Kneser-Ney smoothing to be the best per-forming (Chen and Goodman, 1998).

The word-order in the baseline translation is woeful, while the translations after syntactic preprocessing (baseline+syn and baseline+syn+morph) follow the correct Hindi order (compare with the reference translation). The effect of suffix separation can be seen from the verb form ((dekhem) – visit or see) in the last translation (baseline+syn+morph). The reason for this is that the pair “visit → ”is not available to be learnt from the original and the syntactically preprocessed corpora, but the following pairs are: (i) to visit → (ii) worth visit-ing → , and (iii) can visit → . Thus, the baseline and baseline+syn models are not able to produce the correct verb form for “visit”. On the other hand, the baseline+syn+morph model, due to the suffix separation process, combines (dekha) and e(em) from different mappings in the aligned corpus, e.g., “visit +ing → ” and “sing → e”, to get the right translation for visit () in this context."]},{"title":"5 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We have presented in this paper an effective framework for English-Hindi phrase-based SMT. The results demonstrate that significant improvements are possible through the use of relatively simple techniques for incorporating syntactic and morphological information.","Since all Indian languages follow SOV order, and are relatively rich in terms of morphology, the framework presented should be applicable to English to Indian language SMT in general. Given that morphological and parsing tools are not yet widely available for Indian languages, an approach like ours which minimizes use of such tools for the target language would be quite desirable.","In future work, we propose to experiment with a more sophisticated morphological analyzer. As more parallel corpora become available, we also in-tend to measure the effects of using morphology on corpora requirements. Finally, a formal evaluation of these techniques for other Indian languages (especially Dravidian languages such as Tamil) would be interesting."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["We are grateful to Sachin Anklekar and Saurabh Kushwaha for their assistance with the tedious task of collecting and preprocessing the corpora."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Ananthakrishnan Ramanathan and Durgesh Rao, A Lightweight Stemmer for Hindi, Workshop on Computational Linguistics for South-Asian Languages, EACL, 2003.","Peter F.
