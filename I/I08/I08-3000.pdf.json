The goal of this workshop is to ascertain the progress made in providing computational support for less computerized or ‘less privileged’ languages and in building language resources and Natural Language Processing tools etc. for such languages. An introductory article explains the background of and motivation for this workshop. It also presents an overview of the papers selected for the workshop. The workshop attracted a lot of interest from around the world. There were a relatively large number of submissions and each paper was reviewed by three reviewers, which ensured that the quality of papers selected was comparable to other successful workshops held previously on similar themes. The selected papers include a variety of topics and covers a wide range of languages. Another major feature of the workshop is that it includes three invited talks by speakers from different regions of the world and on very different topics. We would like to thank the program committee members for all the hard work that they did during the reviewing process. We would also like to thank all the people involved in organizing the IJCNLP conference. We hope that this workshop will be able to achieve its goal and will stimulate and encourage even more interest in the theme of the workshop so that the gap between languages like English and the less computerized ‘less privileged’ or languages can be reduced at a rapid pace.
