In this study, a rule-based approach of syllable segmentation algorithm for Myanmar text is proposed. Segmentation rules were created based on the syllable structure of Myanmar script and a syllable segmentation algorithm was designed based on the created rules. A segmentation program was developed to evaluate the algorithm. A training corpus containing 32,283 Myanmar syllables was tested in the program and the experimental results show an accuracy rate of 99.96% for segmentation."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Myanmar language, also known as Burmese, is the official language of the Union of Myanmar. It is spoken by 32 million as a first language, and as a second language by ethnic minorities in Myanmar (Ethnologue, 2005). Burmese is a member of the Tibeto-Burman languages, which is a subfamily of the Sino-Tibetan family of languages. Burmese is a tonal and analytic language using the Burmese script. This is a phonologically based script, adapted from Mon, and ultimately based on an In-dian (Brahmi) prototype (Daniels and Bright, 1996). Burmese characters are rounded in shape and the script is written from left to right. No space is used between words but spaces are usually used to separate phrases.","The Myanmar language still remains as one of the less privileged Asian languages in cyberspace. Many people have put considerable effort into the computerization of the Myanmar script. However, Myanmar still lacks support on computers and not many NLP tools and applications are available for this language. A standard encoding is needed for the language processing of Myanmar script; however, there is not yet any official national standard encoding for Myanmar script.","This study focuses on the syllable segmentation of Myanmar text based on the UTN11-2 1","encoding model for Myanmar script. Myanmar script has been granted space in Unicode (U+1000-U+109F) since version 3.0. In Unicode version 4.0, the Unicode consortium defined standards for encoding Myanmar script and canonical order. The current version of Unicode is 5.0. However, there are only a few Unicode-compliant Myanmar fonts that fully follow the Unicode encoding standard. Local font developers and implementers have produced fonts that follow only part of the Unicode standards and many of these partially-compliant fonts are widely used in cyberspace. In 2006, Myanmar proposed additional characters 2","to be added to the Unicode version 5.0. The proposed characters for the Burmese script are as follows:","• 102B MYANMAR VOWEL SIGN TALL AA","• 1039 MYANMAR SIGN VIRAMA","[Glyph change and note change] 1 Unicode Technical Note 11-2, Martin Hosken & Maung Tuntun Lwin, Representing Myanmar in Unicode: Details and Examples, http://www.unicode.org/notes/tn11/ 2 Proposal to Encode Seven Additional Myanmar Characters in the UCS, Myanmar Computer Federation, Myanmar Language Commission 51 • 103A MYANMAR SIGN ASAT","• 103B MYANMAR CONSONANT SIGN MEDIAL YA","• 103C MYANMAR CONSONANT SIGN MEDIAL RA","• 103D MYANMAR CONSONANT SIGN MEDIAL WA","• 103E MYANMAR CONSONANT SIGN MEDIAL HA • 103F MYANMAR LETTER GREAT SA","• 104E MYANMAR SYMBOL AFORE-MENTIONED [Glyph change]","The Unicode technical committee has accepted these proposed characters for inclusion in future versions of the Unicode standard.3","If the proposal is adopted, this will become the standard encoding for Myanmar script. Therefore, this paper employs the proposed encoding model for the syllable segmentation of Myanmar text."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["The lack of official standard encoding hinders localization of Myanmar language and no previous work on the syllable segmentation of Myanmar script was found. Although character codes for Myanmar languages have been allocated in UCS/Unicode (U+1000–U+109F), lack of imple-mentation makes them unavailable to local end users (Ko Ko and Mikami, 2005). We can learn, however, from related works done for other languages which have similarities to Myanmar. Many attempts have been made in Thai language processing for syllable and word segmentation. Poowarawan (1986) proposed a dictionary-based approach to Thai syllable separation. Thai syllable segmentation was considered as the first step to-wards word segmentation and many of word segmentation ambiguities were resolved at the level of syllable segmentation (Aroonmanakun, 2002). Thai syllable segmentation can be viewed as the problem of inserting spaces between pairs of characters in the text and the character-level ambiguity of word segmentation can be reduced by extracting syllables whose structures are more well-defined (Sornil and Chaiwanarom, 2004). Most approaches 3 http://www.unicode.org/alloc/Pipeline.html to Thai word segmentation use a dictionary as their basis. However, the segmentation accuracy depends on the quality of the dictionary used for analysis and unknown words can reduce the performance. Theeramunkong and Usanavasin (2001) proposed a non dictionary-based approach to Thai word segmentation. A method based on decision tree models was proposed and their approach claimed to outperform some well-known dictionary-dependent techniques of word segmentation such as the maximum and the longest matching methods."]},{"title":"3 Myanmar Alphabets","paragraphs":["In order to clarify the syllable structure, characters of the Myanmar script are classified into twelve categories. Each category is given a name and the glyphs and Unicode code points of characters be-longing to each category are shown in Table 1. The Myanmar script consists of a total of 75 characters. There are 34 consonant letters in Consonants group, four medials in the Medials group and eight vowels in the Dependent Vowels group. Myanmar Sign Virama is used for stacking consonant letters and it does not have a glyph, while Myanmar Sign Asat is used in devowelising process (e.g. ဆင). There are three dependent various signs in Group F. The Group I consists of three independent vowels (ဤ, ဧ, ဪ) and three independent various signs (၌, ၍, ၏). The characters in Group I can act as stand-alone syllables. Group E consists of four independent vowels (ဣ, ဥ, ဦ, ဩ) and Myanmar Symbol Aforementioned (၎). Each of the independent vowels in group E has its own syllable but they can also combine with other signs to form a syllable (e.g. ဥက ). Myanmar Symbol Aforementioned in Group E can never stand alone and it is always written as ၄င as a short form of လညကင . Myanmar Letter Great Sa is always preceded by a consonant and is never written alone (e.g. မဿ ). There are ten Myanmar digits in the Digits group. The group P consists of two Myanmar punctuation marks. Myanmar script uses white space between phrases, which is taken into account in this study.

Independent vowels, independent various signs and digits can act as stand-alone syllables. According to the Unicode standard, vowels are stored after the consonant. Therefore, Myanmar vowel sign E (U+1031) is stored after the consonant although it is placed before the consonant in rendering (e.g. န). Medials may appear at most three times in a syllable (e.g. မ) . Vowels may appear twice in a syllable (e.g. စ). In a syllable, a second consonant may come together with an Asat for devowelising (e.g. ဇင). Each of the independent vowels in group E has its own syllable but they can also combine with other signs (consonants, dependent vowels, dependent various signs) to form a syllable (e.g. ဣ, ဥက , ဦ, သင ).

The program accepts the Myanmar text string and shows the output string in a segmented form. The program converts the input text string into equivalent sequence of category form (e.g. CMCACV for မနမ ) and compares the converted character sequence with the letter sequence tables to determine syllable boundaries. A syllable segmented Myanmar text string is shown as the output of the program. The symbol \"|\" is used to represent the syllable breaking point. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the algorithm, a training corpus was developed by extracting 11,732 headwords from Myanmar Orthography (Myanmar Language Commission, 2003). The corpus contains a total of 32,238 Myanmar syllables. These syllables were tested in the program and the segmented results were manually checked. The results showed 12 errors of in-correctly segmented syllables, thus achieving accuracy of 99.96% for segmentation. The few errors occur with the Myanmar Letter Great Sa ဿ and the Independent Vowel ဥ . The errors can be fixed by updating the segmentation rules of these two characters in letter sequence tables. Some examples of input text strings and their segmented results are shown in Table 7."]},{"title":"8 Conclusion","paragraphs":["Syllables are building blocks of words and syllable segmentation is essential for the language processing of Myanmar script.

A test corpus containing 32,238 Myanmar syllables was tested in the program and 99.96% accuracy was achieved. From this study, we can conclude that syllable segmentation of Myanmar text can be implemented by a rule-based approach. While characters of non-Myanmar script are not considered in this study, the segmentation rules can be further extended to cover these characters. A complete syllable segmentation algorithm for Myanmar script can be further implemented by applying this algorithm. 56","2nd Character A C D E F G I M P S V W A -1 U 1 1 0 -1 1 0 1 0 0 1 C 0 U 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 D -1 1 0 1 -1 -1 1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 E -1 U 1 1 2 0 1 -1 1 -1 0 1 F -1 U 1 1 2 -1 1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 G -1 1 1 1 0 -1 1 -1 1 -1 0 1 I -1 1 1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 M 2 U 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 -1 0 1 P -1 1 1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 S -1 0 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 V 2 U 1 1 0 0 1 -1 1 -1 0 1 1 s t  C h a r a c t e r ","W -1 1 1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 1 -1 -1 0"," Table 4.
