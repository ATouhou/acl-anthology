We propose in this paper a new summarization method that is based on example-based approach. Using example-based approach for the summarization task has the following three advantages: high modularity, absence of the necessity to score importance for each word, and high applicability to local context. Experimental results have proven that the summarization system attains approximately 60% accuracy by human judgment."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["The example-based approach generates language by imitating instances, which originated in the machine translation method based on the analogy (Nagao, 1984). The idea is derived from the observation that a human being translates according to past translation experiences. In the machine translation task, this approach has been implemented, and has so far achieved efficient results (Sumita, 1998; Imamura, 2004).","In summarization, a human being also summarizes with his own knowledge and experiences. For this reason, we focus on a summarization method which is based on analogy, example-based summarization. The example-based method summarizes the input text in three steps. First, it retrieves a similar instance to the input text. Second, it links equivalent phrases between the input text and the similar instance. Finally, a summary is acquired with combination of some corresponding phrases. Here, we employed a Japanese news article as the input text and utilized news headlines as the instances. The news headline consists of one brief sentence which describes the main point.","We assert that the example-based summarization has the following advantages: (1)High modularity","Easy improvement and maintenance are required to formulate a useful system in general. An example-based framework makes it easy for us to improve a system by only adding instances. Besides, the addition of instances causes few side-effects. (2)Use of similarity rather than importance","Almost all previous work on summarization has focused on a sentence extraction. These works compute importance for each word to extract a sentence. However, it is difficult to compute the importance which correlates with human sense. Example-based summarization means there is no need to measure the importance, and it computes the similarity in-stead. We think it is easier to assess the similarity between two expressions rather than the importance of one expression. (3)High applicability to local context","The statistical method, in general, attempts to compute the probability of each word appearing in the summary corpus (Knight and Marcu, 2002; Witbrock and Mittal, 1999). This may increase difficulties in maintaining local context, since the statistical approach focuses on the global probability. However, the example-based approach attempts to find most locally similar instance out of the instance collection, which may increase the fitness of input contexts.","For the three reasons given above, this paper explains the system which summarizes a Japanese news article to a one-sentence summary by imitating the similar instance."]},{"title":"739","paragraphs":["As related work, Nguyen et al. (2004) have proposed an example-based sentence reduction model. They deal with the compression of one sentence, while we summarize some sentences into a one-sentence summary. Thus, our summarization ratio is inevitably lower than theirs, as it is considered to be more difficult as a summarization task.","Many studies have summarized some sentences, such as a news article, into a one-sentence summary. Most of them extract the important sentence and contract it. In contrast, our method generates a one-sentence summary by combining phrases in some sentences. Consequently, we can obtain high compression summaries that include information from many positions of the source."]},{"title":"2 Instance Collection","paragraphs":["Our example-based summarization regards news headlines as the instance collection. A news headline is a short sentence in which the primary point is written. The following example is Japanese news headlines: Example (1) :  (Mitsubishi Motors Corp. produces passenger cars in China.)","We use Japanese news headlines, like the above examples, as instances. Besides, as we have noted, only news headlines are used as instances; that is, the pairs formed by an original sentence and its summarized sentence are not used."]},{"title":"3 Example-based Summarization 3.1 Overview","paragraphs":["Our example-based summarization system summarizes a lengthy news article into a one-sentence summary by using instances. The overall process is illustrated in figure 1. The system is composed of the following three processes in this order: 1. Retrieve a similar instance to an input news article from the instance collection. 2. Align corresponding phrases between the input news article and the similar instance. 3. Combine the corresponding phrases to form a summary. Detail of each process is described hereafter. 3.2 Retrieval of Similar Instance The system measures a similarity between the input and each instance in the instance collection when it retrieves a similar instance. If many words are shared between two expressions, we regard two expressions as similar. Hence, the similarity is calculated on basis of the overlaps of content words between the input news article I and the instance E, defined as follows: Sim(E, I)= n"]},{"title":"∑","paragraphs":["i=1 Score(i)·{w ·||Tv1(E)∩Tvi(I)|| +||To1(E)∩Toi(I)||} (1) where, - n : the number of sentences in input, - Tvi(·) : the verbs set in the last phrase of the i-th sentence, - Toi(·) : the set of content words in the i-th sentence, - ||Tv1(E) ∩ Tvi(I)|| : the number of overlaps between Tv1(E) and Tvi(I). In the equation, Score(i) and w are designed to give a higher score if words indicating the main topic of the input article are matched with words in the instance. We have found that words have different contributions, depending on the sentence position, to the main topic. Therefore, we apply Score(i) which depends on the sentence position i, and we use the following experimentally-determined score as Score(i). Score(i)={ 5.15 if i = 1 2.78/i0.28","otherwise (2) The score indicates an agreement rate of content words depending on the sentence position, which is calculated by using 5000 pairs of newspaper’s body and its title1","We have also found that the verbs in the last phrase are appropriate for the main topic of the input article. For that reason, we determine the weight w = 3 by our experiment.","Example 2 shows the similar instance obtained by measuring the similarity. Example (2) : Input news article  24 (skip the","1","We used the same kind of newspaper as data set in section 4.1 for calculating Score(i)."]},{"title":"740","paragraphs":["Figure 1: Overview of example-based summarization rest.) (The Manufacturing Council held a meeting on the 24th, which discusses the hard-hitting strategy for quality management. ...) Obtained similar instance 18  (The committee for the privatization of the Public Roads Administration held the first meeting on the 18th at the prime minister’s office.) 3.3 Phrase Alignment We compare the phrases in the input with those in the similar instance, and the system aligns the corresponding phrases. Here, the correspondence refers to the link of the equivalent phrases between the input and its similar instance. The detail of phrase alignment procedures are shown in the following.","To begin with, sentences both in the input and in the similar instance are analyzed using a Japanese syntactic parser CaboCha1)",". The sentences are split into phrases and named entities (NEs), such as PER-SON, LOCATION, DATE, are recognized by the tool.","Then the adnominal phrases in the similar instance are deleted. This is because the adnominal phrases are of many types, depending on the modified noun; accordingly, the adnominal phrase should be used only if the modified nouns are exactly matched between the input and the similar instance.","Finally, the system links the corresponding phrases. Here, phrase correspondence is one-to-many, not one-to-one, and therefore a phrase in a similar instance has some corresponding phrases in the input. In order to compare phrases, the following four measures are employed: (i) agreement of grammatical case, (ii) agreement of NE, (iii) similarity with enhanced edit distance, and (iv) similarity by means of mutual information. The measure of (i) focuses on functional words, whereas the measures of (ii)-(iv) note content words. Let us explain the measures using example 2. (i) Agreement of Grammatical Case If there is a phrase which has the same grammatical case2","in the input and in the similar instance, we regard the phrase as the corresponding phrase. In example 2, for example, the phrases “ (the hard-hitting strategy obj3","), (the meeting obj)” in the input corresponds the phrase “ (the first meeting obj)” in the similar instance. (ii) Agreement of Named Entity Provided the input has the same NE tag as the similar instance, the phrase involving its tag links the corresponding phrase. For example, in example 2, the phrase “24 [DATE] (on the 24th.)” in the input corresponds the phrase “18 [DATE] (on the 18th.)” in the similar instance. (iii) Similarity with Enhanced Edit Distance We adopt the enhanced edit distance to link phrases including the same characters, because Japanese abbreviation tends to include the same characters as the original. For example, the abbreviation of “","2","Comma is also regarded as grammatical case (i.e., null case) here.","3","“obj” is an object case marker."]},{"title":"741 ","paragraphs":["(Bank of Japan)” is “”. The enhanced edit distance is proposed by Yamamoto et al. (2003). The distance is a measure of similarity by counting matching characters between two phrases. Moreover, the distance is assigned a different similarity weight according to the type of matched characters. We apply 1.0 to the weight only if Chinese-derived characters (Kanji) are matched. We link phrases as corresponding phrases, where the phrases are the top three similar to a phrase in the similar instance. (iv) Similarity with Mutual Information We finally compute the similarity with mutual information to link syntactically similar phrases. For example, given the following two expressions: “ (to hold a meeting)” and “ (to hold a convention)”, we regard (a meeting) and (a convention) as similar. We use the similarity proposed by Lin (1998). The method uses mutual information and dependency relationships as the phrase features. We extend the method to Japanese by using a particle as the dependency relationships. We link phrases as corresponding phrases, where the phrases are the top three similar to a phrase in the similar instance. 3.4 Combination of the Corresponding Phrases Our system forms the one-sentence summary by combining the corresponding phrases. Let us explain this process by using figure 2. We arrange the phrase of the input on the node, where the phrases is judged as the correspondence to the phrase in the similar instance. For example, in figure 2, the second nodes e and d denote the corresponding phrases in the input, which correspond to the second phrase had in the similar instance.","We assign the similarity between corresponding phrases as the weight of node. In addition to this, we employ phrase connection score to the weight of edge. The score indicates the connectivity of consecutive two phrases, e.g. two nodes such as node d and node e in figure 2. If you want to obtain a fine summary, i.e., a summary that contains similar phrases to the similar instance, and that is correct grammatically, you have to search the best path Ŵp for path sequence Wp = {w0, w1, w2, ··· , wm}, where the best path maximizes the score.","Ŵp = Wp s.t. argmax p Scorep(Wp) (3) Figure 2: Optimal path problem that depends on combination of the corresponding phrases4",". The best path Ŵp is a one-sentence summary which is generated by our system. Take the case of the thick line in figure 2, Ŵp is indicated as Ŵp = {a, d, e, g, k, m, n}, namely, generated summary is formed the phrases {a, d, e, g, k, m, n}. In eq.3, Scorep(Wp) is given by Scorep(Wp)=α m"]},{"title":"∑","paragraphs":["i=0 N(wi)+(1−α) m"]},{"title":"∑","paragraphs":["i=1 E(wi−1, wi) (4)","where α is the balancing factor among the weights of node and edge.

N(wi) illustrates the similarity between corresponding two phrases. The node score, shown above, is determined by the preliminary experiment. The edge score E(wi−1, wi) is given by E(wi−1, wi)=","1 |loc(wi−1) − loc(wi)| + 1 (6) where, loc(wi) denotes where the location of the sentence contains the phrase wi in the input. The edge score means that if wi−1 and wi are located closely to each other, a higher score is given, since a good connection is expected in this case.","4","The nodes, a, b, c,···, n, indicate the corresponding phrases to the phrase in the similar sentence. For example, the nodes, b, c, d correspond to “The PRA Committee.” i is a phrase number in the similar sentence."]},{"title":"742 4 Evaluation and Discussion 4.1 The Corpus","paragraphs":["We used 26,784 news headlines as instances, which were collected from the Nikkei-goo mail service2) for 2001-2006. In order to adjust the weight w in the eq.1 and the balancing parameter α in eq.4, 150 input news articles were used as the tuning set. A different group of 134 news articles were used for evaluation. We used Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a Japanese newspaper 3)",", from 1999 through 2000 as tuning and test data. 4.2 Summarization Ratio To calculate summarization ratio, we have compared the number of characters in the input news articles with that in the output summary. As the result, we obtained a summarization ratio of 5%; namely, 95% characters in the input were reduced. From the summarization ratio, our approach made it possible to summarize sentences into one-sentence summary with high compression. 4.3 Sectional Evaluation We evaluated each part of our system by human judgment5",". We first evaluated the process by retrieving similar instance. Next, we evaluated the processes of phrase alignment and the combination by assessing whether the output summaries were appropriate. · Retrieving Process An examinee evaluated the similar instances obtained. Given an input news article and the similar instance to the input, the examinee rates the following scale from one to four, based on how similar the similar instance obtained is to the summary which the examinee generated from the input news article:","1) quite similar 2) slightly similar","3) not very similar 4) not similar","Out of 134 input articles, 77 inputs were ranked either 1) quite similar or 2) slightly similar. As a consequence, the accuracy of similar instance obtained is approximately 57%, which indicates that the similarity calculation for obtaining similar instance is feasible. 5 One examinee judged the parts of our system. · Phrase Alignment and Combination We also evaluated parts of phrase alignment and the combination by human judgment. The examinee compared 77 output summaries with their input. Here, we limited 77 outputs judged as good similar instances in evaluation of the process of retrieving similar instance, because we evaluate specifically the parts of phrase alignment and combination.","The examinee categorized them based on how proper the output summary is to the input news article:","1) quite proper 2) slightly proper","3) not very proper 4) not proper","As a result of judgment, 48 outputs out of 77 are evaluated either 1) quite proper or 2) slightly proper.","Both a statistical method by Knight and Marcu (2002) and an example-based method by Nguyen et al. (2004) contracted one-sentence with a summarization ratio of approximately 60-70%. Both papers indicated that a score of 7-8 on a scale from one to ten was obtained. They deal with the compression of one sentence, while we summarize some sentences into a one-sentence summary. Thus, our summarization ratio is lower than theirs, as it is considered to be more difficult as a summarization task. Despite this, we obtained the ratio that 62% (48 out of 77 results) were judged proper. Although direct comparison of the performance is impossible, it is considered that our proposed method obtains a competitive accuracy. 4.4 Discussions · Examples of Output Summary Figure 3 shows some examples of the output summary.","From figure 3, we can see that the similar instances were effectively used, and the appropriate summaries to the input are generated. For example, the second summary in the figure is judged as a fine summary contracting information of two sentences according to the similar instance. · Analysis of Summarization Errors In the course of our summarization, we have observed errors due to erroneous correspondences.
