Usually, this term refers to hypertext systems, which offer the possibility to activate hyperlinks, moving the reading point from a text unit (source) to another one (target), this change being intra or intertextual. From our point of view, this conception presents some limitations. First, the hyperlink activation is not assisted. In other words, imprecise, poor or no information is provided to the reader before s/he activates the link. Second, the reader does not know where the movement will be carried out in the text (before or after the reading point or outside the text), which generates the “lost in hyperspace” problem (Edwards and Hardman 1989). Finally, hyperlinks are embedded in the hypertext. Therefore, there is no clearly distinction between text constituents and navigation knowledge. In addition, by not explicitly modeling this knowledge, it is not reusable.","Different solutions have been proposed to address the problems mentioned. Some researchers (Danielson, 2002) have tried to mitigate the lost in hyperspace problem offering global maps where the reading point is clearly identified. Adaptive hypertext (Mathe and Chen, 1994; Brusilovsky, 1996) relying on user model, proposes to modify the way the text is shown on the screen. Dynamic hypertext (Bodner and Chignell, 1999) computes the value of hyperlinks using several criteria such as text similarity or predefined relations. In this approach, a hyperlink is defined as a query returning a text node.","In some way, our conception of text navigation is related to the notion of computed query, but rather than taking into account criteria depending on the reader, the target is computed by exploiting linguistic information in texts. Moreover, the queries are not placed in texts but they are encapsulated as knowledge by a specific language (Sextant), which allows isolating the navigational knowledge to create knowledge bases. Both texts and queries (navigational knowledge) are interpreted by NaviTexte, which manages the interac-tions with a reader.","The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we discuss our approach to text navigation. The third section describes a navigational knowledge modeling language called Sextant. The fourth section details the text navigation system NaviTexte. The fifth section describes two applications of NaviTexte. Then we address the evaluation aspects of our approach. At last, conclusions are presented."]},{"title":"2 Defining text navigation","paragraphs":["Our conception of text navigation lies in the hypothesis that navigating through texts is the expression of a cognitive process related to specific knowledge (Minel, 2003; Couto and Minel, 2006). More precisely: we claim that a reader moves through texts applying some knowledge to exploit linguistic information present in texts (e.g. discursive markers). Moreover, we claim that this"]},{"title":"667","paragraphs":["knowledge may be articulated in a declarative way (cf. Sec. 3) relying on information in texts coded, on the one hand, by its structure, and, on the other hand, by specific annotations.","The main difference between classic hypertext and our conception of navigation lies on the status of texts and on the definition of navigational knowledge. In the case of hypertext, the visualiza-tion of a text is unique and navigational knowledge is encoded (embedded) in the text. In our approach, there are several ways to visualize a text (Couto, 2006), each way called text view, and for each view, different navigational knowledge may be defined. As a consequence, the navigation is not guided by the author, compared to hypertext navigation where s/he determines the links, but it is the result of an interpretation process made by the reader, relying on text structure and annotations.  Figure 1. Elements of text navigation.","Our conception of navigation (cf. Fig.1) relies on four elements: i) a text representation allowing linguistic specific phenomena and annotations (see Couto, 2006); ii) a language to model navigational knowledge (cf. Sec. 3); iii) an agent (an individual or a software) able to encode such knowledge; iv) a system, called NaviTexte, to interpret and apply knowledge to a specific text (cf. Sec. 4)."]},{"title":"3 Modeling navigational knowledge: the Sextant language","paragraphs":["To allow the unambiguous isolation of navigational knowledge we need a formal modeling language. We want to model the knowledge applied by a reader to move through texts, claiming that this knowledge exploits linguistic information present in texts. We do not say that this is the only way a reader may move through texts (e.g. strolling courses proposed by Géry (2002) is a counterexample), but we say that this is the kind of way than we are going to model. Different views of a text and the fact that each view contains specific indica-tions of the possible reading courses constitute the heart of the language. 3.1 Knowledge modules ant text views A text view may be a full view or a partial view focused in some specific phenomena present in the text (for example a view of all discourse referents). The constituent elements of a view are formalized in a view description, which contains the type of view, its parameters, the creation constraints (i.e. conditions to verify by the TU of the view) and the navigation operations (see next section). At present, four types of view have been defined: plain-text, tree, graph and temporality. The three firsts types are described in (Couto, 2006). The last one graphically represents temporality in texts and a complete description is in (Battistelli et al., 2006).","Several view descriptions may be gathered by the encoder in an entity called navigational knowledge module. The creation of a view may be conceptualized as the application of a view description to a specific text. Thus, the application of a module implies the creation of a set of text views. 3.2 The navigation operation The notion of computed query mentioned in section 1 is formalized in Sextant as a navigation operation, which links a source TU to a target TU. In classic hypertext systems one must explicitly connect the specific source to the specific target. For example, if a reader wants, for all definitions in a scientific paper, to move from one to the following one, several hyperlinks must be defined. In our approach we specify the source and the target using conditions. As a result, we can abstract, for example, the navigational knowledge that states “go from one definition to the following one”, being “definition” one of the TU annotations.","We can specify several conditions for the source and the target. We say that a navigation operation is available for a TU if this TU verifies the source conditions. A text navigation system should find the TU that verifies the target conditions. As several TU in the text may verify them, we need a way of disambiguation. This is done by the orientation parameter, which specifies the direction of the target search by using one of these options: first, last, forward(i), backward(i). First and last indicate that the search of the target is absolute: the TU to select"]},{"title":"668","paragraphs":["will be the first (respectively the last) TU that verify the conditions. Forward(i) and backward(i) indicate that the search is carried out relatively to the source (before or after) and indexed by the integer i. For example, “forward(3)” is interpreted as the third TU, after the source, of all the TU verifying the target conditions. 3.3 The conditions language The conditions language is an important component of Sextant ant it is composed by basic conditions, TU elements existence conditions, hierarchical conditions and non-hierarchical conditions.","Basic conditions concern TU’s attributes and annotations. For this kind of condition we use a notation close to the pattern notion. We define an operator called TU, having five operands that correspond to the following properties: type, number, level, annotations and string. With the three first operands and the fifth one, we denote constraints of equality, inequality, order, prefix, suffix and substring occurrence. The fourth operand is used to indicate the existence or non-existence of annotations, whether it is an annotation name, a value or a name-value pair.","For TU elements existence conditions, we define operators without operands to verify if a TU has annotations, string, title, parent and children.","For conditions dealing with hierarchical relationship between different TU, a set of unary operators have been defined, taking a basic condition as an argument. For example, the isAscendant operator verifies if a TU is the ascendant of another TU specified by a basic condition. The other operators are: isParent, isChild, isSibling, isDescendant, hasInTitle, isInTitle. We would like to draw attention to the fact that these operators allow to move through the hierarchy of TU from a starting TU (Couto, 2006).","Non-hierarchical conditions concern constructed units’ attributes and annotations as well as TU constitution.","All conditions may be combined using the classic logic operators OR, AND and NOT. Figure 2 presents an example of a language expression that formulates the following condition: TU of type “NP”, having an annotation of name “discourse referent”, for which it exists, among its descendants, a TU of type “paragraph” not having an annotation of name “semantic label” whose value is “conclusion”. TU(type = NP, *,*,{(discourse referent, *)},*) AND isDescendant(TU(type = paragraphe,*,*, {¬∃(semantic","label, conclusion)},*)) Figure 2. Conditions language example.","This condition means: noun phrases being a discourse referent that does not occur in a concluding paragraph."]},{"title":"4 NaviTexte: a text navigation system","paragraphs":["Several adaptive navigation systems have been proposed (Benyon and Murray, 1993; Kaplan et al., 1993; Boyle and Encarnacion, 1994; Brusilovsky and Pesin, 1994; Brusilovsky et al., 1996). While they are goal specific (learning, tutoring, reading, etc.), NaviTexte (Couto, 2006) is a generic text navigation system implementing our approach. This means that, depending on texts and knowledge modules, NaviTexte may be used, for example, as a learning, tutoring or reading system. Another important difference is that NaviTexte gives the user the liberty to navigate through the text following its own interests (the system propose - the reader chooses), while the mentioned systems try to maintain a user stuck to a given route (the user chooses - the system propose) (Höök and Svensson, 1999).","NaviTexte consists of sub-systems dealing with: text representation, navigational knowledge, visual representation and user interaction. The first one builds a text representation in memory from a text annotated manually or by dedicated software (Cunningham et al., 2002; Bilhaut et al., 2003). The second sub-system loads and compiles the knowledge modules. The result of this compilation is a graph of potential navigation courses that in practice is calculated as needed and stored in optimiza-tion data structures. The third sub-system calculates and displays different text views and the fourth one manages the user interaction.","The reader has the possibility to load and unload several texts and knowledge modules in the same work session. A complete description of NaviTexte may be found in (Couto, 2006)."]},{"title":"5 Applications of NaviTexte","paragraphs":["Building an application with NaviTexte requires a set of texts and navigational knowledge modules. Both text representation and Sextant language have XML implementations with dedicated editors to"]},{"title":"669","paragraphs":["use in case of a manual text annotation and a human knowledge encoder, respectively (cf. Fig.1).","So far four applications have been developed: alternative automatic summarization (Couto and Minel, 2006), the NaviLire project (Couto et al., 2005; Lunquist et al., 2006), re-reading Madame Bovary (Couto and Minel, 2006) and temporality in texts (Battistelli et al., 2006). We present two of them to illustrate NaviTexte’s potential. 5.1 NaviLire: a text linguistics application For the past thirty years, text linguistic researchers have worked on describing linguistic markers of textual coherence in order to bring out principles of text structuring (Lundquist, 1980). A set of concepts and models of textual interpretation has been worked out, including for example, anaphora, connectors, mental spaces, etc. In particular, these studies have shown that even for languages apparently close like French and Danish, texts are not organized in the same way (Lundquist, 2005). Consequently, text linguistics has important implica-tions in foreign language teaching, especially from a contrastive point of view, when language pairs are analyzed through texts used in authentic communication situations. It seems that the teaching of text linguistics contributes to sharpen the attention of students towards the building of well-formed texts and to stimulate their own text production. Therefore, a tool that allows the student to perceive text units that contribute to and maintain text coherence and to navigate between them, can be supposed to be an important didactic tool for teaching reading of foreign language texts, as well as producing written texts in the foreign language.","In the reading process, the student has to deal with two basic types of cognitive problems. First, s/he has to identify discourse referents in a text and choose the correct relations between the noun phrases that refer to them. Second, s/he has to identify the function and orientation intended by the sender. In the NaviLire project, navigation operations assisting the student are defined used Sextant and the texts are manually annotated by a text linguistics expert.","5.2 Navigation as an alternative to automatic summarization Many automatic summarization systems have been proposed (Mani, 2001; Minel, 2003). All these systems, based on the principle of phrase, proposition or group extraction, have been confronted to two problems intrinsic to the extraction procedure: i) the rupture of text cohesion, like in cases of anaphora where the corresponding discourse referent is missing; ii) the adaptation of the summary to reader specific needs. Actually, there are no completely satisfying solutions to these problems. An alternative approach is to consider the summarizing process as a reading course belonging to the reader (Crispino and Couto, 2004). Thereby, instead of extracting text fragments, we propose specific reading courses, whose specifications are based on propositions of (Endres-Niggermeyer et al., 1995) and on practice observations made in the frame of the automatic summarization system SERAPHIN evaluation (Minel et al., 1997) and the Filtext framework (Minel et al., 2001).","These works showed that professional summarizers are interested by discourse categories that they retrieve by exploiting text organization and lexical markers. They also showed that these professionals navigate through texts using heuristics acquired by experience. For example, they begin by reading the conclusion, and then they continue by looking, in the introduction, for nominal groups that occurred in the conclusion. This is the knowledge we have modeled with Sextant.","A specific reading course specifies, on the one hand, the kind of discursive category searched by a reader (e.g. a conclusion, a definition, an argument, a hypothesis, etc. 1",") and on the other hand, the course in which the segments that linguistically enunciate these categories (typically phrases) must be presented to the reader.","To carry out these reading courses, it is necessary to locate the discursive categories involved and mark them in the text. For this purpose, we used ContextO (Minel et al., 2001). A reading course example is presented in Fig. 3. The reading point is positioned over the first TU, a phrase in this case, annotated “Thematic Announcement”. When the user clicks over the TU, NaviTexte recommends her/him four navigation operations. The first one suggests bringing her/him to the following “Thematic Announcement”. The others ones suggest going to the first “Conclusion”, the first “Recapitulation” and the first “Argument”. For a given TU, each navigation operation available has three 1 For more details on different categories or on what empirical basis were these types derived, see (Minel et al., 2001)."]},{"title":"670","paragraphs":["possible states (and there is a visual semantic associated to states), depending if it has been executed (bold font and “*” prefix) or not (normal font and no prefix), and if it exists a TU target (clickable menu option) or not (non-clickable menu option). ","Figure 3. Automatic summarization courses.","","These kinds of suggestions (i.e. showing available navigation operations for a TU) are made all over the reading process. Consequently, along her/his reading continuum, the reader is assisted by the display of a specific set of signs, and there is no rupture of cohesion because s/he is able to continually see all the text (Battistelli and Minel, 2006)."]},{"title":"6 Evaluations","paragraphs":["There are few studies of adaptive navigation in hypermedia systems and most of them are focused in measures such as the number of visited nodes or the task completion time (Höök and Svensson, 1999). Are we interested in this kind of measures? Being NaviTexte a generic text navigation system, we think that what it has to be evaluated are the different applications. Each application requires pertinent measures. For example, in NaviLire, the number of nodes or the time factor seems less use-ful that the comprehension of the text analyzed.","So far, NaviLire has been put into practice on a small scale only, viz. in the teaching of French texts and text linguistics to Danish language students in the 4th year of Language and Communica-tion studies at the Copenhagen Business School. A pilot experiment was carried out in order to evaluate the effects of using the program.","The first results are based on forty answers, of which 35 concern questions about the content of the text. These results show that the navilistes (people using NaviLire) have a better comprehension performance than the papiristes (people using paper and pencil) for 14 questions, an identical performance for 16 other questions, and a poorer performance for 5 questions (cf. Table 1). #questions % Navilistes better than Papiristes 14 40 Navilistes the same as Papiristes 16 45,7 Navilistes worse than Papiristes 5 14,3","Total 35 100 Table 1. Comparison of navilistes and papiristes (Lundquist et al., 2006)","Evaluations of the alternative automatic summarization approach are ongoing. Our main problem is that automatic summarization evaluations, well known as difficult to carry out, typically compare to summaries made by professional summarizers (Mani, 2001; Minel, 2003). On the one hand, since we do not create a summary, we do not have an object to compare. On the other hand, since we have modeled the professional heuristics, we can-not compare the behavior of our system to theirs because it is exactly what it has been modeled."]},{"title":"7 Conclusions and future work","paragraphs":["We have presented our approach to text navigation conceived as a cognitive process that exploits linguistic information present in texts.
