Since the paraphrasing method is capable of clearly disambiguating the sense of an original phrase using the bilingual context of dependency relation, it would be possible to obtain interchangeable paraphrases under a given context. Also, we provide an advanced method to acquire generalized translation knowledge using the extracted paraphrases. We applied the method to acquire the generalized translation knowledge for Korean-English translation. Through experiments with parallel corpora of a Korean and English language pairs, we show that our paraphrasing method effectively extracts paraphrases with high precision, 94.3% and 84.6% respectively for Korean and English, and the translation knowledge extracted from the bilingual corpora could be generalized successfully using the paraphrases with the 12.5% compression ratio."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Approaches based on bilingual corpora are promis-ing for the automatic acquisition of translation knowledge. Phrase-based SMT(Statistical Machine Translation) models have advanced the state of the art in machine translation by expanding the basic unit of translation from words to phrases, which allows the local reordering of words and translation of multi-word expressions(Chiang, 2007) (Koehn et al., 2003) (Och and Ney, 2004).","However phrase-based SMT techniques suffer from data sparseness problems, that is; unreliable translation probabilities of low frequency phrases and low coverage in that many phrases encountered at run-time are not observed in the training data. An alternative for these problems is to utilize paraphrases. An unknown phrase can be replaced with its paraphrase that is already known. Moreover, we can smooth the phrase translation probability using the class of paraphrases.","On the other hand, EBMT or PBMT systems might translate a given sentence fast and robustly geared by sentence translation patterns or generalized transfer rules. Since it costs too much to construct the translation knowledge, they suffer from the problem of knowledge acquisition bottleneck.","In this study, we present a method of automatically extracting paraphrases from bilingual corpora. Furthermore, we introduce a new method for acquiring the generalized translation knowledge. The translation knowledge is a kind of verb sub-categorization pattern composed of bilingual dependency relations. We obtain the generalized translation knowledge by grouping the equivalent constituent phrases. The task of identifying the phrases equivalent to each other is defined as paraphrasing.","Our paraphrasing method utilizes bilingual corpora and alignment techniques in SMT. Unlike pre-"]},{"title":"327","paragraphs":["vious approaches which identify paraphrases using a phrase in another language as a pivot without context information (Bannard et al., 2005), or apply the distributional hypothesis to paths in dependency trees for inferring paraphrasing rules from monolingual corpora(Lin et al., 2001), we take the bilingual context of a bilingual dependency relation into account for disambiguating the sense of paraphrases. First, we create a large inventory of bilingual dependency relations and equate the pairs of dependency relations that are aligned with a single dependency relation in the other language as paraphrased dependency relations. Then, we extract the phrases sharing the same head (or modifier) phrase among the paraphrased dependency relations aligned with a unique dependency relation in the other language. We regard them as conceptually equivalent paraphrases. This work is based on the assumption of similar meaning when multiple phrases map onto a single foreign language phrase that is the converse of the assumption made in the word sense disambigua-tion work(Diab and Resnik, 2002). The two-step paraphrasing method allows us to increase the precision of the paraphrases by constraining the paraphrase candidates under the bilingual contexts of dependency relations.","In order to systematically acquire the generalized translation knowledge, our method includes follow-ing steps:","• Derive a bilingually parsed sentence through projecting the source language parse onto the word/phrase aligned target sentence.","• Extract bilingual dependency relations from the bilingual dependency parses.","• Acquire paraphrases by exploiting the extracted bilingual dependency relations.","• Generalize the bilingual dependency relations by substituting the phrases with their paraphrase class."]},{"title":"2 Extracting Translation Patterns","paragraphs":["In this section, we introduce a method to acquire translation knowledge like a bilingual dependency pattern using bilingual corpus. The bilingual dependency pattern is defined as an asymmetric binary relationship between a phrase called head and another phrase called modifier which are paired with their corresponding translations in the other language. In order to acquire the bilingual dependency relations, we do bilingual dependency parsing based on the word/phrase alignments and extract bilingual dependency relations by navigating the dependency parse tree.","2.1 Bilingual Dependency Parsing based on Word/Phrase Alignment Given an input sentence pair, a source language sentence is dependency parsed in a base phrase level and a target language sentence is chunked by a shallow parser. During the dependency parsing and the chunking, each sentence is also segmented into morphemes and we regard a morpheme as a word.","We make word alignments through the learning of IBM models by using the GIZA++ toolkit(Och and Ney, 2000): we learn the translation model toward IBM model 4, initiating translation iterations from IBM model 1 with intermediate HMM model iterations. For improving the word alignment, we use the word-classes that are trained from a monolingual corpus using the srilm toolkit(Stolcke, 2002). Then, we do phrase alignments based on the word alignments, which are consistent with the base phrase boundaries as well as the word alignments as (Hwang et al., 2007) did. A phrase is defined as a word sequence that is covered by a base phrase sequence, not by a single sub-tree in a syntactic parse tree.","After the word and the phrase alignments, we obtain bilingual dependency parses by sharing the dependency relations of a monolingual dependency parser among the aligned phrases. The bilingual dependency parsing is similar to the technique of bilingual parsing in a word level described in (Hwa et al., 2005)(Quirk et al., 2005). Our bilingual parsing in a phrase level has an advantage of being capable of reducing not only the parsing complexity but also the errors caused by structural differences between two languages, such like a Korean and English pairs1",".","For bilingual parsing between Korean and English, we use a Korean dependency parse on the","1","Since we regard that a phrase in a source language sentence is aligned with a target phrase if at least one word in a source phrase is aligned with the words in a target phrase, we robustly project the source phrases onto the target phrases."]},{"title":"328","paragraphs":["Figure 1: Illustration of Acquiring Bilingual Dependency Relations source language side as a pivot. Figure 1 shows an illustration of bilingual dependency parsing between Korean and English based on the word/phrase alignments. The dependency structure induced on the target language side is in some sense isomorphic to the structure of the source language. 2.2 Extracting Bilingual Dependency Patterns Starting from the head phrase of a given source language sentence, we extract bilingual dependency relations by traversing a bilingual dependency parse tree. A dependency relation is a binary relation between a head and modifier phrases. Each phrase is paired with its corresponding translation. For effectively using them during the decoding or the sentence generation, we attach an additional tag for in-dicating the order(e.g. Reverse or Forward) of target language phrases to the bilingual dependency relation. A dependency pattern refers to the bilingual dependency relation with the phrase order tag.","Figure 1(c) shows some examples of bilingual dependency patterns extracted from the bilingual dependency parse tree in Figure 1(b). In the example, Korean phrase ”sinae ga neun” aligned with the English phrase ”for downtown” modifies the phrase ”bus siganpyo” aligned with the English ”the bus timetable”. Through traversing the dependency parse trees, we acquire the bilingual dependency pattern <sinae ga neun:for downtown, bus siganpyo:the bus timetable;Reverse>.","If we apply the bilingual dependency pattern <sinae ga neun:for downtown, bus siganpyo:the bus timetable;Reverse> for machine translation of a given Korean expression ”sinae ga neun bus siganpyo”, we might generate an English phrase ”the bus timetable for downtown” by reversing the order of English head and modifier phrase corresponding to the Korean phrase ”sinae ga neun bus siganpyo”."]},{"title":"3 Acquisition of Paraphrases","paragraphs":["Paraphrasing is based on the assumption that if multiple Korean phrases are equivalent to each other, they can be translated into a single English phrase. But, the reverse is not always true. That is, even though a single phrase in a source language sentence maps onto multiple phrases in a foreign language sentence, the phrases might not be paraphrases. For example, two different Korean phrases, ”gyedan/{stairs,steps}” and ”baldongjak/steps”, might be translated into a single English phrase ”the steps”. But since the meaning of two Korean phrases is not equivalent to each other, the Korean phrases cannot be paraphrases. This implies that the sense of candidate paraphrases should be disambiguated depending on a given context.","For extracting the paraphrases of which sense is disambiguated under a given context, we give a strong constraint on paraphrases with bilingual context evidence of dependency relation denoted as R(x, y) :"]},{"title":"329","paragraphs":["Figure 2: Illustration of Paraphrasing based on Bilingual Dependency Relations","R(ei, ej) ≡ R(ka","i, ka","j ) and R(e ́","i, e ́ j) ≡ R(ka","́","i , ka","́","j ) (1)","⇒ R(ka","i, ka","j ) ≡ R(ka ́ i , ka","́","j ) where the relation of R(ei, ej) = R(eí, ej́) with the condition of ei = eí and ej = ej́.","R(ei, ej) ≡ R(ka","i, ka","j ) and R(ka","i, ka j ) ≡ R(ka","́","i , ka","́","j ) (2)","⇒ ka","i ≡ ka ́ i iff ka","j ≡ ka","́","j For the identification of paraphrases, we equate the different dependency relations aligned with a unique dependency relation in the other language and regard them as a set of paraphrased dependency relations (see eq.(1)). Under the constraint of the paraphrased dependency relations, we again try to acquire paraphrases at a phrase level. That is, we extract the phrases sharing the same head/modifier phrase in paraphrased dependency relations as a phrase paraphrase under a given bilingual dependency context (see eq.(2)).","Figure 2 shows some examples of paraphrased dependency relations and paraphrases. In Figure 2 (a), the Korean dependency relations <bus siganpyo, sinae ga neun>,<bus seukejul, sinae ga neun> and <bus seukejul, sinae banghyang> mapped onto the English relation <the bus timetable, for downtown> are the paraphrases. Under the condition of paraphrased dependency relations, the phrases, ”bus seukejul” and ”bus siganpyo” modified by the same phrase ”sinae ga neun” are extracted as paraphrases. In the same way, the set of modifier phrases, p1={”sinae banghyang”, ”sinae ga neun”} is acquired as a paraphrase set. For English, we obtain the set of paraphrases, p3={”the bus timetable”, ”the bus schedule”} as we did for Korean.","The induced set of paraphrases can be applied to dependency relations to extend the set through higher inference as in Figure 2(b). We replace a phrase, which is a part of a bilingual dependency relation and a member of a paraphrase set with the representative phrase of the paraphrase set. And we repeatedly apply the paraphrase extraction algorithm to the bilingual dependency relations of which a part is replaced with the previously acquired paraphrase set. Finally, we can acquire new paraphrase sets such as p4 and p5."]},{"title":"4 Generalizing Translation Patterns","paragraphs":["The acquired paraphrases can be utilized for various NLP applications.

We used 152,175 sentences in parallel corpus for training and 10,146 sentences for test. The Korean sentences were automatically dependency parsed by in-house dependency parser and the English sentences were chunked by in-house shallow parser.","Through experiments, we investigated the accuracy of the acquired paraphrases, and the compression ratio of the generalized translation patterns compared to the raw translation patterns. Moreover, we show the strength of utilizing bilingual context information in the acquisition of paraphrases with the comparison to the previous approach. 5.1 Accuracy of the Acquired Paraphrases Through the alignments and bilingual dependency parsing, we extracted 66,664 bilingual dependency relations. 24.15% of Korean phrases and 21.8% of English phrases are paraphrased with more than two phrases under a given bilingual dependency context. The statistics of Korean and English paraphrases based on bilingual dependency relations is shown in Table 1.","Especially, the paraphrasing ratio of the Korean head phrases, 28.63% is higher than that of the English heads,22.6%. Many of the Korean head phrases are verb phrases that reflects the honorific and inflectional characteristics of Korean language. We might expect that the problems caused by various honorific expressions can be resolved with the paraphrases such like {”ga r geoyeyo”, ”ga gessseupnida”}.","For evaluating the accuracy of the acquired paraphrases, we randomly selected 100 sets of paraphrases for Korean and English phrase respectively. Because the accuracy of paraphrases can vary depending on context, we selected the dependency relations that contain a phrase in a paraphrase set from the test set. And we generated the dependency relations by substituting the phrase by the other paraphrases. Accuracy was judged by two native speakers for each language. We measured the percentage of completely interchangeable paraphrases under a given bilingual dependency context.","Table 1 shows the performance of the paraphrases depending on their bilingual context. The accuracy of Korean and English paraphrases are 94.6% and 84.6% respectively. Korean paraphrases are more accurate than English paraphrases.
