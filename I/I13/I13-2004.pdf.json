First, Arabic is morphologically rich, which increases the likelihood of mismatch between words used in queries and words in documents. Much work has been done on addressing this issue in the context of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), primarily using different methods of stemming and query reformulation (Al-Kharashi and Evens, 1999; Darwish et al., 2005; Habash et al., 2006; Larkey et al., 2007).1","Secondly, the Arabic-speaking world displays diglossia, meaning that a standard language, MSA, co-exists with dialects, such as Egyptian Arabic (EGY). The dialects differ from MSA in many dimensions, which limits the effectiveness of using MSA tools to handle the dialects. Relevant to IR are lexical and morphological differences. Lexically, different words may be used to","1","For more information on Arabic natural language processing issues, see (Habash, 2010).

The retrieval of dialectal Arabic text has recently become necessary due to the increase of dialectal content on social media that is not “curated” (i.e., not chosen or edited by professionals). Our tool, DIRA (Dialectal [Arabic] Information Retrieval Assistant), is a query expansion tool that generates search terms, comprising both lexical and morphological variants, in MSA and EGY when provided with queries in English or MSA. No stemming decisions are made as part of DIRA in order to allow its output to be usable by a variety of IR systems with different stemming decisions. While the problem of morphological richness in IR has been addressed before, our DIRA system is, to our knowledge, the only system that addresses the problem of dialectal variation.","In the next three sections, we discuss DIRA’s functionality, some of DIRA’s implementation details, and two use scenarios."]},{"title":"2 DIRA’s Functionality","paragraphs":["DIRA is designed to be used as a component in a cross-lingual information retrieval system (Gey and Oard, 2001). Its purpose is to allow English and Arabic speakers to search for MSA and dialectal content using English or MSA queries. For instance, teachers and language learners may use English queries in DIRA to search the web for sentences containing certain MSA or EGY inflected word forms. An Arabic speaker may use MSA queries in DIRA to search for online EGY content.","The interface accepts English or MSA lemmas (citation forms) as input. MSA lemmas can be undiacritized or (partially) diacritized. Depending on user choice, DIRA outputs a set of MSA or EGY inflected forms for each lemma. The expansions are scored and ranked based on their frequency of use in large MSA and EGY corpora. Advanced settings give the users of DIRA the ability to specify weights for different inflectional feature values such as singular number, imperfective aspect, masculine gender, etc. This allows the system to prefer certain feature values that may be used more often in certain types of content. For instance, 1st and 2nd person may be used more often than 3rd person in blog articles while the converse may be true for news related articles. The weight of specific feature-value pairs can also be set to zero, thus eliminating their corresponding inflected forms from the expanded query.","We demonstrate DIRA’s utility in a web application that uses Google search as the IR system. In this application, DIRA first translates (if needed) user queries (in English or MSA) and then morphologically expands the lemmas in the target language or dialect. Google’s boolean search operators are used to concatenate a user-selected sub-set of the generated search terms to build the final search query. This final search query is used to perform a Google search for related online material. The demo web application shows the generated search terms as well as the Google search results. See Figures 1 and 2.","The online demo is available at http://nlp.ldeo.columbia.edu/dira."]},{"title":"3 DIRA’s Implementation","paragraphs":["DIRA expansion consists of three stages: lemma translation, morphological generation, and output ranking. First, DIRA translates each input lemma into a set of target lemmas using a trilingual English-MSA-EGY dictionary containing about 70,000 entries (Diab et al., in preparation). Second, DIRA morphologically expands the target lemmas into sets of inflected word forms using a target-language morphological generator (Habash, 2007). For MSA, the generator uses the databases of the BAMA/SAMA morphological analyzer (Buckwalter, 2004; Graff et al., 2009). For EGY, it uses the databases of the CALIMA-ARZ analyzer (Habash et al., 2012a). Since the CALIMA-ARZ analyzer maps a set of common spelling variations to the conventional orthography we use for EGY (Habash et al., 2012b), in generation mode, different spelling variants are produced. This is a desirable feature as it allows us to match more terms. In order to speed up the expansion process, DIRA utilizes a lookup cache created from large MSA and EGY corpora and extended online with new generated forms. Third, DIRA ranks the expansions using a weighted combination of (a) lemma-feature probabilities estimated from large MSA and EGY annotated corpora, and (b) user-provided weights for various feature-value pairs.","The DIRA framework has been designed to be easily extended to other dialects. At a minimum, a dialectal-MSA-English dictionary and a databases for morphological generation are required. Addi-tional optional resources include corpora for the new dialects that can be used to estimate different probabilities. 14 Figure 1: Screenshot of the DIRA demo web application. In this example, the user entered the English query ‘see’ and requested that the translation and expansion target Egyptian Arabic."]},{"title":"4 Two Use Scenarios","paragraphs":["We discuss next two use scenarios. In the first scenario, a teacher of Arabic as a foreign language wishes to use real materials to teach the negation forms in Egyptian Arabic. This scenario is illustrated in Figure 1. She selects English as the input language and Egyptian Arabic as the output language. She chooses to search for the verb “see”. The system provides an English gloss for each lemma to help semantically distinguish different lemmas. The teacher can change the lemma choice, but she doesn’t because the first lemma is strongly dialectal. To see the available inflected forms for this lemma, she clicks on the plus sign next to the lemma. The online system proposes a maximum of five inflected forms per lemma. The first two are automatically selected by the system and both happen to express morphological negation. She additionally selects the third term, which is also negated.","As soon as the English search query is entered, the system immediatelty returns four lemmas, uses two inflected forms of the top-ranked lemma to construct the search query, and diisplays the results of the search with that seach query. The query and the results of the Google search are shown on the right hand side of the interface. As the user modifies the choice of lemma or inflected forms on the left-hand side of the interface, the query and search results are immediately updated to the right. In Figure 1, we see the search query is the disjunction of the three inflected forms our user selected.","In the second scenario, a native speaker of Arabic who may not know Egyptian Arabic wishes to conduct a search in Egyptian Arabic. This scenario is illustrated in Figure 2. He selects Standard Arabic as the input language and Egyptian Arabic as the output language.
