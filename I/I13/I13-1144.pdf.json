We show that orthographic preprocessing and morphological segmentation of Persian verbs in particular improves the translation quality of Persian-English by 1.9 BLEU points on a blind test set."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["In the context of statistical machine translation (SMT), the severity of the data sparsity problem, typically a result of limited parallel data, increases for languages with rich morphology such as Arabic, Czech and Turkish. The most common solu-tion, other than increasing the amount of parallel data, is to develop language-specific preprocessing and tokenization schemes that reduce the over-all vocabulary and increase the symmetry between source and target languages (Nießen and Ney, 2004; Lee, 2004; Oflazer and Durgar El-Kahlout, 2007; Stymne, 2012; Singh and Habash, 2012; Habash and Sadat, 2012; El Kholy and Habash, 2012). In this paper, we work with Persian, a morphologically rich language with limited parallel data. Furthermore, Persian’s standard orthography makes use of a combination of spaces and semi-spaces (zero-width non-joiners), which are often ignored or confused, leading to orthographic in-constancies and added sparsity. We address the orthographic challenge of inconsistent spacing with a supervised learning method which successfully recovers near all spacing errors. We also present a set of experiments for morphological segmentation to help improve Persian-to-English SMT. We show that the combination of orthographic cleanup and morphological segmentation for verbs in particular improves over a simple preprocessing baseline."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Much work has been done to address data sparsity in SMT employing a variety of methods such as morphological and orthographic processing (Nießen and Ney, 2004; Lee, 2004; Goldwater and McClosky, 2005; Oflazer and Durgar El-Kahlout, 2007; Stymne, 2012; Singh and Habash, 2012; Habash and Sadat, 2012; El Kholy and Habash, 2012), targeting specific out-of-vocabulary phenomena with name transliteration or spelling expansion (Habash, 2008; Hermjakob et al., 2008) or using comparable corpora (Prochasson and Fung, 2011). Our approach falls in the class of orthographic and morphological preprocessing.","Previous research on Persian SMT is rather limited despite some early efforts (Amtrup et al., 2000). A few parallel corpora have been released, such as (Pilevar et al., 2011; Farajian, 2011). We conduct our research on an unreleased Persian-English parallel corpus (El Kholy et al., 2013a; El Kholy et al., 2013b).","In terms of preprocessing efforts, Kathol and Zheng (2008) use unsupervised Persian morpheme segmentation. Other attempts to improve Persian SMT use syntactic reordering (Gupta et al., 2012; Matusov and Köprü, 2010) and rule-based post editing (Mohaghegh et al., 2012). El Kholy et al. (2013a) and El Kholy et al. (2013b) also address resource limitation for Persian-Arabic SMT by pivoting on English.","Our approach is similar to Kathol and Zheng (2008), except that we do not use unsupervised learning methods for segmenting morphemes and we explore POS-specific processing instead of segmenting all words. We make extensive use of available resources for Persian morphology such as the Persian dependency treebank (Rasooli et al., 2013), the Persian verb analyzer tool (Rasooli et al., 2011a), the Persian verb valency lexicon (Rasooli et al., 2011c), and the PerStem Persian segmenter (Jadidinejad et al., 2010). 1047"]},{"title":"3 Persian Orthography and Morphology 3.1 Orthography","paragraphs":["Persian is written with the Perso-Arabic script. Unlike Arabic, some Persian words have inter-word zero-width non-joiner spaces (or semi-spaces). Many writers incorrectly write the semi-spaces as regular spaces (Shamsfard et al., 2010). This causes data inconsistency and some word-sense ambiguity, e.g., if the word"]},{"title":"AJ @—AK","paragraphs":["nAm ĀšnA1","‘reputed’ (adjective) is written with regular spaces, its meaning becomes ‘the familiar name’. While humans may be able to recover, typical natural language processing tools will fail since they expect standard Persian spelling. 3.2 Morphology Persian has a heavily suffixing affixational morphology with no expression of grammatical gender (Amtrup et al., 2000). We give a brief descrip-tion of Persian adjectives, nouns and verbs and compare to English. Adjectives Persian adjectives have a limited in-flection space: they may be simple, comparative or superlative. In comparative and superlative forms (except for Arabic loan words), a suffix attaches to the adjective:"]},{"title":"QK","paragraphs":["+ + tar2","‘+er’ for comparative","and"]},{"title":"ÆKQK","paragraphs":["+ + taryn ‘+est’ for superlative adjectives. English uses both suffixes (‘+er/+est’) and multi-word construction with ‘more/most’, in addition to some irregular cases such as ‘good’, ‘better’, and ‘best’. As such, it might be hard to define a consistent preprocessing scheme for adjectives in Persian with respect to English. Nouns Nouns are generally similar to English. For example, like English, a suffix marks plural number: mostly"]},{"title":"Ao","paragraphs":["+ + hA and sometimes"]},{"title":"@","paragraphs":["+ +An. Exceptions include Arabic broken plural loan words.

In Persian noun phrases consisting of a noun followed by one or more adjectives, the indefinite suffix attaches to the last adjective. Verbs A verb in Persian may be inflected in different combinations for tense, mood, aspect, voice and person. There are many interesting 1","We use the Habash-Soudi-Buckwalter Arabic transliteration (Habash et al., 2007) in the figures with extensions for Persian as suggested by Habash (2010). We show semi-spaces with underscore character. 2","Suffixes that require a semi-space are marked in the transliteration with an underscore. phenomena in Persian verbs, e.g. the past tense stem is used with another auxiliary verb to create the future form. When an auxiliary verb is used, prefixes attach to the auxiliary verb instead of the root. The negative marker (+ n+) ‘not’ and the object pronouns are attached to the verbs, leading to more than 100 verb conjugated forms (Rasooli et al., 2011b). For example, the verb "]},{"title":"Y K@æ kø","paragraphs":["nmy xwAndmš can be tokenized to n+ my+ xwAnd +m +š ‘I was not reading it’ [lit. ‘not+ was(continous)+ read(past) +I +it’ ]. Persian is a pro-drop language; almost half of the verbs in the Persian dependency treebank do not have an explicit subject (Rasooli et al., 2013). By comparison, English has a much simpler verbal morphology with explicit subject realization. This suggests that tokenizing Persian verbs may be helpful to Persian-English SMT in that it reduces sparsity and increases symmetry with English."]},{"title":"4 Space Correction","paragraphs":["In standard Persian orthography, semi-space characters show inter-word boundaries. Around 8% of all tokens in Persian dependency treebank have semi-spaces (Rasooli et al., 2013). However, in real Persian text, many of these semi-spaces are written as regular space. Although semi-space restoration may actually increase sparsity by creating more compounded forms of words, it is an important step to allow the use of Persian morphological resources that expect their presence.","In order to improve the quality of spacing in Persian texts, we use a language-modeling approach to correct spacing errors. The approach relies on the existence of a lexicon of semi-spaced words. The lexicon provides a mapping model from the regular-spaced versions of the words to their correct semi-spaced version. Starting with a sentence, we identify all sequences of regularly spaced words that can be mapped to semi-spaced versions. An expanded lattice version of the sentence including both forms is then decoded with a language model to select the path with the highest probability.","In terms of resources, we use the Peykare corpus (Bijankhan et al., 2011) and Persian dependency treebank (Rasooli et al., 2013) to create the semi-space lexicon and language model. The training data consists of about 398 thousand sentences and 89 million tokens (12 million types). To construct the lexicon, we extract all words with semi-spaces in the training data. We further extend the lexicon to cover known semi-space inflections for seen words, such as plural suffixes in nouns, 1048 superlative and comparative suffixes in adjectives and prefixing continuos markers in verbs. The language model is a trigram model with back-off.","We use the development part of the Persian dependency treebank for tuning the n-gram model. On the test part of the Persian dependency treebank, we replace every semi-space with regular space and try to predict the semi-spaces with our model. The baseline accuracy (of having no semi-spaces) on the test set is 92.2%. Our system’s accuracy is 99.43%. The precision, recall and F-score of producing semi-spaces are 93.11%, 99.98% and 96.42%, respectively. The recall of our approach is almost perfect, but the precision is not as good, suggesting that we over assign semi-space. There are two common errors in the results. The first problem is with the hard distinc-tion between adjectives and verbs, e.g.,"]},{"title":"ŁY H. @Q k","paragraphs":["xrAb šdh ‘dilapidated’ vs."]},{"title":"ŁY H. @Q k","paragraphs":["xrAb šdh ‘has destroyed’.

PerStem As a baseline method for morphological segmentation, we use the off-the-shelf Persian segmenter, PerStem (Jadidinejad et al., 2010).4 PerStem is a deterministic tool employing a set of regular expressions and rules for segmenting Persian words. PerStem separates most affixes for all parts-of-speech when applicable. PerStem has been used by other researchers for tokenization purposes (El Kholy et al., 2013a; El Kholy et al., 2013b). VerbStem As discussed in Section 3, Persian verbs are particularly problematic for Persian-English SMT because of their rich morphology and differences from English. We experiment with targeting Persian verbs for segmentation. To identify which words are verbs, we use a simple maximum likelihood POS tagging model built on the","3","Peykare is not actually written with semi-spaces. However, each word unit (consisting of one or more tokens) is written on one line and it is almost straightforward to standardize the corpus and add the semi-spaces.

Figure 1 compares three versions of the same sentence processed in different methods.","We use a Persian-English parallel corpus consisting of about 160 thousand sentences and 3.7 million words for translation model training (El Kholy et al., 2013a; El Kholy et al., 2013b). Word alignment is done using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003). For language modeling, we use the English Gigaword corpus with 5-gram LM implemented with the KenLM toolkit (Heafield, 2011). All experiments are conducted using the Moses phrase-based SMT system (Koehn et al., 2007) with a maximum phrase length of 8. The decoding weight optimization uses a set of 1,000 sentences extracted randomly from the parallel corpus. We use only one English reference for tuning.

Results and Discussion The results of SMT experiments on the dev set are shown in Table 1. VerbStem is our best system. Simply replacing all spaces (Raw-RS) does rather well and is plausibly the strongest simplest baseline we can compare to. PerStem and Clean-SS underperform the baseline. Clean-SS is the worst system (as expected since it increases sparsity), but it is necessary as a step for VerbStem. The improvement in VerbStem is possibly the result of reduced sparsity and increased symmetry between English and Persian. Verb segmentation makes a lot of information explicit, such as negation, subject pronoun (especially since Persian as a pro-drop language) and object pronoun.","We apply VerbStem to the blind test set and compare it to Raw-RS. Table 2 shows the blind test results using BLEU-4 (Papineni et al., 2002), METEOR (Lavie and Agarwal, 2007) and TER (Snover et al., 2006). VerbStem produces a higher BLEU score improvement over the Raw-RS baseline on the blind test compared to the dev set. This may suggest that our dev set is easier in general. Although our best system does well in Figure 1, the best result still suffers from suboptimal word order. The position of the verb in Persian (as an SOV language) is very problematic when translat-ing to English (an SVO language) especially for long sentences."]},{"title":"7 Conclusion and Future Directions","paragraphs":["Our experiments show that segmenting Persian verbs improves translation quality. However, the translation output of all current systems in this paper suffer from word order problems. In the future, we plan to investigate how to improve word order in the translation output using a variety of techniques such as hierarchical phrase-based models (Chiang, 2005; Kathol and Zheng, 2008; Cohn and Haffari, 2013), or models employing parsers to be developed using the Persian dependency treebank (Collins et al., 2005; Elming and Habash, 2009; Carpuat et al., 2010).
