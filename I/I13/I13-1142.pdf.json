Our evaluation both from intrinsic and extrinsic perspective shows that adding specialized syntactic and coreference-related features leads to an improvement in translation quality."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Machine Translation (MT) is an extremely broad task and can be decomposed along various directions. One of them lies in using specialized translation models (TMs) for certain types of language expressions. For instance, different types of named entities often receive specialized treatment in real translation systems. This paper deals with introducing specialized TMs for two types of pronouns: the pronoun it and reflexive pronouns. The models are integrated into an English-Czech syntax-based MT framework.","Several works have previously focused on translating pronouns. The linguistic study of Morin (2009) investigated the translation of pronouns, proper names and kinship terms from Indonesian into English. Onderková (2010) has conducted a corpus-based research on possesive pronouns in Czech and English, focusing especially on their use with parts of the human body.","From the perspective of MT, translating personal pronouns from English to morphologically richer languages, such as French (Le Nagard and Koehn, 2010), German (Hardmeier and Federico, 2010) and Czech (Guillou, 2012) has recently aroused higher interest. In these languages, one usually has to ensure agreement in gender and number between the pronoun and its direct antecedent, which requires a coreference resolver to be involved.","In this work, we make use of the English-to-Czech translation implemented within the TectoMT system ( Žabokrtský et al., 2008). In contrast to the phrase-based approach (Koehn et al., 2003), TectoMT performs a tree-to-tree machine translation. An input English sentence is first analyzed into its deep-syntactic representation, which is subsequently transferred into Czech. The pipeline ends with generating a surface form of the Czech translation from its deep representation.","The deep syntactic representation of a sentence in TectoMT follows the Prague tectogrammatics theory (Sgall, 1967; Sgall et al., 1986). It is a dependency tree whose nodes correspond to content words. Personal pronouns missing on the surface are reconstructed in special nodes. All nodes are assigned semantic roles and coreference relations are annotated.","Originally, translation of both it and reflexive pronouns was treated by rules in TectoMT. The English deep representation of it was translated as to and a simple heuristics determined if it is be-ing expressed on the surface. Similarly, reflexives were always translated as se. This paper evaluates the translation quality reached using specialized classifiers for these pronouns. Unlike the related work on pronouns in MT, we focus on improving the lexical choice, not tuning other components that affect generating a particular surface form (e.g. coreference resolution)."]},{"title":"2 Linguistic analysis","paragraphs":["We started with an analysis of how the pronouns under investigation are translated1","in two Czech-English parallel treebanks – Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank 2.0 (Hajič et al., 2011, PCEDT) and CzEng 1.0 (Bojar et al., 2012).","1","Note that besides the means mentioned below, there are other ways of translating these pronouns. However, in most cases they can be replaced by one of the variants listed with no harm to the quality of the Czech output. 1037 E n g l i s","h C z e c h emphasis on object object affected by its own action reflexive pronoun se pronoun sám both sám and se adjective samotný coreferential with VP or a segment demonstrative pronoun to coreferential with NP personal pronoun","pleonastic nothing, structure changes [PersPron] [To] [Null] [Samotny] [Sam] [Se] [SamSe]"]},{"title":"It Reflexives","paragraphs":["Figure 1: The mapping of the types of English it (top) and reflexive pronouns (bottom) to their Czech counterparts. 2.1 Translating it from English to Czech In English, three coarse-grained types of it are traditionally distinguished: referential it pointing to a noun phrase in the preceding or following context, anaphoric it referring to a verbal phrase or a larger discourse segment, and non-referential pleonastic it, whose presence is imposed only by the syntactic rules of English.","There are three prevailing ways of translating it into Czech, also three different ways prevail. Personal pronouns or zero forms2",", whose gender and number are determined by their antecedent, are the most frequent variant (referred to as the PersPron class in the following). Another way is using the Czech demonstrative pronoun to, which is a neuter singular form of the pronoun ten (To class). The third option results in fact no lexical counterpart in the Czech translation, the English and Czech sentences thus having a different syntactic structure (Null class).","The mapping between English and Czech types is shown in Figure 1. The To class is particularly overloaded. Even if a given occurrence of it corefers with a noun phrase, translating it to to does not require identifying the antecedent since the gender and number of to are always fixed (see Example 1).","(1) Some investors say Friday’s sell-off was a good thing. “It was a healthy cleansing,” says Michael Holland. Někteřı́ investoři řı́kajı́, že pátečnı́ výprodej byla dobrá věc. “Byla to zdravá očista,” řı́ká Michael Holland. 2 Czech is a pro-drop language.","2.2 Translating reflexive pronouns from English to Czech According to the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English,3","reflexive pronouns are typically used in two scenarios: to show that the object is affected by its own action and to emphasize that the utterance relates to one particular thing, person etc. (see Example 2).","(2) The Gambia’s President himself participated in the hunt last year.","The most usual Czech counterparts of English reflexives comprise the Czech reflexive pronoun se (Se class), the adjective samotný (Samotny class) and the pronoun sám (Sam class), all in various morphological forms. Moreover, sám often appears with se to emphasize that the action affecting the object is performed by the object itself (SamSe class). Figure 1 illustrates the correspondence between English usages and Czech expressions."]},{"title":"3 Data","paragraphs":["To train and intrinsically evaluate TMs for it and English reflexives, we have extracted data from the entire PCEDT and 11 sections of CzEng. Both treebanks follow the annotation style based on the Prague tectogrammatics theory (Sgall, 1967; Sgall et al., 1986). While PCEDT consists of 50,000 sentence pairs annotated mostly manually, the annotation of CzEng with 15 million parallel sentences is entirely automatic. Both treebanks have been provided with a fully automatic alignment of Czech and English nodes (Mareček et al., 2008), which is, however, prone to errors for it and its Czech counterparts. Since they are pronouns, they can replace a wide range of content words and their meaning is inferred mainly from the context. The situation is better for verbs as their usual parents in dependency trees: since they carry meaning in a greater extent, their automatic alignment is of a higher quality.","We took advantage of this property and the gold annotation of semantic roles in PCEDT, obtaining Czech translations as the argument of the Czech verb aligned with the English parent verb that fills the same semantic role as the given it. Using this approach, we succeeded in reaching the Czech counterpart in more than 60% of instances. The rest had to be done manually.","3","http://www.ldoceonline.com 1038 It Train Test Reflexives Train Test PCEDT sections 00–19 20–21 CzEng sections 00–09 98 PersPron 576 322 Se 6,305 652 To 231 138 Sam 2,271 205 Null 133 83 SamSe 1,361 129","Samotny 804 89 Total 940 543 Total 10,741 1,075 Table 1: Distribution of classes in the data sets.","Czech counterparts of English reflexive pronouns have been collected directly from the alignment in CzEng, ignoring the cases where the aligned Czech word does not fall in one of the classes mentioned in Section 2.2.","The overall statistics of the train and the test set are shown in Table 1. The disproportion of training instances for it results from the manual annotation of classes, which could not be completely finished due to time reasons. In order to maintain the overall distribution, we also had to limit the number of automatically annotated classes.","Given the observation (see Section 2), we designed features to differentiate between the ways it and reflexives are translated. 3.1 Features for it The translation mapping in Figure 1 suggests that identifying the English type of it might be informative. We thus constructed a binary coreference-related feature based on the output of the system NADA (Bergsma and Yarowsky, 2011) giving an estimate of whether an instance of it is coreferential.","Some verbs are more likely to bind with it that refers to a longer utterance. Such it is relatively consistently translated as a demonstrative to. However, PCEDT is too small to be a sufficient sample from a distribution over lexical properties. Hence, we took advantage of CzEng and collected co-occurrence counts between a semantic role that the given it fills concatenated with a lemma of its verbal parent and a Czech counterpart having the same semantic role (denoted as csit). We filtered out all occurrences where csit was neither a personal pronoun nor to. For both possible values of csit a feature is constructed by looking up frequencies for a concrete occurrence in the co-occurrence counts collected on CzEng and quantized into 4-5 bins following the formula: bin(log(","count(semrole : parent ∧ csit) count(semrole : parent)count(csit) )). Linguistic analysis suggested including syntax-be itsubj","obj adj:compl v:to+inf v:that+fin be itsubj a) b) Figure 2: Examples of syntactic features capturing typical constructions with a verb be. oriented patterns related to the verb to be such as those shown in Figure 2. For instance, nominal predicates4","tend to be translated as to even if it is coreferential. On the other hand, an adjectival predicate followed by a subordinating clause in-troduced by the English connectives to or that usually indicates a pleonastic usage of it translated as a null subject. 3.2 Features for reflexive pronouns Here we focused on distinguishing between the two most frequent meanings (see Section 2.2). Ideally, the POS tag of the parent would be a sufficient feature because reflexives in the second meaning should depend on a noun. However, since we deal with automatically parsed trees we had to support the parent POS tag by the POS tag of the immediately preceding word. Moreover, another feature indicates if the preceding word is a noun and agrees with the pronoun in gender and number.","Furthermore, we observed that sám rarely appears in other case than nominative. Although this feature exploits the target side, we can use it since the case of the governing Czech noun is already known at the point when reflexives are translated.","Last but not least, the morpho-syntactic pattern (including a possible preposition) in which the reflexive pronoun appears is a valuable feature."]},{"title":"4 Experiments and Evaluation","paragraphs":["To mitigate a possible error caused by a wrong classifier choice, we built several models based on various Machine Learning classification methods including Maximum Entropy inplemented in the AI::MaxEntropy Perl library,5","logistic regression with one-against-all strategy from Vowpal Wabbit6","as well as decision trees, k-NN and SVM from Scikit-learn library (Pedregosa et al., 2011). 4 The verb to be has an object. 5 http://search.cpan.org/l̃aye/AI-MaxEntropy-0.20 6 http://hunch.net/ṽw 1039","It Reflexives","Train Test Train Test Baseline 60.70 59.30 58.70 60.65 AI::MaxEntropy 85.99 76.61 76.37 77.77 VW (passes=20, l2=10e-5) 89.99 76.43 76.98 77.77 sklearn:decision-trees 93.36 73.66 81.78 76.37 sklearn:k-NN (k=10) 82.51 73.30 77.64 76.74 sklearn:SVM (kernel=linear) 90.83 75.51 76.55 78.14 Table 2: Accuracy of both translation models on the training and test data.","We compare our results with a majority class baseline (PersPron and Se classes) in Table 2. The results show a 17% gain when our approach is used.","The specialized models have been integrated in the TectoMT system and extrinsically evaluated on the English-Czech test set for the WMT 2011 Translation Task (Callison-Burch et al., 2011). 7 This data set contains 3,003 English sentences with one Czech reference translation, out of which 430 contain at least one occurrence of it and 52 contain a reflexive pronoun.","The new approach was compared to the original TectoMT rule-based pronoun handling heuristics (see Section 1). The shift from the original settings to the new translation models results in 166 changed sentences with it and 17 changed sentences with English reflexives. In terms of BLEU score, we observe a marginal drop from 0.1404 to 0.1403 using the new approach. However, BLEU may be too coarse for this kind of experiment.","In order to give a more realistic view, we carried out a manual evaluation. All 17 modified sentences for reflexives and 50 randomly sampled changed sentences containing it were presented to one annotator who assessed which of the two systems gave a better translation. Table 3 shows that improved sentences dominate in both cases. Over-all, the improved sentences account for around 8.5% of all sentences with it and 23% sentences containing a reflexive pronoun."]},{"title":"5 Discussion","paragraphs":["Looking into the types of improvements and errors in the manually evaluated sentences, we have found that the new model for it opted for a different translation only in cases where the original system decided to express to on the surface.

It took advantage mostly of the syntax-based features in the former case and the coreference-related feature in the latter.","Regarding the reflexive pronouns the pronoun was used in its emphasizing meaning in all but two altered sentences. This accords with the design of features, which are mainly targeted at revealing this usage of reflexives. Moreover, the feature in-dicating if a Czech noun is in nominative case has proved to be particularly useful, correctly driving the lexical choice between sám and samotný. The majority of errors stem from incorrect activation of syntactic features due to parsing and POS tag-ging errors."]},{"title":"6 Conclusions","paragraphs":["In this work, we presented specialized translation models for two types of English pronouns: it and reflexives. Integrating them into an English-Czech syntax-based MT system TectoMT we succeeded in improving the concerned sentences measured by human evaluation.","Generally, it is intractable to design a specific feature set for every word. However, this work shows on two examples that the correct translation of some words depends on many linguistic aspects, e.g. syntax and coreference and that is worth taking these aspects into account."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This work has been supported by the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic (grants P406/12/0658 and P406/2010/0875), the grant GAUK 4226/2011 and EU FP7 project Khresmoi (contract no. 257528).
