However, it has been subjected to lacking a proper evaluation metric for a long time. The natural metric for IME is user experience, which is a rather vague goal for research purpose. We propose a novel approach of quantifying user experience by using keystroke count and then correspondingly develop a framework of IME evaluation, which is fast and accu-rate. With the underlying linguistic background, the proposed evaluation framework can properly model the user behavior as Chinese is input through English keyboard. It is helpful to point out a way to improve the current Chinese IME performance. 1"]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Chinese IME is a software solution that enables user to input Chinese into computer with a reasonable size keyboard, by mapping Chinese characters into English letter combinations. Nowadays the majority of Chinese IMEs are pinyin based. Pinyin is originally designed as the phonetic symbol of a Chinese character, using Latin letters as its syllable notation. For example, the pinyin of the Chinese character “爱”(love) is “ài”.2","There are only less","∗","This work was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No.60903119, Grant No.61170114, and Grant No.61272248), and the National Basic Research Program of China (Grant No.2009CB320901 and Grant No.2013CB329401).","†","Corresponding author","1","KySS is the abbreviation for: KeyStroke Score","2","Chinese is a language with tone, but for nearly all pinyin IMEs, tone marks are omitted since it is inconvenient to input. than 500 pinyin syllables in standard modern Chinese, compared with over 6,000 commonly used Chinese characters, which leads to serious ambiguity for pinyin-to-character mapping. Other IMEs using various mapping scheme more or less share this same ambiguity problem, although some of them such as five-stroke IME3",", may have lower ambiguity but they are very difficult to learn. So at present pinyin IMEs are the most popular, we focus on them in this paper. Modern IMEs are sentence-based(Chen and Lee, 2000) to reduce the ambiguity, which means that the IME generates a character sequence upon a sequence of English letter inputs, e.g. pinyin syllables. This is a non-typical sequence labeling task, as English alphabet input is the original sequence and Chinese characters are target labels. IMEs usually utilize beam search incorporated with language model initialized by (Chen and Lee, 2000), then later extended by (Liu and Wang, 2002), (Lee, 2003), and (Zhang, 2007). There are also various methods using conventional sequence labeling techniques such as: support vector machine (Jiang et al., 2007), maximum entropy model (Wang et al., 2006), conditional random field model (Li et al., 2009) and machine translation (Yang et al., 2012a), etc. IME also attracts attention from major software and internet corporations, Microsoft4",", Google5","and many others developed their own IME products.","Note that “sentence” from an IME’s viewpoint is not the linguistic “sentence”. It is actually the Max Input Unit (MIU), the longest consecutive Chinese character sequence inside a sentence. For example, the sentence “第51届ACL年会即将召开” (The 51st annual meeting of ACL will open soon) 3 http://www.wangma.com.cn/ 4 http://bing.msn.cn/pinyin/ 5 http://www.google.com/intl/zh-CN/ime/pinyin/ 1195 has 3 MIUs: “第”, “届” and “年会即将召开”. For more precise expression, we will use “MIU” or “character sequence” throughout this paper as far as possible, instead of “sentence”.","Chinese is used by the largest population in the world, and IME is necessary for all Chinese computer users. However according to our best knowledge there are no comprehensive and quantified metrics for evaluating its performance. The existing evaluation metrics for IME (Chen and Lee, 2000; Yang et al., 2012a) only focus on the character sequence generation, by adopting typical sequence labeling measurements such as character-wise precision and recall, sequence error rate and so on. However IME is an application deeply in-volving human-computer interaction, user behavior ought to be taken into account for IME evaluation(Zheng et al., 2011). Rather than merely judging the performance of character sequence generation, a good IME evaluation system should properly model the user behavior.","Compared with other typical evaluation systems for NLP tasks, such as the well known machine translation evaluation system BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and the summarization evaluation system ROUGE (Lin, 2004), they measure the closeness of machine translation/summarization and human results, using some n-gram co-occurrence statistics (Lin and Hovy, 2003), while our IME evaluation framework tries to quantify user experience during inputting Chinese. Existing keystroke based methods mostly focus on the keystroke dura-tion and frequency pattern for biometric authenticate system security (Giot et al., 2009; El-Abed et al., 2012), instead of user experience modeling."]},{"title":"2 The Evaluation System","paragraphs":["2.1 The User-IME Interaction As introduced in Section 1, nearly all IMEs nowadays are “sentence based”. However, IME does not always succeed to exactly generate the entire expected character sequence for an input letter sequence. Thus IMEs output a list of all possible candidate character sequences corresponding to the input sequence.","Suppose that the input pinyin sequence is S1S2...Sn where Si is a pinyin syllable with in-dex i and n is number of pinyin syllables. The best character sequence has the same length as the input pinyin sequence, and is always in the first position of the list. Other output character sequences in the candidate list is given according to S1S2...Sn′ where n′","is usually less than n. As n is usually large, it is unlikely that the best character sequence is completely correct, but for those shorter character sequences in the candidate list, user can always find that one of them may partially match his/her input target. If user has selected a candidate from the list to partially complete the input, for example, the character sequence for S1S2...Sj has been determined by this selection, then IME will dynamically output a new list of character sequences for the rest pinyin sequence Sj+1Sj+2...Sn. User can continue to make the selection from the list until the desired input is accomplished. For a candidate, we define its position in candidate list as its rank, r. The best character sequence has r = 0. The candidate at the j-th position in the list has r = j − 1.","There are often dozens of candidates for a pinyin sequence, as the space of input interface is limited, candidates have to be shown in multiple pages. A page is part of the candidate list. User can make the choice from the page by pressing candidate ID 1, 2, . . . , m in the current page. If the expected word/character does not occur in the current page, user has to press a “next-page”6","key to see more candidates.","Suppose that one wants to input the MIU “年 会即将召开”(The annual meeting will open soon) by typing the pinyin sequence “nian hui ji jiang zhao kai”, a typical IME prompt window is like Figure 1a.","As shown in Figure 1a, the best character sequence is not completely correct for the input purpose. User has to pick up the 2nd candidate “年会”(annual meeting). Then the IME will update the window as Figure 1b. User can select the 3rd candidate “即将”(soon). The IME will update for the rest as shown in Figure 1c. The first candidate exactly completes the expected character sequence.","In the real world, user behavior is very difficult to predict. In order to alleviate the difficulty of user behavior modeling, an abstract assumption for user-IME interaction is proposed: all user input actions are only restricted to pinyin sequence input, candidate ID selection and page turning. In this manner, user inputs a sequence of pinyin then make a choice from the candidate list in the current page given by the IME, if the desired character se-6 Usually this “next-page” key is not the PageDown key,","but mapped to some more convenient keys such as “+” or “.”. 1196 nian hui ji jiang zhao kai 1.年会激将召开 2.年会 3.年 4.念 5.粘 (a) The first IME window 年会 ji jiang zhao kai 1.激将召开 2.激将 3.即将 4.即 5.及 (b) The second IME window 年会即将 zhao kai 1.召开 2.找 3.赵 4.照 5.招 (c) The third IME window Figure 1: IME windows for inputting an MIU quence is not presented in the current page, then user has to press “next-page” and goes on until the target is met.","Under this proposed user behavior model, user input is divided in to two parts: 1. a sequence of alphabet keys for pinyin and 2. a selection action sequence of “next-page” and candidate ID keys. The first part of inputting alphabet keys for different IMEs will be always the same, thus it can be ignored for evaluation metric. The second part would be the essential difference among different IMEs. We define the sequence of ranks of candidates as Rank Sequence, For an ideal rank sequence , it is always just {0}. For our previous example in this section, the actual rank sequence is {1, 2, 0}. 2.2 Evaluating IME To make use of the rank sequence, i.e. keystroke count, as the metric to evaluate an IME, we define a few terms as follows:","• L: It is the length of MIU in characters.","• P: It is the length of rank sequence. It measures how many parts the MIU is split into to accomplish the input. In the previous example, P = 3 for “年会”, “即将” and “召开”. In the ideal situation, P for any MIU is 1 since the exactly expected character sequence is rank at the top.","• R: It is the sum of all the elements in the rank sequence, i.e. the sum of ranks of candidates for each part. In our previous example, R = 1 + 2 + 0 = 3. For the ideal situation, R is always 0.","• RW : It is the total keystroke without alphabet keys, by using the weighted sum of rank sequence: RW = k−1 ∑ i=1 ω(ri) + 1. (1) The weight function ω(·) reflects the cost of pressing “next-page” and candidate ID keys. In the rest of this paper we will assume there are 5 candidates on each page which is the default setting for most existing IMEs. We also assume the keystroke cost of pressing numeric keys for candidate ID is 1 and the keystroke cost of pressing “next-page” is also 1, then the weight function is ω(r) = ⌊ r 5 ⌋ + 1. For example the 1st candidate on 3rd page has RW = 1 × 2 + 1 = 3. RW measures how many keys the user has to press i.e. how much effort the user has to make to accomplish inputting an MIU.","• KySS: It is the final evaluation score of an IME. Consider an evaluation corpus C with MIUs {m1, m2, . . . , mc}, for a certain IME, the i-th MIU mi has RW (i), then the KySS score for the actual IME on the corpus is defined as the ratio between the total RW for the ideal IME and the total RW given by the actual IME: KySS =","∑ mi∈C Rideal","W (i)","∑ mi∈C RW (i) (2) = ∥C∥","∑ mi∈C RW (i) . (3) For an ideal IME, we have KySS = 1. For actual IMEs, 0 < KySS < 1. An IME with higher KySS is supposed to performan better."]},{"title":"3 Analysis on IMEs","paragraphs":["3.1 Corpus To build a corpus for evaluation, we extract 100,000 sentences from China Daily corpus7",". We annotate it with pinyin sequence using the method in (Yang et al., 2012b). The corpus contains over 4 million characters, 87.6% of which are Chinese 7 http://www.icl.pku.edu.cn/icl_res/default_en.asp 1197 characters, other 12.4% are foreign letters, dig-its and punctuation.

The rate of successful character sequence generation decays linearly with the increment of L as shown in Figure 5.","It also can be seen from Figure 4 that nearly 50% of MIUs are between 7 and 26 characters long, but as shown in Figure 5 they suffer from the rate of successful character sequence generation less than 0.5, which will be our major concern later. 1198","3.2 Position Matters: How Character Sequence Generation Fails From our empirical observation over those cases in which IME fails to generate the completely correct MIU, we found something interesting. The histograms of P and R of MIUs with L = 10 are shown in Figure 6, note that only unsuccessful results are plotted in the figure.","The interesting point is that a peak appears at L/2 in the histograms, as is shown in dotted lines in Figure 6. All the cases that we observed with length ranging from 7 to 26 demonstrate this “error peak” property.","We extract MIUs, IME generated best character sequences and rank sequences of those cases. The underlying reason is discovered after a manual in-spection: in those best character sequences, the last error is at the rear of MIU. In such cases user has to select candidate words one by one until the end of the MIU.","For example, while inputting the MIU “大理 航站是个年轻的航站”(Dali airport is a new airport), the best character sequence generated by IME is “大力航展是个年轻的航展”(STRONG air show is a new air show). Its L = 11. The selected candidates are: “大理”(Dali), “航站”(airport), “是个”(is), “年轻”(new), “的”(meaningless function word), and “航站”; so P = 6. And the rank sequence is {2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1} so R = 7. So when errors occur at the rear of MIU, we have P ≈ NW , where NW is the number of words in MIU. For most of the real circumstances, those correctly generated words in the front part of MIU achieve a very high rank r, often the highest among candidates, i.e., r = 1 so R ≈ P ≈ NW . In sunpinyin, candidates except for the best character sequence are words queried from a internal dictionary. An important linguistic issue is that average length of Chinese words is about 1.8 characters, nearly two character long (Zhao et al., 2006). At last we obtain NW ≈ L/2, which explains the “error peak” at the middle position. 3.3 Improving IMEs with Evaluation Results We propose a method to make use of the “error peak” for better IME performance. Among all those MIUs with the “error peak” problem, we can see an annoying situation is that all words except for the last few ones are successfully generated. In order to correct one or two words, user has to select word by word all the way through the character sequence. To avoid unnecessary selection, the IME can cut the front part of the generated character sequence and make it an independent candidate so that user can accomplish inputting as many words in one selection as possible. We suggest five cutting policies as the following:","• Weakest: Cut at the position where the conditional probability is smallest.","• Mean, LtoR: Cut at the position where the probability is lower than the mean of conditional probabilities of the sequence, scanning from left to right.","• Mean, RtoL: Similar as previous but scanning from right to left.","• Halfway: Cut at exactly at the middle position.","• Fixed: Cut a fixed length sequence. We experiment on length from 1 to 10 and found the best length is 3.","The KySS for each policy is shown in Table 1. The baseline is the original algorithm used by sun-Policy KySS Baseline 27.67% Weakest 29.41% Mean, LtoR 29.21% Mean, RtoL 29.06% Halfway 30.71% Fixed-3 31.30% Table 1: KySS of each policy pinyin without any cutting. To our surprise, the dummy Fixed-3 and Halfway cutting performs best with a more than 10% boost over the baseline due to its robustness. The Fixed-3 and Halfway policy can always stably cut out a reasonable length of MIU. The problem with Mean, RtoL is that it is likely to cut at the end of MIU thus the head that it cuts out may still include errors. On the contrast, the Mean, LtoR policy tends to cut out too few words. And the Weakest policy is easy to fail because it often cuts a sequence with a low conditional probability but actually being correct."]},{"title":"4 Conclusion and Future Work","paragraphs":["In this paper, a novel evaluation framework for Chinese IME, KySS, is proposed by effectively modeling user behavior during Chinese input.
