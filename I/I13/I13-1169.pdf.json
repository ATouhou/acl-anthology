As previous attempts showed, accurate paraphrasing is challenging in an open vocabulary setting, so we propose the use of the closed word class of uncertainty cues. We demonstrate that these words are promising for text watermarking as they can be accurately disambiguated (from the non-cue uses of the same words) and their substitution with other cues has marginal impact to the meaning of the text."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["The goal of digital watermarking is to hide digital information (a secret marker) in an audio stream, image or text file. These markers are by design not perceivable while listening, watching or read-ing the data, but can be read with a tailor-made algorithm and can be used to authenticate the data that carries it, or to identify its owner. We discuss the concept of a watermark and the process of embedding it in a media in more detail in Section 2. Text watermarking is a digital watermarking problem where the aim is to embed a secret message (a sequence of bits) in a text in order to make the actual text copy individually identifiable (Bergmair, 2007). That is, given a natural language source text (e.g. an ebook), the aim is to produce individual copies of the text by means of surface, syntactic or semantic manipulations. The individualized copies should preserve the readability and the meaning of the original text, i.e. the modifications should be undetectable to the readers.","The manipulation of the text can be performed on the surface or the content level. Surface manipulation affects the visual appearance of the text, as in white space modulation. In contrast, syntactic reordering looks e.g. for conjunctions and reorders the connected words or phrases. Finally, semantic manipulation, such as synonym substitution, takes a target word and replaces it with a contextually plausible synonym. Consider the following examples: He was bright and independent and proud. He was bright and independent and proud. (surface) He was independent and bright and proud. (syntactic) He was clever and independent and proud. (semantic)","In steganography, there is a natural tradeoff be-tween capacity (the length of the secret message that can be embedded in a cover medium) and precision (how well the manipulations preserve readability and meaning). Text watermarking is a precision- oriented application as it requires very high transformation quality, and relatively low capacity (recall) is acceptable as the goal is to make a relatively small number of changes in a text. Surface manipulations are typically very easy to spot, so those are not realistic alternatives, while syntactic and semantic methods are equally viable. From a practical perspective, the most reliable method should be used to embed the secret information. E.g. enumeration reordering is a relatively robust method, provided we have a good parser at hand to detect the conjoined units. On the other hand, if there is a reference in the near context, it can be more reliable to employ synonym substitution: He made offers to John and Mary. The latter accepted. He made offers to John and Mary. The latter agreed.","Here we investigate paraphrasing as a way to embed secret information in texts. An open vocabulary approach to synonym substitution could ensure rather high capacity. For example, Chang and Clark (2010b) suggest to identify one paraphrase position per sentence, thereby enabling the system to encode one bit per sentence, but they achieve 1188 original bitmap # after embedding # 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 Table 1: Example watermark. this at the cost of relatively low precision (around 70% even when using the information about the correct word sense). In contrast, we propose to use a closed word class – i.e. uncertainty cues – for paraphrasing. Semantically uncertain propositions are common in natural language: they either directly express something as uncertain (epistemic modality); assert the speaker’s hypotheses, beliefs; express events that are unconfirmed or under investigation or conditional to other events, etc. These linguistic devices are lexical in nature, i.e. they are triggered by the use of specific key-words in the sentence, which we refer to as uncertainty cues. These words are good targets for paraphrasing since – when replaced by another uncertainty cue with similar properties (part of speech and meaning) – their substitution does not change the meaning of the sentence: the main proposition (”who does what, when and where”) remains the same and the proposition stays uncertain:","The legislative body may change.","The legislative body might change.","That is, in our approach a classifier first detects uncertainty cues in a text. Then, those disambiguated cues that are both detected with high precision and have such paraphrases that are valid in all ”uncertain” contexts can be replaced with their paraphrase. This manipulation affects the watermark bit contained in the passage and thus allows information encoding. The actual process is described in more detail in Section 2.1.","With this work, we show that a closed-class approach to generating paraphrases has desirable properties for watermarking: almost perfect substitution quality and acceptable embedding capacity. At the same time, we propose a novel application of uncertainty cue detection: paraphrasing of uncertainty cues for linguistic steganography."]},{"title":"2 Digital Watermarking","paragraphs":["In this section we elaborate on what a watermark message is. In the simplest setup, we can define a watermark message as a sequence of k bits (0 or 1 values). Then the message then can take 2k","different values, and can be used to identify the owner of the medium, if each owner gets a copy of the data with a different digital message embedded in it. Take, for example, the problem of embedding a 6-bit message in a black-and-white bitmap image. In this case, we divide the bitmap to six equal-size parts and consider the parity of the sum of bits in a given part as the message bit. Table 1 shows a 6×6 bitmap and the embedding of a 6-bit message (100100, one bit in each line). For a comprehensive overview of the different watermarking techniques, we refer the reader to Cox et al. (2008).","2.1 Natural Language Watermarking with Paraphrases In order to encode a single bit in a larger block of text – like a paragraph or section – based on bit parity, we first assign a bit (0 or 1) to every word in the vocabulary, i.e. not just those that we plan to manipulate. Then, in each block of the source text, we sum the bits encoded by the original text and take its parity (even = 0, odd = 1) as the secret bit. In case our message should contain the other bit, we have to make exactly 1 synonym substitution, replacing a 0-word with a 1-word or vice versa to reverse the parity of the block, in order to embed the desired bit in the text. Reading the message only requires the same methodology to detect the blocks (sections) in the text and the initial word-to-bit mapping to calculate the parity of the blocks.","If we consider only a small set of words as can-didates for substitution, this places a constraint on the system: it has to be ensured that the receiver can identify which blocks are used to actually encode information. This can be done, for example, if we use such blocks that contain at least one paraphrasable word after the potential manipulation: this way the reader can be sure the actual block encodes a bit (as there is capacity left in the block).","This simple parity-based message encoding approach offers straightforward ways to combine different embedding techniques, which is desirable: in order to combine conjunction reordering with the proposed paraphrasing method, one could use the (parity of the) number of changes in the conjoined list of items from their lexicographic order as the bit encoded in a conjunction, and can use that bit in the message encoding process. In our application scenario, we plan to implement several different text manipulation methods (and combine 1189 them based on their confidence). Therefore the goal of this study is to propose an approach with high precision and coverage will be ensured by a range of syntactic methods and paraphrasing together."]},{"title":"3 Related Work","paragraphs":["In this section we briefly introduce the previous work in natural language watermarking and in uncertainty detection.","The most prominent previous work in natural language watermarking (Atallah et al., 2003) focus on manipulating the sentence structure in order to realize meaning-preserving transformations of the text, which in turn can be used to embed information in the text. This approach either requires the presence of a robust syntactic (and semantic) parser to construct the representation which supports complex sentence-level transformations, or it has to be simplified to local transformations (e.g. conjunction modulation, as in the examples above) in order to ensure high precision without the requirement of deep linguistic analysis. Unfortunately, robust syntactic and semantic parsing of arbitrary texts is still challenging for natural language processing. This fact justifies the importance of more shallow models, such as synonym substitution, provided these approaches can ensure high precision and robust performance across domains. For a general and detailed overview of linguistic steganography, including methods other than paraphrasing, see for example Bennett (2004) and Topkara et al. (2005).","3.1 Paraphrasing for Linguistic Steganography As regards synonym substitution, the first studies made no use (Topkara et al., 2006) or just limited use (Bolshakov, 2005) of the context through collocation lists. While this approach offers a relatively high capacity, the transformations result in frequent semantic, or even grammatical, errors in the text, which is undesirable (Bennett, 2004).","Recently Chang and Clark (2010a,b) proposed the use of contextual paraphrases for linguistic steganography. This offers a higher perceived quality and is therefore more suited to text watermarking where quality is a crucial aspect. Chang and Clark (2010b) used the English Lexical Sub-stitution data (McCarthy and Navigli, 2007) from SemEval 2007 for evaluation, WordNet as the source of potential synonyms and n-gram frequencies for candidate ranking to experiment with paraphrasing for linguistic steganography. They introduced a graph coloring approach to embed information in a text through the substitution of words with their WordNet synonyms. They report an accuracy slightly above 70% for their paraphrasing technique and a potential capacity of around one bit per sentence.","Chang and Clark (2010a) used a paraphrase dictionary mined from parallel corpora using statistical machine translation (SMT) methods. The ranking of candidate paraphrases was also based on n-gram frequencies and for a set of 500 paraphrase examples they reported 100% precision (with very low, 4% recall) for substitution grammaticality. The possible change in meaning for otherwise grammatical replacements was not evaluated. 3.2 Uncertainty Cue Detection Another major field of work related to this study is the detection of uncertainty cues, which we propose to use for paraphrasing in Section 4. The first approaches to uncertainty detection were based on hand-crafted lexicons (Light et al., 2004; Saurı́, 2008). In particular, ConText (Chapman et al., 2007) used lexicons and regular expressions not only to detect cues, but also to recognize contexts where a cue word does not imply uncertainty.","Supervised uncertainty cue detectors have also been developed using either token classification (Morante and Daelemans, 2009) or sequence labeling approaches (Tang et al., 2010). A good overview and comparison of different statistical approaches is given in Farkas et al. (2010). Szarvas et al. (2012) addressed uncertainty cue detection in a multi-domain setting, using surfacelevel, part-of-speech and chunk-level features and sequence labeling (CRF) models. They found that cue words can be accurately detected in texts with various topics and stylistic properties. We make use of the multidomain corpora presented in their study and evaluate a cross-domain cue detection model for text watermarking."]},{"title":"4 Uncertainty Cue Detection for Text Watermarking","paragraphs":["In this section we experiment with uncertainty cue detection and paraphrasing, and study the potential of this approach for text watermarking. 1190","4.1 Dataset, Experimental Setup and Evaluation Measures We used here the dataset introduced by Szarvas et al. (2012). It consists of texts from three different domains (articles from Wikipedia, newspa-per articles and biological scientific texts) and is annotated for uncertainty cues. The uncertainty cues in the corpora are marked only in contexts where they are used in an uncertain meaning, i.e. these texts can be used to train a shallow (cue vs. non-cue meaning) disambiguation model for these phrases. Here we aim to paraphrase the cue uses of the words to encode information via cue-to-cue paraphrasing. We train and test our models on separate parts of the corpora: for example, to assess the accuracy of cue detection in Wikipedia texts, we train the model only on newswire and scientific texts, and so on. This is a cross-domain evaluation setting and is therefore a good estimate of how the system would perform on further, yet different text types from our training datasets.","For evaluation, we use the overall precision of the recognized uncertainty cues, and we also measure the capacity that can be achieved by paraphrasing these words, i.e. how frequently one of these words that we use to encode information actually occurs in a text (the number of detected objects divided by the number of sentences processed). These two criteria – precision and capacity – measure how well the uncertainty detector would perform as a stego system. In addition, we also perform an error analysis of the top-ranked instances that received the highest posterior probability scores by the classifier. The highest-ranked instances are especially important as the underly-ing application would chose the highest-ranked instance in a larger block of text to actually implement a change to the text. 4.2 Uncertainty Detection Model We implemented a cue recognition model similar to that described in Szarvas et al. (2012), using simple features that are robust across various text types. This is important, as we plan to use the model for text types that can be different from those in the training corpus, and for which NLP modules such as parsers might have questionable performance.","Conditional Random Fields were found to provide the best overall results in cue detection.

Since in this study we concentrate on the more simple and frequent unigram cues (or fixed constructions, such as not clear), we use a Maximum Entropy (Maxent) classifier model (McCallum, 2002) in our experiments for cue detection and disambiguation.","In our classification setup, each token is a separate instance, described by a set of features col-lected from a window of size 2 around the token. That is, each feature can be present under 5 different names, according to their relative position, except for sentence beginning and ending to-kens (out-of-sentence positions are discarded). We used the following features to describe each token: i) lexical features (word base forms and word bigrams); ii) 3 to 5 characters long word prefixes and suffixes; iii) word-surface-level features denoting whether the word is written in all uppercase, uppercase initial, or lowercase form, it is a punctua-tion mark or number; and iv) part of speech tags. 4.3 Results The results of the cross-domain cue recognition experiments are summarized in Table 2. The columns indicate the total number number of sentences and recognized cues in the corpora, their precision and the capacity that can be achieved via cue paraphrasing. For comparison to previous works, we also provide the overall phrase-level F score for uncertainty cues. These numbers are slightly better than those reported by Szarvas et al. (2012) for cross-training with CRFs, probably due to the different settings (we used two domains for training, not just one).","As can be seen, the uncertainty cue recognizer is accurate even in a challenging cross-training setting: the precision is well above 80% for two out of three domains, and is around 70% for the most difficult Wikipedia dataset. This precision could realize a capacity of one bit per every six sentences, on average (capacity at or above 16%). In","1","We performed an initial experiment using token-based and sequential models on our corpora and found no statistically significant difference in performance on unigram cues. 1191 corpus # sent. # cues precision capacity Wiki 20756 1869 89.46% 9.00% news 3123 223 93.72% 7.14% sci 19473 2688 98.95% 13.80% Table 4: Summary of results with the 29 selected keywords. order to use this cue recognizer as a watermarking method with the above-mentioned precision and capacity, we should provide a valid paraphrase for all of the 300 uncertainty cues found in the corpora. Doing that, a precision of 70% or more is promising in the light of the precision values be-low 50% for the first answers at SemEval 2007 for an all-words substitution task (Yuret, 2007), and of the fact that this precision stays around 70% even if the correct sense is picked in advance based on the human answers (Chang and Clark, 2010b).","On the other hand, as we argued in Section 2.1, it is desirable to improve precision at the cost of capacity. Thus, we filtered the uncertain vocabulary for such cues that are both frequent and accurate: we kept the cues that had a frequency of at least 10, with a precision above 80%. This left us 37 cues in total and this list was given to two annotators to provide paraphrases. The annotators were told to perform a web search for various contexts of the words and suggest paraphrases that are acceptable in all the words’ uncertainty-cue-uses and contexts. The two annotators agreed on a unique paraphrase which fits in all uncertain contexts of the target words for only 29 cues. These words with the proposed paraphrases and examples from the Wikipedia corpus are listed in Table 3. The columns indicate the selected cue words with their part of speech and the proposed paraphrase cue (or XX where we could not provide a suitable paraphrase). As can be seen, each cue is paraphrased with another cue with the same part of speech. Thus, their inflected forms can be generated based on the original words’ POS tags. For the remain-ing eight cues the annotators either did not find a proper substitute (e.g. belief ) or found the word to have several uncertain readings which would require different paraphrases in different contexts (e.g. expect which can be rephrased as wait, hope, count on, ...).","Table 4 provides aggregate numbers for the selected 29 cue words. The columns indicate the total number number of sentences in the corpora, the number of recognized instances of the 29 selected cues and their precision and capacity. As can be seen, for these words the classifier yielded excellent precision scores, even with cross-domain training. In scientific and newswire texts, the model performs well above 90% precision, while in Wikipedia texts the precision is slightly lower.","As regards the capacity of the selected cues in the texts, on average we can find one instance of the selected cue words in every 7–14 sentences. The above precision and capacity scores can be realized in an actual watermarking method with the use of the paraphrases in Table 3. While this coverage seems lower than some other approaches (e.g. Chang and Clark (2010b) can achieve approximately one bit per sentence capacity), it is still acceptable for text watermarking of lengthy documents (such as ebooks), and as mentioned earlier, different methods can be combined to in-crease capacity. In the light of this, we consider our results especially promising, due to the remarkable precision scores, and the positive characteristic that these changes do not affect the main propositions in the sentences, i.e. meaning is well preserved.","Although direct comparisons are difficult to make, Chang and Clark (2010a) evaluated how accurately their model predicted a paraphrase to be grammatical, which is similar to our goal here. Their model achieved similar precision levels with similar or slightly lower potential capacity scores. Other previous approaches reported substantially lower precision (typically aiming to achieve high recall). These results suggest that our methodology, making a change in 7–14% of the sentences with a precision of 90–98% is a very competitive alternative for precision-oriented linguistic steganography. 4.4 Error Analysis The proposed method can embed information in a cover text with remarkably high precision, as the applied changes to the text are perfectly grammatical and do not affect the main aspects of the meaning of the text. Our error analysis also confirms this (see Appendix). We checked the 250 top-ranked classifications in the Wikipedia and scientific text corpora, and 223 classifications in the newswire texts (the total number of detected instances of the 29 selected cues). We checked the errors in the instances that obtained the highest posterior scores because in a larger block the sys-1192 WORD POS SUBST.

We experimented with texts from three different domains using cue detection models trained on out-of-domain texts in order to simulate a realistic application scenario. We found that uncertainty cues are capable of embedding a 1-bit message in a block of text of around 10–13 sentences on average. Although this capacity is limited, in turn the use of uncertainty cues offers nearly perfect precision, i.e. the manipulated texts are grammatical and preserve the original text’s meaning. As in text watermarking the goal is to embed a relatively short message in potentially large texts, but with high precision (quality), the paraphrasing of uncertainty cues is a promising alternative.","Arguably, the ideal setting from an application perspective would be an open-vocabulary substitution system, but such an approach suffers from significant limitations stemming from the difficulty of paraphrasing in a general setting. An alternative could be to use a larger set of frequent words in a lexicalized approach for lexical substitution which might offer higher capacity with comparable precision Biemann and Nygaard (2010).","On the other hand, we think it is a viable approach to target the extra-propositional aspects of meaning (such as uncertainty proposed here) for lexical substitution in linguistic steganography. This – by definition – leaves the main proposition of the sentence (who does what, when and where) untouched, ensuring high transparency. To this end, we also plan to extend the capacity of this approach via paraphrasing other word classes such as opinion expressions (e.g. great X for excellent X, awful X for terrible X). 1193"]},{"title":"Appendix","paragraphs":["WORD # SUBST. suggest 2 indicate may 6 might might 2 may likely 1 probable believe 2 think assume 3 hypothesize indicate 3 suggest possibility 1 potential Table 5: Examples for the 21 errors in the top 250 (wiki, sci) and 223 (news) examples.
