H. Rumsfeld: things that “we don’t know we don’t know” (Torisawa et al., 2010). However, current commercial search engines are not an effective tool for finding such answers. For instance, even though deforestation is a serious and widely discussed problem, no exhaustive list of answers exists to the question: “What are the consequences if deforestation continues?” We may encounter serious unknown or unexpected consequences in the future. Many documents on the web describe its possible consequences, but only a small portion can be discovered using commercial search engines, because they just provide a huge number of documents that users have to read. Our ultimate goal is to solve such problems by developing deep semantic analysis technologies, which can provide a list of the possible consequences of deforestation,","*","Current address: Nuance Communications, Inc., Ger-many. stijn.desaeger (at) nuance.com for instance, and a software platform on which semantic analysis technologies can be applied to a billion-page-scale web archive.","We introduce WISDOM2013, our large-scale web information analysis system that consists of deep semantic analysis systems, including a factoid QA and a non-factoid QA, such as a what-happens-if QA, which answers “What happens if deforestation continues?” and sentiment/information sender analysis. We also introduce the underlying architecture of the software platform, which is designed to process/store two billion web documents and works as a common software platform for various semantic analyses.","NICT previously proposed an information analysis system called WISDOM1","(Akamine et al., 2009), which is a predecessor of WISDOM2013. But the source of its analyses were limited to 100 million web pages, and it did not provide QA services. In addition, the depth and the scale of its semantic analysis was quite restricted because it performs the semantic analysis online after receiving user requests. In contrast, most semantic processing that runs on WISDOM2013 is done of-fline. WISDOM2013 immediately analyzes each web document after it is crawled and can store the basic analysis results for billions of documents owing to its software platform. Therefore, we can drastically improve the breadth and depth of semantic analyses."]},{"title":"2 Script Outline","paragraphs":["In this section, we introduce the major features that we will demonstrate. They exploit the common fundamental analysis results, which are produced by the underlying architecture for large-scale analysis as shown in Section 3. 1 http://wisdom-nict.jp/ 45","Input query","(e.g. What are businesses doing with nanotechnology?) Source sentences","Answers (gene therapy, drug delivery, etc.) Figure 1: WISDOM2013 interface: factoid QA. 2.1 Factoid QA Figure 1 shows WISDOM2013’s web browser in-terface. WISDOM2013 takes a question in natural language and returns answers. For example, given question “What are businesses doing with nanotechnology?” ( ), WISDOM2013 returns hundreds of answers, such as gene therapy ( ), drug delivery (), and artificial joints () and displays them in clusters of semantically related terms. Users can click on each answer to see the original sentence and document from which the answer was extracted.","The system extracts such patterns as “X are businesses doing with Y” in questions and automatically paraphrases the extracted patterns into many synonymous patterns (De Saeger et al., 2009). Those patterns are matched against the web texts using specially designed indexes.","Note that we aim to provide a wide range of answers to user questions, unlike such traditional factoid QAs as IBM’s Watson for the Jeopardy! game show (Ferrucci et al., 2010), and suggest unexpected information to users, in other words, “unknown unknowns” (Torisawa et al., 2010). We expect that such unknown unknowns broaden thought and trigger proper decision makings in users.","This technology is an extension of the one used in our voice-activated open domain question answering system (Varga et al., 2011). When it is given a question, “What part of Japan was previously hit by tsunamis?”, it found that the Sendai plain, which was devastated by a huge tsunami in the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011, was also hit 1,000 years ago by a huge tsunami; tsunamis of similar scale are expected to hit again in the future. The system found this answer from web pages posted before the Great East Japan Earthquake. For a large number of victims of the 2011 tsunami, this is an example of an “unknown unknown” (or at least relatively unknown facts), and if it had been more widely circulated, lives might have been saved. WISDOM2013 will give chances for many users in the future to discover such unknown unknowns. 2.2 What-happens-if QA When an input question follows the “What happens if X” pattern, WISDOM2013 invokes a special type of QA system, which we call Whathappens-if QA, and gives the result as a directed graph (Fig. 2). The graph represents the causal chains initiated by the event described in the question. If the given question is “What happens if deforestation continues?” ( ), then WISDOM2013 gives a graph that includes the causal chains initiated by the event, “deforestation continues”. For instance, the graph contains the following causal chain: “deforestation continues” → “global warming progresses” → “sea temperature rises” → “Vibrio parahaemolyticus swells.”2",". Deforestaon connues Global warming progresses","Sea temperature rises Vibrio","parahaemolycus swells Figure 2: What-happens-if QA","Of course, it is debatable whether such causal chains or future scenarios will actually happen, and many scenarios are unlikely to become true. Our aim is to provide users the big picture of the future concerns of a given question, which is unlikely to be covered by journalism or mass media. We expect that careful examination of such future scenarios will lead to better decision making and preparation for potential and unforeseen risks.","Note that the causalities among nodes are acquired by our previous method (Hashimoto et al.,","2","An article in Nature Climate Change reported that Vibrio infections are caused by global warming in the Baltic Sea (Craig Baker-Austin et al., Nature Climate Change, Vol. 3, pp, 73–77 (2013)) 46 2012) from a large body of web texts. Each single causal relation between two nodes is extracted from a single web page, but a chain of causalities is obtained by combining those extracted causal relations and represents the information scattered over many web pages. In this sense, what-happens-if QA involves an certain inference process and enables users to explore possible social scenarios by chaining/combining statements from different documents. In other words, this feature creates awareness of hypothetical future scenarios that are not actually written in any document. 2.3 Sender/Sentiment Analysis WISDOM2013 can also show the results of sentiment analysis for a given topic or answers for factoid QAs. The amount of positive/negative information based on sentiment analysis is shown in charts to elucidate trends for users (Fig. 3). The results are classified based on the types of senders of the information source page. These functionalities were inherited from WISDOM, WISDOM2013’ s predecessor (Akamine et al., 2009). For instance, we can check the reputa-tion of treatments for atopic diseases by applying sentiment analysis to the answers to “What works for atopy?” ( ) and use the results as clues for determining the treatment’ s reliability or uncovering side-effects. In our demonstration, we show that companies post the most positive opinions concerning nutritional supplements that are supposedly effective against atopy. Users might infer that the companies are exaggerating the drug’s positive qualities even though much positive information is available about them. In extreme cases, users may question the effectiveness of such supplements or associate side-effects with them."]},{"title":"3 Software Platform","paragraphs":["In this section, we describe the architecture of the underlying software platform, which consists of two stages of data processing. Fig. 4 shows the first stage for fundamental analyses and archiving. The fundamental analysis results are designed to be shared by a wide variety of application-oriented analyses in the second stage.","After the crawler collects web documents, fundamental analyses are applied to them, which include document structure analysis, dependency","Classes of senders referring to some","nutrion supplements (answers to","“What works for atopy?”) Number of","posive/negave","sentences referring to","answers","Most posive opinions are wrien by companies, not by customers Figure 3: Sender/sentiment analysis Structure Analysis Senment Analysis Sender Analysis Crawler T e x t  a n a l y s i s  m a n a g e r Storage KVS Data Server","Distribuon Proxy A r c h i v i n g Archive Manager Archive Access Crawl data I n v o k e Register metadata URL, Crawled date Save metadata KVSKVSKVSKVSKVS Master Server Save (Distribute to 80 nodes) User To the cluster for applicaon-oriented analyses Request for Retrieval Data transfer Retrieve Dependency Analysis (Distribute to 80 nodes) Request for Retrieval Figure 4: Fundamental analyses and archiving. analysis, sender analysis, and sentiment analysis. The analyses need to process more than ten million documents daily collected by the crawler. To manage such metadata as URL, the crawled date, and the processing status of each document, we adopted a distributed key-value store (KVS).","In the second stage, more application-oriented analyses are performed based on the fundamental analysis results. For factoid QAs, the preprocessor extracts patterns of phrases that indicate relationships between terms and indexes them. The preprocessor for the what-happens-if QA extracts causal relations and indexes them. Both QAs rely on structure analysis and dependency analysis, both of which are produced in the first stage. Sender/Sentiment are also indexed for the interactive analysis described in Section 2.3.

Fig. 5 shows an overview of the process. The update manager transfers the fundamental analysis results to the distributed computation nodes. Due to computational load and data size that exceeds the storage amount of a single node, preprocessing including indexing for some analyses runs on 40 nodes in parallel. The indices for the analyses are used by access services, which provide APIs to access the indices. The distributed services are called worker services. A server service receives a request from the GUI, sends it to all worker services in parallel, and aggregates their results. The server service also eliminates duplicated results and ranks them. The extensible software platform allows us to add new preprocessors, indices, and services."]},{"title":"4 Conclusion","paragraphs":["In this paper, we introduced the major features of WISDOM2013 and described its software platform. We are planning to extend it in the future by adding more semantic analysis systems, such as Why QA (Oh et al., 2013) and inference mechanisms (Tsuchida et al., 2011). We also plan to introduce WISDOM2013 as infrastructure for a counter disaster information analysis system (Ohtake et al., 2013), which we are developing to organize information extracted from tweets after disasters (Varga et al., 2013). WISDOM2013’s software and service are scheduled to be made public in 2014."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Susumu Akamine, Daisuke Kawahara, Yoshikiyo Kato, Tetsuji Nakagawa, Kentaro Inui, Sadao Kurohashi, and Yutaka Kidawara. 2009.
