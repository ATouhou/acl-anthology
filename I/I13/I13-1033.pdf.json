In this paper we propose an alternative to comparable corpora of texts as resources for extracting parallel data: a multimodal comparable corpus of audio and texts. We present a novel method to detect parallel phrases from such corpora based on splitting comparable sentences into fragments, called phrases. The audio is transcribed by an automatic speech recognition system, split into fragments and translated with a baseline statistical machine translation system. We then use information retrieval in a large text corpus in the target language, split also into fragments, and extract parallel phrases. We compared our method with parallel sentences extraction techniques. We evaluate the quality of the extracted data on an English to French translation task and show significant improvements over a state-of-the-art baseline."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["The development of a statistical machine translation (SMT) system requires one or more parallel corpora called bitexts for training the translation model and monolingual data to build the target language model. Unfortunately, parallel texts are a limited resource and they are often not available for some specific domains and language pairs. That is why, recently, there has been a huge in-terest in the automatic creation of parallel data. Since comparable corpora exist in large quantities and are much more easily available (Munteanu and Marcu, 2005), the ability to exploit them is highly beneficial in order to overcome the lack of parallel data. The ability to detect these parallel data enables the automatic creation of large parallel corpora.","Most of existing studies dealing with comparable corpora look for parallel data at the sentence level (Zhao and Vogel, 2002; Utiyama and Isahara, 2003; Munteanu and Marcu, 2005; Abdul-Rauf and Schwenk, 2011). However, the degree of parallelism can vary considerably, from noisy parallel texts, to quasi parallel texts (Fung and Cheung, 2004). Corpora from the last category contain none or few good parallel sentence pairs. However, there could have parallel phrases in comparable sentences that can prove to be helpful for SMT (Munteanu and Marcu, 2006). As an example, consider Figure 1, which presents two news articles with their video from the English and French editions of the Euronews website1",". The articles report on the same event with different sentences that contain some parallel translations at the phrase level. These two documents contain in particular no exact sentence pairs, so techniques for extracting parallel sentences will not give good results. We need a method to extract parallel phrases which exist at the sub-sentential level.","For some languages, text comparable corpora may not cover all topics in some specific domains and languages. This is because potential sources of comparable corpora are mainly derived from multilingual news reporting agencies like AFP, Xinhua, Al-Jazeera, BBC etc, or multilingual encyclopedias like Wikipedia, Encarta etc. What we need is exploring other sources like audio to generate parallel data for such domains that can improve the performance of an SMT system.","In this paper, we present a method for detecting and extracting parallel data from multimodal corpora. Our method consists in extracting parallel 1 www.euronews.com/ 286 Comparable audio Comparable texts Manual Transcription Manual Transcription Figure 1: Example of multimodal comparable corpora from the Euronews website. Audio (en) Text (fr) Figure 2: Example of multimodal comparable corpora from the TED website. phrases."]},{"title":"2 Extracting parallel data 2.1 Basic Idea","paragraphs":["Figure 2 shows an example of multimodal comparable data coming from the TED website 2",". We have an audio source of a talk in English and its text translation in French. We think that we can extract parallel data from this corpora, at the sentence and the sub-sentential level.","In this work we seek to adapt and to improve machine translation systems that suffer from resource deficiency by automatically extracting parallel data in specific domains. 2 http://www.ted.com/ Audio L1 Sentences L1 Translations L2","Phrases L2 ASR SMT IR Texts L2 Multimodal Comparable Corpora Parallel Data Filter Phrases L1 Split Phrases L2 Split Figure 3: Principle of the parallel phrase extraction system from multimodal comparable corpora. 2.2 System Architecture The basic system architecture is described in Figure 3. We can distinguish three steps: automatic speech recognition (ASR), statistical machine translation (SMT) and information retrieval (IR). The ASR system accepts audio data in the source language L1 and generates an automatic transcription. This transcription is then split into phrases and translated by a baseline SMT system into language L2. Then, we use these translations as queries for an IR system to retrieve most similar phrases in the texts in L2, which were previouslt split into phrases. The transcribed phrases in L1 and the IR result in L2 form the final parallel data. We hope that the errors made by the ASR and SMT systems will not impact too severely the extraction process.","Our technique is similar to that of (Munteanu and Marcu, 2006), but we bypass the need of the Log-Likelihood-Ratio lexicon by using a baseline SMT system and the TER measure (Snover et al., 2006) for filtering. We also report an extension of the work of (Afli et al., 2012) by splitting transcribed sentences and the text parts of the multimodal corpus into phrases with length between two to ten tokens. We extract from each sentence on the corpus all combinations of two to ten sequential words. 287 2.3 Baseline systems Our ASR system is a five-pass system based on the open-source CMU Sphinx toolkit 3","(version 3 and 4), similar to the LIUM’08 French ASR system described in (Deléglise et al., 2009). The acoustic models are trained in the same manner, except that a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is added using the bottle-neck feature extraction as described in (Grézl and Fousek, 2008). Table 2.3 shows the performances of the ASR system on the development and test corpora. Corpus % WER Development 19.2 Test 17.4 Table 1: Performance of the ASR system on development and test data.","Our SMT system is a phrase-based system (Koehn et al., 2003) based on the Moses SMT toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007). The standard fourteen feature functions are used, namely phrase and lexical translation probabilities in both directions, seven features for the lexicalized distortion model, a word and a phrase penalty and a target language model. It is constructed as follows. First, word alignments in both directions are calculated. We used the multi-threaded version of the GIZA++ tool (Gao and Vogel, 2008). Phrases and lexical reorderings are extracted using the default settings of the Moses toolkit. The parameters of our system were tuned on a development corpus, using the MERT tool (Och, 2003).","We use the Lemur IR toolkit (Ogilvie and Callan, 2001) for the phrases extraction procedure. We first index all the French text (after splitting it into segments) into a database using Indri Index. This feature enable us to index our text documents in such a way we can use the translated phrases as queries to run information retrieval in the database, with the specialized Indri Query Language. By these means we can retrieve the best matching phrases from the French side of the comparable corpus.","For each candidate phrases pair, we need to decide whether the two phrases are mutual translations. For this, we calculate the TER between them using the tool described in (Servan and 3 Carnegie Mellon University:","http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/ Schwenk, 2011),4","i.e. between automatic translation, and the phrases selected by IR."]},{"title":"3 Experiments","paragraphs":["In our experiments, we compare our phrase extraction method (which we call PhrExtract) with the sentence extraction method (SentExtract) of (Afli et al., 2012). We use the extracted dataset by both methods as additional SMT training data, and measure the quality of the parallel data by its impact on the performance of the SMT system. Thus, the final extracated parallel data is injected into the baseline system. The various SMT systems are evaluated using the BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002). We conducted experiments on an English to French machine translation task. All the text data is automatically split into phrases of two to ten tokens. 3.1 Data description Our multimodal comparable corpus consists of spoken talks in English (audio) and written texts in French. The goal of the TED task is to translate public lectures from English into French. The TED corpus totals about 118 hours of speech. We call the English transcriptions of the audio part TEDasr witch is split into phrases (called TEDasr split). A detailed description of the TED task can be found in (Rousseau et al., 2011).","The development corpus DevTED consists of 19 talks and represents a total of 4 hours and 13 minutes of speech transcribed at the sentence level. The language model is trained with the SRI LM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002), on all the available French data without the TED data. The baseline system is trained with version 7 of the News-Commentary (nc7) and Europarl (eparl7) corpus.5","The indexed data consist of the French text part of the TED corpus which contains translations of the English part of the corpus. We call it TEDbi. It is split into phrases (called TEDbi split). Tables 2 and 3 summarize the characteristics of the different corpora used in our experiments. 3.2 Experimental results We first apply sentence extraction on the TED corpus with a method similar to (Afli et al., 2012). We then apply phrase extraction on the same data split 4 http://sourceforge.net/projects/","tercpp/ 5 http://www.statmt.org/europarl/ 288 bitexts # tokens in-domain ? nc7 3.7M no eparl7 56.4M no DevTED 36k yes Table 2: MT training and development data. Data # tokens in-domain ? TEDasr 1.8M yes TEDbi 1.9M yes","TEDbi split 80.4M yes","TEDasr split 82.7M yes Table 3: Comparable data used for the extraction experiments. as described in 2.2. Then, both methods are compared.","As mentioned in section 2.3, the TER score is used as a metric for filtering the result of IR. We keep only the sentences or phrases which have a TER score below a certain threshold determined empirically. Thus, we filter the selected sentences or phrases in each condition with different TER thresholds ranging from 0 to 100 by steps of 10. The extracted parallel data are added to our generic training data in order to adapt the baseline system. Table 4 presents the BLEU score obtained for these different experimental conditions.","Our baseline SMT system, trained with generic bitexts achieves a BLEU score of 22.93. We can see that our new method of phrase extraction significantly improve the baseline system more than sentences extraction method until the TER threshold of 80 is reached: the BLEU score increases from 22.93 to 23.70 with the best system of our proposed method and from 22.93 to 23.40 with the best system using the classical method of sentence extraction.","The results show that the choice of the appropriate TER threshold depends on the method. We can see that for PhrExtract the best threshold is 60 when the best one is 80 for SentExtract. This last one is also an important point in the general evaluation of the two methods. In fact, we can see on Figure 4 that from this point our proposed method gives less performing results than SentExtract method.","This suggest to apply combination of the two methods. This corresponds to injecting the extracted phrases and sentences into the training data. The combination method is called CombExtract. Figure 4 presents the comparison of the different experimental conditions in term of BLEU score for each TER threshold. We can see that except for threshold 30, the curve of the combination follows in general the same trajectory of the curve of PhrExtract. These results show that SentExtract has no big impact in combination with the PhrExtract method and the best threshold when using PhrExtract is at 60. 22 22.5 23 23.5 24 0 20 40 60 80 100 BLEU score TER threshold PhrExtract SentExtract CombExtract Baseline Figure 4: Performance of PhrExtract, SentExtract and their combination in term of BLEU score for each TER threshold.","This is because of the big difference on the quantity of data between the two methods as we can see in Table 4. The benefit of our method is that it can generates more quantities of parallel data than the sentence extraction method for each TER threshold, and this difference of quantities improves results of MT system until the TER threshold of 80 is reached. However, we can see in Table 4 that the quality of only 39.35k (TER 80) extracted by SentExtract can have exactly the same impact of 25.3M extracted by our new technique. That is why we intend to investigate in the filtering module of our system."]},{"title":"4 Related Work","paragraphs":["Research on exploiting comparable corpora goes back to more than 15 years ago (Fung and Yee, 1998; Koehn and Knight, 2000; Vogel, 2003; Gaussier et al., 2004; Li and Gaussier, 2010). A lot of studies on data acquisition from comparable corpora for machine translation have been reported (Su and Babych, 2012; Hewavitharana and Vogel, 2011; Riesa and Marcu, 2012).","To the best of our knowledge (Munteanu and 289 TER BLEU score BLEU score # tokens (fr) # tokens (fr)","SentExtract PhrExtract SentExtract PhrExtract 0 22.86 23.39 55 1.06M 10 22.97 23.35 313 1.4M 20 23.06 23.53 1.7k 2.5M 30 22.95 23.39 6.9k 4.3M 40 22.92 23.45 23.5k 7.02M 50 23.26 23.54 62.4k 11.4M 60 23.10 23.70 13.82k 13.8M 70 23.29 23.41 25.15k 18.04M 80 23.40 23.40 39.35k 25.3M 90 23.39 23.18 57.54k 35.9M 100 23.34 23.26 83.60k 45.3M Baseline 22.93 - 60.1M - Table 4: Number of tokens extracted and BLEU scores on DevTED obtained with PhrExtract and SentExtract methods for each TER threshold. Marcu, 2006) was the first attempt to extract parallel sub-sentential fragments (phrases), from comparable corpora. They used a method based on a Log-Likelihood-Ratio lexicon and a smoothing filter. They showed the effectiveness of their method to improve an SMT system from a collection of a comparable sentences. The weakness of their method is that they filter source and target fragments separately, which cannot guarantee that the extracted fragments are a good translations of each other. (Hewavitharana and Vogel, 2011) show a good result with their method based on on a pairwise correlation calculation which suppose that the source fragment has been detected.","The second type of approach in extracting parallel phrases is the alignment-based approach (Quirk et al., 2007; Riesa and Marcu, 2012). These methods are promising, but since the proposed method in (Quirk et al., 2007) do not improve significantly MT performance and model in (Riesa and Marcu, 2012) is designed for parallel data, it’s hard to say that this approach is actually effective for comparable data.","This work is similar to the work by (Afli et al., 2012) where the extraction is done at the phrase level instead of the sentence level. Our methodology is the first effort aimed at detecting translated phrases on a multimodal corpora.","Since our method can extract parallel phrases from a multimodal corpus, it greatly expands the range of corpora which can be usefully exploited."]},{"title":"5 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We have presented a fully automatic method for extracting parallel phrases from multimodal comparable corpora, i.e. the source side is available as audio stream and the target side as text. We used a framework to extract parallel data witch combine an automatic speech recognition system, a statistical machine translation system and information retrieval system. We showed by experiments conducted on English-French data, that parallel phrases extracted with this method improves significantly SMT performance. Our approach can be improved in several aspects. The automatic splitting is very simple; more advanced phrases generation might work better, and eliminate redundancy. Trying other method on filtering can also improve the precision of the method."]},{"title":"6 Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This work has been partially funded by the French Government under the project DEPART."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["S.
