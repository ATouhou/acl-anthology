This makes different approaches to genre identification incomparable and the task itself unclear. We introduce the linguistically motivated text classification tasklanguage function analysis, LFA, which focuses on one well-defined aspect of genres. The aim of LFA is to determine whether a text is predominantly expressive, appellative, or informative. LFA can be used in search and mining applications to efficiently filter documents of interest. Our approach to LFA relies on fast machine learning classifiers with features from different research areas. We evaluate this approach on a new corpus with 4,806 product texts from two domains. Within one domain, we correctly classify up to 82% of the texts, but differ-ences in feature distribution limit accuracy on out-of-domain data."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Text classification has been successfully applied to various natural language processing tasks, among which some of the most popular are topic detection, authorship attribution, sentiment analysis, and genre identification. While the first three refer to single aspects of a text, genres cover different properties of both documents and texts, such as their form, function, purpose, and target audience. As a consequence, many different genre classification schemes exist, which makes most approaches to genre identification badly comparable as a recent study showed (Sharoff et al., 2010). Correspondingly, the question which features work best in genre identification still remains open. We argue that one major reason behind is a missing common understanding of genres and that we need to focus on the single aspects of genres in order to overcome this situation.","In this paper, we investigate why a text was written. Therefore, we introduce the ambitious task language function analysis, abbreviated as LFA, i.e., to classify the predominant function of a text as intended by its author. In line with the work of the psychologist Karl Bühler (1934), we distinguish three abstract and very general classes, namely, expressive, appellative, and informative texts. Several search and text mining applications can benefit from applying LFA as a document filtering step with respect to both efficiency and effectiveness. A search engine, for instance, might restrict its result list to hits that mainly serve an informative purpose. Similarly, LFA can be used in opinion mining to cancel out promotional texts in favor of personal attitudes. While, of course, LFA does not replace genre identification, we think that language functions constitute one root of a common and clear genre concept.","Language functions are well-studied in linguistic pragmatics, but we analyze whether they also correlate with statistical text characteristics. For this purpose, we built a manually annotated corpus with 4,806 product-related texts from two separated domains (music and smartphones) in close collaboration with industry. Each text is tagged as personal, commercial, or informational, which can be seen as an application-specific classification by language function. Also, the texts have been categorized by sentiment polarity.","Our approach to LFA relies on machine learning of lexical and shallow linguistic features from different research areas. We evaluate this approach both for classification within one corpus domain and for the transfer to another domain. With respect to the in-domain task, our results indicate that a text collection of homogeneous quality and style allows for high accuracy. In particular, we 632 correctly classify 81.9% of the music texts using a very efficiently computable feature set. This makes our approach suitable for document filtering purposes. However, classification of out-of-domain data seems difficult because of thecovariate shift (Shimodaira, 2000) in feature distribution between domains. Interestingly, though, the best-performing features for this task come from the area of authorship attribution. 1.1 Summary of Contributions Altogether, the main contributions of this paper are the following:","• We introduce the linguistically motivated text classification task language function analysis, which addresses one well-defined aspect of genres (Section 2).","• We provide a corpus for language function analysis and sentiment analysis with product-related texts that were manually annotated by one of our industrial partners (Section 4).","• We analyze the impact of machine learning features from different research areas on the language function analysis of texts from two domains (Sections 5 and 6)."]},{"title":"2 Language Function Analysis","paragraphs":["One of the most influential attempts to categorize language functions was introduced by the famous psychologist Karl Bühler (1934). In his Organon model, which is rooted in Plato’s view of language as a tool, Bühler identifies and interrelates three fundamental functions of natural language in communication: the expression of the speaker, the appeal to the receiver, and the representation of the object or state of affair being communicated. As illustrated in Figure 1 they all refer to a linguistic sign, which can be understood as the unit of all forms of language.","Based on the three language functions, Katharina Reiß (1971) defined a classification of text types, which relates to the intention of the author of a text. In particular, she distinguished between the form-focused expression of the author’s attitudes in expressive texts, the aim of making an appeal to the reader in appellative (or operative) texts, and the content-focused description of objects and facts in informative texts. Reiß assigned several concrete text types such as “report” (informative), “novel” (expressive), or “comment” (in-","linguistic sign speaker receiver objects or states of affairs expression representation appeal Figure 1: The organon model, formulated by Karl Bühler (1934), with its three language functions expression, appeal, and representation. formative and appellative) to one or more of these classes. While she claimed that a hybrid type is the regular case, she observed that one function is predominant in most texts. We adopt Reiß’ typology to define the language function analysis task. Definition 1 (Language Function Analysis) Let C = {expressive, appellative, informative} be the set of abstract language functions and let d be a text. Then the task of language function analysis, LFA, is to find the mapping d ↦→ c ∈ C such that c is the predominant language function of d.","We argue that LFA can help in many practical problems where document filtering is needed, especially because of its generic nature. For product-related texts, the use of LFA emerges, when we map the abstract functions in C to the following concrete language function classes of text:","• personal (expressive). Text that aims to express the personal attitude of an individual towards a product of interest.","• commercial (appellative). Text that follows commercial purposes with respect to a product of interest.","• informational (informative). Text that reports on a product of interest in an objective and journalistic manner.","Another example for a set of concrete language function classes might be review (expressive), proposal (appellative), and report (informative) in the research project context. Notice, though, that the mapping from abstract functions to concrete classes of text is meant to be an interpretation for a concrete learning situation rather than a redefinition of the task. In the remaining sections, we 633 use the classes personal, commercial, and informational for a first evaluation of LFA. Our intuition is that, statistically, language functions imply shallow linguistic features, such as certain parts-of-speech or writing style characteristics."]},{"title":"3 Related Work","paragraphs":["Classification by intention has been recently addressed in (Kröll and Strohmaier, 2009). The authors infer a subset of 145 intentions from the transcriptions of speeches based on actions mentioned within the text. Similar problems refer to the analysis of speaker intentions in conversation (Kadoya et al., 2005) and to the area of textual entailment (Michael, 2009), which is about the information implied by text. In contrast, LFA is about the question why a text was written and, thus, refers to the authorial intention behind a text.1","In that, our work resembles (Santini, 2005) where a linguistic expert system analyzes the gradation of four text types that convey the purpose and function of a text. Two of these types fit to the abstract functions introduced in Section 2, namely, the types “explicatory/informational” and “argumentative/persuasive”. However, the other types (“descriptive/narrative” and “instructional”) seem quite arbitrary and appear to intersect with the first type. Moreover, a class for the expression of personal views is missing. This might result from the used SPIRIT corpus (Clarke et. al., 2002), which was created for question answering purposes. Besides, language functions constitute a general classification scheme that may be concretized for a task at hand, while Santini regards text types only as input to web genre identification.","In terms of the communicative purpose of a text, language functions can be considered as the most abstract view on genres. Indeed, Kessler et al. (1997) argue that the class of texts that aim at persuading someone would not be seen as a genre merely because that class is too generic. While the authors simply define a genre to refer to a certain functional trait as well as to some formal properties, several abstract and concrete classification schemes have been proposed for genre identification. In a pioneer study on genres, Biber (1986) analyzes basic textual dimensions, such as “informative vs. involved”, while Karlgren and Cutting 1","While literature theory also addresses the intention of the reader and the intention of the text itself (Eco, 1990), only authorial intention is relevant for the purpose of this paper. (1994) try to automatically separate informative from imaginative texts. Stamatatos et. al. (2000) rely on more concrete press-related genres (e.g. “Letter to the editor” or “Spot news”), and Garera and Yarowsky (2009) investigate modern conversational genres, such as “Email”.","The two latter show that genres do not only describe the function and purpose of a text, but also its form and target audience and, thus, also represent concepts orthogonal to language functions. Correspondingly, a great deal of genre research in the last decade focused on web genres as surveyed in (Stein et al., 2010). Two standard corpora for web genre identification, KI-04 (Meyer zu Eissen and Stein, 2004) and SANTINIS (Santini, 2010), illustrate a common situation in genre research: Their classification schemes partly over-lap, e.g. the class “Help” from KI-04 can be mapped to “FAQ” in SANTINIS, but partly also contain unique and quite specific classes, such as “Search pages” in SANTINIS. Moreover, Sharoff et. al. (2010) found out that seemingly similar classes (“Portrayal” and “Personal home page”) differ strongly in terms of discriminative features. This supports our argumentation that there is neither a clear common understanding of genres, nor a well-defined genre concept. Additionally, Boese and Howe (2005) recognized that, in the web, genres may evolve over time to other genres.","However, language functions still represent one important aspect of genres. Accordingly, genre identification and LFA have similarities with respect to both practical applications (e.g. document filtering) and potentially helpful features. Since our focus is on a text itself as opposed to a document, we follow Webber (2009) who emphasizes the importance of text-internal and linguistic features, such as particular parts-of-speech. Also, we investigate both character-based and word-based n-grams, which were most successful in the above-mentioned evaluation of genre collections of Sharoff et al. (2010).","Further promising features relate to sentiment analysis and authorship attribution. Like LFA, sentiment analysis covers the issue of subjectivity (Pang and Lee, 2008), but it addresses what is said. Correspondingly, research in sentiment analysis often focuses only on characteristic terms as in (Prettenhofer and Stein, 2010). In contrast, approaches to authorship attribution aim at measur-ing the writing style of a text; sometimes based on 634 lexical and shallow linguistic information (Luyckx and Daelemans, 2008), sometimes using deeper analyses like parsing (Raghavan et al., 2010). We adopt some of these features in Section 5 and 6."]},{"title":"4 The LFA-11 Corpus","paragraphs":["To evaluate LFA, we built the LFA-11 corpus with manually annotated German texts from two separated domains: music and smartphones. The purpose of the corpus is to provide textual data for the development and evaluation of approaches to LFA and sentiment analysis.

The Spinn3r project aims at crawling and indexing the whole blogosphere. Hence, the texts in the smartphone collection vary strongly in quality and writing style. While the music texts span 9.4 sentences with 23.0 tokens on average, the blog posts have an average length of 11.8 sentences but only 18.6 tokens per sentence. 4.1 Annotations The corpus consists of UTF-8 encoded XMI files preformatted for the Apache UIMA framework3",", which implements the Unstructured Information Management Architecture (Ferrucci and Lally, 2004).

Tagging was done by two employees of the Digital Collections Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, a leading supplier of digital as-set management systems.","Figure 2 shows excerpts from three texts of the music collection, one out of each language function class. The excerpts have been translated to English for clarity.

The text seems to predominantly aim at persuading the reader to buy or like the product.”","• informational. “Use this annotation if the text seems not to be of commercial interest with respect to the product. Instead, it predominantly appears to be informative in a journalistic manner.”","About 20% of the music texts and 40% of the smartphone texts were tagged twice in order to compute inter-annotator agreement. The resulting values κm = 0.78 (music) and κs = 0.67 (smartphone) of Cohen’s Kappa (Carletta, 1996) for the language function annotations constitute “substantial agreement”. Especially κs is far from perfect, which can be problematic for text classification purposes. Under consideration of the hybridity of language functions in texts (cf. Section 2), κm and κs appear to be quite high, though. 635 Set personal commercial informational music collection Training 521 (38.5%) 127 (9.4%) 707 (52.2%) Validation 419 (61.7%) 72 (10.6%) 188 (27.7%) Test 342 (50.4%) 68 (10.0%) 269 (39.6%) smartphone collection Training 546 (52.1%) 90 (8.6%) 411 (39.3%) Validation 279 (53.3%) 36 (6.9%) 208 (39.8%) Test 302 (57.7%) 28 (5.4%) 193 (36.9%) Table 1: Distribution of language function classes in the music and smartphone sets of the corpus.

Also, Table 1 and 2 give a first hint that the correlation between language functions and sentiment is low. With regard to the distribution of language functions, we observe a large imbalance between the three classes. In case of double-annotated texts, we chose the annotations of the employee who categorized more texts as commercial.

After sentence splitting and tokenization, we applied the highly efficient TreeTagger (Schmid, 1995) for part-of-speech tagging and we extracted time and money entities with fast regular expressions. Regarding sentiment polarity, we used the corpus annotations for simplicity.","For the writing style features, we determined the 48 most common words, the 55 most common part-of-speech trigrams, and the 35 most common character trigrams on the training set of each collection. Accordingly, we computed the most discriminative trigrams for feature type 5. The core vocabularies sum up to 30 words for the music collection and to 36 words for the smartphone collection (proper names were discarded). Some of these words are quite specific, e.g. “single” in the music domain (an indicator for commercial), while others seem less domain-dependent such as “zumindest” (“at least”, informational).","Altogether, the six feature types were instantiated by 299 music and 373 smartphone features, respectively. On both training sets, we trained one linear multi-class support vector machine (hereafter called SVM) using feature type 1 to m for each m ∈ [1, 6] as well as one such SVM using only type m. For this, we applied the LibSVM integration in Weka (Hall et. al., 2009; Fan et. al., 2001), where we selected the cost parameters of all 4 The Java source code and the feature files used for eval-","uation can be accessed at http://infexba.upb.de. SVMs on the validation sets. Finally, we analyzed the impact of the resulting classifiers on both test sets. We measured their effectiveness in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall and their efficiency in milliseconds per processed input text. 6.2 Results Effectiveness of the classifiers. Figure 3a illustrates classification accuracy on the music test set for a stepwise integration of feature type 1 to 6 into an SVM trained on the music training set. Additionally, the accuracy for the transfer of the SVM with all features to the smartphone domain is depicted. The simple genre features (SG) already achieved 69.4%. While text type (TT) and sentiment (SE) contributed only little, the writing style features (WS) and the core trigrams (CT) boosted accuracy by 4.4% and 6.2%, respectively. At last, the core vocabularies (CV) added 1.2 percentage points to the resulting overall accuracy of 81.9% (86.7% on the validation set).","When we applied the SVM with all features to the smartphone test set, its accuracy dropped to 48.8%. To find out whether this dramatic decrease indicates a covariate shift in the feature distribution between the two domains, we retrained the SVM on the smartphone training set. Indeed, its accuracy was re-increased to 68.8%, as shown in Figure 3b. Interestingly, though, the domain transfer worked fine in the opposite direction, i.e., the SVM trained on smartphone texts still correctly classified63.3% of the texts in the music test set. We suppose that this effect originates from the heterogeneity of the smartphone texts, which prevented the learning of features from being biased towards a certain style of speech. Such a bias naturally exists in music reviews and the like. 637 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 1. Simple genre feat.","2. Text type 3. Writing style","4. Sentiment 5. Core trigrams 6. Core vocabularies 1.-6.

The accuracy of SG, 64.2%, was over five points lower, and only the integration of TT (+1.8%) and CT (+3.1%) yielded notable improvements afterwards. Adding WS even led to a decrease of one percentage point. However, this does not mean that the writing style features failed, as we see later on, but seems to be only noise from the optimization process of the SVM.","While a kappa value of 0.67 (cf. Section 4) renders high accuracy difficult, in general, one reason for the weak performance on the smartphone test set can be inferred from Table 3. This table lists effectiveness results of the SVMs with all features for each class. On the music test set, we observe a recall of more than 75% for all three classes. Though precision significantly dropped for commercial, given a class imbalance of 1:9 (commercial:rest), 61.9% is still over five times better than the expected precision of guessing. In contrast, the recognition of commercial texts failed on the smartphone test set with an F1-score of only 31.0%. Apparently, the SVM did not determine meaningful features for commercial, probably because of the small number of commercial texts (cf. Table 1) in combination with the heterogeneity of the smartphone collection. This, in turn, also affected the effectiveness of the other classes.","Effectiveness of the feature types. We measured the effectiveness of each feature type in isolation in order to investigate their impact on LFA. Within music, the simple genre features, the writing style type, and the core trigrams did best, each of them with nearly 70% accuracy as shown in Figure 4. However, there is not one discriminative type, i.e., the complete feature set clearly outperformed all single types. Under the transfer to the smartphone domain, only the text type and writing style features reasonably maintained effectiveness. The core vocabularies failed on out-of-domain data, and also the core trigrams did unexpectedly bad, dropping from 68.6% to 10.5%.","With regard to sentiment, our evaluation under-pins the observation from Section 4 that sentiment polarities and language functions hardly correlate: the according features learned on the music training set did not work out on both test sets, and the same holds for the opposite direction in Figure 5. There, we see that feature type 1, 3, and 5 also performed best within the smartphone domain. In particular, the writing style type (64.8%) is only 4% worse than the complete feature set. More-over, while the domain transfer worked well in general, again the most impact was achieved by the text type features with 59.8% accuracy and by the writing style features with 58.9%. This suggests that the distribution of these features is only weakly domain-dependent in LFA. With respect to the writing style type, this is an interesting result, as it indicates that the genre-related task LFA significantly benefits from features that are most prominent in the area of authorship attribution.","Efficiency.

This indicates that language functions relate to the writing style of a text. In contrast, the correlation with sentiment appeared to be low.","However, in general, both the language function analysis of more heterogeneous texts and the domain transfer remain unsolved.
