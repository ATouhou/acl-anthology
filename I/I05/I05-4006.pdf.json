To solve this issue, several approaches have been so far proposed. One of them is an approach in which the system expresses the knowledge of the dialogue with a frame and executes the dialogue according to that frame (Goddeau, 1996; Niimi, 2001; Oku, 2004). However, it is difficult to make a frame that totally defines the content of the dialogue. Additionally, there is a tendency for the dialogue style to be greatly affected by the frame. Figure 1: The data collection vehicle(DCV)","In this paper, we describe the construction of a structurally annotated spoken dialogue corpus. By statistically dealing with the corpus, we can achieve the automatic acquisition of dialogue-structural rules. We suppose that the system can figure out the state of the dialogue through the in-cremental building of the dialogue structure.","We use the CIAIR in-car spoken dialogue corpus (Kawaguchi, 2004; Kawaguchi, 2005), and describe the dialogue structure as a binary tree. The tree expresses the purpose of partial dialogues and the relations between utterances or partial dialogues. The speaker’s intention tags were provided in the transcription of the corpus.

Each subject had conversations with three types of dialogue system: a human operator, the Wizard of OZ system, and the conversational system.","In this project, a system was specially built in a Data Collection Vehicle (DCV), shown in Figure 1, and was used for the synchronous recording of multi-channel audio data, multi-channel video data, and vehicle related data. All dialogue data were transcribed according to transcription standards in compliance with CSJ (Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese) (Maekawa, 2000) and were as-signed discourse tags such as fillers, hesitations, and slips. An example of a transcript is shown in Figure 2. Utterances were divided into utterance units by a pause of 200 ms or more.","These dialogues are annotated by speech act tags called Layered Intention Tags (LIT) (Irie, 2004(a)), which indicate the intentions of the speaker’s utterances. LIT consists of four layers: “Discourse act”, “Action”, “Object”, and “Argument”. Figure 3 shows a part of the organization of LIT. As Figure 3 shows, the lower layered intention tag depends on the upper layered one. In principle, one LIT is given to one utterance unit. 35,421 utterance units have been tagged by hand (Irie, 2004(a)).","In this research, we use parts of the restaurant guide dialogues between a driver and a human operator. An example of the dialogue corpus with LIT is shown in Table 1. In the column called Speaker, “D” means a driver’s utterance and “O” means an operator’s one. We used the Discourse act, Action, and Object layers and extended them with speaker symbols such as “D+Request+Search+Shop”. There are 41 types of extended LIT. Because the “Argument” layer is too detailed to express the dialogue structure, we omitted it."]},{"title":"41","paragraphs":["Table 1: Example of the dialogue corpus with LIT","Utterance LIT","Number Speaker Transcription First layer Second layer Third layer","(Discourse Act) (Action) (Object)","277 D kono hen de tai ga tabera reru tokoro nai kana.

To make the structural analysis of the dialogue more efficient, we express the dialogue structure as a binary tree. We defined a category called POD (Part-Of-Dialogue), according to the observations of the restaurant guide task, that was especially focused on what subject was dealt with. As a result of this, 11 types of POD were built (Table 2). Each node of a structural tree is labeled with a POD or LIT. The dialogue structural tree of Table 1 is shown in Figure 4. 3.2 The design policy of dialogue structure To consider a dialogue as an LIT sequence, LIT providing process (Irie, 2004(b)) usually should be done. Furthermore, repairs and corrections are eliminated because they do not provide LIT. In this research, we used an LIT sequence provided in the corpus. After that, the annotation of the dialogue structure was done in the following way.","Merging utterances: When two adjoining utterances such as request and answer, they seem to be able to pair up and merge with an"]},{"title":"42","paragraphs":["appropriate POD. In Table 1, for example, the utterance “Should I make a reservation?” (#286) is a request and the answer to #286 is “No, a reservation is not necessary”(#287). In this way, utterances are combined with the POD “S INFO”.","When the LIT’s of two adjacent utterances are corresponding, these utterances are supposed to be paired and merged with the same LIT. Utterance “Fresh and roe” (#280) and “I want to have Hotpot” (#281) are related to choosing the style of restaurant and are provided with the same LIT. Therefore they are combined with the LIT “D+Statement+Select+Genre”.","Merging partial dialogues: When two adjoining partial dialogues (i.e. a partial tree) are composing another partial dialogue, they are merged with a proper POD. In Table 1, for example, a search dialogue (from #277 to #285, SRCH) and a shop information dialogue helping search (from #286 to #287, S INFO) are combined and labeled as the POD “SLCT”. When the POD’s of two adjacent partial dialogues are corresponding, these dialogues are merged with the same POD. Two search dialogues (one is from #277 to #282, other is from #283 to #285) are combined with the same POD “SRCH”.","The root of the tree: The POD of the root of the tree is “GUIDE”, because the domain of the corpus is restaurant guide task."]},{"title":"4 Construction of Structurally Annotated Spoken Dialogue Corpus 4.1 Work environment and procedures","paragraphs":["We made a dialogue parser as a supportive environment for annotating dialogue structures.","Applying the dialogue-structural rules, which are obtained from annotated structural trees (like Figure 4.), the parser analyzes the inputs of the LIT sequences and the outputs off all avail-able dialogue-structural trees.

The structural rules were extracted from all annotated dialogues. In the environment outlined above, we have worked at bootstrap building. That is, we","1. outputed the dialogue structures through the parser.","2. chose and rectified the dialogue structure using an annotator.","3. extracted some structural rules from some dialogue-structural trees. We repeated these procedures and increased the structural rules incrementally, so that the dialogue parser improved it’s operational performance. 4.2 Structurally annotated dialogue corpus We built a structurally annotated dialogue corpus in the environment described in Section 4.1, using the restaurant guide dialogues in the CIAIR corpus. The corpus includes 789 dialogues consisting of 8150 utterances. One dialogue is composed of 11.61 utterances.

If the next utterance or LIT of the extracted dialogue is the user’s, the system waits for the user’s utterance and predicts its meaning and intention. If the system’s utterance is next, the system uses the utterance or LIT to control the dialogue.
