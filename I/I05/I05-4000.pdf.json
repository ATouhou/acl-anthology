PREFACE","paragraphs":["It is increasingly convinced that language resources, as well as corpus-based, stochastic, and learning approaches, play a significantly important role in Natural Language Processing (NLP) research. There have been several reports on the success of constructing and using corpora in many dimensions. How to effectively re-organizing the existing resources into a unified framework and establishing the guideline for corpus development has become more and more important, which will be highly helpful for sharing resources and coping with cross-language problems. Motivated by this background, the 5th Workshop on Asian Language Resources (ALR) and 1st Symposium on Asian Language Resources Network (ALRN) are organized under the auspices of the Asian Language Resources Committee of Asia Federation of Natural Language Processing (AFNLP) in conjunction with IJCNLP2005. The purposes of the workshop and symposium are as follows. (1) To investigate the situation of Asian Language Resources, and to make a catalog of the result of this investigation; (2) To investigate and discuss the problems related to the standards and specification on creating various kinds of language resources; (3) To promote communications between developers and users of various language resources in order to fill the gap between language resources and practical applications; (4) To launch a roadmap for Asian Language Resources. ALR-05 accepts 10 regular papers. We are so sure that the selected papers for presentation are informative and can gain much potential for further research. We hope to meet worldwide active researchers working on Asian languages to promote the research on linguistic resources and related fields. We are sure that the workshop and symposium will fruitfully contribute to construct a unifying architecture and mechanism for Asian Language Resources development, management and sharing. Our workshop and symposium would not have been succeeded without the hard work of the program committee. Also, we would like to express our great thanks to the arrangement of the IJCNLP-05 organizing committee and the secretariat. Finally, we wish that all the participants can benefit a lot and enjoy themselves in the workshop and symposium.
