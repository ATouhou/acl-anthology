{"sections":[{"title":"IJCNLP-05 Fourth SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language Processing Proceedings of the Workshop 14-15 October 2005 Jeju Island, Korea © 2005 Asian Federation of Natural Language Processing Preface","paragraphs":["We would like welcome you to the Fourth SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language Processing held on Jeju Island, Republic of Korea, October 14-15, 2005. Building on previous workshops in Sapporo and Barcelona, SIGHAN4 brings together researchers from Asia and around the world to report recent developments in many aspects of Chinese language processing. This year for the first time the workshop is being held under the auspices of the Asia Federation of Natural Language Processing, in conjunction with the Second International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing. We hope that this collaboration will encourage the participation of a broad group of researchers.","This year’s workshop has assembled a diverse general technical program. With ten regular papers and six poster presentations, the general session spans topics from segmentation and part-of-speech tagging to semantics, discourse, and dialogue. Presenters represent institutions in Asia, North America, and Europe. We hope that these papers will engage the participants and promote wide-ranging discussion.","This year’s workshop also presents the results of the Second International Chinese Word Segmentation Bakeoff sponsored by SIGHAN. The First Bakeoff, held in conjunction with SIGHAN2 at ACL 2003 in Sapporo, quickly became the standard evaluation for segmentation systems, and we hope this new evaluation will prove to be a worthy successor. Twenty-three groups from eight countries participated in the evaluation, and their results as well as an overview comprise the Bakeoff section of the workshop.","We thank all who submitted papers. We greatly appreciate the time and insightful reviews provided by the members of the Program Committee. We also thank Tom Emerson for his great efforts in bringing together the Segmentation Bakeoff and all the bakeoff participants for their contribution to the success of the event. Finally, we would also like to thank the SIGHAN Board, the IJCNLP-05 workshop chairs, Yuji Matsumoto and Laurent Romary, and the publications chairs, Olivia Kwong and Jian Su, for their guidance and support.
