The technology of NLP has been achieving rapid growth through the accumulated industrialization experiences and vivid deeper research. We believe this progress is not only contributing to the knowledge society, but also playing an important role in economic growth through awakening the infrastructure of knowledge of the human brain and language functions.","Following the success of IJCNLP 2004, IJCNLP 2005 has made further progress. Not only do we have a big submission increase, but also more invited talks and more tutorials are organized. All these could not have happened without a lot of effort from the conference committees. I’d like to take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to the organizing chair Jong-Hyeok Lee, the program co-chairs Robert Dale and Kam-Fai Wong, the publication co-chairs Jian Su and Oi Yee Kwong, and all the other committee chairs for supporting IJCNLP 2005 enthusiastically. It is also my pleasure to thank the AFNLP President Benjamin T’sou, the Vice-President Jun’ichi Tsujii, and the Conference Coordination Committee chair Keh-Yih Su for their continuous advice.","Furthermore, I greatly appreciate the support from the sponsors of this conference: Jeju Province Local Government, KAIST, KISTI, ETRI, Microsoft Korea, Microsoft Japan, and Mobico & Sysmeta.","Last, we look forward to the active participation from you, the honorable guests, to make this conference a successful event.","October 2005 Key-Sun Choi Conference Chair","IJCNLP 2005"]},{"title":"Preface","paragraphs":["The Theme of IJCNLP 2005: “NLP with Kimchee”, a Conference with a Unique Flavor Welcome to IJCNLP 2005, the second annual conference of the Asian Federation of Natural Language Processing (AFNLP). Following the success of the first conference held in the beautiful city of Sanya, Hainan Island, China, in March 2004, IJCNLP 2005 is held in yet another attractive Asian resort, namely Jeju Island in Korea, on October 11–13, 2005 — the ideal place and season for appreciating mugunghwa, the rose of Sharon, and the national flower of Korea.","On behalf of the Program Committee, we are excited to present these proceedings, which collect together the papers accepted for oral presentation at the conference. We received 289 submissions in total, from 32 economies all over the world: 77% from Asia, 11% from Europe, 0.3% from Africa, 1.7% from Australasia and 10% from North America. We are delighted to report that the popularity of IJCNLP has significantly increased this year, with an increase of 37% from the 211 submissions from 16 economies and 3 continents received for IJCNLP 2004.","With such a large number of submissions, the paper selection process was not easy. With the very considerable assistance of our 12 area chairs — Claire Gardent, Jamie Henderson, Chu-Ren Huang, Kentaro Inui, Gary Lee, Kim-Teng Lua, Helen Meng, Diego Mollá, Jian-Yun Nie, Dragomir Radev, Manfred Stede, and Ming Zhou — and the 133 international reviewers, 90 papers (31%) were accepted for oral presentation and 62 papers (21%) were recommended as posters. The accepted papers were then assigned to 27 parallel sessions leading to a very solid three-day technical program. Four invited speeches were added to further strengthen the program; we are honored this year to have invited Bill Dolan (USA), Seyoung Park (Korea), Karen Spärck Jones (UK) and Hozumi Tanaka (Japan), all world-renowned researchers in their areas, to present their views on the state of the art in natural language processing and information retrieval.","IJCNLP 2005 is obviously a sizable international conference. The work of the Program Committee would not have been so smooth without the unfailing support of the other team members. In particular, we would like to thank Key-Sun Choi (General Chair) and Jong-Hyeok Lee (Organizing Committee Chair) for their continuous backing and their prompt responses to our numerous requests for information and assistance. Thanks are due to the Publication Committee Co-chairs, Jian Su and Oi Yee Kwong, for serving as the bridge between Springer, the authors, and the Program Committee. We are also very grateful to Benjamin T’sou, the President of AFNLP, for his invaluable advice at various stages in the development of the conference. VIII Preface","We hope you will take advantage of every aspect of IJCNLP 2005: the program and the presentations; the proceedings and the papers; the meetings and the people; the resort and the mugunghwa, as well as the food — especially the kimchee. Enjoy it .","October 2005 Robert Dale and Kam-Fai Wong Program Committee Co-chairs","IJCNLP 2005"]},{"title":"Conference Organization","paragraphs":["Conference Chair Key-Sun Choi","(KAIST, Korea)","Organizing Chair Jong-Hyeok Lee","(POSTECH, Korea)","Program Co-chairs Robert Dale","(Macquarie University, Australia) Kam-Fai Wong","(Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong)","Publication Co-chairs Jian Su","(Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore) Oi Yee Kwong","(City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong)","Publicity Co-chairs Hiroshi Nakagawa","(University of Tokyo, Japan) Jong C.
