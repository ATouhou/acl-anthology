All have been concerned with how knowledge of paraphrases can be useful in the field of natural language processing, and each has had a theme focussing on one aspect of how such knowledge of paraphrases can be acquired, codified and used. Because of its broad potential applicability, the subfield of paraphrase studies has occasioned interest from researchers from many institutions around the world. For this third workshop in the series, we received submissions from Asia, Australasia, the US and Europe. The accepted papers reflect this wide distribution of interest. All papers were peer reviewed in full by at least three members of the Program Committee. We would like to thank Program Committee members for their efforts this regard. We would also like to thank the organisers of the Second International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (IJCNLP-05), with which this workshop is associated, for their assistance.

As having been claimed by an increasing number of researchers, technology for generating and recognizing paraphrases can potentially benefit a broad range of NLP tasks including machine translation, reading assistance, multi-document summarization, information retrieval, and question answering. Motivated by this background, we organized international workshops on automatic paraphrasing in 2001 and 2003 (IWP2003), which successfully drew the growing interest of NLP researchers. As both workshops attracted attention and successfully finished, we will hold the third workshop in conjunction with IJCNLP-05, in order to collect existing and emerging research topics on automatic paraphrasing during the recent two years. The proposed workshop is intended to be the successor to these previous workshops. The goals of the workshop are to connect with a broader range of research activities related to automatic paraphrasing, and to place the workshops in a series with the aim of establishing a new research field. General Topics The workshop will be open to any research topic related to paraphrasing of any language. More specifically, topics of interest include, but are not limited to: • typology of paraphrases • representation of paraphrases • automatic acquisition of paraphrases • algorithms for recognizing and generating paraphrases • existing and potential applications of automatic paraphrasing • computational modeling of linguistic theories on paraphrases • open resources for paraphrasing technology • methods for evaluating paraphrasing technology Given the location of the workshop, papers focusing on paraphrasing within the languages of the Asia-Pacific region are particularly encouraged. Special Topic: constructing paraphrase-related resources The theme of the previous workshop in the series was the automated acquisition of paraphrase. A particular topic of interest for this workshop, then, is the issue of constructing paraphrase-related resources that would follow from this automated acquisition: What should these look like? How would dictionaries and corpora of automatically acquired paraphrases be defined?"]},{"title":"ii","paragraphs":["Organizers: Mark Dras Macquarie University, Australia Kazuhide Yamamoto Nagaoka
