For example, when we read a news, if title of the news includes a word “ (Yao Ming)”, as we know, “(Yao Ming)” is a famous China basketball athlete in US NBA game, so we could recognize the topic of the document is about “ , (Basketball, Sports)” with our domain knowledge. In this paper, we call the specific word “ (Yao Ming)” as a Domain Associated Term (DAT). A DAT is a word or a phrase (compound words) that enable humans to recognize intuitively a topic of text with their domain knowledge. In fact, domain knowledge is a kind of commonsense knowledge. We think that domain knowledge is very useful for text understanding tasks, such as text classification, document summariza-tion, and information retrieval.","In previous literatures, some researchers used knowledge bases for text understanding tasks(Scott et al., 1998), such as WordNet for English and HowNet for Chinese. We know that WordNet and HowNet are lexical and semantic knowledge resources. Other researchers tried to use commonsense knowledge such as field-associated terms for text understanding tasks(M. Fuketa et al., 2000, Sangkon Lee and Masami Shishibori, 2002). But the problem of limitation of size of such knowledge base is still a key bottleneck for using domain knowledge dictionary for text understanding tasks, and how to solve it is an ongoing research focus.","In the following content, we try to give an-swers to four questions: 1)What is our Chinese domain knowledge dictionary NEUKD? 2)How to learn DATs from a large amount of unlabelled data? 3)How to use the Chinese domain knowledge dictionary NEUKD for text classification? 4)Due to the problem of limitation of size of domain knowledge dictionary, how to solve the"]},{"title":"110","paragraphs":["problem and improve performance of text classification using domain knowledge dictionary?"]},{"title":"2 Domain Knowledge Dictionary","paragraphs":["We first introduce briefly domain knowledge hierarchy description framework (DKF) which includes three levels: Domain Level (DL), Domain Feature Level (DFL) and Domain Associated Term Level (DATL). The DL is the top level which defines many domains, such as “ (Sports)”, “(Military Affairs)”. The DFL is the second level which defines many domain features. A domain defined in the DL has a lot of domain features defined in the DFL. For example, domain “(Military Affairs)” has many domain features, such as “ (Army Feature)”, “(Weapon Feature)” and “ (War Feature)”. The DATL is the third level which defines many domain associated terms. Many domain associated terms could indicate a same domain feature defined in the DFL. For example, some domain associated terms, such as some domain associated terms, such as “ (Mid-East War)”, “(Iraq War)” and “(Afghanistan War)”, indicate domain feature “(War)”.","Since 1996 we employed a semi-automatic machine learning technique to acquire domain knowledge from a large amount of labeled and unlabeled corpus, and built a general-purpose domain knowledge dictionary named NEUKD according to the domain knowledge hierarchy description framework(Zhu Jingbo et al., 2002). Items defined in the NEUKD include domain associated term, domain feature and domain. Currently 40 domains, 982 domain features and more than 610,000 domain associated terms are defined in the NEUKD. Some instances of NEUKD are given in Table 1. Because the size of NEUKD is limited, so in following content we will study machine learning techniques to solve the problem of using NEUKD for text classification task. Domain Associated Terms Domain Features Domain  (Yao Ming) , (Basketball, Athlete)  (Sports )  (The Sanxia project)  (Irrigation Project)  (Irrigation Works)  (Match Season)  (Match)  (Sports )  (Arsenal Team)  (Football)  (Sports)  (Industrial and commercial bank of China)  (Bank)  (Finance) Table 1.

In the FLB learning procedure, some seed words are given in advance. In fact, seed words are some important DATs. For example, ten seed words of domain “(finance)” are (stock), (finance), (loan), (stock), (finance and economics), (bank), (tax), (foreign","exchange), (investment) and (stock","market). The FLB learning procedure is described as","follows:","z Initialization: Use a small number of seed","words initialize DAT set","z Iterate Bootstrapping:","Candidate DAT Learner: Learn some","new DATs as candidate DATs from","unlabeled data.","Evaluation: Score all candidate DATs,","and select top-n best DATs as new","seed words, and add them into DAT set.

In fact, we can regard bootstrapping as iterative clustering.

The score of a word is computed as:","iii"]},{"title":"RXwFLogwM u ),()(","paragraphs":["2 (1) Where F(wi,X) is the frequency of co-occurrence of word wi and X (set of seed words) in the same sentence, F(wi) is the frequency of wi in the corpus, and Ri=F(wi,X)/F(wi). The RlogF metric tries to strike a balance between reliability and frequency: R is high when the word is highly correlated with set of seed words, and F is high when the word and X highly co-occur in the same sentence. In the experiments, we use the corpus from 1996-1998 People’s Daily as unlabeled data which has about 50 million words. For domain “ (finance)”, we select ten seed words shown in above example, the bootstrapping-based DAT learning algorithm obtains 65% precision performance within top-1000 new learned DATs according to human judgment."]},{"title":"4 Domain Knowledge based Text Classification","paragraphs":["In this paper, naïve Bayes(NB) model (McCallum and K.Nigam, 1998) is used to build text classifier. We want to study how to use our Chinese domain knowledge dictionary NEUKD to improve text categorization. 4.1 BOW Model The most commonly used document representation is the so called vector space model(G.Salton and M.J.McGill, 1983). In the vector space model, documents are represented by vectors of terms (textual features, e.g. words, phases, etc.). Conventional bag-of-words model (BOW) uses common words as textual features. In the comparison experiments, we use the BOW model as baseline NB system. 4.2 BOTW Model As above mentioned, more than 610000 domain associated terms (DATs) are defined in the NEUKD, such as “(Yao Ming) ”, “ (The Sanxia project)”, and “ (Industrial and commercial bank of China)” shown in table 1. We use domain associated terms and common words as textual features, called BOTW models (short for bag-of-terms and words model). For example, in the previous examples, the DAT “(The Sanxia project, Sanxia is a LOCATION name of China)” can be used as a textual feature in BOTW model. But in BOW model(baseline system) we consider two common words “(The Sanxia)” and “(project)” as two different textual features. 4.3 BOF Model Similar to BOTW model, we use domain features as textual features in the NB classifier, called BOF model (short for bag-of-features model). In BOF model, we first transform all DATs into domain features according to definitions in the NEUKD, and group DATs with same domain features as a cluster, called Topic Cluster. For Examples, Topic Cluster “ (sports)” includes some DATs, such as “ (match season)”, “(Arsenal)”, “ (Olympic Games)”, “ (Table Tennis)”, “(Yao Ming)”. In BOF model, we use topic clusters as textual features for text categorization. Also the classification computation procedure of BOF model is same as of BOW model. 4.4 BOL Model To solve the problem of the limitation of NEUKD, in this paper, we propose a machine learning technique to improve BOF model. The basic ideas are that we wish to learn new DATs from pre-classified documents, and group them into the predefined topic clusters which are formed and used as textual features in BOF model discussed in section 4.3. Then these new topic clusters could be used as textual features for text categorization. We call the new model as BOL model(short for bag-of-learned features model) which could be consider as an extended version of BOF model.","First we group all DATs originally defined in NEUKD into a lot of topic clusters as described in BOF model, which are used as seeds in following learning procedure. Then we group other words (not be defined in NEUKD) into these topic clusters. The Learning algorithm is described as following: - Preprocessing: Text segmentation, extract-","ing candidate words, and sort the candidate","words by CHI method. As above mentioned,","all candidate words except stopwords which"]},{"title":"112","paragraphs":["are not defined in NEUKD will be grouped into topic clusters in this process.","- Initialization: These words, which are defined in NEUKD, are first added to corresponding topic clusters according to their associated domain features, respectively.","- Iteration: Loop until all candidate words have been put into topic clusters: Measure similarity of a candidate word","and each topic cluster, respectively.

The important issue of above procedures is","how to measure the similarity between a word","and a topic cluster.

When a new word w2 is added into topic cluster f1, we could get a new topic cluster f2. How to estimate the new distribution P(C|f2) is key step, where f2=w2f1. We could use the following formula (3) to estimate distribution P(C|f2) =P(C|w2f1). Similarly, we could know if the new word wn is added into topic cluster fn-1 to form a new topic cluster fn, we also could estimate P(C|fn)=P(C|wnfn-1) following this way, and so on. 2 2 1 2 2 2 1 1 1 2 1"]},{"title":"( | ) ( | ) ( ) ( | ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( | ) ( ) ( ) P C f P C w f P w P C w P w P f P f P C f P w P f      ","paragraphs":["(3)","We turn back the question about how to measure the difference between two probability distributions.

The NEU_TC data set contains Chinese web pages collected from web sites. The pages are divided into 37 classes according to “Chinese Library Categorization”(CLCEB, 1999). It consists of 14,459 documents. We do not use tag information of pages. We use the toolkit CipSegSDK(Yao Tianshun et. al. 2002) for word segmentation. We removed all words that had less than two occurrences. The resulting vocabulary has about 60000 words.","In the experiments, we use 5-fold cross validation where we randomly and uniformly split each class into 5 folds and we take four folds for training and one fold for testing. In the crossvalidated experiments we report on the average performance. For evaluating the effectiveness of category assignments by classifiers to documents, we use the conventional recall, precision and F1 measures. Recall is defined to be the ratio of correct assignments by the system divided by the total number of correct assignments. Precision is the ratio of correct assignments by the system divided by the total number of the system’s assignments. The F1 measure combines recall (r) and precision (p) with an equal weight in the following form:"]},{"title":"pr rp prF   2 ),(","paragraphs":["1","In fact, these scores can be computed for the binary decisions on each individual category first and then be averaged over categories. The way is called macro-averaging method. For evaluating performance average across class, we use the former way called micro averaging method in this paper which balances recall and precision in a way that gives them equal weight. The micro-averaged F1 measure has been widely used in cross-method comparisons.","To evaluate the performance of these four models based on NB classifier, we construct four systems in the experiments, including BOW, BOTW, BOF and BOL classifier. CHI measure is used to feature selection in all text classifiers. Figure 1. Experimental results of BOW, BOTW, BOF, BOL classifiers","In figure 1, we could find that BOTW classifier always performs better than BOW classifier when the number of features is larger than about 500. From comparative experimental results of BOTW and BOW classifiers, we think that domain associated items are a richer and more precise representation of meaning than common words. Because the total number of domain features in NEUKD is only 982, in figure 1 we find the maximum number of features (domain fea-"]},{"title":"114","paragraphs":["tures) for BOF and BOL classifier is less than 1000. When the number of features is between 200 and 1000, BOF classifier performs better than BOW and BOTW classifiers. It is also obvious that BOL classifier always performs better than other three classifiers when the number of features is less than 1000. As above mentioned, in BOL model, we use a machine learning technique to solve the problem of limitation of size of NEUKD, and group rest 65.01% words into predefined topic clusters as textual features in BOL model. So the classifier based on BOL model can yield better performance than BOF model."]},{"title":"6 Conclusions and Future Work","paragraphs":["In this paper, we first introduce our Chinese domain knowledge dictionary NEUKD. To alleviate the cost of construction of domain knowledge dictionary by hand, we propose a boostrapping-based algorithm to learn new domain associated terms from a large amount of unlabeled data. This paper studies how to improve text categorization by using domain knowledge dictionary. To do it, we propose two models using domain knowledge as textual features. The first one is BOTW model which uses domain associated terms and common words as textual features. The other one is BOF model which uses domain features as textual features. But due to limitation of size of domain knowledge dictionary, many useful words are lost in the training procedure. We study and use a machine learning technique to solve the problem to improve knowledge-based text categorization, and propose a BOL model which could be considered as the extension version of BOF model. Comparison experimental results of those four models (BOW, BOTW, BOF and BOL) show that domain knowledge is very useful for improving text categorization. In fact, a lot of knowledge-based NLP application systems have to face the problem of limitation of size of knowledge bases. Like our work discussed in this paper, we think that using machine learning techniques is a good way to solve such problem. In the future work, we will study how to apply the domain knowledge to improve other text understanding tasks, such as information retrieval, information extraction, topic detection and track-ing (TDT)."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["This research was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China & Microsoft Research Asia (No. 60203019), the Key Project of Chinese Ministry of Education (No. 104065), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 60473140)."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Chen Wenliang, Chang Xingzhi, Wang Huizhen, Zhu Jingbo, and Yao Tianshun. 2004.
