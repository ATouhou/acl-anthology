The paraphrases in dictionaries are generalized from the collection of example sentences which are gathered from the fields that seemed most feasible. Therefore compiling a dictionary always cost a great deal manpower, material resources and time. The renewed period of traditional dictionaries has not adapted to the increasing and changing of new words and new meanings, so using computers to help the compile of dictionaries is brought forward.","About the extraction for the definition, [zhang Yan, 2003] instructed a definition extraction means for Chinese terms, which based on Chinese syntactic parsing. They segmented and tagged the corpora of computer domain with part-of-speech firstly, then used two parsers to gain structures and phrases of sentences. They summarized the structures characteristics of term definitions and automatically extracted the patterns of definitions. Finally they gave an algorithm to define a new term according to their knowledge database. Their algorithm to define a term needs concept semantic knowledge and other knowledge, and segmented and tagged texts. In 2004, XU Yong et al presented an experiment of web based term definition retrieval system. For a given term, the system used the algorithm based on term definition patterns with indicated words to extract its definition. The two means of definition extraction are all for given terms, and have available to some extent.","We think that definitions are for terms, the paraphrases are suitable for letter-word phrases (hereinafter we will use “LWP” to denote “letter-word phrase”) in live Chinese texts in general field. Therefore in this paper we’ll discuss the principles of paraphrases of LWPs firstly, and then generalize their formalized patterns based on the collection of paraphrases of LWPs. Secondly, we’ll analyse the especial paraphrases, bilingual synonymous LWPs, and present an algorithm to obtain this kind paraphrases. Thirdly, we’ll label the LWPs using our auto-labeling software, and then put forward an algorithm to extract the paraphrases of LWPs."]},{"title":"2 The principles of our paraphrase of letter-word phrases","paragraphs":["LWPs, especially those prevailed in general media, many of them are terms or proper noun, and most readers have no acquaintance with them, so they want to know the meaning of them. With their"," 1 Sustentation fund: science fund (code: 60475022), and XIAMEN University start-up fund. 158 increasing quickly, we have to use machines to help extracting their paraphrases. But what is the extent? What are the principles?","With analyzing different requirements of dictionaries and investigating paraphrases of LWPs in live texts, we would conclude our interpretation criterion.","From the book by FU Huiqing, and the paper by LI Xiyin, we can conclude that traditional dictionaries use about four forms to interpret a word.","a) Genus name and differentiae addition. This pattern is used usually to define a term. The","differentiae would be properties, reasons, degrees, functions, effects, or extents etc..","b) Synonymous words interpretation. Interpreting a word with its synonymous words.","c) Translation with bilingual synonymous words.","d) Depiction, explanation. Depicting or explaining a word with its phenomenon, characters, relations,","parable etc.","[ZHENG Shupu, 2005] Russian Scelba considered that cyclopedias and common dictionaries are different in defining a word. Common dictionaries provide an interpretation to help readers to understand the meaning of a word, not a complete interpretation of the word. And long before ,Russian term scholar Liefu’ermaciji presented that terms in textbooks or in news papers are secondhand, which are derived from scientific terms, their interpretation demands are different from scientific term system, for they just relate to some keywords, and don’t relate to whole term system.","The LWPs in the paper were from general media, most of them were terms or proper nouns. According to the argumentation above, we think that paraphrases of LWPs are not the cyclopaedic definitions, they are generally common interpretations. In fact, for most readers it is better to give an interpretation like “a standard of information communication.”, “a sort of computer virus.” than a scientific definition. Thereinafter, our paraphrases of LWPs are common dictionary interpretations."]},{"title":"3 The paraphrases patterns of letter-word phrases in live texts","paragraphs":["Our paraphrases extracting process is based on no segmented and tagged texts, we have to find out","LWPs firstly, and then retrieval the paraphrase sentences. The paraphrase examples are a byproduct of our collating software, videlicet, during our collating","we can enregister the encountered interpretations by the record function of the software. So we get hold","of 400 paraphrases of LWPs. Some of these paraphrases are repeated, but they were from different texts,","and with different contents, with different points of view. They are beneficial for us to find patterns of","paraphrase. Through investigation, we find that there were two types paraphrases of LWPs, one has steady forms,","the other has no form. The former paraphrases with mark words. Such as: FAD2 是一种将饱和脂肪酸转化成不饱和脂肪酸的酶,对哺乳动物生长具有重要作用,在 菠菜等植物中存在。但是哺乳动物,包括人类体内不含这种酶,必须从食物中摄取。 可怕的电磁武器家族中还有“杀人雷达”,简称 RF/MO 武器。它是功率特强的射频、超高 频或微波武器,其发射功率从几亿瓦到几十万亿瓦不等。根据所发射电磁波不同的频率、 调制方式和功率强度,RF/MO 武器可以在人体的不同组织或器官产生不同的效应。人体 最易遭受电磁武器攻击的组织和器官是大脑、脖子、胸部和生殖腺。受到攻击时的症状 是身心疲惫、记忆紊乱、皮肤生病、眼睛出血、白内障、角膜和视网膜损伤,甚至罹患 癌症。","The “LWP是一种......的......”,“LWP,它是/是......”are mark words. The latter interprets a LWP","using its contexts without mark words, and readers may see the meaning from the contexts, such as: 据《日刊工业新闻》报道,硼同位素有 B10 和 B11,二者的存在比例为 20∶80。B10 能 吸收中子,用中子束照射浓缩硼,会产生阿尔法射线。它的能量足以杀死癌细胞,但又 不伤害正常组织,因而不会产生副作用。 除来自英国、加拿大、德国、法国、意大利、日本、美国和俄罗斯的 8 国领导人外,非 洲的南非、尼日利亚、埃及、塞内加尔、安哥拉 5 国的领导人也将参加会议。这在 G8 首 脑会议历史上还是第一次,凸显本次会议的非洲议题。联合国秘书长安南也将参加会议。 159","This sort LWP may have deep structure, but now we haven’t do farther analysis. This paper we only study these LWP’s paraphrases with steady forms.","From our invesitigation, we find that just three types of common dictionarie paraphrases are shown in the paraphrases of LWP, such as genus name and differentiae addition, translation with bilingual synonymous words and depiction, explanation.","The paraphrases of LWP, which could be formalized, can be divided into six groups, such as: a) the form with “是”, like “LWP 是一种......”, “LWP 是......的缩写|简称,是一种......”, etc. b) the form with “即”, like “......LWP 即|,即......” c) the form with “名为”, like “研制出|推出的|生产的|发现的名为 LWP......的......” d) the form with “称为”, like “被称为|简称为|称为 LWP ......的......” e) translation with bilingual synonymous words, like “中国石油集团物探局(BGP),世界贸易组织","(WTO)” f) dash paraphrases, like “......——LWP......”.","We don’t differentiate between simple interpretations and complete definitions in extracting process. We obtain interpretation sentences from LWP whereabouts to next sentence, for most interpretations of LWP are covered to this extent. We find that the two types interpretation, translation with bilingual synonymous words (we call them bracket interpretations) and “是” structure interpretation, take about 90 percent by our investigation, so this time we just extract the two types interpretation."]},{"title":"4 Interpretations of translation with bilingual synonymous words","paragraphs":["In Chinese texts bilingual LWPs can be classified as follows: A:complete Chinese character+( complete English corresponding words) B:complete Chinese character+( English abbreviation) C:English abbreviation LWP+( complete English) D:English abbreviation LWP +( complete Chinese corresponding words) E:bilingual LWP+(complete English or English abbreviation) F:complete English LWP+( English abbreviation) G:complete English LWP +( Chinese corresponding words) H:bilingual LWP +(Chinese or bilingual words) For instance: A:全球环境基金(Global Environment Facility,简称GEF)","无线局域网(WLAN,Wireless Local Area Network) B:全球环境基金(GEF)","国际标准化组织(ISO) C:TD—SCDMA(Time Divided Syn-chronization CDMA) GEF(Global Environment Facility) D:DOI(数字对象标识符)技术","COD(生化耗氧量)","“M—office”(商务干线) E:黑客QQ(Hack.OicqHack)","X射线扫描断层检查仪(CT) F:National Council for Social Security Fund,PRC(缩写:NaCSSeF) G:EVALUATION BASED ON RESEARCH(基于研究的评估)","EXCHANGE INFORMATION(交流信息) H:奥运艺术Swatch(斯沃琪)","ERP软件(enterprise resource planning,企业资源管理)","北京CBD(商务中心区) 160 ","About this type interpretation, we designed a module to process.","In order to extract this type interpretation, we must consider three didymous punctuations, such as “《补贴与反补贴措施协定》(“《SCM 协定》”)”, it contains 书名号, marks and brackets. We design a code system firstly, for codes are simple and contain more information than texts, and then an algorithm was put forward based the code system. a) The code system","this system memorizes the state about three didymous punctuations used in a bilingual LWP with six codes. Thereinto, the former twain codes denote brackets, the middle twain codes denote quotation marks, the latter twain codes denote 书名号. For every twain codes, the first one denotes whether one didymous punctuation appeared in a LWP, it has three meaning, such as “1 ” means the left punctuation appeared, “2” means the right punctuation appeared, and “3” the left or the right punctuation don’t appeared at first position of the LWP. The second one denotes position of one punctuation, it has three forms and four states, “1” the left punctuation appeared at first position of the LWP, “2” means the right punctuation appeared at first position of the LWP, “0” means one punctuation don’t appeared or had appeared in couples. For example, “113131” can denotes a left bracket appeared at left first position, and a left quotation marks and a left “《” appeared at other positions, such as “(“《SCM”. “103030” mean three didymous punctuations appeared in couples, such as “(“GATT1994”)”. b) The process flow","The first step, we need to scan a letter string in one text, and transfer the function iskuohao()to encode the letter string with our code system. The second step, according to the codes, judge whether any punctuations had not appeared in couples, and if there are such punctuations, then transfer the function iskq()to scan two sides of the letter string to obtain the other one of these punctuations. The operation order is brackets, then quotation marks, and then “《,》”. This step generally circulate two times. The third step, examine the string obtained from above step, if there are any quotation marks, then examine if there are any irregular punctuations within the quotation marks, if it is true, then take out the quotation marks part. If all punctuations in the string are in couples, then transfer the module, which obtains the collocation Chinese characters, and then record the bilingual LWP.","We have 712 items bilingual LWPs from the People’s Daily in 2002.","Here, we will chose “是” structure to illustrate our extracting experiment, the others we’ll discuss in future work."]},{"title":"5 the paraphrases patterns of “是” structure","paragraphs":["We conclude the paraphrases patterns from 400 examples of LWP paraphrases, such as:","a) “LWP 是......的......缩写”","b) “LWP 是......的......缩写,......,是......”","c) “LWP 是......的......缩写,......,意即......” Such as: CMM是软件“能力成熟度模型”的缩写,是一种用于评价软件承包能力并帮助其改善软件 质量的方法,是评估软件能力与成熟度的一套标准,侧重于软件开发过程的管理及工程 能力的提高与评估。","d) LWP 是......的......简称","e) LWP 是......的......简称,......,是......","f) LWP 是......的......简称,......,意即......
