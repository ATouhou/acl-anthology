This paper proposes a networked data mining method for relations discovery from large corpus. The key idea is representing the named entities pairs and their contexts as the network structure and detecting the communities from the network. Then each community relates to a relation the named entities pairs in the same community have the same relation. Finally, we labeled the relations. Our experiment using the corpus of People's Daily reveals not only that the relations among named entities could be detected with high precision, but also that appropriate labels could be automatically provided for the relations. Keywords: named entities pair, community, betweenness"]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Relation extraction among named entities (NR) is one of major tasks in information extraction (IE).The goal of relation extraction is to find out the relations among named entities(NE) in documents. In recent years, such technology has been widely used in many fields, such as: information retrieval, questionanswering systems, biology technology, construction of ontology, etc.","Many methods have been proposed for relation extraction, including supervised learning methods (Zelenko et al., 2002) [8], weakly supervised learning methods (Brin 1998; Agichtein 2000; Sudo 2003) [9][10][11] and unsupervised learning methods (Hasegawa 2004; Chen Jinxiu 2005) [1][2]. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method for relation extraction.","Currently, unsupervised learning methods for relation extraction have some difficulties. For example, in Hasegawa et al.'s method, they eliminated less frequent NE pairs, collected the contexts of NE pairs, clustered the contexts using complete linkage method, and finally selected the most frequent word in a cluster to label the relation in this cluster. However, the less frequent NE pairs might have relations, and it is difficult for complete linkage method to select the threshold.","In Chen Jinxiu et al.'s method, they firstly got the NE pairs labeled with relation in ACE corpus and collected their contexts, clustered the contexts using stability-based method, and finally used DCM method to label the clusters. However, we can't select NE pairs with relation in the unannotated corpus. And the relations of NE pairs might be in hierarchical structure; but the stability-based method can not discover the hierarchical structure.","Based on the issues mentioned above, this paper proposes a method to discover relations among NEs based on networked data mining. The advantages of this method is that there is no need to eliminate less frequent NE pairs and select the NE pairs which have relations. In addition, our method can automatically present the relations of NE pairs in the hierarchical structure.","The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 talks about the construction for networked structure. Section 3 explores the procedure of relation discovering and labeling. Section 4 describes experiments and evaluation of experiment results. Section 5 gives a discussion of the problems in existing methods. Finally, Section 6 gives a summary and talks about future prospect. 42"]},{"title":"2 Network constructing","paragraphs":["Many systems take the form of networks. Sets of nodes or vertices joined together in pairs by links or edges. Researches show that the distribution of these network vertices forms many communities, which means vertices are classified into different groups; there are many edges connecting the vertices inside a same group and few connections between groups. However, vertices in a same group could be divided into smaller, tighter structured groups. We call this group community [3] [13]. So we construct a network by NE pairs and their contexts for relations discovery. 2.1 NE pairs and their contexts We define NE pair as bellow: In the corpus, if there is a sentence si which contain 2 named entities ex,ey; and the number of words between ex,ey is no more than N, then ex,ey make a NE pair.","Firstly, we have to define a window of context (WINpre-WINmid-WINpost).

Thus, we just cut the edges with great betweenness to get expected communities [7].

This paper uses the method of DCM (Chen Jinxiu, 2005) [2] to set the weight of every word, considering the importance of the word in a certain community and all communities. Then we label the NE pairs’ relations with the word with the highest weight. Furthermore, we find that many communities just contain 1 NE pair in clustering result. And we find out a majority of these NE pairs without relation. So we collect these to be a set of NE pairs without relation. 44"]},{"title":"4 Experiment and evaluation 4.1 Manual annotation","paragraphs":["We quote 2 types of NE pair in annotated corpus of People's Daily (7 million characters) (Location-Person, Organization-Organization) as the research objects to verify the method in this paper.

E.g.总统-总书记, 外交部长-外相, etc. So we apply the method and software 45 package from<Word Similarity Computing Based on How-net>(Qun Liu, 2002)1","[16] to calculate the similarity between relations descriptive words in 2nd","level. According to the result, groups like {总统, 总书记},{外交部长,外相},{战胜,击败,赢} have 1.0 point of similarity between internal words, which means semantically the same. So we think the relations these words described are the same. Thus we combine these relations, and use the aggregation of these words to describe 2nd","level relations after combination. Finally we find out improved relation description is more reasonable, and more logical in real life application. Improved relation description is in Table 4. Table 4.

This procedure aims to find a one-to-one mapping function Ω from the TC to EC which is based on the assumption that for any two clusters, they do not share the same class labels. Under this assumption, there are at most |TC| clusters which are assigned relation type tags. If the number of the estimated clusters is less than the number of the ground truth clusters, empty clusters should be added so that |EC| = |TC| and the one-to-one mapping can be performed [2]; it is shown in equation (5). And the mapping procedure can be formulated as the equation (6). We also use our data and our evaluated method to evaluate Hasegawa’s method and Chen Jinxiu’s method.

We still hope to discuss some problems and related solutions from following aspects. • Context window • Size of corpus","Too big a window will bring much noise, which makes the edge among communities ambiguous and cannot get the good result. Too small a window will lose a lot useful information, which makes internal relation of community not tight enough, and will lose many important relations of NE pairs. This paper uses experience value when setup the size of context window. How to achieve best window size still need further research.","This experiment uses the corpus of People's Daily as research object. But the corpus is limited, so we can carry out the experiment based on Girvan and Newman(2003)’s method [4]. However, if the corpus is larger and the amount of retrieved NE pairs increase, we should apply A. Clauset(2004)’s method [6], in order to quickly find communities in larger scope network."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion and future work","paragraphs":["This paper presents a method of automatically discovering relations among NEs based on networked data mining. This method contains the advantages in Hasegawa and Chen Jinxiu's methods. As compare with their two methods, our method has the following features: it can retrieve the hierarchical structure relations in NE pairs with higher accuracy; it needn’t eliminate less frequent NE pairs; it can find out the NE pairs without relation; and it can combine the relation with the same semantic meaning. But this method has some space to improve in future work. Firstly we will try to verify such method based on bigger scope and specialized corpus. Secondly, we need to find out a better method to evaluate the hierarchical structure result and a better method to evaluate relation labeling."]},{"title":"Reference","paragraphs":["1.
