The Secrete History of the Mongols (SHM) is a special Mongolian histo\\rical document transliterated with Chinese characters as phonetic symbols, which featur\\e causes many multivariate analyses in later ages.

Yet till now, the exposition specially written for Chinese-transliterated characters a\\s phonetic symbols are only papers of Mr. Chen Yuan’s, namely An Inspection on Chinese Characters Used in SHM [1], which was published seventy years ago, and of Shiro Hattori’s A Study on Chinese-transliterated Characters from Mongolian in SHM [2], which was published in 1946.","In terms of the original text of SHM prior to the appearance of the vers\\ion of Chinese-transliterated characters, the well-known viewpoint is that the original text of SHM is\\ in Uighur letters or characters. The SHM of Chinese-transliterated character is at that times a cultural \\activity serving Ming Dynasty’s political, military and diplomatic purposes. The transliteration with Chinese characters definitely causes problems such as accuracy, pronunciation harmony and context consistency\\. Furthermore, it is difficult to avoid multi-errors such as copies of handwriting with wrongly written\\ words, or missed-out words, because of the procedures of manual copies in ancient times.","So far, there are neither an identical view on the classification of Chi\\nese-transliterated characters, nor an accurate statistics and frequencies of Chinese characters and sym\\bols in SHM. This paper tries to conduct comprehensive statistics and analysis of Chinese-transliterated \\characters on the bases of an electronic version of SHM and presents accurate character data of SHM [3\\].","The discussing object is based on the version from SibuCongkan ( ), a classical Chinese collection. Before discussion, we regulate some terminologies. The chara\\cters in main body of the text are called Chinese-transliterated characters from original Mongolian. Th\\e small characters in the left side of Chinese-transliterated characters represent different consonant \\pronunciation, called word initials. The small characters after Chinese-transliterated characters represent \\consonant differences in"," * This research is supported by the CASS Funds to Key Laboratory (phoneti\\cs and computational linguistics, MZ-101). 49  word endings, called word endings. It is necessary to point out that the\\ word initials and the word endings do not really stand for Mongolian sounds or syllables, in stead,\\ they are supplementary symbols for transliterating Mongolian letters to Chinese characters. Therefore, \\they will be treated differently while conducting statistics."]},{"title":"2 The Classification & its Principles of Chinese-Transliterated Charac\\ters","paragraphs":["Firstly, let’s focus on the form types of the Chinese-transliterated \\characters in SHM. There are two studies on the types of Chinese-transliterated characters between Shuang\\fu and Shiro Hattori, which show much differences from their viewpoints. Shuangfu lists altogether 5\\02 Chinese-transliterated characters [4], which are characters without word initials. Such as “\\ ”, “ ”, “ ”. In Shiro Hattori’s study, however, they may be “ ”, “ ” or “  ”, “","” etc.. Hattori Shiro lists 43 characters with word","initials “\\b ”, 22 characters with initials “\\t ” in his table of 563 items. For instance, “ ”, “  ”; “ ”, “ ","”. Apparently, Shuangfu’s classification is simpler. Only characte\\rs in main body of the text were embedded into his word table, without distinguishing character with or w\\ithout supplementary symbols. In addition, Shuangfu also excluded those characters which are used as a\\uxiliary symbols and never appear as independent characters, namely “\\b ”, “\\f ”, “ ”, “ ”. Table 1. Some difference examples between the two character lists A B A B A B A B A B A B           \\b \\b  \\t \\t        \\f \\f     "," ","               ","                ","   Note: A stands for Shiro Hattori’list; B stands for Shuangfu’s lis\\t","","From the classification approach, we know that Shiro Hattori’s standp\\oint of classification is clear and definite, because he regards Chinese characters as phonetic symbols,\\ and characters with word initials as a whole. But it is obscure that he lists word initial symbol\\s or word endings as characters into his table, such as “ ”, “ ”. In fact, these characters never appear as independent Chinese-tran\\sliterated characters in the main body of the text.","Secondly, there are some differences of character numbers and character \\forms between the two researchers’ lists. Please check table 1.","The number in the list of Shuangfu is smaller, in which there are no “\\ ”, “ ”, “ ”, “ ”, “ ”, “ ”, “ ”, “ ”, “ ” and so on. Some difference may be caused by different character fon\\t-types among simplified Chinese and traditional Chinese. For example, “ ” may be corresponding to Shiro Hattori’s “ ”. On the contrary, there are no characters “ ”, “ ”, “ ” in Shiro Hattori’s list.","It should be pointed out that both of the two researchers mark character\\s with phonetic symbols. So character “ ” appears twice in Shiro Hattori’s list, one is “qung”, and \\another is “hung”.","In terms of transliteration principle, the list of Shiro Hattori is far \\from perfect. Because he does not attach word endings to characters of the text main body, and characters \\with word initials are not the whole of them as well. For example, “ ” and “","”. The researcher here to be mentioned of is Ozawa Shigeo, who gives a perfect process to all the characters in his w\\ork [5]. In his work Ozawa Shigeo compiles a dictionary, in which all the characters are in the for\\mat of “word initial + character + word endings”. For example, “ "," ”, “  ”, “  ”, “ ”, etc.. 50 In this paper all the characters in the text main body are put into four\\ types, and the statistics will be","collected upon this principle. The four character types are as follows. \\ 1) Type C: Single characters. E g.“ ”, “ ”, 2) Type xC: Characters with initials. E g. “  ”, “  ”, 3) Type Cy: Characters with endings. E.g. “ ”, “ ”, 4) Type xCy: Characters with initials and endings. E.g. “  ”, “  ”"]},{"title":"3 The Number and Frequency of Chinese-Transliterated Characters","paragraphs":["According to the statistics on the original text, there are only 540 items of Chinese-transliterated characters in the main body part of the whole book, and they appear for \\90,457 times.

With regard to Chinese-transliterated characters, the numbers of their t\\ypes are 540 and they appear 90,457 times in the main body of the text. On average, every character a\\ppears 167.5129 times. However, the token for each character is quite different. Such as, there\\ are 124 characters, which only appear once. In addition, 56 characters appear twice and 21 characters a\\ppear three times among them. Although the 201 characters take 37.22% amongst all types of characters,\\ yet their token is only 0.33%. The character at the highest token takes 4,826 times, which takes rate o\\f 5.33% in frequency. Another case, which should be considered of, is that there are 27 characters, ea\\ch of which appears more than 1000 times, and each proportion is 5.00%. Furthermore, there are 51 char\\acters, each of which appears more than 500 times, and the proportion for each one is 9.44%. In additi\\on, the occurrence token for the two types are separately 56.46% and 74.67%. See table 3. Table 3. The first 20 Chinese-transliterated characters in frequency Chr. Token Rate Chr.

For example, character “ ” is usually used as a grammatical participle, meaning progressive aspect.","About the types of Chinese-transliterated character, as we mentioned abo\\ve, they are categorized into four types. Because there are only two types of word initials, one of wh\\ich is “\\b ”(8,896 times), another “\\t ”(6,637 times), the total types of characters with word initials ar\\e very limited. The number of xC type is 83 items, accounting for 8.6278% of all types. However, the frequencies of these types are far more than types of characters with word endings. Type xC appear 14,477 t\\imes, accounting for 16.0043% from all four types. Otherwise, there are 317 items in type Cy,\\ accounting for 32.9521% of the whole types. Yet the occurrency token is only 6,114 times, it only t\\akes the rate of 6.7590%. The number of type xCy is only 52 items, and appears 1,056 times, accounting\\ for 5.4054% of all types, taking the rate of 1.1674%. As to type C, the 510 items, accounting for \\53.0145% of all types, appear 68,810 times, taking the rate of 76.0693%. Pay attention to the followin\\g data. Table 4.

For example, character “ ” with word initial “\\b ” (type xC) shows the number of 3,707 times, but “ ” with initial “\\t ” only 3 times. Thus, it is definite that there are some errors withi\\n the handwriting process. Furthermore, with the comparison to type C and xC of “ ”, the frequency is still open to suspicion. The former is in frequency of 1,116 times, and the latter 3,707. Are they tw\\o characters? In the light of the SHM experts’ study, the two types of “ ” are due to “inconsistency character usage” [6]. Therefore, from the angle of statistics, any character “ ” without an initial is an error. Eldengtei has pointed out that type xC of “ ” rarely emerges within volume 1 or 2, which has been proved by the c\\omputing statistic data. In volume 1 “ ” emerges 362 times, none of which takes word initials. In volume 2, \\the number of “ ” is 478, among which there are only 8 items with initials. Yet from \\volume 3, things changed dramatically. “ ” appears 408 times in volume 3, among which there are 391 items of t\\ype xC. The same is to volume 4 and 5 and so on so forth.","Altogether, there are 15 word endings in the main body of the text. Howe\\ver, in fact, some of them are homophones, which are caused by the writers for representing origina\\l word meaning with Chinese radical. For instances, “ ”, “ ”, “ ” and “ ” are of the same pronunciation and of a little different senses. Some word endings may be fabricated arbitrarily or by miscopy. Table 5 \\shows the data and rates of the endings in the text. 52 Table 5.

For example, Only 20 items of Chinese charact\\ers can take both initials and endings with themselves. They are “ , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ”. On the other hand, the number of characters attached to with initi\\als is 87, and that of characters with endings is 317. Table 6.

In volum\\e 6, type xC and type xCy are slightly high. The reason need to be explored further.
