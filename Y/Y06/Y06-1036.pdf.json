Morphological analysis in the current methods, such as finite-state and unification-based, are predominantly effective for handling concatenative morphology (e.g. prefixation and suffixation), although some of these techniques can also handle limited non-concatenative phenomena (e.g. infixation and partial and full-stem reduplication). A constraint-based method to perform morphological analysis that handles both concatenative and non-concatenative morphological phenomena is presented, based on the optimality theory framework and the two-level morphology rule representation. Although optimality theory has been proven effective in handling non-concatenative phenomena, it has been applied for the generation process, and in this study, it has been shown to be effective also in morphological analysis. The method was tested on 1,600 Tagalog verb forms (having 3 to 7 syllables) from 50 Tagalog roots which exhibit both concatenative and non-concatenative morphology. The resulting method is able to produce the correct underlying forms of the surface forms of 96% of the test data, having a 4% error, which is attributed to d-r alternation. Keywords: morphological analysis, morphological generation, optimality theory."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Morphology is the area of linguistics that deals with the internal structure of words – how they are systematically formed from smaller units. Computational morphology deals with the processing of words and word forms in both written (graphemic) and spoken (phonemic) form. A morpheme is the smallest meaningful unit of a language. It could be a word stem or affixes. A free morpheme can stand alone, while bound morpheme functions only as part of a word. Affixation is the process of adding a bound morpheme to a free morpheme attached in front (prefix) or at the end (suffix) of a stem. The combination of a prefix and a suffix is called a circumfix. The infix is an affix where the placement is defined in terms of some phonological conditions. Reduplication requires copying of some portion of the stem. It can be complete or partial (prefixal, infixal, or suffixal reduplications). Infixation and reduplication are non-concatenative morphological processes.","Much of the work in Philippine linguistics focused on the Tagalog language [1]. Tagalog language exhibits a rather complex verbal system. A single verb may contain reduplicated syllables, prefixation or suffixation and at the same time infixation. Reduplication in Tagalog can be partial or full. There could also be a combination of such phenomena in one word especially seen in Tagalog verbs. For instance, the word pinanglilibang-libang has root word libang and prefix pang (with infix in), partial reduplication of syllable li and full word reduplication of libang.","Research on computational morphology has been predominantly on concatenative morphology and on finite-state models of morphotactics [2]. Although attempts were made to handle non-concatenative phenomena, it has been on a limited capacity only [3]. Optimality Theory is a phonological approach that is proven effective in handling non-concatenative morphology [4]. It has been applied for the generation process and never been used in morphological analysis. 273"," um.pili p.um.ili pi.um.li pil.um.i pili.um GEN Rules EVAL"," Faithfulness Constraints Surface Form Candidate set INPUT pili + -um- (UF) OUTPUT pumili (SF)",""]},{"title":"2 Optimality Theory for Morphological Generation","paragraphs":["The optimality theory architecture for morphological generation (as cited by [5], Fig. 1) has several components: the GEN and EVAL functions, the lexicon of root words, and the databases for the rules and constraints.               Fig. 1. The Generation Process in OT. ","GEN function when applied to some input, produces a set of candidates, all of which are logically possible analyses of this input. EVAL function when applied to a set of candidates, produces an output, the optimal analysis of the input. LEXICON stores root words of words that can be inputted to GEN. Rules as applied to GEN are restrictions imposed, made of licit elements from universal vocabularies of linguistic representation, such as segmental structure, prosodic structure, morphology and syntax. Constraints applied to EVAL are structural requirements of a candidate that may be either satisfied or violated by an output form. Ranking of these constraints are imposed. While constraints are universal, rankings are not: differences in ranking are the source of cross-linguistic variation.","A theoretical study was conducted by Fosler in exploring the possibility of parsing through the reversal of the generation process in OT [5]. The architecture is shown in Fig. 2. It attempts to recover the underlying form from a surface form through reversing the generation process. Fosler made extensions to Ellison’s approach of converting the constraints to finite-state transducers, showing the constraints to be regular.","       Fig. 2.

NoCoda ranks higher than the Align constraint. NoCoda requires that syllables must be open, while Align requires that the prefix (-um-can appear as a prefix or move slightly into the word to which it is attached [6]) should remain as close to the front of the word as possible. The winning candidate, gru.mad.wet, violated the Align and NoCoda constraints twice. The final candidate violated NoCoda twice also, but it was pruned since it violated Align constraints more times than the winner. The winning candidate has the least number of violations.  Table 1.

The GEN function produces an underlying candidate set based on the rules and patterns of the verb. This candidate set will be validated by the EVAL function and an optimal candidate will be determined, based on a set of constraints. The flowchart (in Fig. 3) shows the processes in parsing.                Fig. 3. TagMA: System Data Flow.  275","GEN function produces a candidate set. A candidate set is composed of underlying form candidates derived from the assumption that affixed and reduplicated verbs follow certain patterns. The GEN function produces any conceivable, possible underlying forms for a given input, under the morphological assumptions that are applicable. The candidate set shall be divided into separate paradigms. A paradigm is composed of candidates belonging to the same word structure classification. The following are the paradigms in this algorithm: Prefixed, Infixed, Partially Reduplicated, Full-Stem Reduplicated, and Suffixed.","There is a set of rules employed to produce each candidate for each paradigm. These rules account for the morphological analysis. The rules tokenize the input surface form into separate morphemes that represent the underlying form. Reduplication patterns according to French’s work [6] was employed which includes also the infixation phenomena. Prefixation and suffixation configuration is based on [7], [8].","Evaluation through the application of constraints, is the determining engine of the optimal UF candidate. Evaluation of candidates is done by paradigm. Constraints shall only be applied to an appropriate candidate. The EVAL function will determine the winner (a candidate with no violations of any constraint) and extract its morphological categories from the lexicon and pass it to a syntactic parser. There are four types of ranked constraints that are used by EVAL:","Co-occurrence: certain root words could only be combined with certain set of affixes. Violation score: 4","Lexical Lookup: affixes and stems/root words should be in the dictionary. Violation score: 3","Affixal /Reduplication constraints: for each of the paradigm, certain characteristics must be possessed by the candidate. Violation: 2","Morphophonemic/Alternation Rules: these are the spelling-change rules that may change/delete/insert certain characters in order to make sure that the words are actually following the correct alternation rules, before going up the hierarchy. In this case, it can be said that the success of the rest of the constraints in the upper hierarchy depends on this constraint. Violation: 1","TagMA system is the application of the theories taken from OT. The system can handle both concatenative and non-concatenative morphologies. To measure the accuracy and efficiency of the system, 1,600 Tagalog verb forms (having 3 to 7 syllables) from 50 Tagalog roots [8] which exhibit both concatenative and non-concatenative morphology, particularly infixation and reduplication, and performance evaluation was measured in terms of actual runtime, number of rules, and number of constraints used based on the sample set of Tagalog verbs.

In Table 2, the variance and standard deviation of the average number of candidates produced are presented.","Prefix and full-stem paradigms have 0 variance and standard deviation, which means that the number of candidates is predictable. In prefix, the number of syllables of a given input verb represents the number of conceivable candidates. Full-stem candidate depends upon the number of prefix candidates.
