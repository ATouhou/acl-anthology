This paper presents a computational analysis within the framework of a type grammar for the treatment of Japanese particles. In Japanese, particles express a number of functional relations; they follow a word to indicate its relationship to other words in a sentence, and/or give that word a particular meaning. We explain our parsing technique and discuss about various constructions using case particles and focus particles. We show how troublesome phenomena such as scrambling and omission of case particles are treated."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["As the need of software modules performing natural language processing tasks is growing, in depth grammatical analyses of sentences must be properly carried out. Grammatical analyses based on theoretically sound grammar formalisms are thus essential.","Treatment of case particles constitute an essential part of a grammar for the Japanese language, where the word order is relatively flexible. The role of case particles is functionally determined within a sentence: they indicate that the accompanying noun functions as subject, object, etc. But because case components are often scrambled or omitted and because case particles disappear when case components are accompanied by the topic marker wa or other special particles, it makes it difficult to syntactically analyze Japanese sentences.","Various studies in the literature discuss about the Japanese argument case marking and the treatment of Japanese focus particles. Here, we explore the treatment of Japanese particles within the Lambek style pregroup grammar.","The application of pregroups in natural language processing provides a rigorous formulation of the grammar of a given language. Pregroup calculations are very simple from a computational point of view. Furthermore, in analyzing a sentence, we go from left to right and imitate the way a human hearer might proceed: recognizing the type of each word as it is received and rapidly calculating the type of the string of words up to that point.","The reader might be curious to see a comparison of our grammar formalism with other existing formalisms such as HPSG. Indeed, it would be interesting to write our proof-theoretic analysis in terms of the model-theoretic HPSG framework. We could perhaps follow the HPSG analysis of Japanese presented by Siegel in [13], where particles are analyzed as heads of their phrases and the relation between case particle and nominal phrase is a head-complement relation. To account for the omission and scrambling of verbal arguments, Siegel introduces the attributes SAT, which denotes whether a verbal argument is already saturated, optional or adjacent, and VAL, which contains the agreement information for the verbal argument. Siegel also presents a Japanese head-complement schema which accounts for optional and scrambable arguments as well as for obligatory and adjacent arguments. Due to limited space, however, page-filling representations in the HPSG framework will not be further discussed. 142 2 Kumi Cardinal"]},{"title":"2 The calculus of Pregroup","paragraphs":["The concept of pregroup has been developed as an algebraic tool to recognize grammatically well-formed sentences in natural languages [8–11]. Pregroups are a simplification of the Lambek calculus [7]. In [6], Kiślak compares the strenght of the Lambek calculus and the calculus of pregroup, and shows that syntactic analyses can be translated from one framework to the other one by means of basic translation. Furthermore, Buszkowski formally proved that grammars based on free pregroups are context-free [1].","We formally introduce the notion of pregroup [8].","Definition 1. A pregroup is a partially ordered monoid in which each element a has a left adjoint","al","and a right adjoint ar","such that al","a → 1 → aal","and aar","→ 1 → ar","a. Here the arrow is used to denote the order1",". Consequences of the definition of pregroup are","the following identities:","1l","= 1, arl","= a, (ab)l","= bl al , aal","a = a, al","aal","= al",";","1r","= 1, alr","= a, (ab)r","= br ar , aar","a = a, ar","aar","= ar","; and the following implication:","if a → b then bl","→ al and br","→ ar",". In linguistic applications, we work with the pregroup freely generated by a partially ordered","set of basic types. From the basic types, we construct simple types: if a is a simple type, then so","are al","and ar",". Thus, if a is a basic type, then","· · · , all",", al , a, ar",", arr",", · · · are simple types. The compound types are strings of simple types. The only computations required are contractions, al","a → 1, aar","→ 1; and expansions, 1 → aal",", 1 → ar","a, where a is a simple type. Expansions are not needed for the purpose of sentence verification, but only contractions combined with some rewriting induced by the partial order.","Constructing a pregroup grammar for a language consists of assigning one or more types to each word in the dictionary, and then verifying the grammaticality and sentencehood of a given string of words by a calculation on the corresponding types."]},{"title":"3 Analyzing Japanese grammar","paragraphs":["We will study the pregroup freely generated by a partially ordered set of basic types for some fragments of the Japanese language2",". To begin with, there are a number of basic types such as the following: 1 Lambek originally used the ‘6’ symbol to denote the order in the pregroup but since the terminology is borrowed from category theory, he later adodpted the arrow for the partial order [11]. 2 The analysis presented is based on parts of my Master’s thesis [2]. 143 Type grammar meets Japanese particles 3 π = pronoun; n̄ = proper name; n = noun; s = statement when the tense is irrelevant; s̄ = topicalized sentence; si = statement,","with i = 1 for the non perfective tense;","i = 2 for the perfective tense; c1 = nominative complement; c2 = genitive complement; c3 = dative complement; c4 = accusative complement; c5 = locative complement. We also postulate: si → s; s̄ → s; n → n̄ → π.","To account for the free word order, we assign the type (cr 4, cr","1)si to a transitive verb, and the type (cr","1)si to an intransitive verb. What occurs between the parentheses is optional. Furthermore, the order of the elements in the parentheses can be random. 3.1 Case particles In (1b), the topic marker wa replaces the nominative case particle ga; wa is assigned the type πr c1, which is the type for the particle ga. In the example sentences given in (1), we use the partial order n → π to get the simplification of the type of the accusative complement.","However, we will prefer the alternative analysis in which we assign the new type πr","s̄sl","to the topic marker wa, as in (1c), such that the resulting sentence is of type s̄, that is, a topicalized sentence. One of the motivation for the choice of the type πr","s̄sl","is that we can differentiate topicalized sentences from sentences; other reasons will be given in a subsequent section.","(1) a. Watasi ga ringo o taberu.","π (πr","c1) n (πr","c4) (cr","4cr","1s1) → s1","I nom apple acc eat","I eat an apple.","b. Watasi wa ringo o taberu.","π (πr","c1) n (πr","c4) (cr","4cr","1s1) → s1 I top apple acc eat","I eat an apple.","c. Watasi wa ringo o taberu. π (πr","s̄sl",") n (πr","c","4) (cr 4s1) → s̄ 144 4 Kumi Cardinal","I top apple acc eat I eat an apple. The sentence Watasi ga ringo o taberu ‘I eat an apple’ has several variants, all meaning the","same. In (2a), the word order is changed; in (2b), the object is missing; in (2c), the subject is","missing; and in (2d), both the subject and the object are missing. The word-order flexibility and the omission of complements phenomena are tackled by assign-","ing different types to the verb. For example, in (2a), the verb taberu is assigned the type cr","1cr","4s1;","in (2b), taberu is assigned the type cr 1s1 while in (2c), it is assigned the type cr","4s1; and finally, taberu is assigned the simple type s1 in (2d).","(2) a.

Taberu.","s1 eat (I) eat (an apple). 3.2 Focus particles Japanese case particles are frequently omitted when the topic marker wa or a focus particle, such as made, bakari, sae, is added to a noun phrase. Moreover, when a sentence has a particular syntactic construction, a case particle can mark a different case than it usually does.","Various functional relations are expressed by particles in Japanese. For instance, particles such as bakari, dake, nomi specify focus in sentences. Focus particles bear different syntactic functions depending on where they appear in the sentence, so a Japanese parsing system needs to be able to correctly treat these particles.","In (3a), the focus particle mo replaces the accusative case particle o while in (3b), mo replaces the nominative case particle ga. The particle mo is therefore assigned the type πr","c4 in (3a) and","πr c1 in (3b) respectively.","(3) a. Watasi ga ringo mo taberu.","π (πr","c1) n (πr","c4) (cr","4cr","1s1) → s1","I nom apple also eat I eat an apple, too. 145 Type grammar meets Japanese particles 5","b. Watasi mo ringo o taberu.","π (πr","c1) n (πr","c4) (cr","4cr","1s1) → s1","I also apple acc eat","I, too, eat an apple.","In (4), the particle dake follows the proper noun Taroo. Assigning the type πr","π to the focus","particle dake and then using the partial order n̄ → π, we can analyze the nominative complement","Taroo dake ga and thus, (4) can be successfully parsed.","(4) Taroo dake ga ringo o tabeta.","n̄ (πr","π) (πr c1) n (πr","c4) (cr","4cr","1s2) → s2 Taro only nom apple acc eat-past Only Taro ate an apple. In (5), the particle dake follows the clause Taroo wa taberu. In this case, the type πr","π for","dake is inappropriate. We need to introduce a different type which will correspond to the particle","dake occurring after a verb. We thus assign the type sr","s to dake.","(5) Taroo wa taberu dake da.","n̄ (πr s̄sl ) s (sr","s) (sr","s 1) → s̄ Taro top eat only be Taro only eats. In (6b), the focus particle bakari follows the gerund tabete. We therefore assign the type ssl","to bakari.","(6) a. Taroo wa ringo o tabete iru.","n̄ (πr","s̄sl ) n (πr","c4) (cr","4ssl",") s1 → s̄","Taro top apple acc eat-gerund is","Taro is eating an apple.","b. Taroo wa ringo o tabete bakari iru.","n̄ (πr s̄sl ) n (πr","c4) (cr","4ssl",") (ssl",") s 1 → s̄ Taro top apple acc eat-gerund only is Taro has been eating just apples. In (7b), bakari appears in a different context; it follows the locative case particle de. We","therefore assign the new type cr","5c5 to bakari.","(7) a. Taroo wa gakko de hon o yomu.","n̄ (πr","s̄sl",") n (n̄r","c5) n (πr","c4) (cr","4cr","5s1) → s̄","Taro top school loc book acc read","Taro reads a book in school.","b.

The resulting type of the sentence gakusei ga kaita is then s2.","In (8b), the same verb form kaita appears in the context of a relative clause. The phrase gakusei ga kaita modifies the noun ronbun ‘article’, therefore, it must be of a different type than s2. This leads us to the introduction of the new type cr","1nnl","for the verb kaita occurring in a relative clause.","(8) a. Gakusei ga kaita.","n (πr","c1) (cr","1s2) → s2 student nom wrote The student wrote (an article).","b. [ gakusei ga kaita ] ronbun","n (πr","c1) n student nom wrote article The article that the student wrote. The type assignment of relative clause verbs is summarized in the following metarule.","Metarule 1 Any verb of type (cr","j , cr k)si also has type (cr","j )nnl",", where i = 1, 2 and j, k = 1, . . . , 5.","If we apply the above metarule to the verb kaita of the sentence (9a), we obtain the two relative clauses in (9b) and (9c).","(9) a. gakusei ga ronbun o kaita.","n (πr","c1) n (nr","c4) cr","4cr","1s1 → s1 student nom article acc wrote A student wrote an article.","b. gakusei ga kaita ronbun","n (πr","c1) (cr","1nnl",") n → n student nom wrote article The article that the student wrote","c. ronbun o kaita gakusei n (πr","c4) (cr","4nnl",") n → n article acc wrote student The student who wrote the article","In the following two example sentences, the topic marker wa replaces the nominative case particle ga. In (10a), sensei is the subject of yonda. In (10b), sensei is the subject of yonda and the subject of kaita is omitted. That is, sensei modifies yonda rather than kaita. This grammatical phenomenon can be generalized by the following rule: wa cannot cause a topicalization and an omission of the nominative case particle ga in a relative clause [12].","(10) a. sensei wa ronbun o yonda.","n (πr s̄sl ) n (πr","c4) (cr","4s2) → s̄ teacher top article acc read-past The teacher read an article. 147 Type grammar meets Japanese particles 7","b. sensei wa kaita ronbun o yonda.","n (πr s̄sl",") (nnl",") n (πr","c4) (cr 4s2) → s̄ teacher top write-past article acc read-past The teacher read the article that (someone) wrote.","However, if wa is assigned the type πr","c1 as first suggested, the sentence sensei wa kaita ronbun","o yonda is not correctly parsed, as shown in (11). Under this analysis, sensei wrongly becomes","the subject of kaita. In order to avoid this problem, the topic marker wa must be assigned the","type πr ssl",".","(11) sensei wa kaita ronbun o yonda.","* n (πr c1) (cr","1nnl",") n (πr","c4) (cr 4s2) → s2 teacher top write-past article acc read-past The teacher read the article that (someone) wrote. 3.4 Ga-no conversion The genitive case particle no usually transforms a noun into a possessive, as in gakusei no ronbun ‘the student’s article’, but it can also be used as a subject marker in a relative clause. In fact, when a relative clause includes a noun phrase marked with the nominative case particle ga, the case can be replaced by the genitive case particle no without difference in meaning (see [3]).","Relative clauses may be accounted for by the following metarule:","Metarule 2 Any verb of type cr","1nnl has also type cr","2nnl",". The relative clause gakusei ga kaita in (12a) contains the nominative case particle ga, there-","fore, we can replace the particle ga by the genitive case particle no and get the alternate relative","clause gakusei no kaita, which is illustrated in the example (12b). The type of the verb kaita in the phrase (12a) is cr","1nnl",". If we then apply the above metarule,","we get the alternate phrase (12b), where kaita has type cr","2nnl",".","(12) a. gakusei ga kaita ronbun n (πr","c1) (cr","1nnl",") n → n","student nom wrote article","The article that the student wrote","b. gakusei no kaita ronbun n (πr","c2) (cr","2nnl",") n → n","student gen wrote article","The article that the student wrote"]},{"title":"4 Conclusion","paragraphs":["In this paper, we proposed a parsing method based on pregroup grammar that properly treats Japanese case particles.
