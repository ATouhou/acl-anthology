How to improve the rankings of the relevant documents plays a key role in information retrieval. In this paper, a re-ranking approach based on topic words pair is proposed to improve precision while recall is preserved. The topic word pairs contain two correlated words, one of which is the original query word and the other come from the documents. The selection is based on Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing (PLSI). Then, the distribution of the word pairs is used to re-rank documents. Results show a 53.6% and 56.8% improvement compare to the initial retrieval without any re-ranking or query expansion on NTCIR-5 document collection for SLIR."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Since the number of electronic Chinese documents is growing very fast, efficient techniques for Chinese information retrieval are needed. In the past years, significant progress has been made on this problem by researchers in the field of information retrieval (IR) and many retrieval models, indexing strategies, query expansion and re-ranking strategies have been successfully used in IR.","How to improve the rankings of the relevant documents plays a key role in information retrieval. In general, there are three kinds of information could be used for re-ranking: 1. Document information","The clustering information has been used by Kyung-Soon Lee et al. [6]. Both the clusters and initial","retrieval results have been used for re-ranking. Jaroslaw Balinski and Czeslaow Danilowicz [9]","investigated ways to re-rank documents utilizing the inner distance between them. 2. Query information","In the re-ranking phase, Mitra et al. [7] considered the correlation of query words. They add","constraints to the query terms in order to get stronger indications for document relevance. Qu Youli et","al. [8] described their method utilizing the location information of query terms. 3. Additional information","Dequan Zheng et al.[10] adopt ontology information to re-rank documents.","Currently, re-ranking using query information alone has some difficulties: this method neglects query words’ semantics. For example, document may be considered not relevant to query if they have not matching terms even though they are the same in semantics. Re-ranking using additional information (such as ontology, dictionary and so on) has other problem: the construction of ontology is still difficult. On the other hand, adding additional information into the query is equivalent to query expansion, which may cause a drift in the focus of the search topic. For example, 查询运动媒体或运动相关产业表彰老 虎伍兹为运动明星的报导(Find documents about sports media or related enterprises recognizing Tiger Woods as a sports star), many system will add “高尔夫”(golf) to the query, as a result documents will get high score if they contain “高尔夫” with high frequency, though the document talk about other linksman.","Then in this paper, we present a re-ranking method utilizing both document information and query information. The main process is that: 1. Initial retrieval 2. Select topic word pairs. The topic word pair"," 1 The paper is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), (Grant No.60496323; Grant No.60375016 Grant No.10071028;); Ministry of education of China, Research Project for Science and technology, (Grant No. 105117).  237 means two words which strongly represent a topic. It contains exactly one of the original query words wq and the other word wd is from documents. The reason why use topic word pair can improve precision is that the two words are highly correlated. They describe the topic more exactly. They can focus on the search topic and give stronger indications of relevance. Thus, only the documents contain both wq and wd can be affected. 3. Re-rank documents based on the distribution of the topic word pairs. Our topic word pair selection process is based on Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing (PLSI). Specifically, we look for the pairs with the strongest correlation in latent semantic space. The selection process is achieved automatically.","The structure of this paper is as follows. In the next section, we will give a brief review of hybrid indexing and retrieval model. In section 3, we describe the topic word pair and its selection. In section 4, we give the document re-ranking method. In section 5, we evaluate the performance of our proposed method and give out some result analysis. Finally, we conclude."]},{"title":"2 Retrieval Model and Indexing Strategy","paragraphs":["Research work compared the retrieval effectiveness using different types of terms. In general, retrieval based on Chinese characters has the best recall while retrieval based on words or based on bi-grams has the best precision. To overcome the shortcomings of one type of term, we use hybrid index [1]. Firstly, words can be extracted automatically and then bi-grams are extracted at parts of the documents where the out-of-vocabulary problem occurs. Note that we also index single-character words if it is not a stop word. All these words and bi-grams used as index units. In addition, TFIDF retrieval model is used in our experiment."]},{"title":"3 Topic word pair","paragraphs":["The topic word pair is two words which strongly represent a topic.

Document Re-ranking","paragraphs":["Documents re-ranking is a method to sort the initial retrieved documents without doing a second retrieval. It's expected that the more a document is relevant the higher ranking it should have.","In this section we describe our re-ranking method which is based on distribution of topic word pairs. Our proposed approach integrates the information from the span of the two words in a pair, relative 239 document frequency and the document-query similarity. As already defined, let D be the result set for query q, L be the list of topic word pair, a be a word pair in L. We re-rank D considering the following factors: 1. Span: For each word pair (wi , wj) in the list L, we consider the span | position(wi )-position(wj ) | in document where position(w) is the sequential position number of w in text [4]. Intuitively, the shorter the span is, the higher is the weight of the document. 2. The weight of the word pair (wi , wj): The weight is calculated by formula 7, the higher it is, the closer wi is related to wj, thus the more important it is. 3. Relative document frequency: The ratio of document frequency of a word pair in the top 1000 document against the document frequency of it in the whole document collection. Obviously, the higher the ratio is, the more important the word pair is [5]. 4. The original similarity S between document and query: With both these information taken into consideration, document score is then calculated by the following formula.

Then, we use the new ranking score to re-order the 1000 documents."]},{"title":"5 Experiments and performance evaluation 5.1 Test collection","paragraphs":["We evaluated re-ranking method with a test collection which is composed of NTCIR5 test collection for the single language (Chinese) information retrieval task. Then we only use field DESC as query and evaluate our methods on 20 topics. Standard trec_eval tool is used to compute the mean average precision (MAP) scores and the precision after R (= num_rel for a query) docs retrieved. 5.2 Experiments and results In this section we report results from experiments we conducted to evaluate the influence of the suggested re-ranking method on search precision. As a baseline we use the lemur version 4.1 system.","The first experiment is designed to test how many topic word pairs used to re-rank documents affects the precision. Firstly we suppose that the number depends on the length of original query because too few topic word pairs have not enough information while too many bring much noise. Then (2m-1) word pairs are automatically chosen for each query empirically, m is the number of indexing unit in query.","The results of evaluation are presented in table 1. Column 2 (Rigid) displays the precision of rigid relevant measure and Column 3 (Relax) uses relax relevant measure.

We can see that compared with original result without re-ranking, our proposed method can improve PreAt5 by 15% from 0.4960 to 0.5720 in relax relevant measure and improve 13% from 0.3520 to 0.3980 in rigid relevant measure.

The result is shown in Table 3. Column[Rigid] shows the average results of rigid relevant measure and Column[Relax] use the Relax measure. Row[PLSI] give the MAP result when PLSI is used to select topic word pair and Row[MI] select word pair based on mutual information. Both the selection method improves MAP clearly.

We have presented evidence that our proposed method is one which can produce significant improvements over the method based on similarity search ranking alone.","In this paper, how to choose the number of topic word pair is something to consider and we have supposed that the number depends on the length of original query. The experiments show it works generally and also show that using topic word pairs is not always effective if the word is wrongly segmented and leads to another meaning. Maybe term should be the better unit to form a pair. Another conclusion is that the selection process of topic word pair is not unique, it doesn’t rely on specific arithmetic.","For the future work, we will try to improve the quantity of topic word pair and do some experiments for re-ranking utilizing term pair."]},{"title":"Reference","paragraphs":["1.
