The monophthong formants were measured using LPC method. The mean value and deviation of formants were given with statistical meaning.

Introduction ","paragraphs":["There have been researchers on the monophthong formants characteristics of Mandarin (Putonghua) since 1960’s[1][2][3]",". Because the number of the speech samples was limited, the results were insignificant in statistics and can not be used to describe the group characteristics of the monophthong formants of Mandarin.","The computer aided Putonghua Shuiping Ceshi (Mandarin level testing) technique has been studied in Communication University of China since 1996. To develop computer aided PSC technique, it needs a statistical survey of the Mandarin speech characteristics with a large number of samples.","Using the Mandarin speech database recorded in the Communication University of China, the monophthong formants of 212 trained female students and 126 trained male students were measured and analyzed. The result is meaningful in statistics. It should be helpful to the study of the group characteristics of Mandarin monophthong formants. It is also helpful for the study of parametric speech standard of Mandarin.  "]},{"title":"2. Measurement method ","paragraphs":["The statistical survey is based on the Mandarin speech database in the Communication University of China. All speakers are students from the broadcaster’s department, aged from 19 to 21 years old and have been trained for 1 to 3 years. 212 female students and 126 male students were measured.

These 10 monophthongs of Mandarin are selected according to reference [4], and it is not completely same with the monophthong catalogue used by other researchers. Usually, ê[ε] is only used as the mood word “G()”,and its voice is unstable. In phonetics, there is dispute of whether the vowel should be put into the Mandarin speech frame. In this paper, considering the special application background, ê[ε] is dealt with as an independent monophthong.","The software used to measure the formants and is SFSwin. The LPC technique is used in SFSwin with a formant trajectory estimation dynamic program to get the optimum formants estimation[5]",".","","Table 2.

Since the speakers in this test are being trained as professional broadcaster, they are required to speak the vowels independently. If it is really too difficult to speak the monophthongs independently, then they can speak the Mandarin character with the monophthong as the final. The monophthong is then cut from the sound of the character in signal processing.","For signal processing, all recorded monophthong signals are checked by listening. The data with deficiencies are repaired or cut into the stable pieces. The processed sound files are then put into the SFSwin to measure the first five formants and the fundamental frequencies. Based on the analysis, it found that tones has no meaningful affection on formants, therefore all sound samples in this paper are with the first tone (plain flat).  "]},{"title":"3.

For each formant, the ratio of standard deviation to the mean frequency of the formant is listed in Table 4.","Although 212 female students and 126 male students were recorded, the number of effective sound samples is not the same as the number of students because some sound samples are not correct or with deficiency.

The frequency of F1 and F2 are labeled in mel to be consistent with that used in phonetics. Compared with Fig. 2-13 in Ref. [4], it can be seen that in Figure 5 and Figure 6, [o] is outside the vowel triangle composed of [i], [u], and [a], while in Ref. [4], [o] is inside the vowel triangle. It is not clear whether the Fig. 2-13 in Ref. [4] is meaningful in statistics, and whether it is the male data or female data. The fact that [o] is outside the vowel triangle in Figure 5 and Figure 6 is from the practical statistical survey. The difference from Ref. [4] possibly means that speaking style of the students has been changed with the time, at least the speaking style of the trained students group has been different from that decades ago[7][8]",", or different from the subjects used in Ref. [4]. Compared Figure 5 with Figure 6, it can be seen that the triangle in Figure 5 for female students is similar to the triangle in Figure 6 for male students, but it is larger than the male triangle. This may imply that besides the absolute value of formants, there are some other attributes in the listening perception of sound that has not been completely revealed by current studies.

The subjects in the work of this paper are all with the age from 19 to 21 years old and are all university students. The number of subjects is large enough to guarantee the survey with statistical meaning and produce the typical formants data representing this subject group. It is not meaningful to comment whether the data in this work is more precise or more correct than the data measured by other researchers, because the work in this paper has been the first time to survey the 285 Mandarin monophthongs with very large number of subjects for a specified group.  "]},{"title":"4. Summary ","paragraphs":["The work of this paper is the first time to conduct a statistical survey of Mandarin monophthong formants for the students being trained as broadcasters in Communication University of China. The result for female group is different from that of male group. Generally, a formant frequency of female is higher than the corresponding frequency of male formant. This is believed to be caused by acoustic model of monophthongs. Different subject should possess different formants. But, different subject can make the same listening perception of a specified monophthong. Therefore, although the statistical survey of monophthong formants is very useful for monophthong synthesizing and the study of voice source mechanism, more important study should be conducted to explore the listening perception mechanism of monophthongs.
