This paper discusses the problem of sorting orders of Tibetan dictionar\\ies and Tibetan electronic databases. The alphabetical sequence of Tibetan language has \\being gradually formed by popular usage in the long history, in which many cognitive senses and cu\\ltural connotations lie embedded of Tibetan people, also there are a few influence of foreign el\\ements and irrational elements. However, on the bases of the analyses of the background, the p\\aper proposes three standardizing principles for compiling Tibetan dictionaries: agreement, \\compatibility, and rationality. In light of the three principles, the paper designs a set o\\f digital codes for each letter or character and assigns distinctive sorting values to all existing words in the electronic dictionary with corresponding algorithm, which revises some serious errors in a previous\\ paper. The method of compiling Tibetan word order mentioned above has been accomplished in ou\\r software system.

A dictionary sequence is not innate\\ from the beginning, but gradually formed through common usage in a long history. So before discu\\ssing a compiling word order of a Tibetan dictionary, it is necessary to find out the development of \\its order, which may help readers to comprehend where the problem of the Tibetan alphabet order is.","Firstly, to let the issue clear, it is necessary to introduce briefly the Tibeta\\n graphic structure. In figure 1, a Tibetan word or morpheme consists of not more than 7 letters\\, in which the base letter(Ba) is the core letter and the first one in structural sorting order, then the \\rest of the order is prefixed letters(Pr), head letters(Up), subjoined letters(Lw), vowels(V),\\ suffixed letters(Sx). However, except the base letters, any other letters may be absent in the structure. Therefor\\e, any structures with vacant letters will make special Tibetan graphic structures, which will change the orde\\r of different graphic forms (Figure 2). Furthermore, there exists different letter number in each \\position of graphic structures and the letters are in the order of alphabet sequence of their own.2","The process of compiling order of a graphic form is that, choose letters by the alphabet sequence within the\\ lowest position, such as position 7, after alternating all the letters in the layer, then enter into the a\\bove layer, and do the alternation again, after each change, return to the lowest layer, and run the previo\\us circle. After the alternation goes through each position and each layer until the base letter changes,\\ then a sorting order shifts to next graphic form with another base letter by the alphabet sequence. Read the\\ complicated process in detail with reference [1] and [2]."," *","Funds Supported: Ministry of Education of China (MZ115-020), National Natural Science Foundation of","China (No. 60173024, 60473135). 1","There are only base letters and some subjoined letters in Unicode Standa\\rd, which are not available to process","the word order directly.","2","Thonmi Sambhota, the creator of written Tibetan scripts, pointed out in \\his great book Sum cu pa (On grammar)","that the thirty letters are divided into seven groups and a half by four\\ together in each group, which shows the","letter sequence 1300 years ago. 231    ","Csoma de Körös compiled the earliest Tibetan dictionary with an al\\phabet sequence in 1834, which is Essay towards a dictionary, Tibetan and English. [3] This dictionary is not really a dictionary wit\\h Tibetan structural and alphabet order in that he compiles it with Latin \\alphabet order, in which any prefixed letter and head letter are viewed as the same as basic letters.\\ Hence, after compiling words with prefixed letters, such as g, words following are ones with head letter g\\-, no matter what the basic letters are. While the other base letters emerge afterwards words with prefixed \\g- will not appear any more in this way. It is the same with head letters. Once you compile base letter\\ r, including head letter r- as well, it means that there is no head letter r- again in the rest of the dictio\\nary. By the way, we also need to know that the Tibetan sorting order is quite different from its handwrit\\ing sequence (Figure 3).","In 1866, Hermann August Jäschke published his Romanized Tibetan and E\\nglish Dictionary, which follows the tradition of Tibetan alphabet and the structural sorting ord\\er, which becomes the sorting model of Tibetan dictionaries later.[4] After Jäschke, another three \\important dictionaries came off the press. They are Tibetan-English Dictionary with Sanskrit Synonyms (by Sarat Chandra Das in 1902), [5] A Tibetan Dictionary by Dge bshes chus kyi grags pas in 1949, [6] A Tibetan-Chinese Dictionary by Zhang Yisun (chief editor) in 1985. [7] However, along with words growing in number, many errors and chaos emerge in sorting orders of Tibetan dictionaries, which will be di\\scussed at next section."]},{"title":"2 Disagreements among Different Dictionaries","paragraphs":["There are three reasons for the disagreement among different dictionarie\\s. One is that there are no criteria on sorting orders of Tibetan-transliterated letters from Sanskr\\it. Another is that the nature of some character forms are still not clear, which causes compilers disagre\\e with each other. The third is whether a dictionary ought to contain those forms of Tibetan sounds newl\\y-emerged in its phonology or not.","The most troublesome problem comes from Tibetan-transliterated letters f\\rom Sanskrit. In such letters retroflex letters exercise much influence upon the sorting order\\, which are (tt), (tth), (dd), (nn), (ssh), and they appear with the sequence in the following dictionaries\\.","H.Ä.Jaschke views the retroflex letters as the same positions and lay\\ers as base letters in his A Tibetan-English Dictionary, however he only collects two of them, and gi\\ves the order like (tt), (dd), (t), (tth). [8] That is to say, the Tibetan-transliterated letters emerge p\\rior to Tibetan letters in the sequence of dictionary entries. This method will surely do great damage \\to the principles of Tibetan tradition of 30 letters. 3","Therefore, it is not a good idea and method.","Melvyn C. Goldstein puts retroflex letters under the corresponding lette\\rs, such as entries with (tt) embedded in the entries with (t), (dd) in those with (d), in his Tibetan-English Dictionary of Modern Tibetan.[9] However, some disorders still exist in his dictionary. For e\\xample, under the condition of the"," 3 About the Latin transliteration of Tibetan letters, please consult [8].\\ 232 same vowels, (tta) appears after (ta). The sequence is (ta), (tta), (taa), t(tag)......, (ti)......, (tu). Yet (dd) changes the criterion, in which the sequence is (da), t(dag), (dal), (dda), t (ddag), (di), ......, (du), ......, (de), ......, (des), (dde), (dden), (do), t(dog), (ddo), t (ddog). In another words, (dd) emerges after the alternation of suffixed letters or before the a\\lternation of vowels. Obviously, Goldstein makes wrong use of two different criteri\\a on his compiling word order.","The compiling method of Zhang Yisun(chief editor) in A Tibetan-Chinese\\ Dictionary is not the same as that of Goldstein for (ta), his sequence is as: (ta)...(ti)...(tu)...(to)... (tos)...(tta)... (ttam)...(tti)...(twa)..., namely (tta) follows (ta) with all the alternations of vowels and suffixed letters, or emerges only before subjoined letters. As for (dd), it seems to insert itself into different vowels, which is in the same sequence as that in Goldstein’s dictiona\\ry.","Another type of letters, which may influence the sorting order, is Tibet\\an-transliterated composed characters from original monographic letters of Sanskrit. They are (gh), (ddh), (dh), (bh), (dzny), (dzh). However, the processing method for these letters in modern dictionaries\\ always disintegrates them into two independent letters, the above one is base letter, and the other is su\\bjoined letter. As subjoined letters, (ny) appears before the normal subjoined letter (w) and (y), (h) follows subjoined letters (r) and (l).","As mentioned above, people have different ideas on the nature of the identification of the \\mark (va chung). It is a mark concerning three vowels, (aa), (ii) and (uu). H.Ä.Jaschke did not give the mark a clear and definite identification, and let it appear freely in his dicti\\onary, which is a common phenomenon in early dictionaries. In A Tibetan-Chinese Dictionary, (va chung) follows the corresponding vowels, and before the alternation between vowels and suff\\ixed letters. For example, (ka), (kaa), t(kag), (da), (daa), t(dag); (di), (dii), t(dig). In A Tibetan Dictionary by Dge bshes chus kyi grags pas, (va chung) appears at the position before vowel alternations and after\\ the alternations of suffixed letters. For instance, (ka), t(kag), (kar), (kaa), (ki); (sha), t(shag), (shas), (shaa), (shi), (shu).","If mark (va chung) is a long vowel, is it a variant to vowels or another vowel\\, which is the nature of the mark. Different ideas will make different compiling word orders. Per\\haps the process in A Tibetan Dictionary is a recommendable plan.","In recent years, some newly written forms emerged in Tibetan texts becau\\se of sound changing. Such as (hpha), which comes from the interpretation of sound /f/. How to arran\\ge the new form in compiling word order in a dictionary is an issue of standardization. According to \\the experience of processing Tibetan-transliterated letters from Sanskrit, (ph) may be viewed as a subjoined letter, which is not in conflict with the traditional subjoined letters. Therefore, it may appea\\r before subjoined letter w in line with the alphabet sequence. It is pity to say that it appears after the \\subjoined letter w in A Dictionary of Tibetan-Chinese, Lhasa Dialect.[10]","","Besides the above problems, there are quite a few abnormal phenomena of \\sorting orders in dictionaries. Such as subjoined letter w emerges before the alternation of vowels and suffixed letters in A Tibetan Dictionary. For example, t(ga), (gwa), tt(gag); (gra), (grwa), t(grag); (da), (dwa), t (dag), (dang), (dwang), (ra), (rwa), t(rag). This means that all the structural sequence and layer based on base letters are in chaos or in confusion. 233"]},{"title":"3 Standardization: Agreement, Compatibility, and Rationality in Sortin\\g Order","paragraphs":["It is necessary to set up principles in advance while compiling a dictio\\nary. For Tibetan dictionary, there are three important things to do with. First, we need a strict standardi\\zation for the agreement accepted by the people through long social practice in history. Secondly, we ough\\t to arrange forms, homogeny or heterogeneity, together rationally for compiling word order in common sequence. Thirdly, we should objectively understand the complicated phenomena, established by differe\\nt usage, such as ambiguous symbols in semantics and symbolic variability.","In the light of the above three aspects of standardization, this session\\ will give out a referential scheme to Tibetan dictionaries or electronic Tibetan dictionaries on its\\ sorting order, in which some reasonable sorting values may be set up.","3.1 All 30 Tibetan letters will enter into the sorting order of dictiona\\ries according to the traditional alphabet sequence, including retroflex letters, which follow the corresp\\onding normal letters as subentries.

Here we need add an identification mark b\\etween subjoined letters and vowels to revise the useful value table in [1], in which 0 represents normal base letters, and 1 represents retroflex letters. see table 2.

The same is to the rest tables. 234 Table 3. head letters and their sorting values letter t trans. k kh g ng ny t tt th tth d dd n nn value 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 letter trans. p ph b m ts tsh dz w r l sh ssh s h value 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27","","In [1] we have discussed the special situation on different types of syl\\lable structures, in which an identification mark is used to sorting values of prefixed letters.

To match the three vowels \\with va-chung, we regard (ee) and (oo) from Sanskrit as long vowels although they may be diphthongs ‘\\ai’ and ‘au’ in Sanskrit. The position of each long vowel is in the rear of the corre\\sponding short vowel in the sorting sequence.
