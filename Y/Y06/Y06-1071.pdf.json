Based on large-scale bilingual corpora and the theories of vector space model and lexical mutual information, this paper explores the application of the traditional monolingual IR technology to converting the translation of query sentence to the computation of the boost value of query keyword translations in the bilingual dictionary, so that the target language query sentence is reconstructed.

CLIR integrates the traditional monolingual information retrieval technology with machine translation (MT) technology. It is becoming a worldwide subject of crucial importance in the Information Age, as proved in some way by the fact that CLIR is included from time to time as an important subtask in the annual event of Text Retrieval Conference (TREC).","In CLIR systems, the query sentence is usually input as a combination of a series of keywords rather than a sentence in its exact sense. Due to the absence in the series of query keywords of necessary syntactic and semantic information, traditional MT technology [1, 2]","can not be readily used for the precise translation of the query sentence. In this paper, a new translation and transform algorithm of query sentence is proposed. This approach is based on large-scale corpora, traditional monolingual IR technology and the theories of vector space model (VSM) and lexical mutual information [3, 4]","."]},{"title":"2 Query and Query Transform","paragraphs":["In cross-language information retrieval, the input is often a combination of a series of keywords rather than a complete sentence. This sequence of query keywords lacks necessary contextual and syntacticosemantic information, so they can not be translated by traditional MT technology in a direct and easy way. Neither can the translation problem be resolved by simply looking up the bilingual dictionary. For example, the English word “bank” corresponds to two Chinese meanings in a typical English-Chinese dictionary: “ł——” and “”¶”. Then the problem arises: should the word “bank” be translated into “ł ——” or “”¶”?","In common sense, when the user inputs {bank; credit} as a query, we may well conclude that he is most likely looking for information about “ł——” and “—ˆ̄”, although we cannot completely exclude"," ∗ This research is supported by the National Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 60502048. 467 the small possibility of interpreting “bank” as the meaning of “”¶” in this context. Therefore, the retrieval algorithm should rank among all the retrieval results the documents containing the keyword “ł——” before those containing the keyword “”¶”. The translation and transform of query sentence in CLIR is formalized as follows: Suppose there is a SL keyword query sentence:","SNiSSSS WWWWQuery \"\"21= (1) where iSW represents the ith","keyword in the query sentence, for example, the keywords “bank” and “credit” in the query instance “bank credit”.","The SL keyword query sentence is translated and transformed into a TL keyword query sentence, which is represented as follows: )^̂(̂ )^̂(̂ )^̂(̂ 2211 2211 1112121111 TNNTNNTNTNTNTN NiTNiTiTiTiTiT NTNTTTTTT boostWboostWboostW boostWboostWboostW boostWboostWboostWQuery \" \"\"\" \"= (2) where NiTiTiT WWW \"21 are the translations in the bilingual dictionary of the keyword iSW of the source language keyword query sentence, and NiTiTiT boostboostboost \"21 are the weight of each translation of the keyword iSW in the bilingual dictionary, which is referred to as boost value."]},{"title":"3 Algorithm Analysis 3.1 Basic Theory of Information Retrieval","paragraphs":["For an IR system, the kernel problem is ranking, i.e., the so-called relevance computing.

The websites include www.xinhua.com, www.sohu.com, www.sina.com, among others.

For this purpose, it is designed to include the following steps:","Step 1: Design 100 English query sentences with well-chosen keywords. In each of the query sentences, there is at least one query keyword that has clear distinction between its Chinese translations.","Step 2: Subject the 100 query sentences to the CLIR system for cross-language retrieval between English and Chinese.","Step 3: Evaluate artificially the retrieval results. In the experiment, only the first 10 and 100 of the retrieved documents are respectively evaluated. The evaluation is conducted by the following criterion: if a given document contains the correct translation of the query keyword, it is a true retrieval result; or else it is a false retrieval result. 469","Step 4: Repeat Step 2 and Step 3 for a contrastive experiment. The contrastive experiment is conducted by looking up the English-Chinese dictionary instead of using the translation and transform algorithm. This is referred to as the dictionary lookup approach. 4.3 Results and Analysis The results of the contrastive experiments are shown in the following table. For the 100 queries, when the first 10 retrieved documents are considered, the number of true retrieval results is 928, and the precision rate is 92.8% which is 15.4% higher than that of the dictionary lookup approach. When the first 100 retrieved documents are considered, the number of true retrieval results is 8891, and the precision rate is 88.9% which is 13.0% higher than that of the dictionary lookup approach. This shows that the translation and transform algorithm is fairly effective. ","Tab.

However, it is always a tough job to build a large-scale high-quality bilingual corpus. In particular, when it comes to minority languages, the cost becomes almost unbearably expensive. In our further study, some parameter smoothening mechanism will be introduced so that the algorithm can work effectively when a supporting large-scale bilingual corpus is not available.
