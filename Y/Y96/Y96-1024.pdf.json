The conjugation types consists of five vowel stem verbs, two regular consonant stem verbs and nineteen irregular verbs. All verbs are classified into 24 types.","Table 1 shows seven conjugation forms and Table 2 shows some examples of verb conjugation. Table 3 shows a list of vowel stern verbs and their suffix vowels. In Table 2, '+' indicates a positive vowel stem verb and indicates a negative vowel stem verb. 'reg' means a regular conjugation verb, and 'irg' means an irregular conjugation verb. 'C' indicates a consonant. And F. and L specify unit letters. A unit letter means a constituent that constructs a hangul. Usually unit letters do not exist on the conjugational ending, however, we consider 1.. 1- means 4- as shown in Table 4. We will describe the details on section 3. As a result we only need five conjugation types for each vowel stem verbs.","Because of the verb conjugation, we do not need to include the morphemes such as 7.11 il t8 and L C J t t j into the dictionary. Therefore, it is possible to make the numbers of nonconjugational endings and prefinal endings be small. Furthermore, the adjective conjugation can be classified in a similar way as verbs.

This has two consonant letters to specify initial consonant or final consonant(D.B.Kim 1994). However we use letters from the KS C5601 line4 as the unit letters. Using this character coding achieves better reading than the alphabet coding. The unit letters we proposed include the double final consonants such as El and Et . This makes it easier to treat consonant stem verbs. Table 4 shows some special unit letter translation rules. This can treat the contraction. We also include 0 (ieung, a letter to show an empty consonant) as a unit letter. Using double consonants and ieung we can distinguish whether a consonant letter is a final or initial consonant. Thus, we need not prepare two sets of consonant letters for initial and final consonants. For example, suppose we analyze the sentence \",ilui"]},{"title":"a -34-c}-.\" \"v-rp","paragraphs":[", is more accurately written \"19N\" . Such phenomenon that \".2_ 0 1-\" becomes \"21-\" is called contraction. Contraction is easily handled in our translation rules. First we transform the original sentence into unit letters, \"1_1-- 1 t _,_ 0 I- AC I-231 .\" For instance, the original form of \" 0 \\tM\" is \"V\". In our dictionary is written as \" 0\\t\" by the unit letters. The conjugational form5 of this verb whose conjugational type is vowel3 has the ending \" 0 F \" and \" F \". So \".2.E1-\" conjugates \" 0 _L.. 0 F \" and \" 0\\t\" as the conjugational form5. Now \" 0 \" is included in the original sentence, so we can conclude that \"t\" is composed of \"24\", which is the conjugational form5 of the verb \"_2_E}\" and the morpheme \" AA\".","By decomposing a hangul to unit letters, a word is treated as a sequence of unit letters. For example, we consider the prefinal ending of past tense BP as a word. This connects with the conjugation form5 of verbs. Therefore we do not need to include two prefinal endings, '̀,'Zkr1-' and \\tin the dictionary."]},{"title":"4 Morphological analysis over segments","paragraphs":["Korean sentences are separated by spaces into phrasal segments.

In such a case, we, therefore, have to take the outside information of a segment into consideration.","Look at the morpheme on the left side of over the segmentation. Sentence (a) has /adnominal case particle(ACP), and sentence (b) has E / adno mi n ending(AE) to the left. Due to Korean grammar, the bound noun cannot take ACP to the left. Thus it is clear that the POS(part-of-speech) of ‘-+' in sentence (a) is a common noun. Although the correct POS of -̀t-' cannot be decided unambiguously in many cases like the one in (b), frequent occurrences of the pattern E /AE + -t-/BN' strongly suggests that \"+' in the sentence (b) is a bound noun.","As is seen in the example, using outside information of segments reduces ambiguities. In our system, connection rules take both segment boundary and morpheme information beyond the segments into account to cope with this ambiguity."]},{"title":"5 Analysis method","paragraphs":["The Korean morphological analysis system we are developing is called Kocha. The algorithm is based on the minimal cost analysis, where a cost is allocated to each morpheme and connection of morphemes. The lower the cost is, the 232 more the plausible morphemes or the connections are to occur. When some morphemes may not occur adjacently, the cost of the connection is undefined.","The words in the dictionary and the possible connection of POSs are defined with costs. We consider that a space for segmentation is special kind of word. Thus, it is possible to describe a connection rule between a word and a space. For example, particles cannot locate right after a space. Therefore in the connection dictionary the cost between space and a particle is undefined. Conversely a particle and a space appear frequently in this order, so the cost between a particle and a space is set to be low. We also consider the connectability of the morphemes which appear at the opposite side of a space. We use both connectability of adjacent morpheme and the morpheme over a space.","Samples of a word dictionary, a connection dictionary and a connection dictionary for over segmentation are shown in Tables 5, 6 and 7.

We cannot decide which is better without further information. Also we cannot decide if 4̀*.' is a verb or an auxiliary verb. Our method estimates the plausibility of those possibilities by referring to the costs to each morpheme and to each connection of the morphemes. Both a word and a connection have its defined cost. A connection over segmentation also has a cost. We sum up all the costs of the morphemes and connections for every path. In the calculation of the cost over segmentation, the connection costs defined over segmentation are also added. For instance, in the calculation of the connection cost of 'xi ' and in Figure 1, the cost sums up 63 (30+30+3). When any of the costs is not defined, the cost is regarded as an infinity. The path with the minimal cost is regarded as the most suitable result.
