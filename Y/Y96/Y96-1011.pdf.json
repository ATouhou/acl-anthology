Secondly, LVCs (neither LVs nor VNs) are classified into two groups based on their structural differences. Thirdly, LVC sentences in general are ambiguous between the structures of these two groups.

Introduction","Since Cattell (1984) and Grimshaw & Mester (1988), much attention has been paid to Light Verb Constructions (LVCs), especially those in Japanese and Korean (H-S Han 1988, Miyagawa 1989, H-D Ahn 1991, K Park 1992, etc.). These analyses, however, have failed to provide objective criteria for defining LVCs (and hence \"thematically incomplete\" Light Verbs (LVs) and accompanying Verbal Nouns (VNs)).

S-W Kim (1994) implies that it is not a LVC sentence because \"true VNs\" cannot be moved or focused. According to M-K Kim's (1994: 108) analysis, it is a \"heavy verb\" construction \"in case there is no deleted object, while it is a LVC if there is a deleted object.\"","Most scholars argue that the sentences in (2b-c) are not LVC sentences but heavy verb sentences (except M-K Kim (1994) and a few others).

We have to rely on the VN directly. 102","The last characteristic of LVCs to be considered here is that the VN phrase is a non-saturated NP. This non-saturatedness requirement comes from the fact that the VN has its arguments outside of the VN phrase.","(7) a.

In general demonstratives have the function of closing NPs (i.e., making them saturated).","Turning to the major contentions in this paper, we are assuming that LVCs (neither LVs nor VNs) are classified into two groups based on their structures: vp[..., v'[VNP + LV]v']vp (SI) and vp[..., VNP, LVbrp (S2):","(8) Mary-ka KONGPU-111 ha-yass-ta. Nom study Acc do Past Decl a. S1: \\t b. S2: NP\\tVP Mary-ka Mary-ka\\tVNP\\tV' KONGPU-111\\tLV KONGPU- 1 1","\\t LV \\t ha-yass-ta ha-yass-ta There does not seem to be significant meaning differences between the two groups of LVCs. Syntactically, however, there are noticeable differences between them. First of all, the position of the VN phrase (VNP) is different in the structures of the two constructions. The VN phrase is in a position which renders it \"special\" in the former structure (SI) while it is not in the latter structure (S2). It has more verbal properties and (hence) more deeply embedded in SI than in S2. Because of these characteristics the VN phrase in SI cannot be modified or moved. Notice that the VN (and ha-) is the same in the two structures regardless of the differences of its syntactic behavior, which will be considered shortly.","Our last main point for a new analysis is that LVC sentences in general 103 are ambiguous between S1 and S2. For example, sentence (2a) and (8) are ambiguous (between the senses of 'introduced1studied' and 'made an introduction' /'did studying') because the VN phrase can occur either within or outside the V' phrase. The sentence will have an S1 structure when this NP occurs within the V' phrase and it will have an S2 structure when the NP occurs outside of the phrase.","However, many of the LVC sentences become disambiguated because of the specific properties of the VN phrase in each structure. Some of them have only the S1 structure. As we can see from the data in (lb-c), the VN phrase in (la) cannot be modified or moved. Notice that there is another Acc-marked NP outside the V' phrase. We can easily account for the disambiguation here if we assume that there can be only one Acc-marked phrase on the same level of the tree structure. Under this assumption the VN phrase can only occur within the V' phrase because the position for an Acc-marked NP outside of the V' phrase is taken by another phrase.","Another group of LVC sentences with only Sl structure is \"ergative\" LVC sentences: (9) a. pongkip-i\\tINSANG(-11) ha-yess-ta. \\t salary Nom raise\\tdo Past Decl 'The salary has been raised.' b. ki hoisa -ka pongkip-U1 INSANG(-11) ha-yess-ta. \\t that company Nom\\tAcc 'That company raised the salary.'

The Nom-marked subject NP in (a) corresponds to the Acc-marked object NP in (b). From the data in (10) we can see that the VN phrase cannot be modified, scrambled or relativized, which is a characteristic of the 51 structure. As is widely assumed, the subject in an ergative sentence has an object-like property at least logically and/or semantically. Then, we may assume that sentence (9a) has two \"objects-like entities\", just like sentence (la). For the moment, until we can implement this idea into a theoretical mechanism, we can assume that the subject NP of structure S2 must be [-I-Agent]. Note that ergative sentences such as (9a) do not have agent subjects.","Some other sentences have only the S2 structure. Firstly, in all the following examples, the VN is not in its \"original position\" (cf. (8)):","(11) a. KONGPU-nin Mary-ka ha-yass-ta. (topicalization) study Top 104 b. KONGPU-111 Mary-ka ha-yass-ta. (scrambling) c. [Mary-ka ha-n]\\tKONGPU (relativization) We have seen that the VN can be moved only in the S2 structure. Therefore the above examples have nothing to do with the S1 structure. We can say that they are disambiguated by syntactic (movement) operations.","Another group of LVC sentences which have only the S2 structure is those containing adnominal modifiers. For example, the sentences in (2b) are disambiguated because only the S2 VN phrase can be modified (cf. (2b.ii)). (12) John-i Mary-hanthe [caemi iss-nin SOKAE(-141)] ha-yass-ta. (13) ajcaemi iss-nin SOKAE-111] John-i Mary-hanthe ha-yass-ta.","b.[John-i Mary-hanthe ha-n] [caemi iss-nin SOKAE] The data in (13) show that the modified VN phrase in (12) can be moved by syntactic operations.","Before we leave this section, let us see how we can analyze sentence (la) under the present approach. Let us also compare the structure posited here with an alternative structure:","(14) John-i Mary-hanthe Bill-11 [SOKAE\\t(-1il)] ha-yass-ta. Nom\\tto\\tAcc introduction Acc do Past Decl a.

The left-branching structure, however, have difficulties in dealing with the following data, among others:","(15) a. [Bill-11] John-i Mary-hanthe e SOKAE(-lil) ha-yass-ta. b.

As for sentence (b), there is no plausible way of analyzing the adverb occurring in between two nominal expressions.","Summarizing the discussions in this section, all the sentences in (1) and (2) are analyzed as LVC sentences. Among these sentences, sentence (2a) is ambiguous between the S1 and S2 structures. All the other sentences are disambiguated. Sentence (la) has only the S1 structure because it has two Acc-marked objects. The sentences in (2b-c) have only the S2 structure because the VN phrase in 51 is in a position where movement or modification is not allowed. IV. Conclusion","In this paper, we have argued that all ha-sentences should be analyzed as LVCs when the potential VN has at least one of the verbally case-marked phrases as its argument, regardless of whether the VN phrase is modified or moved. Under this definition of LVCs, we have examined important properties/criteria which characterize LVC sentences. With some assumptions about the LVCs, we could account for all the relevant data in a way which conforms to the native speakers' intuition. Most of all, VNs and the LV ha-are analyzed uniformly, as single lexical items. The differences in their behavior in some related sentences are attributed to their structural differences. We need not have to multiply the number of lexical items \"spuriously\".","The contents of this paper are mainly from Chae (1996), which are written (unfortunately to some people) in Korean.
