Ever since Perlmutter's Unaccusative Hypothesis [uH, Perlmutter (1978)], as formulated below in (1), later researchers have widely accepted the view that the heterogeneous behaviors of intransitive verbs, known as Split Intransitivity (si), are accounted for by assuming two different classes of intransitive verbs.","(1) The Unaccusative Hypothesis [Perlmutter (1978, p.161)] Certain intransitive clauses have an initial 2, but no initial 1. The verbs of the clauses, the existence of which uH hypothesizes, are called unaccusative verbs. Intransitive verbs, called unergative verbs, normally have an initial 1. The basic ideas of UH have been later adopted within the Government-Binding (GB) framework and further developed [by Burzio (1986), among others]. In the GB framework, each class of intransitive verbs is represented differently in the syntactic configurations of D-structure: [s NP [vp [e] V ]] for unergative verbs, and [s [e] [vp NP V ]] for unaccusative verbs. The advocates of this approach, which I call \"syntactic approach,\" try to explain si by assigning each verb class a different syntactic configuration in the underlying or the initial structure [cf. Burzio (1986) and Rosen (1984)].","An alternative proposal tries to account for si solely in terms of some semantic notions such as Aktionsart and agentivity [e.g. in van Valin (1987, 1990)], the telicity and the protagonistic control [e.g. in Zaenen (1988)], or lexical entailments along the lines of Dowty (1991) [e.g. Zaenen (1993)]. The proponents of semantic approaches basically deny the need to assume two different syntactic configurations for the different classes 327 of intransitive verbs. What they do not deny is that intransitive verbs are sub-classified into unergative and unaccusative verbs. Thus, the foregoing accounts of si, syntactic or semantic, are dichotomous in that they basically distinguish only two classes of intransitive verbs.","The dichotomous distinction of intransitive verbs has the following two straightforward consequences: First, each intransitive verb should be either an unergative or an unaccusative verb. No intransitive verbs which could be classified as a verb in between or outside of the two classes. Second, any intransitive verb should uniformly show either the unergative phenomena or the unaccusative phenomena.","There is, however, a set of intransitive verbs which seem to show some mixed properties, therefore they do not fall neatly into one of the two classes. This problem is widely acknowledged as Unaccusative Mismatches (ums). The previous approaches based on the binary distinction of intransitive verbs sometimes regard ums simply as idiosyncratic properties of the verbs, or as two instances of a single verb, depending on their use. I will point out some of the fundamental problems of these previous approaches.","I will show in this paper, in section 2, that the verbs showing ums are not exceptional, but behave grammatically in a non-random way as well. I will also show that they cannot be simply regarded as two instances of a single verb since this view causes further ums. Drawing from the mismatches between ums and uH, I then propose a quadripartitive distinction of intransitive verbs on the basis of the distribution of the subject argument in the semantically motivated argument structure, and show that this distinction allows a better understanding of si and ums. The main idea of this proposal will be summarized as the Quadripartitive Split Intransitivity Hypothesis (QsiH). In section 3, I will briefly introduce the theoretical backgrounds, and formulate my ideas within this framework. Before drawing the conclusion in section 5, I will briefly sketch the analysis of the si phenomena in German in section .4."]},{"title":"2 Unaccusative Hypothesis and Unaccusative Mismatches","paragraphs":["The most frequently discussed split intransitivity phenomena can be summarized as follows: I call the phenomena listed in the middle column of table (2) unergative phenomena and the phenomena in the right column of table (2) unaccusative phenomena, respectively.

Grewendorf (1989) and Kathol (1992)]. I present four pieces of evidence against UH and the dichotomous distinction of intransitive verbs, motivating a quadripartitive distinction of intransitive verbs. 2.1 Unaccusativity Hypothesis and Transitivity UH and subsequent syntactic approaches predict that all transitive verbs should form their perfect tense with the auxiliary haben (to have), since the selection of sein (to be) is due to the D-structural position of the single subject argument of the unaccusative verbs. Unfortunately, there are a small number of transitive verbs which select sein (to be) for the formation of perfect tense.

This means that it is definitely not the case that intransitive verbs which are not unergative are unaccusative, or vice versa.

Consequently, the previous accounts based on UH should be carefully re-examined."]},{"title":"3 4 Types of Intransitive Verbs and Argument Structure","paragraphs":["In this section, I consider how these empirical observations can be accounted for within the framework of Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG, Pollard and Sag (1994)). Basically following the widely acknowledged insight that the grammatical behaviors of a predicate are to a large extent determined by its lexical meaning, I will try to show that the subject of intransitive verbs could be more naturally distinguished in a four-part way. Then, I will propose a Quadripartitive Split Intransitivity Hypothesis ((Ism), which states that the least oblique argument of intransitive verbs will have 4 different distributions in the \"argument structure\" . Following QSIH and its underpinning insight that si is semantically determined and lexically represented, I will suggest that, under the assumptions of HPSG [Pollard and Sag (1994)], the different classes of intransitive verbs should be differently represented in the lexical entries. 3.1 Theoretical Backgrounds: The Two-Level Linking Theory For the representation of lexical information, I adopt the model of the two-level linking theory (TLLT), developed by Ryu (to appear). For the lack of space, only some of the relevant components of this model will be briefly introduced in this section.","The lexicon in HPSG, hence in TLLT, is defined by means of the Word Principle (VVP), which is formulated in terms of King's Speciate Re-entrant Logic (SRL) [see King (1994)] as in (10).3 WP says that every feature structure of the sort word must satisfy a lexical entry and all linking constraints.","(10) The Word Principle [= a revision of the Word Principle of Hale (1995)]","word—+ (E1V,...,VEn)A(LiA,-..,ALn), where Ei (1\\ti\\tn) is a lexical entry in the base lexicon and L i a linking constraint. As can be seen in (10), the linking is viewed in TLLT as conjunctive descriptions of admissible feature structures. TLLT has two closely related components: (i) the constraints on the interrelation between the thematic structure (= NECLEUS) and argument structure (= ARGSTR), and (ii) the constraints on the interrelation between ARGSTR and valence features (vAL). The former constraints will be called \"pre-linking\" and the latter \"post-linking\" (hence the name TLLT). Argument structure is characterized as a collection of argument indices (note: not synsem objects), one of which is classified as the external argument and one as the internal argument.

On the basis of this conclusion, I propose the Quadripartitive Split Intransitivity Hypothesis (will).","(20) The Quadripartitive Split Intransitivity Hypothesis (Qsni) Intransitive verbs are sub-classified into four classes to the effect that they have one of the four types of argument structure: The least oblique argument is token-identical (i) only to the external argument, (ii) only to the internal argument, (iii) both to the external argument and the internal argument, or (iv) to neither the external argument nor the internal argument. Based on this typology of the subject argument, I propose a theory of si in which two kinds of unaccusativity can be explicitly distinguished: the primary and the secondary unaccusativity.","(21) a. the primary unaccusativity =def :'-word A (ARGSTR INTARG FIRST C.:$ :ARGSTR ARGS FIRST)","b. the secondary unaccusativity =clef :'-word A (ARGSTR EXTARG FIRST ARGSTR INTARG FIRST N :ARGSTR ARGS FIRST)"]},{"title":"4 Split Intransitivity and Unaccusative Mismatches Revisited","paragraphs":["The proposed approach to si crucially draws the distinction of the distributions of the subject argument in the argument structure, which are deduced from lexical implications of each verb. Since the status of the external argument and the internal argument plays a central role in the further formation of grammatical structures, the token-identity between the external and the internal argument in the definition of the secondary unaccusativity has many promising consequences. I will briefly suggest the analysis of si phenomena in German using the sorts and the status of the subject argument in the argument structure.","First, the auxiliary selection sein (to be) must selected for the formation of perfect tense if the index of the least oblique argument of a verb is token-identical to the list-internal value of the feature intarg. 4 According to this analysis, verbs of Type 4 such as weather verbs, verbs of emission, and verbs of natural process, etc. select sein (to be) for the formation of perfect tense, just as verbs of Type 1 do. Second, the passive is, in general, only possible with verbs if the index of the least oblique argument of them is token-identical to the list-internal value of the feature extarg. Thus, the impersonal passive is possible with verbs of Type 1 or Type 3. Third, the past participle of a verb can be used as a prenominal attribute if the index of the least oblique argument of a verb is token-identical to the list-internal value of the feature intarg. Fourth, Agent nominalization of a verb is basically possible if the index of the least oblique argument of a verb is token-identical to the list-internal value of the feature extarg. The discussion in this section can be summarized as follows:","(22) split intransitivity phenomena (in German) and the types of intransitive verbs I SI phenomena ji Type 1 I Type 2 I Type 3] Type 4 I auxiliary selection haben sein sein haben impersonal passive yes no yes no prenominal attribute no yes yes no Agent nominalization yes no yes no To sum up, Type 1 corresponds to the unergative verb, Type 2 to the primary unaccusative verb, Type 3 to the secondary unaccusative verb, and Typ 4 to those verbs including 334 impersonal verbs which have not previously received any detailed account in the context of unaccusativity literature.","Finally, it can be pointed out that my proposal has some advantages over the previous approaches. Advantages are obvious, at least in the following aspects: First, weather verbs, verbs of emission etc. receive a more natural explanation in my approach than in the previous approaches [Type 4]. Second, ums can be accounted for more systemtically in my approach, since they can be attributed to the properties of Type 3 verbs. Third, the unaccusativity changing verbs such as verbs of movement with or without a definite change of location [cf. laufen (to run) ± directional PP, tanzen (to dance) f directional PP, etc.], which is regarded as Type 1 and Type 3 depending on their lexical entailments. Fourth, unlike other approaches in HPSG, the proposal here is semantically well-grounded and independently motivated."]},{"title":"5 Conclusion","paragraphs":["Pointing out some problems of the dichotomous distinction of intransitive verbs, I proposed a quadripartitive distinction of intransitive verbs and developed theoretical tools to model this quadripartitive distinction within a framework of HPSG. To conclude, I hope to have shown that the approach advanced on the basis of the quadripartitive distinction of intransitive verbs properly subsumes all the predictions and the explanatory power of uH, and gives a reasonable explanation for ums. The proposal made in this paper, I believe, is highly suggestive for the analysis of si and ums in other languages. A cross-linguistic research in the context of this proposal will certainly be crucial to the account of the other two kinds of ums which I do not deal with in this paper, namely the cross-linguistic unaccusative mismatches and the language-internal unaccusative mismatches."]},{"title":"Notes","paragraphs":["There are at least three kinds of ums, which should be distinguished from each other: (i) cross-linguistic ums, (ii) language-internal ums, and finally (iii) unaccusative hypothesis mismatches.

See Ryu (1996) for a detailed discussion and see also Rosen (1984) for a discussion in the framework of Relational Grammar.","2 There are further verbs showing ums in German, which for the lack of space I will not discuss in this paper. These verbs include aspectual verbs such as dauern (to last), enden (to end), etc. and further verbs such as sein (to be), werden (to be), bleiben (to remain). See Ryu (to appear, chap. 6) for the detailed discussions of these and other further verbs showing uMs.","3 The following symbols are used in King's Speciate Re-entrant Logic (sRL). The symbol : is a term which precedes a chaih of attributes, indicating the root point. The symbol ,••• indicates the sort assignment, and the symbol indicates the sort equation.","4 This analysis is somewhat oversimplified, even though it covers the data shown in this paper. A more precise analysis will be that the auxiliary selection sein (to be) must be selected for the formation of perfect tense if the index of the subject is token-identical to the index of the least oblique argument of a verb, the corresponding sort of which is subsumed by the sort change-of-location or affected in the sort hierarchy of qfpsoa [see Ryu (to appear, chap. 6)]. Verbs showing the mismatch between the auxiliary selection and transitivity such as durchgehen (to go through), eingehen (to enter), anlaufen (to run through), angehen (to approach), etc. [section 2.1], I regard, are treated as normal transitive verbs, perhaps with an exceptional property that the subject of these verbs have a metaphorical entailment of change-of-location. The selection of sein (to be) of these verbs receives a natural explanation within the proposal made above, given the assumption that the subject argument of these verbs is subsumed by the sort change-of-location via some kind of morphological inheritance [see Kathol (1992)]. 335"]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Burzio, Luigi. 1986."]},{"title":"Italian Syntax: A Government-Binding Approach.","paragraphs":["Dordrecht: Reidel.
