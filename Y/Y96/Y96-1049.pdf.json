Abstract","This paper reconsiders nasal assimilation in English within the framework of Optimality Theory and shows that the phenomena can be accounted for in a natural way in terms of some ranked violable constraints. In so doing, I also argue against an account based on structural interpretations of faithfulness, and propose that identity relation between input and output, i.e., correspondence, provides the best account. I also present further evidence that as pointed out by Lamontagne and Rice (1995), it is necessary to extend correspondence to the featural level. 1. Introduction","The purpose of this paper is to reconsider nasal assimilation in English within the framework of Optimality Theory (hereafter OT; Prince & Smolensky 1993, McCarthy & Prince 1994). There has been in the literature much discussion on the above phenomena (e.g., Halle & Mohanan 1985, Borowsky 1986 among others). However, none of them provide a satisfactory account. In this paper, I will show that a purely constraint-based approach can account for nasal assimilation in a better way. In so doing, I will argue against an account based on structural interpretations of faithfulness, and propose that identity relation between input and output (i.e.,"]},{"title":"correspondence,","paragraphs":["McCarthy & Prince (1994)) provides the best account. I will also show that as Lamontagne and Rice (1995) assert, correspondence should be extended to the featural level.","The paper proceeds as follows. First, section 2 reviews previous analyses of English nasal assimilation. Second, section 3 presents the general principles of OT and discusses how the constraint-based approach can handle the phenomena under consideration. Finally, section 4 provides a brief summary of the paper. 2. Previous studies","In English, the underlying nasals are /m/ and /n/. Unlike them, [o] does not exist as an independent segment. Rather it is derived from a sequence of nasal and velar obstruent by the so-called Nasal Assimilation. According to Halle and Mohanan (1985), the rule is formulated as (1). 479","(1) Nasal Assimilation (domain: stratum 2): In/\\t[o] / ___[-son, -cor, -lab] Sample derivations showing the operation of this rule follow:","(2) /ink/\\tAuk/ (Nasal Assimilation) /long/ -4 /long/ (Nasal Assimilation)\\t/lou/ (/g/-deletion)' As Halle and Mohanan (1985) point out, however, the rule in (1) is blocked when the following syllable is stressed, as exemplified in (3b) in comparison with (3a); i.e., in (3a), In/ becomes [u], while it remains unchanged in (3b). 2","(3) a. co[n]gress co[n]cord sy[n]chrony i[n]cubate co[n]quer co[n]gruous co[n]crete","b. co[n]gressional co[n]cordance sy[n]chronic i[n]clude co[n]cur co[n]gruity co[n]cretion Without giving a concrete account of the alternations in (3), they simply suggest that the determining factor appears to be the stress contour of the word; i.e., [u] does not occur before stressed vowels in English. However, this is not the case. Observe the examples in (4), where contrary to their assumption, [o] occurs before stressed as well as unstressed vowels. \\t (4) li[n]guist","\\t li[n]guistic","\\t Hu[n]gary","\\t Hu[n]garian \\t tra[n]quil","\\t tra[n]quility","\\t Mo[n]gol","\\t Mo[n]golian \\t","sa[n]guine\\t sa[n]guinity\\t","larkbalgophone lary[n]x \\t bro[n]chi","\\t bro[n]chitis","\\t 16[0]g","\\t elo[n]gate","Accounting for the phenomena above within the framework of lexical phonology, Borowsky (1986) asserts that the contrast between (3) and (4) are quite systematic. That is, she claims that where Nasal Assimilation applies without reference to stress as in (4), the nasal + velar sequence is in a monomorphemic stem, whereas the stress governed alternations in (3) are always of the form prefix + root. Assuming that the segment Azi/ is allowed lexically in English if it shares the place features of the following velar consonant, she asserts that morpheme internally Nasal Assimilation applies as a spreading rule and creates a structure like that in (5a), but across morpheme boundaries it applies as a copying rule"]},{"title":"and creates the structure in (5b).","paragraphs":["480 (5) a.\\tx\\tx\\tb. *\\tx \\t [+nasal] [-nasal]\\t[+nasal] \\t [+velar]\\t[+velar] (6), for example, exemplifies how 'li[rj]guist' and 'coNlgress' are derived from their underlying forms. The monomorphemic form in (6a) has a structure with a single tier, while the bi-morphemic form in (6b) has a structure with two morphemes each occupying a different tier. In the monomorphemic form, Nasal Assimilation applies as a spreading rule and creates a structure like that in (5a). In the bi-morphemic form, in contrast, it applies as a copying rule and creates the structure in (5b). Borowsky says that as a result, the [o] in 'linguist' is derived at level 1 since this will not violate Structure Preservation, while 'congress' and 'congressional' cannot be derived cyclically because the structures resulting from Nasal Assimilation (as a copying process) would violate Structure Preservation.","(6)a. xxx xxxxx\\tb. con III lin guist","\\t X X X +X X XX \\t"]},{"title":"g\\t","paragraphs":["gres But her analysis is also untenable in that in order to account for a phonological process, it needs two different rules which apply at different levels. Unlike her assertion, in addition, there are some cases where across morpheme boundaries Nasal Assimilation applies without reference to stress (e.g., 'impossible,' 'compose,' etc.). 3.

Third, an individual grammar consists of a ranking of the constraint set; i.e., the constraints of Con are ranked on a language-particular basis.

Fourth, the constraint hierarchy evaluates a set of candidate analyses that are admitted by very general considerations of structure well-formedness. Finally, best-satisfaction of the constraint hierarchy is computed over the whole 481 hierarchy and the whole candidate set; there is no serial derivation. In OT, the grammar is schematically represented as in (7).","(7) a. Gen(Ink)\\t{Outi, Out2, ...) b.

Correspondence is a relation between two structures, such as base and reduplicant or input and output. According to McCarthy and Prince (1994b), correspondence is formally defined as follows:","(8) Correspondence Given two strings Si and S2, related to one another as reduplicant/ base, output/input, etc.,"]},{"title":"correspondence","paragraphs":["is a function"]},{"title":"f","paragraphs":["from any subset of elements of S 2 to Si.

In a correspondence-sensitive grammar, the function of Gen is to supply correspondence relations between S i and all possible structures over some alphabet. Each candidate pair (Si, S2) comes from Gen equipped with a correspondence relation between Si and Sz that expresses the relation between the elements of Si and those of S2. The correspondence relation between input and output is illustrated in (9). Here, subscripted indices are used to indicate the correspondence relationship. In (9a), for example, the /p/ of the input corresponds to the [p] of the output; the /u/ of the input corresponds to the [u] of the output, and so on.","(9) Input = iplazu3k4t5a6/ a. pla2u3k4t5a6\\tb. pia2?u3k4t5a6\\t","C. pi u3k4t5a6 As shown above, the elements of the input can stand in correspondence relations with the elements of the various candidates. In (9a), for example, the relation between the input and the output is one-to-one. But the output may also contain more or fewer elements than the input as in (9b) and (9c); that is, [?] is inserted in (9b), while /a2/ is deleted in (9c). Once the candidates are generated, Eval rates them in terms of their relative harmony with respect to 482 the language-particular constraint hierarchy and determines what is optimal. The optimal candidate is the one that best satisfies the constraint hierarchy.","Given this much theoretical background, in what follows, I will consider how English nasal assimilation can be handled in terms of correspondence. To begin with, for the cases in (3) and (4), the constraints in (10) come into play in selecting optimal outputs.","(10) a. *[...n{k, g}...]foovmonomorpheme \\t b. SPREAD: Do not spread features. Constraint (10a) bans the sequence of /n/ and /k/ or /g/ within the foot/monomorpheme, while constraint (10b) is against spreading of features. The tableaux in (11), for example, show that if (10a) (10b), we predict the correct surface form. In these and other tableaux, constraints are ordered left to right in order of priority, and violation-marks are indicated by *. The optimal candidate is called out by r-, and fatal constraint violations are signalled by !. Below these fatal violations, cells are shaded to indicate their irrelevance to determining the outcome of the comparison at hand. In addition, ( ) represents foot boundaries.'; In (11a), candidate (a) violates a highly ranked constraint *[...n{k, g}..•]foot/monomorpheme because of the sequence of 1n,/ and /g/ that belong to the same foot. This violation is fatal, since the competing candidate satisfies it; therefore, candidate (b) is selected as optimal in spite of its violation of constraint SPREAD. In (lib), candidate (a) meets constraint *[...n{k, g ) ifoot/monomorpheme because In/ and /g/ are neither tautomorphemic nor within the same foot. Candidate (b) also satisfies it. Thus the decision between them must be passed on to the subordinate constraint SPREAD. Candidate (a) passes but candidate (b) fails it; therefore, the former emerges as optimal. In (11c), candidate (a) contains tautomorphemic /n/ and /g/, violating constraint *[...n{k, g }...]foot/monomorpheme, which is fatal. Although the alternative analysis (b) fails constraint SPREAD, it is selected as optimal. The same reasoning holds for (lid).

It has been traditionally assumed that in (12), /n/ is first changed into /13/, and then /g/ is deleted. (12) angma, long, bring, gingham Under the analysis argued for in this paper, this can be accounted for by invoking the constraint PARSE. In McCarthy and Prince (1994b), PARSE' is redefined as a constraint on correspondence as in (13).","(13) PARSE: Every element of S 2 in (Si, S2) has a correspondent in S1.5 (where S2 = input, Si = output). As stated in (13), correspondence operates on the domain of the segment. But this is not enough to account for the data in (12) -- I will return to this below. Rather I argue after Lamontagne and Rice (1995) that correspondence should be extended to the featural level. Accounting for coalescence in Athapaskan languages, that is, Lamontagne and Rice show that in addition to the segmental input/output correspondence, features may stand in a correspondence relation. In other words, whether or not a segment of the input corresponds with a segment of the output depends on whether some features of these segments correspond; i.e., a Root node of the input and that of the output will stand in a correspondence relation if features that they dominate correspond. According to them, therefore, (13) can be restated as in (14).","(14) For two Root nodes X and Y, where X is part of the input and Y the output, X and Y correspond if some features of X correspond with features of Y. Consider, for example, the relation between the input and the output in coalescence structures like (15). Given the assumption above, the Root node of 484 Y in the output of (15) has a double correspondence, and hence it corresponds with both X and Y of the input, as indicated through the use of the indices from each of the input segments.

This also prevents the redistribution of input features to other Root nodes, as the one-to-one relation is violated.","There is another constraint which plays a crucial role in selecting the optimal outputs in (12). The constraint is given in (17), which rules out a sequence of nasal and /g/ within a syllable.

In this tableau and henceforth, columns separated by a dotted line (such as *[...n{k, g}...]foovm.morpheme and *[+nasal]g]s) do not conflict and so are not crucially ordered. Besides, < > indicates segments which are not phonetically realized, and periods represent syllable boundaries. Among the candidates in (19), only candidate (c) survives the top-ranked constraints, so that it emerges as optimal in spite of its violations of the lower ranked constraints SPREAD and *MC. Note that here, the optimal candidate is not a PARSE violation because [u] in the output corresponds with both /n/ and /g/ in the input; i.e., it contains features from both of them.

(21) *n[+labial] Constraint (21) is undominated, so that it should not be violated in any optimal output. For example, the tableau in (22) illustrates how this constraint conspires with other constraints in selecting optimal outputs. Candidate (a) violates highly ranked constraint *n[+labial], whereas candidate (b) satisfies it. Therefore, candidate (b) emerges as optimal although it contains violations of low-ranked constraints SPREAD and *MC.

Here, since candidate (a) violates constraints *[...n{k, 1g}--footimonomorpheme and *[+nasal]gh, it is excluded from consideration immediately. The remaining three parses (b, c, d) are not distinguished by the top-ranked constraints; i.e., they tie in violating one of the constraints each (Note that both (23c) and (23d) violate Parse (Prince and Smolensky 1993), for /g/ is unparsed.). Thus the next constraint down the hierarchy, SPREAD, becomes relevant. Candidates (b) and (c) fail but candidate (d) passes it.
