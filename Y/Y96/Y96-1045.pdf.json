It is often unavoidable and it should not necessarily be avoided. We will present a case where a semantic theory is influenced more by a seemingly universal fact, but in fact accidental among related languages, than by a few significant exceptions in the language in question, thereby failing to capture a meaningful generalization. In particular, we argue that in-adverbials are not a test for telic predicates, as they are popularly claimed to be; we will show that this claim is triggered by the accidental fact that there are two homomorphic in-adverbials in English and their cognates in other languages."]},{"title":"Two Uses of I n-adverbials","paragraphs":["Examples like (1)—(4) below are often presented to argue that an adverbial like"]},{"title":"in","paragraphs":["an hour can occur with an accomplishment or an achievement, but not with an activity or a stative (cf.

Several differences can be listed as in (5):1","(5) • In-adverbials always refer to contiguous times for achievements but they sometimes refer to noncontiguous times for accomplishments.","• A contextually given reference time is required for achievements but is not for accomplishments.","• In-adverbials are upward monotone with respect to accomplishments but not with respect to achievements.","• In-adverbials refer to runtimes, or event times, for accomplishments but for achievements they refer to elapsed times, times from a reference point until the given event occurs.","For instance, if we compare the sentences in (1) and (6) below, we notice that (a) the one hour in the letter writing does not have to be one continuous hour but the one hour in the leaving has to; (b) in (6) a specific reference point is required to know from what time the elapsing of an hour is being considered, but it is unnecessary for (1); (c) in a situation where Mary actually wrote the letter in 40 minutes, (1) is acceptable, whereas if Mary did leave in 40 minutes, (6) is not readily acceptable. 2 ; (d) the one hour refers to the time spent in writing the letter in (1) but the time before leaving in (6): (1)\\tMary wrote the letter in an hour.","1 /n-adverbials have two different uses, and these differences are commonly seen between accomplishments and achievements when these adverbials modify them. However, this does not mean that the use of in-adverbials is determined by the predicate they modify.","2 Dowty (1979:334) suggests that it is bad because of a violation of the Maxim of Quantity. Yet, the point is that the pragmatic principle seems to affect accomplishments and achievements differently in this respect. 440 (6) Mary left in an hour.","Despite these differences, it is observed in many languages that the same in-adverbials, or their counterparts, are used for both types of telics (cf. Smith 1991:157). Then, a natural question is whether in-adverbials have the same truth conditions with both accomplishments and achievements. If they do, are the truth conditions given above adequate to accommodate the different behavior of achievements? While the same truth conditions are explicitly proposed by Dowty and Hinrichs, most authors are silent on this matter, with the exception of Nerbonne (1984), who acknowledges one of the above-mentioned differences and proposes two different truth conditions for the German preposition"]},{"title":"in","paragraphs":["'in' (see Nerbonne 1984:61-62).

Namely, accomplishments differ from the other aktionsarten with respect to this temporal adverbial, existence of which is suggested by the different behaviors of in-adverbials exhibited between accomplishments and the other aktionsarten. According to our observation, it would be highly unlikely for any language that a certain measure adverbial just like a in-adverbial modifies either achievements only or accomplishments and states only. •","It may be instructive to try to understand how this difference arises between Korean and English. Two facts seem to be involved. First, accomplishments are different from the other aktionsarten in that they provide a natural end point for a given event which is different from its starting point. Therefore, an accomplishment event has a natural interval to measure. On the other hand, achievements are regarded as having one small interval for their event time, which might be considered as the starting and end point. Activities and states, by definition, do not have identifiable end points. Hence, it follows that it is the most natural and the easiest to measure the event time of an accomplishment event, i.e. it is often unnecessary to measure the event time of an achievement event; it would be not as simple to measure the event time of an activity or a stative. Therefore, it is plausible that there exists some temporal adverbial which measures accomplishments only, e.g. Korean ey-adverbials and English in-adverbials used for accomplishments. 445","Second, it appears that certain English temporal adverbials contain default information specifying temporal directions, even though the information is not retrievable from its parts. For instance, the adverbials in (24) all locate events at or within certain intervals.
