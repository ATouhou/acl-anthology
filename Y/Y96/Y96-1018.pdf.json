Preparation of Sinica Corpus Word Segmentation and Part-of-speech Tagging","paragraphs":["To prepare a tagged Chinese corpus, word segmentation and automatic tagging are two major processes after text selection. Word segmentation for Chinese is a 169 difficult task due to the lack of delimiters to mark word boundaries. Simply looking up a word dictionary to identify words is not sufficient to solve the problem, because of the existence of unknown words, such as proper names, compounds, and new words. Basically an automatic word segmentation system for Chinese works as follows: an electronic dictionary provides a list of common words, and a set of morphological rules to generate/identify a variety of derived words and compounds, such as determiner-measure compounds, reduplication etc., as supplement. An algorithm will resolve ambiguous segmentation by either heuristic or statistic methods (Chen & Liu 92). The remaining segmentation errors (as well as tagging errors) are fixed by human post editing. 3.1 Word Segmentation Standard","The form and content of a correct word segmentation. criteria has been discussed and disputed in the field. Different word segmentation systems have been designed and they all follow their own idiosyncratic guidelines (Chen & Liu 92, Sproat et al. 94). While the Sinica Corpus was being developed, a standard for Chinese word segmentation was also drafted and proposed by the ROC Computational Linguistic Society. The word segmentation standard project fully utilized the variety of actual examples encountered in corpus tagging in order to ensure better coverage on the definition of words. The word segmentation of Sinica Corpus follows this standard. Therefore it also became the best testing data for the proposed segmentation standard. The segmentation standard is composed of two parts: a set of segmentation criteria and a standard lexicon. The segmentation criteria can be further divided into the lexicon-independent and the lexicon-dependent parts. The lexicon-independent parts include the definition of a segmentation unit and.two segmentation principles. (1) Segmentation Unitdef is the smallest string of character(s) that has both an","independent meaning and a fixed grammatical category. (2) Segmentation Principles","(a) A string whose meaning cannot be derived by the sum of its components","should be treated as a segmentation unit.","(b) A string whose structural composition is not determined by the grammatical","requirements of its components, or a string which has a grammatical category","other than the one predicted by its structural composition should be treated as","a segmentation unit. The definition of a segmentation unit is an instantiation of the ideal definition of a word. The two segmentation principles are a functional definition of the segmentation unit as well as a procedural algorithm of how to identify segmentation units. In addition, the segmentation guidelines are lexicon-dependent and give instructions on how each lexical class should be treated. (3) Segmentation Guidelines","(a) Bound morphemes should be attached to neighboring words to form a","segmentation unit when possible.","(b) A string of characters that has a high frequency in the language or high co-","occurrence frequency among the components should be treated as a","segmentation unit when possible.","(c) A string separated by overt segmentation markers should be segmented.","(d) A string with complex internal structures should be segmented when possible. 170 Lastly, the lexicon contains a standard list of words as well as productive morphological suffixes, and obligatory segment markers. For more detail on the word segmentation standard, please refer to Huang et al. (1996). 3.2 Part-of-speech Tagging","The possible part-of-speech (abbr:pos) of each word was given after segmentation process. To resolve the ambiguities, a two-stage automatic tagging process was designed to disambiguate multi-category words. In the first stage, a small portion of the corpus was resolved by a hybrid method which combines rule-based and relaxation methods to select the most plausible pos tag for each multi-category word (Liu et al. 95). This initial corpus was post-edited manually and then became training data for the second stage statistical tagging model adapted from (Church 88). This statistical tagging model selects the pos sequence with the highest probability among all possible pos sequences P for each input sentence W, i.e. arg maxPr(PIW)=arg maxPr(P)","P\\t P Pr(WIP) and the probability of a pos sequence was approximated by pos-bigram statistics, i.e. Pr(P) = Pr(P1,P2,...,Pn)\\tIT Pr(PiIPi-1) , and Pr(WIP)\\tII Pr(WiIPi) After the automatic assignment of pos tags, the remained segmentation errors and tag errors need manual post-editing. An on-line editing tool--TAGTOOL was designed to provide functions of (1) on-line dictionary look-up, (2) short term memory and recall ability, and (3) new word collection (Chang & Chen 95). The function of an on-line dictionary to provide the possible pos and their respective examples for each word. Human taggers may examine examples of different word uses to help them determine a correct tag. The most recent correction of segmentation as well as tag assignments are recorded by TAGTOOL such that the same type of errors will be automatically corrected. The function of new word collection will report any new word, which is not listed in the lexicon, such that the lexicon can be augmented for future tagging. TAGTOOL not only speeds up the post-editing process, but also make the results more consistent when providing on-line consulting functions. However, human-induced inconsistencies are inevitably exist after post-editing. The last process to improve the tagging quality is by checking the KWIC file for each multi-tagged word in the corpus. If we sort each KWIC file according to the context around the key word, it is easy to find the inconsistent results. After sequentially proof-reading the corpus via TAGTOOL and selectively examining KWIC files for multi-category words, the SINICA corpus is able to maintain a high quality of standard both on word segmentation and on the pos tagging.","The tagset of the Sinica Corpus is reduced from the syntactic categories of the CKIP lexicon (CK1P 93). Appendix 1 lists the Sinica Corpus tagset and its interpretation. However, the reduced tags can still predict the finer-grained grammatical categories unambiguously, by fixing the domain of the mapping to the set of categories from each individual word.","In addition to the pos tags, we adopts 8 feature tags, in order to preserve important morpho-syntactic information, such as separable VO compounds, VR compounds, and abbreviated conjunct words, as shown in Fig. 3.

Conclusion","The Sinica corpus is the first balanced Chinese corpus with part-of-speech tagging available to public. The major design features of the Sinica corpus are summarized below. With five variant textual attribute parameters, we may adjust the proportions of text in different attributes to achieve an ideally balanced corpus. Another benefit of the hierarchical attribute assignment is that we can control our proportions of values according to different usages of the corpus. It is easy to establish subcorpora on the basis of our classifications. There are many different dimensions for us to compare all subcorpora from different viewpoints. We hope our work will lead to ideal criteria for a balanced corpus in the future. As for the word segmentation, we followed the draft standard of the ROC Computational Linguistic Society which might be the future national standard. The tag set is reduced from the category set of the CKIP Chinese lexicon under the criterion of keeping an unambiguous mapping between the word tag and syntactic category for each word. The resulting tagged corpus will benefit future tree bank construction, for the unique tag retains the information of the syntactic function and category for each word. The inspection system provides convenient tools for extracting and observing information hidden in the corpus by allowing the user to specify various linguistic and contextual conditions on the key word and the window. 6.

(3) Segmentation Guidelines","(a) Bound morphemes should be attached to neighboring words to form a","segmentation unit when possible.","(b) A string of characters that has a high frequency in the language or high co-","occurrence frequency among the components should be treated as a","segmentation unit when possible.","(c) A string separated by overt segmentation markers should be segmented.","(d) A string with complex internal structures should be segmented when possible. 170 Lastly, the lexicon contains a standard list of words as well as productive morphological suffixes, and obligatory segment markers. For more detail on the word segmentation standard, please refer to Huang et al. (1996). 3.2 Part-of-speech Tagging","The possible part-of-speech (abbr:pos) of each word was given after segmentation process. To resolve the ambiguities, a two-stage automatic tagging process was designed to disambiguate multi-category words. In the first stage, a small portion of the corpus was resolved by a hybrid method which combines rule-based and relaxation methods to select the most plausible pos tag for each multi-category word (Liu et al. 95). This initial corpus was post-edited manually and then became training data for the second stage statistical tagging model adapted from (Church 88). This statistical tagging model selects the pos sequence with the highest probability among all possible pos sequences P for each input sentence W, i.e. arg maxPr(PIW)=arg maxPr(P)","P\\t P Pr(WIP) and the probability of a pos sequence was approximated by pos-bigram statistics, i.e. Pr(P) = Pr(P1,P2,...,Pn)\\tIT Pr(PiIPi-1) , and Pr(WIP)\\tII Pr(WiIPi) After the automatic assignment of pos tags, the remained segmentation errors and tag errors need manual post-editing. An on-line editing tool--TAGTOOL was designed to provide functions of (1) on-line dictionary look-up, (2) short term memory and recall ability, and (3) new word collection (Chang & Chen 95). The function of an on-line dictionary to provide the possible pos and their respective examples for each word. Human taggers may examine examples of different word uses to help them determine a correct tag. The most recent correction of segmentation as well as tag assignments are recorded by TAGTOOL such that the same type of errors will be automatically corrected. The function of new word collection will report any new word, which is not listed in the lexicon, such that the lexicon can be augmented for future tagging. TAGTOOL not only speeds up the post-editing process, but also make the results more consistent when providing on-line consulting functions. However, human-induced inconsistencies are inevitably exist after post-editing. The last process to improve the tagging quality is by checking the KWIC file for each multi-tagged word in the corpus. If we sort each KWIC file according to the context around the key word, it is easy to find the inconsistent results. After sequentially proof-reading the corpus via TAGTOOL and selectively examining KWIC files for multi-category words, the SINICA corpus is able to maintain a high quality of standard both on word segmentation and on the pos tagging.","The tagset of the Sinica Corpus is reduced from the syntactic categories of the CKIP lexicon (CK1P 93). Appendix 1 lists the Sinica Corpus tagset and its interpretation. However, the reduced tags can still predict the finer-grained grammatical categories unambiguously, by fixing the domain of the mapping to the set of categories from each individual word.","In addition to the pos tags, we adopts 8 feature tags, in order to preserve important morpho-syntactic information, such as separable VO compounds, VR compounds, and abbreviated conjunct words, as shown in Fig. 3. The separable VO and VR features are essential since they identify discontinuous parts of a word. 171"]},{"title":"Figure 3. Table of Attributes","paragraphs":["Attr.

Conclusion","The Sinica corpus is the first balanced Chinese corpus with part-of-speech tagging available to public. The major design features of the Sinica corpus are summarized below. With five variant textual attribute parameters, we may adjust the proportions of text in different attributes to achieve an ideally balanced corpus. Another benefit of the hierarchical attribute assignment is that we can control our proportions of values according to different usages of the corpus. It is easy to establish subcorpora on the basis of our classifications. There are many different dimensions for us to compare all subcorpora from different viewpoints. We hope our work will lead to ideal criteria for a balanced corpus in the future. As for the word segmentation, we followed the draft standard of the ROC Computational Linguistic Society which might be the future national standard. The tag set is reduced from the category set of the CKIP Chinese lexicon under the criterion of keeping an unambiguous mapping between the word tag and syntactic category for each word. The resulting tagged corpus will benefit future tree bank construction, for the unique tag retains the information of the syntactic function and category for each word. The inspection system provides convenient tools for extracting and observing information hidden in the corpus by allowing the user to specify various linguistic and contextual conditions on the key word and the window. 6.
