A similar phenomenon is found in cases of French Stylistic Inversion with causative and perception verbs. The nominal subject of the infinitival complement can never appear with the inverted subject of the causative or perception verb. Both phenomena are usually referred to as Case-adjacency problems. In this paper, we will show that these Case-adjacency problems can be accounted for in a simple and straightforward manner under Attract F and Procrastinate, two constraints on movement formulated in Chomsky's Minimalist Program (Chomsky 1995, chapter 4). 1.\\tIntroduction* One way of deriving WH-interrogatives in French is to generate the subject, which must be nominal, in VP-final position.

With respect to the subject of the infinitival complement of causative and perception verbs the following can be observed: Causative verbs always have the subject follow the infinitive. In the case of perception verbs, the subject either precedes or follows the verb: (3) a Jean a fait chanter Marie.","Jean has made sing Marie","b Jean a entendu (Marie) chanter (Marie).","Jean has heard Marie sing A remarkable aspect of causative and perception verbs displaying the structure of Stylistic Inversion is that the inverted subject of the matrix clause can never occur with the nominal subject of the infinitival clause: 501 (4)\\ta * Qu'a entendu Marieobject chanter Jeansubject?","b * Qu'a entendu Jeansubjec, Mariethject chanter?","c * Qu'a entendu Mariethject Jeansubject chanter?","d * Qu'a entendu chanter Jeansubject Marieobject?","What did Jean hear Marie sing?' Traditionally, cases like (4a-d) have been explained via the Case adjacency requirement, according to which the Case-assignee must be strictly adjacent to its Case-assigner (cf. Stowell 1981). Under the assumption that both the inverted subject of the matrix clause and the subject of the embedded predicate get their Case from V under government, the ungrammaticality of (4a-c1) can be attributed to the circumstance that the rightmost NP is not adjacent to V and therefore it cannot get Case.","Stowell (1981) makes crucial use of the mechanism of Case-assignment under government for the explanation of the ungrammaticality of (4a-d). However, in the Minimalist Program (Chomsky 1995), functional licensing through government has been abandoned in favour of functional licensing under the strict local relationship of SPEC-Head agreement. Therefore, explanations like the one proposed by Stowell cannot be maintained any more.","In this paper, we will show that within the Minimalist Program the ungrammaticality of (4a-d) can straightforwardly be accounted for under"]},{"title":"Attract F","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"Procrastinate,","paragraphs":["two constraints on movement formulated in Chomsky's Minimalist Program (Chomsky 1995, chapter 4).

Valois & Dupuis(1992:328)","paragraphs":["The price that will-present Marie to Pierre.","b * Le prix que prêsentera a Pierre Marie.","The price that will-present to Pierre Marie Under an approach where the subject is to the right of VP, the unmarked word order is ungrammatical, as illustrated by (6b), whereas the marked word order in (6a) which is the result of extraposition of the PP-complement -a movement for which no clear motivation can be provided- is grammatical. The contrast between (6a) and (6b) follows quite naturally under an analysis where the subject is to the left of VP.","As we have seen in section (1), the subject of Stylistic Inversion with causative and perception verbs appears after the verb of the complement. This could lead to the conclusion that the hypothesis according to which the subject is to the right of VP is more appropriate for the derivation of (1) and (2). This conclusion is incorrect, because the problems for the derivation of cases where the PP-complements follow the subject pointed out above also crop up in cases of Stylistic Inversion with causative and perception verbs: (7) Qu'a entendu dire Jean a Marie?","What has heard say Jean to Marie? It seems that an analysis where the subject is to the left of VP is also the most plausible way to account for causative and perception verbs displaying the structure of Stylistic Inversion.

This claim is also consistent with Kayne's (1994:36) hypothesis that specifiers are universally to the left of their head.","A major consequence is that we do have to assume that the infinitive in examples like (1) and (2) moves to the functional domain of the matrix clause. This immediately raises the question whether this movement is restricted to interrogatives or does it also take place in declaratives as one would desire. In order to find an answer to this question, one needs to analyze the structure of the infinitival complements of the causative and perception verbs.","3. The structure of infinitival complements of causative and perception verbs With respect to the structure of embedded predicates of perception verbs with preverbal subjects, two proposals can be distinguished. According to the first one, the structure of these constructions is monoclausal (Guêron & Hoekstra 1988). According to the second one, the structure is biclausal (Zubizarretta 1985, Reed 1992). Constructions with causative and perception verbs where the subject of the complement follows the infinitive can have three structures. Besides a biclausal structure (Aissen 1974, Rouveret & Vergnaud 1980, Reed 1992) and a monoclausal structure (Guêron & Hoekstra 1988, Den Dikken 503 1992, Pijnenburg & Hulk 1989), these constructions are also assigned both structures at the same time (Zubizarretta 1985, Goodall 1984). In this section, we will show on the basis of empirical arguments that constructions with perception verbs having the subject of their complement precede the infinitive are biclausal, whereas constructions with causative and perception verbs having the subject of their complement follow the infinitive are monoclausal.","The first question one has to answer with respect to infinitival complements where the subject precedes the infinitive is the following: Do they have a functional domain or are they merely consisting of a VP? Whether they have a functional domain can be tested through the distribution of VP-adverbs. According to Pollock (1989:366), VP-adverbs are to the left of VP. Assuming this view to be correct, the subject in the following sentences must be outside the VP: (8) Jean a vu Marie [vp, a peine [vp manger.","Jean has seen Marie hardly eat. Under the rather generally accepted claim that the accusative Case-feature in French is weak, which we adopt here, we must conclude that the infinitival complement in (8) has a functional domain. Otherwise there is no position for the subject"]},{"title":"Marie.","paragraphs":["This conclusion raises the following question: How","articulated is this functional domain?

This means that under normal circumstances the verb has moved to TP. This movement raises the following question: Does TP in (10) host the subject"]},{"title":"Marie as","paragraphs":["well or is this subject somewhere else? The answer to this question can be found by investigating the possibility of having negation inside the infinitival complement.","It is rather generally accepted that negation has its own projection. In accordance with Pollock (1989:397), we locate this projection in between AgrSP and TP. As shown by the following examples, negation is allowed in the infinitival complement of perception verbs: (11) Jean a vu Marie ne pas manger vite.","Jean has seen Marie not eat quickly In the example in (11), the subject precedes negation. This entails that the subject must be in AgrSP in overt syntax. It cannot be in SPEC-AgrOP, since the accusative Case-feature in French is generally considered to be weak, as 504 we pointed out above. In accordance with Chomsky (1995), we assume that AgrS° contains a strong D-feature (EPP-feature). The need to check this strong D-feature causes the subject to move overtly.","Up till now, we have established that infinitival complements of perception verbs with preverbal subjects have an AgrSP and everything AgrSP can possibly dominate. The obvious question is whether this complement has a CP as well. The presence of a CP can be determined by verifying whether the infinitival complement can be introduced by a WHelement. In (12) this is quite unproblematic.

Notably the impossibility of negation in complements of causative and 505 perception verbs with a postverbal subject strongly suggests that they lack a functional domain. As a consequence, we adopt the hypothesis according to which constructions containing causative and perception verbs with embedded predicates having the subject follow the verb are monoclausal. More specifically, we assume, following Zubizarretta (1985), that the embedded predicate is part of the VP of the matrix clause. This VP is headed by a c̀omplex verb' consisting of the infinitive and the causative or perception verb. Again following Zubizarretta, we assume that this complex verb internalizes the external argument of the infinitive as an object.

As shown by the contrast between (1) and (2) on the one hand and (4a-d) on the other, Stylistic Inversion is only allowed with causative and perception verbs having an embedded predicate which lacks a subject. The immediate effect of this distributional restriction is that these cases can never be generated in the structure illustrated in (14). The reason is that the strong D-feature of AgrS° will remain unchecked causing the derivation to crash, contrary to fact. The only possible alternative is the structure illustrated in (18) corresponding to cases where the matrix verb and the infinitive form a complex verb.","In section (2), we made the assumption that the subject of Stylistic Inversion is to the"]},{"title":"left","paragraphs":["of VP. We already pointed out that the consequence of this assumption is that the infinitive in (1) and (2) has to move to a position in the functional domain. The question that we have to ask ourselves now is whether the infinitive also moves in declaratives. Above, we assumed that the matrix verb and the infinitive start as a unit. It is very likely that this unit will be split up in the course the derivation.
