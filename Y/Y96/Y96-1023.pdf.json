Introduction","paragraphs":["TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) is an international project which aims to provide some guidelines for encoding various kinds of texts in electronic forms. It conforms to the ISO standard of Standard Generalized Markup Language (ISO 1986). The primary result of this project, published in 1994, Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange (TEI P3) edited by Burnard and Sperberg-McQueen, covers many kinds of texts in depth. Dictionary markup is one of them. In this paper, we investigate ways to use and extend TEI encoding scheme for the markup of Korean dictionary entries. To accomplish this objective, it is necessary to consider the logical structure of the Korean dictionary entries.","Although TEI suggestions for dictionary encoding (markup) is very comprehensive to cover various kinds of dictionaries, its original commitment is to consider only western language dictionaries Ode and Veronis 1995: 168). We need to cope with problems to be encountered in encoding Korean dictionary entries in conformance with TEI. We try to extend and modify the TEI encoding scheme in the way suggested by TEL In addition, we restrict the content model so that the encoded dictionary might be viewed more as a database than as a simple computerized (originally printed) dictionary.[1][2]"]},{"title":"2. Top Level Elements of a Dictionary Entry","paragraphs":["Before presenting the model of Korean dictionary entries, let us go over the basic dictionary scheme provided by TEI. 219 (1) TEI P3: Basic Structure of a Dictionary","<text>","<body> <entry> ... </entry> <entry> ... </entry> <superEntry>","<entry> ... </entry>","<entry> ... </entry>","•","• • </superEntry> <entry> ... </entry> <entry> • • • \\t<hom>\\t</hom> \\t <hom>\\t</hom> </entry> </body> </text>","The text of a dictionary consists of a number of <entry> elements, each of which can consist of a number of <hom>(i.e. homonym) elements.","Some dictionary elements, called dictionary top level elements can appear at the level of entry, homonym, and sense, disregarding superentry element for the moment. The following DTD definitions show this: (2) TEI P3: Print Dictionaries DTD Top Level <!ENTITY x superentry 'INCLUDE' > <![ xsuperentry; [ <!ELEMENT xn.superentry; - 0 ((xn.form)?, (xn.entry)+) . . .","<!ENTITY x entry 'INCLUDE' > xentry; [ \\t","<!ELEMENT xn. entry;\\t- 0\\t(xn.hom; I xn. sense; 1 xm.dictionaryTopLevel)+","+(anchor) <!ENTITY x hom 'INCLUDE' > <![ xhom; [ <!ELEMENT xn.hom;\\t- 0\\t(xn.sense;","xm.dictionaryTopLevel)*","-(entry)\\t> <!ENTITY x sense 'INCLUDE' > <!( xsense; [ \\t","<!ELEMENT xn.sense;\\t- -\\t (xn.sense;\\txm.dictionaryTopLevel xm.phrase I #PCDATA)*"]},{"title":"220","paragraphs":["The definitions of <entry>, <horn>, and <sense> include dictionary top level elements, which are defined as follows: (3) TEI P3: Dictionary Top Elements <!ENTITY x x.dictionaryTopLevel <!ENTITY x m.dictionaryTopLevel 'xx.dictionaryTopLevel def eg","etym 1 form : gramGrp I note 1 re I trans 1 usg xr' >","As defined by m.dictionaryTopLevel entity reference, these top level elements are <def>, <eg>, <etym>, <form>, <gramGrp>, <note>, <re>, <trans>, <usg>, and <xr>. For Korean dictionary entries, these 10 elements are all are needed. Overall, some elements can be used as they are provided by TEI, and others need to be modified according to specific needs of a Korean dictionary, in the way to be specified from now on.","First of all, the following dictionary top level elements elements are to be used without modifications for the markup of Korean dictionary entries: 1) <def> for definition; 2) <trans> for translation (not used in a monolingual dictionary); 3) <eg> for usage examples; 4) <note> for any kind of notes; 5) <re> for related words. Other dictionary top elements are to be modified as follows.","For the <form> element, besides usual <orth> (orthography) and <pron> (pronunciation) elements, we need a sub-element which contains a form showing long vowels and a major morphological constituent break, which is usually marked for entries in Korean dictionaries.\\tWe call this element <lenHyph>.\\tIn the following example, we provide -the part tagged by <lenHyph> along with parts of <orth> and <pron>.","(4) Eg. ,1;?1ZEJC4 'courageous' <form> <orth>gg-Z.̀_.t CWorth> <lenHyph>g\\tCE</lenHyph> <pron>- ECE</pron> </f orm>","Another top level element is <gramGrp> for grammatical information of an entry. Besides <pos> and <subc> elements provided by TEI P3, we seem to need some elements which specify the kinds of irregular inflection for some verbs and exemplary inflected forms.

Instead, we might adopt the following work procedure.","Lexicographers use a popular wordprocessor, which is non-SGML, but they write in a strict format and use a few special symbols which specify various dictionary elements. A program converts this file to a text file which conforms to the modified TEI DTD discussed above. Lexicographers view the content of the writing in a formated way by an SGML browser. If we find inconsistencies and faults in the file, we correct the wordprocessor file and convert it and view the content again, and so on. This procedure can be adopted at a later stage of dictionary compilation and is necessary if one considers an SGML publishing of the dictionary in the long run (Alschuler 1995). Also, it is a step toward making a machine-readable dictionary to be used for theoretical and computational linguistic research purposes (Boguraev 1994, Atkins and Zampoli 1994, Fillmore and Atkins 1994, Sinclair 1987)."]},{"title":"5. Conclusion","paragraphs":["In this paper, I have presented some ways to accommodate TEI encoding scheme for the markup of Korean dictionary entries. It is an SGML application, so it is in general an approach to structured information. Since dictionary entry is a typical instance of structured information, the SGML method can be applied most easily and successfully. However, since the structure of a dictionary entry is relatively flexible too, we need to be careful not to be too strict in modeling the structure. TEI's definition of dictionary top level elements seems to give enough flexibility to cope with such a problem. Other SGML approaches relating to the markup of Korean dictionaries, such as Choe (1996) and Choe & Choe (1996), which assume a more strict structure for a Korean dictionary entry, might encounter a problem in actual markup of Korean dictionary entries. 226"]},{"title":"(Notes)","paragraphs":["[1] Ide and Veronis (1995) and Chapter 12 (Print Dictionaries) of TEI P3 (Sperberg-McQueen and Burnard, eds., 1994) discuss three views of dictionaries: (a) the typographic view; (b) the editorial view; (c) the lexical view. The first view is concerned with the two-dimensional printed page while the last view is concerned with underlying information represented in a dictionary, without concern for its exact form. The editorial view is in between. [2] The markup scheme presented here has been investigated in conjunction with an on-going project of Korean dictionary compilation at Korea University.
