A more interesting phenomenon is that the increased argument usually takes either a relation of direct object or a relation of indirect object, which is different from the one assumed in corresponding non-causative constructions. To explicate this phenomenon, clause union analyses have been suggested within the framework of Relational Grammar, supposing that causative constructions are universally biclausal at the initial stratum but monoclausal at the final stratum.","Perlmutter & Postal (1974) propose that the intransitive downstairs subject is revalued as an upstairs direct object whereas the transitive downstairs subject is revalued as an upstairs indirect object.

Gibson & Raposo (1986) also demonstrate that in French the downstairs final 1 always revalues to 3 forcing the initial 3 into chomage, and that the revalued 3 may further advance to 2.

Clause Union Analyses and Biclausal Analysis","This section discusses the inadequacies of Gerdts' (1990) and Kim's (1990) union analyses and proposes a biclausal analysis based on the subcategorizational features of the verb ha as an alternative solution. 3.1 Clause Union Analyses","Following P & P, G & R and Rosen, Gerdts (1990) and Kim (1990) account for the case marker alternations in (1) under the assumption that Korean syntactic causatives are initially biclausal but finally monoclausal. So, (5a,b) are the initial structures of (1a,b), respectively, in their analyses: 84","(5) a [Chelswu [Swuni ttena] ha] b. [Chelswu [Swuni chayk ilk] ha] According to them, Swuni in (la,b) is, respectively, assigned an accusative case and a dative case because it is revalued as the 2 and 3 of the matrix clause (P & P's Union Laws), chayk in (lb) is assigned an accusative case by virtue of G & R's Inheritance Principle, and Swuni in (lb) can be assigned an accusative case due to the advancement to 2 after the revaluation to 3. Gerdts and Kim further claim that Korean allows another type of clause union in which the downstairs final 1 is put into a 1-chomeur relation (Rosen). For this reason,"]},{"title":"Swuni","paragraphs":["in (la,b) can be also nominatively marked.","At first glance, with the admittance of the two types of unions and 3-to-2 Advancement, Gerdts and Kim seem to account for the case marker alternations in (1). However, their analyses are not only inadequate to account for the case marker alternations but also theoretically invalid. First, the appearance of the dative case in (la) is problematic because no union law allows the intransitive downstairs 1 to revalue to 3. Although Gerdts does not mention anything, the problem could be solved if the further retreatment of the revalued 2 to 3 is assumed. However, it cannot but be an ad hoc solution because the retreatment of 2 to 3 is not allowable in. Korean. Kim (1990:189-92) instead proposes that the intransitive downstairs 1 revalues to 2 or 3 in the union stratum in accordance with the given meaning. If coercive causation is involved, the downstairs 1 appears as a 2, while if noncoercive causation is involved, the downstairs 1 appears as a 3. However, Kim's proposal cannot but be another ad hoc solution in the sense that he proposes another peculiar union law which is restricted to Korean syntactic causatives. Moreover, Kim's proposal would also be ad hoc unless a principled answer could be given to account for the assymetry between the intransitive and transitive causatives.","Second, in a No-Revaluation Union, a stipulation is required to guarantee that the embedded 1 will be put en chomage by the matrix 1 (Davies & Rosen 1988:82-5).3' That is, the Chomeur Law and the Motivated Chomage Law require the nominal which bears a term relation in the matrix before union to be put en chomage to satisfy stratal uniqueness; but precisely the opposite happens in clause unions. Thus, Gerdts' and Kim's analyses relying on Rosen are not permissible analyses within the framework of Relational Grammar. 3.2 Biclausal Analysis Cho (1987) and Lee (1991) show that the verb"]},{"title":"ha","paragraphs":["subcategorizes a direct object alone, a direct object and an indirect object together, or a clause, as shown below:","(6) a.

The fact that the causee can be nominatively, but not datively, marked shows that the quantifier is floated from the downstairs 1, not from the upstairs 3. This follows from the fact that quantifier floating is not allowed from 3s.","Further note that accusative markers can appear between the downstairs verb and the matrix verb, as in (10). (10) Chelswu-ka Swuni-ka/-luV-eykey chayk-ul ilk-key-lul ha-yess-ta. The accusative marker can be attached to the embedded clause itself because it is a final 2 in (7a,c) and is a final 2-chomeur by virtue of the Relational Succession Law although the downstairs 1 raises to upstairs object. This is exactly what the proposed analysis claims. In other words, the intervening 86 accusative marker above is the evidence that the embedded clause itself is taken as a direct object of the matrix verb. 4. Arguments for the Biclausal Analysis","This section shows that the proposed biclausal analysis is superior to the union analyses in that the former makes a correct prediction with respect to several syntactic phenomena whereas the latter do not. 4.1.

Take a look at the following examples:","(11) a. *Sensayngnim-i haksayng-i chayk-ul ilk-key ha-yess-ta. b. Sensayngnim-i haksayng-i chayk-ul ilk-key ha-si-ess-ta.

This is because the downstairs 1 revalues as a 2 and the revalued 2 may advance to the 3 under the union analyses.

Thus, union analyses predict that the sentences in question include only one time adverb whereas the biclausal analysis predicts that they can include two different time adverbs.

Gerdts (1990:208) argues that the fact that adverbials such as"]},{"title":"onul","paragraphs":["'yesterday' cannot occur between the upstairs verb and the downstairs verb for almost half of Korean speakers is evidence that the downstairs verb and upstairs verb form a single verb in the union stratum. However, her argument does not seem convincing. In the first place, the grammaticality judgement of the illustrated sentence is not determinate because over half of Korean speakers admit (16) as a grammatical sentence, as she indicates. Lee (1991) suggests that the obscure grammaticality may be ascribed to the semantic peculiarity of the verb"]},{"title":"ha.","paragraphs":["88 That is, the sequence of the downstairs verb and ha seems to be perceived as a single constituent because the verb ha itself is not strong in its lexical meaning. If this is the case, (16) should be considered grammatical since the grammaticality of (16) is a matter of perception, not syntax.","In addition, two different time adverbs can occur in the sentences under discussion, as shown below: (17) Swuni-ka Chelswu-ka/-lul/-eykey onul chayk-ul ilk-key ecey ha-yess-ta. As shown above, the appearance of two different time adverbs reveals that the downstairs verb and the upstairs verb are separate verbs of each clause and that the sentences in question are consequently biclausal. This follows from the fact that the scope of time adverbs is restricted to the clause which the time adverbs belong to. 4.4. Negation Words","In Korean, a negation word like an 'not' occur only in the position immediately preceding the main verb within the same simplex clause unless it negates a whole sentence. Hence, the negation word would be expected to appear only in front of the downstairs verb under the union analyses but in front of the downstairs verb as well as the upstairs verb under the biclausal analysis. Now take a look at the following examples:","(18) a. Chelswu-ka Swuni-ka/-lul/-eykey chayk-ul an ilk-key ha-yess-ta. theslwu made Swuni not read the book.' b. Chelswu-ka Swuni-ka/-lul/-eykey chayk-ul ilk-key an ha-yess-ta.","C̀helswu did not make Swuni read the book.' c. Chelswu-ka Swuni-ka/-luV-eykey chayk-ul an ilk-key an ha-yess-ta.","C̀helswu did not make Swuni not read the book.' The above show that the negation word can occur with the downstairs verb or/and the upstairs verb. If the insertion of a negation word is a surface phenomenon, the union analyses predict that (18a) is possible but (18b,c) are impossible. Thus, the union analyses cannot but make a wrong prediction. However, the biclausal analysis predicts that the above three are possible sentences. Moreover, the appearance of a negation word between the downstairs verb and the upstairs verb is another strong evidence that they do not form a single verb as claimed in the union analyses. 4.5. Scrambling","Scrambling in Korean is a process by which some of sentential elements are fronted for stylistic reasons. Generally, final 2s and 2-chomeurs can scramble. In addition, downstairs final 2s and the embedded clauses bearing a relation of final 2 or 2-chomeur can be scrambled. Let us again look at the sentences in issue to discuss the predictions under the two different analyses"]},{"title":"with respect to scrambling: (19) a.","paragraphs":["Chelswu-ka Swuni-ka chayk-ul ilk-key ha-yess-ta. b. Cheslwu-ka Swuni-lul chayk-ul ilk-key ha-yess-ta."]},{"title":"89","paragraphs":["c. Chesiwu-ka Swuni-eykey chayk-ul ilk-key ha-yess-ta. Under the union analyses, chalk in (19a, c) and Swuni in (19b) take a final 2 relation but chayk in (19b) is a 2-chomeur. Under the biclausal analysis, chayk in (19a,b,c) is the final 2 of the downstairs clause but Swuni in (19b) is the final 2 of the upstairs clause. For this reason, although their accounts are slightly different, both the union analyses and the biclausal analysis equally predict that Swuni and chayk can be scrambled, as in (20).","(20) a. Chayk-ul Chelswu-ka Swuni-ka ilk-key ha-yess-ta. b. Swuni-lul Chelswu-ka chayk-ul ilk-key ha-yess-ta. c. Chayk-ul Chelswu-ka Swuni-eykey ilk-key ha-yes-ta. d. Swuni-lul Cheslwu-ka Swuni-eykey ilk-key ha-yess-ta.","However, the causative sentences under discussion are finally monoclausal under the union analyses whereas under the biclausal analysis they are finally biclausal so that the downstairs clause bears a relation of 2 in (19a,c) or 2-chomeur in (19b). 5) Accordingly, the latter can additionally predict that the downstairs is itself scrambled, as in (21), but the former cannot.","(21) a. Swuni-ka chayk-ul\\tChelswu-ka ha-yess-ta. b. Chayk-ul ilk-key-(1u1) Chelswu-ka Swuni-lul/-eykey ha-yess-ta. (21a) is the case in which the downstairs in (19a) is scrambled and (21b) is the case in which the downstairs in (19b,c) is scrambled. Especially the appearance of the accusative marker after the complementizer -key strongly suggests that the embedded clause per se is scrambled. Moreover, the split of the downstairs verb from the matrix verb in (21) cannot be accounted for if the downstairs verb and the upstairs verb form a single verb by virtue of clause union as argued in Gerdts. However, unlike the union analyses, the biclausal analysis can provide not only a correct prediction but also a principled explanation in regard to the split of the two verbs by scrambling. 4.6. Passivization","Passivization is an advancement to subject from direct object. On the other hand, passivization is a cyclic rule which is sensitive to clause boundaries. For this reason, downstairs 2s cannot be passivized at the upstairs level.","There might be only one final 2 under the union analyses since the final monoclausality is assumed. By contrast, there might be a downstairs 2 as well as an upstairs 2 under the biclausal analysis because the final biclausality is taken. The downstairs clause itself can be a final 2 or a final 2-chomeur due to a raising to upstairs 2 of the downstairs 1. Therefore, the union analyses predict that only nominals bearing a final 2 relation at the collapsed clause level can be passivized whereas the biclausal analysis predicts that any nominals or"]},{"title":"the downstairs","paragraphs":["per se can be passivized if they come to bear a relation of final 2 regardless of stairs status (downstairs or upstairs). Thus, the two types of analyses are completely different from each other in their predictions with respect to the passivization of the sentences in question.","To save space, let us directly plunge into the cyclicity of passivization, although there might be many other instances which would be differently 90 predicted under the two types of analyses. As mentioned, passivization presupposes sentences containing a transitive stratum. For this reason, the biclausal analysis predicts that passivization can be cyclically applied to (19b) only since the passivization within the downstairs clause would be prevented due to subject raising to upstairs 2 in (19b) and the deletion of the downstairs 1 in (19c). Now let us look at the sentence below:","(22) Chelswu-eyuyhay chayk-i Swuni-eyuyhay ilk-e ci-key\\ttoy-ess-ta.","-by\\tbook-N\\t-by\\tread-Pass-Cmp Pass-Pst Ìt was made by Chelswu that the book was read by Swuni.' (22) is a sentence in which the downstairs 2 is passivized and then the downstairs clause bearing the 2 relation of the upstairs clause is passivized. As expected, the biclausal analysis predicts that the cyclic application of passivization would result in (22), and (22) is indeed a grammatical sentence. However, the union analyses would not even expect the existence of a sentence like (22).","It seems worthwhile to discuss an additional issue regarding the passivization of the sentence in (19a). Look at the following:","(23) a Chelswu-ka Swuni-ka chayk-ul ilk-key ha-yess-ta. b. Chelswu-ka chayk-i Swuni-eyuyhay ilk-e ci-key \\tha-yess-ta.","-N book-N\\t-by\\tread-Pass-Cmp do-Pst C̀helswu made the book to be read by Swuni.' (23b) is the sentence in which passivization is applied only within the downstairs clause. Following Rosen, Gerdts and Kim claim that (23a) is an instance of clause union in which the downstairs 1 undergoes no revaluation but is put into the 1-chomeur relation because of the upstairs 1. Then (23b) should be also considered a causative sentence insofar as the sequence -ke ha is treated as a causative morpheme. Observing that, on the one hand, in Italian a passive morpheme cannot occur with causative sentences, and on the other hand, in Romance languages the argument of unaccusative predicates cannot appear in the causative sentences, Rosen (1983:347) claims that if a nominal heads a 1-arc in the complement clause of a union, it heads an initial 1-arc in that clause. Following Rosen's claim, Gerdts and Kim implicitly argue that the downstairs clause Swuni-ka chayk-ul ilk-key in (23a) is not a passive clause so that Swuni is an initial 1, but is put en 1-chomage due to the Stratal Uniqueness Law. However, if the downstairs clause chayk-i Swuni-eyuyhay ilk-e ci-key in (23b) is a passive clause, as the passive morpheme -e ciindicates, the nominatively-marked subject chayk should not be an initial 1. If Rosen's observation is valid, Gerdts' and Kim's union analyses based on Rosen's No Revaluation Union should treat sentences like (23b) as ungrammatical or as different sentences from causative sentences at least. This may amount to saying that Gerdts and Kim cannot but treat -key ha as two different grammatical formatives. 5."]},{"title":"Conclusion","paragraphs":["This paper has argued against Gerdts' and Kim's union analyses of the Korean syntactic causatives.

Most significantly, wrong predictions of the union analyses with respect to the syntactic processes which are sensitive to clause boundaries at the surface level reveal that ha-causatives are not instances of clause unions at all.
