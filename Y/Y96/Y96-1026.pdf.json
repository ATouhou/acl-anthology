In this paper, we try to propose a theory of control in line with the LMT theory. The new control mechanism is called Argument Control.","Facts involving the HO construction in Taiwanese will be given first to show the inadequacy of Functional Control. Then, based on the observation that the HO construction in Taiwanese manifests a semantic alternation determined by both the property of the matrix subject and of the embedded subject, we propose the theory of argument control. In this theory, the control relation lies between two thematic roles. 1. Introduction","Bresnan and Kanerva (1989) proposes Lexical-Mapping Theory (LMT) to correlate the syntactic structures and representations with the predicate argument structure of verbs. In this theory, the syntactic representation is determined by the predicate argument structure of a verb.","However, widely accepted LMT account has not been given to the control structure : the widely adopted theory of control is still Bresnan's functional control based on grammatical functions and structural terms instead of the predicate argument structure of verbs.

Yet, functional control cannot give a satisfactory account for it since it totally resorts to grammatical functions and structural terms. Hence, we try to determine the control relation in the argument structure. 3.1 The Frame of Argument Control","In argument control, I have stipulated the controller is either a thematic role or an argument structure, e.g. a clausal subject. The same applies to the controllee. The control relation in argument control is determined as follows: the thematic role, taken by a control verb, in the lower position in the hierarchy of the thematic roles controls the highest (or the higher if a verb requires two arguments) thematic role of another verb which will be an embedded verb. And then the regular devices of the mapping theory 3, such as the intrinsic role classifications, the default role classifications and the well-formedness condition, can be applied to the argument structure.","In addition, there are two things we have to pay attention to. The first is that verbs like 'to seem' which has a non-thematic subject will, in its argument structure, have an empty slot for this non-thematic subject. The other is that a verb will take a proposition as its argument. In our analysis, a proposition is also represented in the argument structure of the whole sentence as an argument structure. When a verb takes a proposition (or two propositions) and a thematic role as its arguments, we need to determine which of them will be realized as a subject. We propose a hypothesis as follows: if any thematic role in one of the propositions is controlled', then the other proposition will be mapped onto SUBJ; if a verb takes a proposition and a thematic role as its arguments, as long as the thematic role taken by this verb is either a theme role or a patient role, both of which will be mapped onto SUBJ only when the sentence is unaccusative, the proposition will be realized as a subject, that is, the theme role or patient role will be mapped onto OBJ. 3.2 The"]},{"title":"HO","paragraphs":["Construction Examined in terms of Argument Control As illustrated in Section 2, the semantic alternation of"]},{"title":"ho","paragraphs":["is determined by the cooperation of the property of the matrix subject and of the embedded subject.

A control verb is lexically specified. To represent the control relation in argument structure, we propose that the lower role of a control verb controls the higher role (or highest role if the verb takes three arguments). If the control verb is a verb taking a non-thematic subject, then the empty slot left in an argument structure will automatically be the controller. If a verb takes thematic roles and propositions as its arguments, then, to determine whether the proposition(s) will be mapped onto SUBJ, we need to consider the position of thematic roles it takes in the hierarchy of the thematic roles: if the verb takes any role other than a patient role or theme role, the thematic role will be mapped onto SUBJ because unmarkedly a theme role or a patient role will not be mapped onto SUBJ unless it is unaccusative (Levin and Hovav 1995: 3). If a verb takes two propositions and a thematic role as its 254 arguments, both propositions are potentially able to serve as a subject. In this situation, syntax can do nothing about this and which one is a proper subject is determined in semantics by logic or even by world knowledge.","In argument structure, when a verb takes a proposition as its argument, the argument structure of an embedded verb is placed instead of a PROP feature. When the verb takes a non-thematic subject, which means that its subject is not restricted to certain thematic role, an empty slot is left in its argument structure to indicate its non-thematic position.","The embedded argument structure will automatically be mapped onto either a COMP, a clause with a complete structure, or a XCOMP, a clause with its subject unfulfilled depending on whether any thematic role in it is controlled. 4. Conclusion","The essence of argument control includes two parts: the first is that a verb taking a proposition as its argument, in fact, takes an argument structure as its argument; the second is that the control relation can be determined in an argument structure.
