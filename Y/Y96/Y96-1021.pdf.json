The correlation between proportional readings and topic structure has been observed by Heim (1990) and Chierchia (1992) but has not been given a satisfactory explanation yet. Based on my previous study that indefinite NPs are ambiguous between quantificational and cardinal readings, and proper readings are determined by the topic structure, I will show how appropriate readings of donkey sentences are derived from the semantics of indefinite NPs and the syntactic representation of topic structure. 1. Introduction In this paper I address the ambiguity of donkey sentences, namely multiple proportional readings. Kadmon (1987) notices that a conditional donkey sentence may have three different proportional readings, i.e., an asymmetric reading oriented to either a subject or an object, and a symmetric reading, while a relative-clause donkey sentence is unambiguously asymmetric to a head noun. Recently, it has been observed by Heim (1990) and Chierchia (1992) that the proportional readings of a conditional donkey sentence are disambiguated by the topic structure.","As always resonated in the literature of donkey sentences, a solution to the proportion problem hinges on the semantics of indefinite NPs and quantificational adverbs. Two main analyses have been suggested for this problem, i.e., Heim (1990) and Chierchia (1992). Both of the analyses assume that indefinite NPs are existential quantifiers, and quantificational adverbs are quantifiers over situations or events. Based on this assumption, they assign multiple proportional readings to donkey sentences; however, neither of them give a convincing explanation for the role of topic structure, namely disambiguating proportional readings.","I start with my previous study, Kwak (1995), about the ambiguity of indefinite NPs and the semantics of quantificational adverbs. For independent reasons, I have proposed that indefinite NPs are ambiguous between quantificational and cardinal readings, which are sensitive to topic structure, and cardinal readings of indefinite NPs are not generalized quantifiers but 'event-dependent' individuals. Quantificational adverbs are defined as quantifiers over events. Based on this study, I consider how proper readings of donkey sentences are derived from the semantics of indefinite NPs and the syntactic representations of topic","Section 2 concerns multiple proportional readings of donkey sentences and sensitivity to topic structure. In section 3, previous analyses will be critically reviewed. Finally, in section 4, I will summarize my previous study, and show how this work leads to an appropriate account for the current issue. 2. Multiple Proportional Readings of Donkey Sentences The proportional reading of a relative-clause donkey sentence as in (1) has been first pointed out by Partee (1984). 197 (1) Most farmers who own a donkey beat it. Partee argues that the correct truth condition of (1) concerns the proportion of donkey-owning farmers as to donkey-beating farmers. Inspired by Partee, Kadmon (1987) observes that the proportional readings of conditional donkey sentences are more complex than their relative-clause counterparts. (2) If a farmer owns a donkey, he usually beats it. In addition to the asymmetric reading as to farmers, (2) also has an asymmetric reading as to donkeys, i.e., most donkeys that are owned by a farmer are beaten, and a symmetric reading such that for most pairs of farmer and donkey standing in an owning relation, it is true that a farmer beats a donkey.","Later Heim (1990) and Chierchia (1992) argue that three proportional readings of a donkey sentence are not equally available, and that a preferred reading is determined by the topic structure. For instance, a sentence that is neutral to topic structure like (3) is ambiguous in three ways. (3) If a drummer lives in an apartment complex, it is usually half empty. (3) may be interpreted in an asymmetric reading as to drummers such that most drummers live in an apartment that is half empty, or in an asymmetric reading as to apartment complexes such that most apartment complexes where a drummer lives are half empty. In addition to these asymmetric readings, a symmetric reading is also available in (3), i.e., for most pairs of drummer and apartment complex standing in a living relation, it is true that the apartment is half empty.","The three readings of (3), however, are not equally available, when the sentence involves a marked topic NP.","(4) a. Do you think there are any vacancies in this apartment complex? - Well, I heard that Fulano lives there, and if a DRUMMER lives in an apartment complex, it is usually half empty.","b. Drummers mostly live in crowded dormitories, but if a drummer lives in an APARTMENT COMPLEX, it is usually half empty. With a strong phonological stress on one of the NPs, the discourse of (4a) is oriented to the vacancies of the apartment complex, while that of (4b) is oriented to drummers. Heim and Chierchia observe that (4a) is construed only in an asymmetric reading as to apartment complexes, whereas (4b) delivers only an asymmetric reading as to drummers. Therefore, I will consider how to derive an appropriate proportional reading from the topic structure of a donkey sentence. 3. Previous Analyses Two main analyses have been proposed as to multiple proportional readings, i.e., Heim (1990) and Chierchia (1992). I will critically review each of these analyses, focusing on whether their analyses can derive an appropriate proportional reading from the topic structure. 3.1 Heim (1990) In the framework of Kratzer (1989)'s situation theory, Heim (1990) defines quantificational adverbs (henceforth Q-adverbs) as quantifiers over situations and indefinite NPs as existential quantifiers, modifying her earlier theory of unselective binding. Based on this, Heim argues that multiple proportional readings are derived from different sets of minimal situations that Q-adverbs quantify over. 198","According to Kratzer (1989), situations are parts of a world and primitive objects partially ordered by the part-of relation 's', where worlds are maximal elements with respect to s. Predicates have an extra argument ranging over situations, as shown by the example of (5). \\t (5) a.\\tman'(s, x) \\t b.\\tbeat'(s, x, y) (5a) says that x is a man in"]},{"title":"s,","paragraphs":["and (5b) says that x beats y in"]},{"title":"s.","paragraphs":["In the situation theory, Q-adverbs are considered as quantifiers over situations.

According to (6b), the Q-adverb"]},{"title":"usually","paragraphs":["is not an unselective binder any longer but constrained to bind only a situation variable. This establishes some relationship between the situations of a restrictive clause and those of a nuclear scope.","Given the notion of Q-adverbs as quantifiers over situations, multiple proportional readings of donkey sentences are explained as follows. First, (7b) is derived from (7a) by the rule of Quantifier Raising. (7) a. if a man owns a donkey, he is usually happy \\t b.\\tusuallys if [a"]},{"title":"mans, l","paragraphs":["[a donkeys, 2 [t ] ownss\\tAix] is happysl According to the quantificational reading of"]},{"title":"usually,","paragraphs":["(7b) is interpreted as in (7c).","(7) c. most (minimal) situations s in which there is a pair of man and donkey standing in an owning relation are extendible to a situation s' where the man who owns a donkey in s is happy. Second, multiple proportional readings of (7c) are derived from postulating different sets of minimal situations. (8) a.\\t{s: 3x3y[x is a farmer in s n y is a donkey in s n x owns y in s]} b. {s: 3x[x is a man in s n 3s'fs s s' n 3y[y is a donkey in s' n x owns y in s']]]l c. {s: 3y[y is a donkey in s n 3s'Es s s' n 3x[x is a man in s' A x owns y in all The symmetric reading of (7a) is derived from quantification over a set of situations as in (8a), where minimal situations include both a farmer and a donkey. On the other hand, (8b) feeds into a subject-asymmetric reading such that for most situations where there is a man x, and that are extendible to another situation where there is a donkey y owned by a man x, a man in s (i.e., x) is happy. Similarly, (8c) leads to an object-asymmetric reading, which quantifies over a set of situations s that include a donkey y and are extendible to another situation such that there is a man that owns a donkey y.","Heim's application of situations to donkey sentences gives a better account for the proportion problem than earlier theories. However, her analysis, first, cannot deal with the symmetric reading of a sentence that includes a symmetric predicate such as"]},{"title":"meet, share, etc. (e.g., if a man shares an apartment with another man, he shares the housework with him)","paragraphs":["Second, although Heim makes an observation that the proportional reading of a donkey sentence is determined by the topic structure, this observation is not incorporated in her analysis. She posits different sets of situations for multiple proportional readings, but the selection of a relevant set is made by the scopal relation of NPs rather than by the topic structure. 199 3.2 Chierchia (1992) Based on 'Dynamic Montague Grammar (DMG)' as developed by Groenendijk & Stokhof (1990), Chierchia (1992) argues that multiple proportional readings of a donkey sentence can be derived from the topic structure, proposing the 'existential disclosure' of a topic NP.","Groenendijk and Stokhof implement the idea of the classical Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) in the intensional logic to develop DMG. In DMG, an intension operator A abstracts over so-called 'states', which behave as the assignments of values to 'discourse markers'. Then, the primary meaning of a sentence is its context change potential, i.e., the ability to constrain its subsequent discourse. In other words, the dynamic meaning of a sentence is a set of propositions which can be conjoined with the given proposition.","To formalize this idea, DMG makes use of two operators t and I. A sentence that does not have a dynamic effect may be lifted to a dynamic sentence by means of the operator T. For example, t changes a sentence (1) of type t to a dynamic sentence t (1) of type «s,t>,t>, where s stands for a state. (9) t4) = APi4) A '1)] X.p[4) n -p] is a function that accepts all and only the propositions that are compatible with (1) 1 s truth. To get the static interpretation of a sentence, we only have to wipe out the place holder of the corresponding dynamic interpretation, which amounts to discourse closure.","To derive the interpretation of a conditional donkey sentence, Chierchia follows the assumption of many researchers such as Kratzer (1989), Diesing (1992), de Swart (1991), etc. that the semantics of Q-adverbs involves quantification over events or situations (at least in some cases). For instance, a sentence like"]},{"title":"when John is in the bathtub, he always sings","paragraphs":["involves quantification over events such that for every event of John's being in the bathtub, there is an event of his singing. Then, the static interpretation of the sentence will look like (10). (10) Ve[[in_the_bathtub'(j)(e)]\\t3elsing'(j)(e)]] To implement this in a dynamic setting, Chierchia assumes an existential disclosure operation in the spirit of Dekker (1993), which is the reverse of existential closure advocated in the classical DRT.

However, it is not well justified why Q-adverbs should bind topic NPs. Since Q-adverbs have either temporal or atemporal quantificational readings, Chierchia claims that Q-adverbs may bind either events or indefinite NPs. To deliver multiple proportional readings, only topic NPs are subject to existential disclosure and bound by Q-adverbs. Given that, it needs to be answered what kind of similarities hold between events and topic NPs to be bound together by Q-adverbs. If he does not want to claim that events are always the topics of sentences, the binding properties of Q-adverbs look very ad hoc. 4. The Proportion Problem under the Event-Dependency 4.1 The Semantics of Indefinite NPs and Q-adverbs To provide a proper account for the proportion problem, the semantics of indefinite NPs and Q-adverbs needs to be reconsidered. In this section, therefore, I discuss the interpretations of indefinite NPs and Q-adverbs. I will argue for the ambiguity of indefinite NPs between quantificational and cardinal readings, proposing that cardinal readings of indefinite NPs are 'event-dependent' individuals. I assume that Q-adverbs are quantifiers over events, binding only event variables.","Inspired by Milsark (1974), a number of researchers such as Enc (1991), Diesing (1992), Ladusaw (1994), and de Hoop (1995) defend the ambiguity of weak quantifiers between quantificational and cardinal readings, which may be phonologically distinguished by strong and weak forms.","(15) a.

As for the semantics of Q-adverbs, de Swart (1991), Chierchia (1995), Rothstein (1995), and Bayer (1995) all agree that Q-adverbs are quantifiers over events, mapping the events of a conditional clause to those of a matrix clause. Given that, the question is what kind of mapping relations Q-adverbs establish. Rothstein properly points out that these mapping relations cannot be arbitrary functions. Rather, they denote specific relations such as temporal relations, cause-effect relations, etc., which will be finally determined by the context. Hence, Rothstein argues that the semantics of Q-adverbs should involve some matching functions, the content of which will be determined by the context.","Adopting Rothstein's argument, I propose the semantics of a Q-adverb, e.g.,"]},{"title":"always, as","paragraphs":["follows.

Notice that the Q-adverb is defined as a selective binder of events, while Chierchia (1992) defines it as an unselective binder. 4.2 The Proportion Problem In this section, I will consider the proportion problem of donkey sentences under the revised notion of indefinite NPs and Q-adverbs.

In this proposal, the semantics of a donkey pronoun is exactly like that of a cardinal NP, except that a relevant property is contextually provided. (26) <\"it\", DNPE.Topi, X [E(e)(PA> Compared with the semantics of an indefinite NP in (19b), the semantics of a donkey pronoun in (26) is exactly the same except that a relevant property is supplied by the context here. This is in the same line as the E-type approach of Cooper (1979).","Given that, the truth-condition of (22a) is represented as in (27).","(27) [[if a farmerT owns a donkeyT, he usually beats it]] = moste[3x3y[farmee(x) A donkeyt'(y) n own'(e) n AG(e) = x n PT(e) = y t(e) =ten","o(e) = se] 3e[beat(e) n AG(e') ="]},{"title":"E(e","paragraphs":["t"]},{"title":")(Po)","paragraphs":["A PT(et) ="]},{"title":"E(et)(Pi)","paragraphs":["M(e) =\\tt(e') = te, A 0(e') = se]] 205 The sentence is interpreted in a way that for most owning events at te and se such that the agent is a farmer and the patient is a donkey, there is a beating event e' matched with e such that the agent is all the individuals having a property Po in e' and the patient is all the individuals having a property P 1 in e', at te' and se.. In the donkey sentence reading, Po and P1 are assigned the properties of 'farmer' and 'donkey', respectively, and tee and see are assigned the values of te and se, respectively, with respect to the event type of beating. This means that each event of the conditional clause is matched with another event of the matrix clause that includes the same participants. So (27) yields a reading that for most events involving a pair of farmer and donkey in the owning relation, there is an event of his beating his donkey. 5. Conclusion I have discussed multiple proportional readings of donkey sentences and their sensitivity to topic structure. Before suggesting my proposal, I have critically reviewed previous analyses of Heim (1990) and Chierchia (1992). To derive multiple proportional readings, Heim postulates different sets of minimal situations for different proportional readings, and Chierchia proposes that Q-adverbs quantify over topic NPs. Both of the analyses provide a way to obtain multiple proportional readings; however, they have no explanation for why proper readings are determined by topic structure.","Based on my earlier study that indefinite NPs in topic positions are generalized quantifiers, and those of non-topic positions are event-dependent individuals, I have shown that the interpretations of donkey sentences are the result of the interaction between the semantics of indefinite NPs and the syntactic representations of topic structure.","The advantages of the present proposal over the previous analyses, are, first, topic sensitivity of donkey sentences is naturally explained from the semantics of indefinite NPs, which is independently motivated. Second, this proposal not only accounts for multiple proportional readings, but also shows that donkey sentences with a stage-level predicate may have an additional reading, namely a symmetric reading in a collective version.

The status of the existential disclosure of topic NPs is not quite convincing in Chierchia's article. The proposal of Dekker (1993) is based on the semantic consideration of implicit arguments. However, Chierchia's proposal of disclosing topic NPs is a semantic operation driven by a syntactic consideration, and has much departed from the original insight of Dekker's existential disclosure. Thus his proposal seems to need more semantic justification. 4.
