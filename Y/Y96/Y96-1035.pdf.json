Introduction","paragraphs":["Procedures of semantic analysis may be one of the most complicated structures people have met with. Some conventional semantic theories presuppose the notion that natural language may be describable by a finite set of rules capable of generating an infinite set of sentences. The difficulty with this approach is that external features depends on being able to clearly determine for each relevant features whether or not an object processes it. Moreover, even those features which have been decided, such as 'heavy\", 'short' or 'blue', might still be fuzzy since there are no clear cut boundaries distinguishing heavy from very heavy, short from a little short or blue from purple.","A fundamental problem of lexical semantics is the fact that what Ruhl (1989) calls the perceived meaning of a word can vary so greatly from one context to another. Some disadvantages about computational (numerical) semantics are: (i) the danger of overstraining the empirical data to meet the requirement of numerical precision; (ii) the danger of overinterpreting the numerical results of a term. One possible way to diminish the required amount of precision is to use fuzzy statistics. However, Zadeh (1972) and (1983) have proposed certain alternative approaches where the linguistic aspects are mostly emphasized. Since then, many papers have also been published on this topic, for examples, see Joyce (1976), Rieger (1976) and Morgan and Pelletier (1977) Sanchez et al (1982) etc. For an extensive treatment of the theory of fuzzy sets with applied linguistics the interested reader may refer to see Dubois and Prade (1980) or Manton, Woodbury and Tolley (1994).","In this paper, we will apply the fuzzy statistical analysis and computational lexical semantic method to investigate some uncertain and ambiguous problems. Especially we will discuss the degree of object's typicality and similarity, which 337 Especially we will discuss the degree of object's typicality and similarity, which provide a more precise expression in human cognition. . It should be pointed out that the concept of fuzzy statistical analysis applied in this research does not refer to the general notation of constructing certain theories, but to propose some alternative methods in computational lexical semantics. We hope that such analytic technique will be more reliable and significant for the future research."]},{"title":"2. Measuring the lexical semantics","paragraphs":["In speaking of the semantic of a natural language, Langacker (1973, p.28) argued that we are referring not only to the fact that the words of the language have meanings but also to the way in which they divide the range of our conceptual experience into scaling. The arguments seem to demonstrate that such an analysis yields a notion of proposition which is insufficiently fine-grained to serve as the object of a human belief or a thought. Familiar considerations from lexical semantic theory cast doubt upon the conventional analysis of propositions as sets of possible words. Therefore, the fuzzy linguistic scaling used for measuring the meaning of terms measurement is necessary to be mathematically defined with membership function. 2.1 Fuzzy logic and lexical semantics","Let K be a class of generic elements called the kernel set.

The membership function corresponding to the object nouns could be constructed on the basis of the outer characteristics of factors, such as geometric patterns, topological properties or physical feature constrained in objects.","Because different kinds of morphemes have been found to be associated with different degrees of internal semantic sensitivity depending on whether the meaning of a morpheme is completely or partially rendered by the form of the morpheme, the component features have been arranged in the order of their fuzzy semantic value. Typically speaking, exactly one meaning to a sentence, its fuzzy 338 semantic value will equal to 1.","Such constructions require the intervention of human thought to provide the logics and Bayesian probability, hence we can hardly assume those complicated phenomenon as measurable, not even approximately reasoning.

Rosch's studies (1975) reported intersubjective agreements on typicality that were surprisingly high, in most cases a correlation greater than .9 A subsequent reconsideration of her statistical methods revealed that her measure of agreement was biased in that the larger populations automatically tended to produce a higher degree of agreement. The ability to perceive relations between ideas has long been taken to reflect human cognition. The most typical items in a category will be those that rank high in typicality on each features, where as the least typical will be those that rank low in typicality in each individual feature. Most of the known term relations are based on the three types: (i) semantic associations exhibit a degree of typicality. (ii) relations compared with one another. (iii) like other general terms (e.g. \"cable\"), association terms can be used to refer to a variety of different kind of situations and are instantiated or elaborated by their context.","On the other hand, semantic associations of an object have also long played an important role as explanatory constructs in psychological and computational linguistics. The use of association as theoretical primitives has obscured the fact that semantic associations are themselves concepts with interesting properties that are in need of explanation. The representation of objective association in cognition must be explained in terms of more basic meaning elements that are common to a variety of different concepts, c.f. Lyons (1977, p.317). 3.1 The internal structure of fuzzy subjective categories","There are many methods proposed in the literature of mathematical psychology or lexicon for scaling a subject's perception of an attribute, e.g. Nunnally (1978), Cruse (1986), Salton (1986), Dubois and Prade (1988), Hamers"]},{"title":"et al","paragraphs":["(1989), Ruge and Schwarz (1990) and others.

The following three schemes are proposed to measure the general term relations and associations."]},{"title":"(a) Typicality","paragraphs":["A category vary in the degree to which they are typical of the concept. For example, a trout is a very typical fish, a skipper is slightly typical, a whale is less typical, and a frog is not very fish-like at all. As Medin (1989) points out, this kind of grade structure has been found for every kind of category that has been studied: taxonomic categories, formal categories, goal-derived categories, ad hoc categories, and linguistic categories. If a typical pet is a dog, then the subject must have a representation of a dog in his/her mental warehouse. Typicality is measured by asking subjects from random samples to rate how good an example a concept is of category. Typical members of a category are those that are most similar to prototype of the category. For instance, the typical dog has four lags and tail, is about 1 foot long, and runs and barks around the house. Ruge and Schwarz (1990) have all these attributes and so are similar to the prototypical dog and are judged to high in typicality. Here, I define the typicality T for any object o as membership value of o T(o) — maximum membership value in the population","Decision rules of this kind were originally proposed to account for effects of typicality on the latency of category verification. Evidence for or against category membership was based on a comparison of attributes of the stimulus concept with those of the prototype for the category. Evidence is more consistently positive for high typicality than for low typicality category members and more consistently negative for dissimilar than for similar nonmembers."]},{"title":"(b) General Similarity","paragraphs":["Because people can easily make similarity judgments about relations, their judgments can be used to identify the elements that are used in comparing semantic relations. As noted before, concepts have generally been viewed as composed of more basic components. For example, it is easy to decide that a gorilla and a chimpanzee are more similar than a gorilla and a panda. Comparison requires the identification of ways in which the things compared are similar and different, e.g. shape, lags, fingers, taste etc...

Conclusion","paragraphs":["In the real world, the concepts involved in various domains of information or knowledge are much too complex and sophisticated to admit conventional logic as well as linguistic semantics. Using the fuzzy logic in analyzing the semantic system as well as measuring words sense have contributed not only to attain the identification of the situation stated above, but also exert a significant impact on the orientation of linguistic semantics. Although there are many different approaches given in the literature, each has its own advantages as well as its own drawbacks.","One of the problems in practical applications of fuzzy theory is how to obtain the membership functions and how to be sure that they do represent the meaning of the linguistic terms. In this paper, we described the fuzzy system analysis process in psycholinguistic cognition. The fuzzy propositional model for the semantic system can account for the degree of typicality and similarity. Which provide a more precise expression in human cognition. It is not difficult to imagine that there exists alternative models that do not directly involve either typicality, similarity and partial similarity membership information. The viability of such models will mostly depend on whether it is a satisfactory description of human perceptual primitives.","To this aim, some essential definitions for fuzzy statistics are proposed to implement these procedures. Empirical results of this research suggests that fuzzy modeling and statistics analysis are potentially powerful heuristics.","Finally, a neural network is a system of interconnected computational elements operated in parallel, arranged in patterns similar to biological neural nets and modeled after the human brain. Recently interest in this field has increased mainly because of the developments in many fields. We hope this direction of research would provide a useful tool in computing linguistics. In order to get an appropriate accuracy for human thought, we expect neural computing will be a worthwhile approach and may simulate more future empirical work in lexical semantics. 345 REFERENCE Cruse, D.
