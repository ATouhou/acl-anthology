This supports a reformulation of Principle Z, encompassing subject-oriented and non subject-oriented long-distance anaphora, which shows up as the fourth binding principle. The striking internal congruence of the resulting four principle based Binding Theory cogently makes it apparent that the binding symmetries are far more richer than the problematic single distributional symmetry between anaphors and pronouns that has been continuously assumed to hold by most of the research of the last three decades. We also discuss how the data involving the Portuguese long-distance anaphor add to the growing evidence that the generalization assumed in mainstream GB approaches about the universal correlation between \"simplex\" anaphors, long-distance anaphora, subject-orientedness and intermediate blocking effects is most likely not to be empirically grounded."]},{"title":"1. Principle Z revisited","paragraphs":["Long-distance anaphors have been a major focus of inquiry for mainstream three principle based theories of binding. Roughly, such items must get their interpretation from antecedents occurring either inside or outside the relevant local domain. This constraint is not accounted for by any of the three \"classic\" binding principles, set up mostly on the basis of empirical evidence from the English language - in HPSG terms: Principle A requires o-binding by an antecedent occurring in the same local domain; Principle B has to do with o-freeness; and Principle C concerns expressions with non-dependent interpretation.","Current analyses tackling this issue have proposed extra binding principles for coping with languages exhibiting this kind of unbounded obligatory o-binding phenomena. This is the case of Xue, Pollard and Sag's 1994 proposal concerning the Chinese expression ziji: (1)","\\t Zhangsani zhidao [Lisij renwei [Wangwuk zui xihuan zijii 6/0. Zhangsan know Lisi think Wangwu most like self 'Zhangsani knows [that Lisij thinks [thatWangwuk likes himj,j/himselfk most]]'. 21 That proposal takes up a slightly revised version of Principle Z previously put forward by (Pollard and Sag 1992a). This principle states that \"z-pronouns must be o-bound\", where z-pronouns are expressions not identified in terms of the NP typology usually assumed."]},{"title":"1 . 1 Weakness","paragraphs":["However, Principle Z is too weak, as pointed out by the authors. Under this principle, ungrammatical constructions like (2), where the antecedent is not a subject, are incorrectly predicted as grammatical.","(2) *Zhangsan cong Lisii chu tingshuo Wangwu bu xihuan zijii. Zhangsan from Lisi place hear Wangwu not like self 'Zhangsan heard from Lisi i Wangwu does not like himi.'","In order to circumvent this undesired effect, as a \"provisional solution\", Xue, Pollard and Sag added a specific restriction which stipulates that \"antecedents of z-pronouns should be subjects\"."]},{"title":"1 . 2 Restrictiveness","paragraphs":["This solution, though provisional, may be acceptable as long as one just takes into account evidence concerning subject-oriented long-distance anaphors, widely documented in the literature (for a synopsis vd. (Koster and Reuland 1991b):10). It will induce however incorrect predictions, if there exist languages with non subject-oriented long-distance anaphora. Portuguese is a Romance language which presents such kind of phenomenon.","In Portuguese, si prOprio ('he-DAT own') is the third person short-distance anaphor and ele ('he-NOM') is the third person pronoun. Their behavior as dependent reference expressions follows closely the behavior of English himself and he, respectively. As the data (3)-(7) illustrate, on a par with these two expressions, Portuguese has also the long-distance anaphor ele prOprio ('he-NOM own')1.","The contrast in (3) illustrates that, like short-distance anaphors, ele prOprio is a dependent reference expression which requires an antecedent (with identical features of person, number and gender).","(3) a.\\t*A Diana gosta dele prOprio. the-FEM Diana likes of he own 'Diana likes himself.'","b.\\t0 Carlosi gosta dele prOprioi. the-MASC Carlos likes of he own 'Carlos likes himself.' Contrast (3)b./(4)b., in turn, shows that ele prOprio must be o-bound; while (4)a./b. illustrates again the parallelism between the short-distance anaphor and ele prOprio, and (4)b./c. the difference between ele prOprio and the pronoun with respect to the requirement of o-binding by the antecedent.","(4) a.\\t*[As pessoas que falaram com a Dianai gostam de si prOpriai. the people that talked with the Diana like of she-DAT own '[People who talked with Dianai ] like herselfi.'","b.\\t*[As pessoas que falaram com a Dianai gostam dela prOpriai. the people that talked with the Diana like of she-NOM own '[People who talked with Dianai ] like herselfi.' 22","b.\\t[As pessoas que falaram com a Diana, gostam dela,. the people that talked with the Diana like of she-NOM '[People who talked with Diana, ] like hers.' The examples of (5) are designed to illustrate the long-distance properties of ele prOprio.","(5)\\ta.\\t0 Pedro, convenceu a Diana de [que o Carlos] gosta dele prOpriosii]. the Pedro convinced the Diana of that the Carlos like of he own 'Pedros convinced Diana [that Carlosj likes hims/himselfj].'","b.\\t0 Joao, disse-me [que to convenceste a Diana de [que o Carlosj gosta dele prOprioo]]. the Joao told me that you convinced the Diana of that the Carlos like of he own 'Joao, told me [that you convinced Diana [that Carlosj likes hims/himselfi]].' And the contrast of (6) is meant to reinforce the evidence for the long-distance anaphoric behavior of ele prOprio, as it shows that, also when coindexed with an antecedent outside its local domain, ele prOprio requires to be o-bound, contrarily to what happens with regards to pronouns2:","(6)\\ta.\\t*[0 apartamento que o Carlos ofereceu a Diana, mostra que ele pensa nela prOprias the apartment that the Carlos offered to_the Diana shows that he thinks in_she own '[The apartment that Carlos offered to Dianas] shows that he cares about herself,.'","b.\\t[0 apartamento que o Carlos ofereceu a Diana, mostra que ele pensa nela, the apartment that the Carlos offered to_the Diana shows that he thinks in_she '[The apartment that Carlos offered to Diana,] shows that he cares about her,.'","Having provided empirical evidence which shows that ele prOprio is a long-distance anaphora, we turn now to its distinctive feature of not being subject-oriented. Examples in (7) illustrate that this expression may have antecedents which are not subjects: (7)","\\t","a. 0 Pedro descreveu a Maria, a ela prOprias. the Pedro described the Maria to she own 'Pedro described Maria to herself.'","b. 0 Pedro convenceu a Diana, de que o Carlos gosta dela prOprias. the Pedro convinced the Diana of that the Carlos like of she own 'Pedro convinced Diana, that Carlos likes hers.'","c. 0 Pedro disse a Diana, que o Carlos gosta dela prOprias. the Pedro said to_the Diana that the Carlos like of she own 'Pedro said to Diana, that Carlos likes hers.'","Notice further that, irrespective of the provisional extra stipulation proposed by Xue et al. concerning subject-orientedness, Principle Z still expresses too strong a constraint. It excludes grammatical constructions like the following, with exempt long-distance anaphors:","(8)\\ta.\\tA Diana, disse que o jornalista [que ela prOprias convidou] pagou a conta. the Diana said that the journalist she own invited paid the bill 'Diana, said that the journalist [shed invited] paid the bill.' 23","b. 0 jornalista [que viu a Dianai] disse que ela prOpriai pagou a conta. the journalist who saw the Diana said that she own paid the bill 'The journalist [who saw Dianai ] said that shei paid the bill.'","c. [Se o Carlosi gostasse da Diana], ele prOprioi lho diria. if the Carlos like of the Diana, he own CLIT:to_her_it tell '[If Carlosi liked Diana], hei would tell it to her.'","d. Ele prdprio pagou a conta. he own paid the bill 'He paid the bill.' In the above examples the z-pronoun is not o-bound: in (8)a. the antecedent does not locally o-command it; in (8)b. and c. the antecedent does not o-command it at all; and in (8)d. ele prOprio has no antecedent, in which case it seems to be able to support a deictic use. Still these examples are fully acceptable. Principle Z, with or without the stipulation about subject-orientedeness, predicts all of them to be ungrammatical."]},{"title":"2 Principle Z revised 2.1 A new definition","paragraphs":["Given the data presented above, what is thus called for is an empirically adequate account of unbounded obligatory o-binding (both subject-oriented and non subject-oriented).","As to the excessive restrictiveness of Principle Z just pointed out, we propose to eliminate this shortcoming in two steps.","First, we remove the stipulation that long distance anaphors must be subject-oriented. Constructions like those of (7), where z-pronouns have antecedents which are not subjects, are not incorrectly ruled out as ungrammatical.","Second, we give the following formulation to the principle ruling long-distance anaphora:","(9)\\tPrinciple Z A locally o-commanded z-pronoun must be o-bound.","Examples (8) are now correctly predicted to be grammatical as, in any of them, the z-pronoun is not locally o-commanded and, at the light of (9), it does not have to be o-bound4.","It is worth noting that definition (9) not only eliminates previous excessive restrictiveness of Principle Z, as it also accommodates facts which provide new and independent motivation for the notion of exempt anaphor, as put forward by (Pollard and Sag 1992b) on the basis of short distance anaphora."]},{"title":"2.2 Chinese long","paragraphs":["-"]},{"title":"distance exempt anaphors","paragraphs":["That the formulation of Principle Z proposed in (9) does not apply only to Portuguese and it is likely to have a general character can be highlighted, if we reappreciate the data about Chinese available in the literature. Consider contrast (10), taken from (Xue et al. 1994):(11),(21). 24","(10) a.\\t[Zhangsani de xin] biaoming Lisij hai-le Zhangsan DE letter indicate Lisi harm-ASP self TZhangsan'si letter] indicates that Lisij harmed *himi/himselfi.'","b.\\t[Zhangsani de hua] anshi [Lisij de xin] zai yingshe ziji?i/j.

The impossibility of ziji being bound by Zhangsan in (10)a., but not in (10)b., is said to be, on a par with \"...the unlike-person blocking,...a pragmatic or discourse processing effect of animate blocking\".","We propose a different tentative explanation. We take the contrast of (10) as possible evidence showing that also in Chinese the requirement of o-binding only holds in case the z-pronoun is locally o-commanded. The point here is to understand that, just like ziji is [+animate] and requires a [+animate] antecedent, also its local o-commanders must be [+animate] in order to qualify as o-commander for the application of Principle Z. Therefore, at the light of Principle Z as stated in (9), in (10)a. the coindexing Zhangsan/ziji is ruled out because, as ziji is locally o-commanded by Lisi, the long-distance anaphor is required to be o-bound, constraint which is not satisfied. In (10)b., in turn, the coindexing with Zhangsan would be acceptable due to the fact that ziji is not locally o-commanded (by an [+animate] o-commander), which allows it to pick antecedents which do not o-command it.","An important consequence of this tentative solution seems to be that we can dispense with Xue et al.'s assumption that, on par with \"syntactic ziji\", ruled by Principle Z, there is a \"discourse ziji\", whose apparent distinctive feature would be its ability to allow subcommanding antecedents.","It will be interesting to check the adequacy of our hypothesis against further empirical evidence designed by linguists speaking Chinese and other languages, like Korean and Japanese, which have subject-oriented long-distance anaphors5. (Xue et al. 1994):(26) seems, though, to provide yet a further piece of evidence which supports our analysis. They present an example due to (Wang 1990) where ziji needs not to have an (o-commanding or subcommanding) antecedent: Mama de shu ye bei ziji de pengyou touzoule. mother DE book also BEI self DE friend steal-ASP 'Mother'si book was also stolen by hisk friend.' In (11) vji is not o-commanded (by a local [+animate] o-commander) and, apparently, like ele prOprio in (8)d., it seems to be able to support a deictic use in the absence of overtly available antecedents in the sentence."]},{"title":"2.3 Dissociating long-distance and subject-orientedness \\t","paragraphs":["Turning now to the weakness of Xue et al.'s Principle Z pointed out above in section 1.1, notice that the reformulation we propose does not provide a direct solution to this problem. (9) does not rule out constructions like (2), where subject-oriented z-pronouns, like ziji, are o-bound by antecedents which are not subjects.","We retain, nevertheless, Principle Z as stated in (9), and notice that the ill-formedness of such constructions can be explained on the basis of an independent principled account, without resorting to any specific, provisional or not, stipulation in order to assure subject-orientedness.","We adopt the proposal that the obliqueness hierarchy relevant to Binding Theory may have a non-linear ordering, independently motivated in (Branco 1996). This solution builds on (Manning and Sag 1995) proposal for dissociating argument structure (coded in the new ARG-S 25 feature) and grammatical relations (coded in the previous SUBCAT feature), and for checking binding principles in the former and subcategorization principles in the latter.","Following (Branco 1996), obliqueness hierarchies may be given a non-linear ordering where subjects are the only o-commanders of any other argument, both in single and multiclausal constructions: (12) • • • argln Accordingly, in languages with subject-orientedness, hence with non-linear obliqueness hierarchy in the ARG-S value plausibly by virtue of parametric choice, Principle Z as stated in (9) makes the correct predictions as only subjects can be the o-binders of any other argument."]},{"title":"2.4 A \"new\" integrated Theory of Binding","paragraphs":["We believe the merits of Principle Z we propose in (9) should be assessed not only in terms of its empirical adequacy but also in terms of its impact in the whole set up of Binding Theory.","Under our proposal, Principle Z naturally appears not as a mere extra binding constraint, but as the fourth principle of Binding Theory, on an equal footing with the three \"classic\" Principles A, B and C, given the striking \"natural\" cross symmetry between the four principles.","(13)\\tPrinc. A: A locally o-commanded anaphor must be locally o-bound Princ. Z: A locally o-commanded z-pronoun must be o-bound Princ. B: A personal pronoun must be locally o-free Princ. C: A nonpronoun must be o-free Both anaphoric and non anaphoric expressions have now two binding principles ruling them, and the different senses in which the opposition local vs. non local should be taken seems to receive a more fine-tuned clarification: Principle Z shows up as the non local \"variant\" of Principle A, in the same sense that Principle C could have been taken as the non local \"variant\" of Principle B; but also Principle B may be taken as the non local \"variant\" of Principle A in the same sense that Principle C may be taken as the non local \"variant\" of Principle Z.","Consequently, by enlarging our sample of data to encompass both subject-oriented and non subject-oriented long-distance anaphors, it is a more empirically adequate analysis we obtain. But notably, it is a more integrated Binding Theory that one is led to, as well, we would like to incisively stress. And it is not unlikely that the overarching cross symmetry 26 between the four principles, now evident, reveals that the longstanding insistence of generative researchers on the assumed, but ever since problematic, single distributional symmetry between anaphors and pronouns has persistently channeled the bulk of the last three decades of research on binding into a deadlocked track."]},{"title":"3. About empirically ungrounded correlations","paragraphs":["This insistence in taking the supposed distributional symmetry between (short-distance) anaphors and pronouns as the empirical touchstone which the Binding Theory should mostly account for has had its impact, both theoretically and methodologically, on the mainstream GB attempts to deal with long-distance anaphora. In accordance to the unique central role assigned to this distributional symmetry, the phenomena of long-distance anaphora has been taken in GB as being but a successive-cyclic association of short-distance links6. This way, the insistence in maintaining the focus of explanatory machinery on that supposed symmetry has had the side effect of delimiting a specific set of supposed empirical correlations which, in turn, are becoming the canonical empirical touchstone for the GB research on long-distance anaphora.","However different the several alternative GB proposals may be in their little details7, all they seem to share the common stance that the central facts to be accounted for in studying long-distance anaphora gravitate around the correlation between so called \"simplex\" anaphors, long-distance binding, subject-orientedness and binding blocking by intervening subjects. The methodological consensus around these correlations certainly owe much to the GB explanatory devices they are able support, which are in consonance with the conviction about the supposed primitive local nature of anaphora (and the supposed fundamental complementarity with regards the non-local nature of pronouns). In their essential aspects, the different accounts run like this: the \"simplex\" anaphors have some kind of deficit of inflectional morphology which must be supplemented by some kind of local link (e.g., movement, coindexing, binding, etc.) to the inflection of the local subject - this explains the subject-orientedness; links of the same sort between the subjects of the different clauses successively subordinated in the sentence may be connected - this explains the long-distance; the connection of the links is interrupted when there is a upwards subject which does not support the relevant kind of link - this explains the blocking of long-distance binding by intervening subjects.","Xue et al. have extensively discussed data from the Chinese language which strongly weaken the plausibility of such correlations, and they called the attention for the fact that the claimed universal character of these correlations is not likely to be empirically grounded.","First, they have shown that there is no correlation between subject-orientedness and long-distance anaphoric binding. Chinese to-ztji is not a long-distance anaphor though it is subject-oriented (cf. (Xue et al. 1994):(6)): (14)\\tZhangsani songgei Lisij yizhang ta-ziji t"]},{"title":"y*i.","paragraphs":["de xiangpian. Zhangsan give Lisi one-CLA he-self DE picture 'Zhangsani gave Lisij a picture of himselfii*j.' Portuguese data strengthen this dissociation: ele prOprio, in turn, is a long-distance anaphor and it is not subject-oriented (see (7) above). Accordingly, our option of separating the explanatory devices for long-distance anaphoric binding (cf. Principle Z in (9)) and for subject orientedness (cf. (Branco 1996)) seems thus to receive full empirical justification.","Second, (Xue et al. 1994):n.2 also refer data provided by (Progovac 1992) concerning the Russian anaphor sebja as supporting the dissociation between \"simplex\" anaphors and long-distance properties: sebja is a \"simplex\" anaphor, though it only allows short-distance binding. Once more, Portuguese data strengthen this other dissociation. Ele prOprio by no means can be 27 considered a \"simplex\" anaphor: it is made up of two expressions ele ('he') and prOprio ('own'), and bears a full fledged inflectional morphology which displays features of person, gender and number. Nevertheless, it allows long-distance binding.","Third, Xue et al. have shown that there is no correlation between, on the one hand, \"simplex\" anaphors, subject-orientedness and long-distance, and on the other hand, binding blocking by intervening subjects. Example (15), taken from (Xue et al. 1994):(15), shows that also non subject may block the binding of ziji by an upwards subject:","(15)\\tZhangsani gaosu woj Lisik hen ziji*oci/k. Zhangsan tell me Lisi hate self 'Zhangsani told mej Lisik hates *himil*mei/himselfk.' Also in this case, the data from Portuguese reinforce the noticed dissociation: ele prOprio is a long-distance anaphor but its binding by an antecedent is not ruled by any such kind of constraint concerning intervening antecedents with unlike inflectional features. This seems to suggest that, like what happens for the dissociation between binding principles and subject-orientedness, the binding blocking effects should most likely to be taken as extraneous to the core of Binding Theory and accounted for by other possibly independent explanatory device."]},{"title":"4. Conclusions","paragraphs":["Data were presented which reinforce the claim that, as to long-distance anaphora, there is no correlation at least between the morphological simplicity of the anaphors and their long-distance properties, between long-distance properties and subject-orientedness, and between subject orientedness and binding blocking effects.","An integrated approach to both subject-oriented and non-subjected oriented long-distance anaphora was developed by means of the reformulation of Principle Z in articulation with the proposal of (Branco 1996) concerning non-linear obliqueness. This solution led to a significant reshuffling of our understanding of the internal congruence of Binding Theory, in general, and to a more fine-tuned characterization of the distinction local vs. non local for dependent reference expressions, in particular."]},{"title":"Endnotes","paragraphs":["1\\tIn Portuguese, a language without a system of overt morphological case, only clitics and pronouns present fossilized case distinctions. 2\\tIt is worth noting that it is possible to construct contrasts where this constraint seems to be relaxed:","(i)\\ta.\\t*[O apartamento que o Carlos ofereceu a Dianai] mostra que ele pensa nela prOpriai. the apartment that the Carlos offered to_the Diana shows that he thinks in_she own '[The appartment that Carlos offered to Dianai] shows that he cares about herselfi.' 28","b.\\t[A recente dedicacäo da Dianai ao seu trabaiho] mostra que o Director acabou por falar com ela prOpriai depois de a ter advertido atraves do Chefe de Seccdo. the recent dedication of the Diana to_the her job shows that the Director ended_up by talking with she own after of CLIT.PRON have warned by means of the Chief of Section '[The recent dedication of Dianai to her job] reveals that the Director ended up by talking to here, after having asked her Chief to warn her on his behalf.' At present we are working on the hypothesis that contrasts like this may have to do with the other non anaphoric meaning of prey/Ho ('own') and the conventional implicature associated to it. See also note 5. 3 Data collected in (3)-(6) present standard tests for checking the anaphoric nature of long-distance dependent reference expressions. As far as Portuguese is concerned, there is another test that can be done. As this language has direct object clitic doubling, one should check which kind of clitic, anaphoric or pronominal, the phrase containing ele prOprio can double in short-distance anaphoric links.","(i)\\ta.\\t0 Pedroi viu-se a si prOprioi no espelho. the Pedro saw-CLIT.ANAF to he-DAT own in_the mirror 'Pedroe saw himselfe in the mirror.'","b. 0 Pedroi viu-se a ele prOprioi no espelho. the Pedro saw-CLIT.ANAF to he-NOM own in_the mirror 'Pedroi saw himselfe in the mirror.'","c. *[A mde do Pedroi] viu-se a ele prOprioi no espelho. the mother of the Pedro saw-CLIT.ANAF to he-NOM own in_the mirror Pedro'si mother] saw himselfi in the mirror.'","(ii)\\ta.\\t[0 pai da Dianai] viu-a a elai no espelho. the father of the Diana saw-CLIT.PRON to she in_the mirror IDiana'si father] saw here in the mirror.'","b.\\t[0 pai da Dianai] viu-a a ela prOpriai no espelho. the father of the Diana saw-CLIT.PRON to she own in_the mirror IDiana'si father] saw here in the mirror.' The data show that ele prOprio can double both kind of clitics. Interestingly, it is apparent that ele prOprio assumes an anaphoric behavior, if it doubles anaphoric clitics (cf. contrast (i)a./b.), and that it assumes a pronominal behavior, if it doubles pronominal clitics (cf. (ii)b.).","Nevertheless, even when doubling pronominal clitics, if locally o-commanded, ele prOprio seems to keep its inability to support deictic reference:","(iii) a.\\t0 Pedro viu-a a ela no espelho. the Pedro saw-CLIT.PRON to she in_the mirror 'Pedro saw her in the mirror.'","b.\\t*0 Pedro viu-a a ela prOpria no espelho. the Pedro saw-CLIT.PRON to she own in_the mirror 'Pedro saw herself in the mirror.' 29 4 Notice that o-command is not enough to impose the requirement of o-binding. In (8)a. and b., ele prOprio is not locally o-commanded but it is o-commanded (non locally) by the matrix clause subject. Nevertheless, the z-pronoun accepts antecedents which do not o-bind it. 5 Among other contrastive analyses, it will be interesting to check whether in Chinese there is also some kind of gradual degradation of o-commanding requirements like the one that seems to occur in Portuguese - see note 2 above. 6\\tSee Reinhart and Reuland (1993), Progovac (1992, 1993), Huang and Tang (1991), the papers collected in Koster and Reuland (1991a), and the references cited therein. 7 Some examples: for Reinhart and Reuland (1993) the anaphor undergoes head movement to local I at LF; for Progovac (1992, 1993) the movement is replaced by coindexation with the local Agr; for Huang and Tang (1991) there is no head movement but adjunction to the local IP."]},{"title":"Acknowledgment","paragraphs":["The research reported in this paper was supported in part by PRAXIS XXI Program of the Portuguese Ministry of Science."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Branco, Antonio. 1996.
