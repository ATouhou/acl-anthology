The first one was held in Hong Kong last year, and all of us witnessed its success, with high academic standards in warm and friendly interactions. It still retained our traditional \"family-like\" atmosphere then, despite the fact that PACLIC 10 introduced the process of referee reviewing for the first time in our conference history. Now PACLIC 11 is not a small-size scholarly gathering any more; more than ninety abstracts were submitted to the Program Committee of PACLIC 11 from all over the world. If we had insisted on preserving the small-size tradition as we did in PACLIC 10 in Hong Kong last year, we should have been forced to turn down two thirds of the abstracts. Rather, the Program Committee opted for a little larger conference and decided to accept fifty-seven abstracts. We seem to be in a position where we cannot claim that Small Is Beautiful any longer. It has turned out that papers dealing with theoretical and computational linguistics are evenly distributed. The topics of the papers comprise nearly all fields of linguistic studies ranging from phonology through syntax and semantics to computational lexicography and machine translation. It is still true that the majority of participants come from Pacific Asia regions: 13 from Japan, 11 from areas where the Chinese language is spoken, and 20 from Korea, but our horizon is surely being extended. Eleven paper presenters come from non-Pacific Asian areas including North and Central America, Germany, France, Netherlands, Portugal, and Denmark. The 21st century is just around the corner. It is predicted that more and more interactions not only among different fields of language studies, but among various human sciences will be sought after, as it is felt that the tendency of specialization and compartmentalization has gone too far during the 20th century. This leads us to realize that the value of harmony, which our PACLIC has pursued as a scholarly goal, will be more and more meaningful. I hope that the forum for both theoretical and computational linguistics which our Pacific Asia Conference has tried to develop will promote harmonious links between East and West and between New and Old, as well as between theory and practice. In this connection, the Chomskyan chauvinism, which is still persisting to some extent even today, will eventually become a by-gone fashion among linguists, giving way to healthier and more diversified interactions among various theoretical traditions. PACLIC intends to contribute to such a change. We expect that our keynote speaker Professor Carl Pollard will deal with this issue in his discussion of \"Recent Developments of Constraint-Based Grammar,\" indicating new directions of linguistic studies in the 21st century. I take this opportunity to thank Kyung Hee University for its financial and logistic assistance, which has made it possible to organize and carry out this international conference at the Language Education and Research Institute of Kyung Hee University. VII We also thank Language and Information Society of Korea for its philosophical support for this conference. Above all, this conference is in large part the product of the efforts of the Program Committee members who participated in painstaking reviewing processes of the submitted abstracts. I thank all of them for their sacrifice and contribution, especially the Program Committee's cochairmen, Professors Akira Ikeya, Benjamin K. T'sou and Chu-Ren Huang. My heart-felt gratitude goes to our colleagues coming from far and near to present their papers. If PACLIC 11 is anything successful, it owes them. I hope that all the participants will experience a rewarding and fruitful time while staying in Seoul for PACLIC 11. Byung-Soo Park Conference Chair VIII"]}]}
