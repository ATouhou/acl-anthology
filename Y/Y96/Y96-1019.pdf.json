We use the clue that many idioms with the noun n are extracted through that method. We have experimented with a corpus which consists of 5 years' worth of articles from a Japanese economic newspaper. As a result, we found 177 types of lacking meanings.

Needless to say, it is important to expand and refine Bunrui-goi-hyou for the sake of Japanese natural language processing. This paper presents the method to automatically find meanings which must be entered in Bunrui-goi-hyou but not be entered. By this method, we can efficiently fill the deficiency of meanings in Bunrui-goi-hyou.","We should notice that our method automatically executes the following:","(1) to estimate that a certain noun n has the meaning g which is not entered as a meaning of this noun n in Bunrui-goi-hyou, (2) to show some nouns which have the similar meaning to the meaning however, our method does not trace what the meaning g is. This meaning is manually decided by observing nouns shown in (2).","For example, the Japanese noun \"J*\" has meanings \"voice\" and \"opinion \", but \"r. \" in Bunrui-goi-hyou has only \"voice\" and does not have \"opinion 177 //. Our method points out that \"r4 \" in Bunrui-goi-hyou has a deficiency of a meaning, and shows some nouns such as"]},{"title":"\"SR","paragraphs":["(opinion)\""]},{"title":",\"NS","paragraphs":["(view)\" ,\"1","(insistence)\" etc. which have the similar meaning to \"opinion\". By observing these nouns, we can manually decide that the lacking meaning of \"P\" is \"opinion\".","The traditional research to acquire the unknown meaning was done by (Wilensky 1990). In his research, if a sense of a word is unknown, the sense is estimated from similar uses of other words to the use of the word. This approach, which estimates a feature of an unknown word from features of similar words, is taken to cope with the data sparseness problem of a corpus (Dagan 1993). In short, this approach is base on the idea that the unseen part can be estimated from seen similar parts. However, the simple use of this idea alone cannot find an unknown meaning of a word, because even similar words hardly have same polysemy to the word. For example, nouns such as \"%\\t(laughter)\" ,\"'\\t(cheer)\", \"E PA (scream)\", \" 7..12 son g)\" etc. are similar to the noun \"P\", but these nouns don't have the( meaning \"opinion\".","To estimate a lacking meaning, this paper applies the method presented by (Shinnou 1995), which extracts idioms from a corpus. In his research, first, the set of nouns which are co-occurred with a verb v is constructed from a corpus. Second, similar nouns to each other are removed from the above set. In this step, the similarity is measured by Bunrui-goi-hyou. Last, idioms are constructed from left nouns in the set and the verb v.","Suppose a noun n have multiple meanings and a meaning in them is not entered as a meaning of the noun n in Bunrui-goi-hyou. In above second step, the noun n tend to be left in the set. That is, we can estimate the noun n with the meaning lacking in Bunrui-goi-hyou by the clue that many idioms with the noun n are extracted through the above steps. Next our method extracts nouns which have a similar meaning to the lacking meaning of the noun n by mutual information. These nouns can be associated with the lacking meaning.","Our method can find not only a deficiency of a meaning but also meanings which are not used or are specifically used in the corpus domain.","We have experimented by the corpus which consists of Japanese economic newspaper 5 years articles with about 7.85 M sentences. We report the result of this experiment."]},{"title":"2 Estimation of nouns with the lacking meaning","paragraphs":["Shinnou (Shinnou 1995) proposed the method to extract predicative idioms from a corpus by the lexical peculiarity for the noun in an idiom.

The corpus has about 7.85 M sentences, and the average number of characters in one sentence was about 49.","From the corpus, we gathered about 4.41 M bits of cooccurrence data (about 1.48 M types) whose postpositional particle was \"wo\" . From them, we removed the cooccurrence data whose frequency was 1, or whose verb does not appear more than 20 times. In all, we obtained about 3.27 M bits of cooccurrence data, which consisted of about 0.24 M types. Next, we extracted 46,930 types of expressions as idioms from cooccurrence data by the lexical peculiarity for the noun in an idiom, and removed real idioms from these expressions by using the idiom dictionary (Inoue 1994). Next, we classified left expressions by their nouns, and picked out 2,142 types of nouns whose frequency was more than 4. These 2,142 types of nouns were candidates of nouns with lacking meanings.","Next, we made tin and Rn for each candidate noun n. By comparing Un and Rn , 1,110 types of nouns were estimated to have a lacking meaning, and U„ for these nouns were shown. These shown Un are evaluated by Kouji-en (Shinmura edition 1993) which is Japanese standard dictionary. Suppose the shown Un is associated in our mind with a meaning g. If the meaning g is not entered as a meaning of the noun n in Bunrui-goi-hyou, but is entered in Kouji-en, then we evaluate that the Un is effective. For example, there was the noun \"A\\t(ski)\" in 1,110 types of extracted nouns, and\\tis as following.","UA$_ = f lterF (sock), AR (rubber boot), *ft (shoe), AIM (sport shoe),\\t(ancient Japanese straw sandals)} By observing nouns in U -, we can estimate that the noun has the meaning \"ski\". And Kouji-en shows two meanings for the noun \"A 4--\" as following.","1. one of a pair of long narrow strip of wood etc. fixed under the feet for traveling over snow 2. sport on snow with ski First meaning shows that the noun \"A\\thas the meaning \"ski\" in practice. However, the noun \"X in Bunrui-goi-hyou has only the above second meaning. That is, we can decide the lacking meaning of the noun \"A +—\" is \"ski\". Thus, the U 4.-- is evaluated to be effective. 182","This evaluation found 177 types of effective Un . The appendix table shows a part of lacking meanings found by our method. For information, the appendix table shows the meaning entered in Bunrui-goi-hyou besides the found lacking meaning."]},{"title":"5 Remarks","paragraphs":["It is difficult to extract all knowledge from only a corpus because of incomplete analysis and data sparseness. And it is nonsense to create new one from scratch. It can be preferable to adjust or expand an existing one to meet an application's needs.","Such efforts have been done by many researchers. Hearst decomposed the Word Net into a set of categories, and adjusted and expanded the set by the Word Space created from corpora in order to better serve a text labeling task (Hearst 1996). Kaneda pointed out that we cannot gather enough examples, which is used to automatically acquire rules to select a verbal meaning, from only a corpus, and tried to adjust the handmade rules by the corpus (Kaneda 1995). Shinnou pointed out that the general thesaurus cannot be constructed from only a corpus, and used the existing thesaurus to cover the sparseness of the corpus (Shinou 1996). Our method is a kind of these approaches.","However, only addition of the lacking knowledge to existing one is not so useful. It is preferable to find the specific knowledge in the needed task, and to modify to suit the used corpus domain. Our method can not only find lacking meanings but also modify existing meanings.","Our method extracts nouns which have the similar meaning to the meaning entered in Bunrui-goi-hyou. But there are some nouns which don't have these similar nouns. Meanings entered in Bunrui-goi-hyou for these nouns are estimated not to be used in the corpus domain. Thus, we can lower the priority of these meanings. The noun \"a* (stock)\" is the such example. The meaning of \"tE)*\" in Bunrui-goi-hyou is \"something exist in a warehouse\". In the corpus, this meaning is not used and only the meaning \"merchandise kept in a warehouse\", which is not entered in Bunrui-goihyou, is used.","Further, our method can find also the incorrect meaning in Bunrui-goihyou, when deciding the lacking meaning. For example, UNE is shown as following. Una\\t{ f_tE (to stop), Nia (to leave),"]},{"title":"MP","paragraphs":["(to cancel (to break up), MR (sanctions)} 183 We can estimate that \"NIN (to leave)\" has the meaning \"to leave a party etc.\", but can notice strangeness that \" JR\" is not similar to \"NA\" in UNE . This is because the position of the noun \"Mr on the thesaurus in Bunrui-goi-hyou is wrong.","Moreover, when deciding the lacking meaning, we can find also meanings which are not entered in Kouji-en. This is because these meanings are conventionally used in the used corpus domain. For example, the for the noun \"\\tV) (top)\" is as following. U\\t= { 1-±A (president), MO (prime minister),"]},{"title":"id no","paragraphs":["(President), OM (leading member), itA (representative)} The meaning of the noun \" 79\" is obviously \"person with the highest rank or degree\", but this meaning is not entered in Bunrui-goi-hyou and Kouji-en. That is, the meaning is specifically or conventionally used in the used corpus. As other examples, there are the meaning \"gang\" for the noun"]},{"title":"\"a","paragraphs":["(class)\", and the meaning \"character\" for the noun \"P6. (type)\".","The problem of our method is that many mistake estimations make the decision of the lacking meaning hard work. To overcome this problem, in this paper we use similarities to the meaning entered in Bunrui-goi-hyou to reduce mistake estimations. In the future, we will try other ways.","The scale of the used corpus is another problem. The large corpus is favorable for our method. However, the usable corpus is generally small. Therefore, in the future, we must consider how to effectively apply our method to a small corpus. 6 Conclusions In this paper, -we proposed the method to find a deficiency of a meaning in Bunrui-goi-hyou by a corpus. The proposed method first extracts idioms from the corpus by the lexical peculiarity for the noun in an idiom. By incorrect extractions, the noun with a lacking meaning is estimated. Next, nouns which have the similar meaning to the lacking meaning are shown. By observing these nouns, the lacking meaning is manually decided. We experimented by the corpus which consists of Japanese economic newspaper 5 years articles. As the result, we could find 177 types of lacking meanings.","This method is a kind of approaches to expand and modify the existing knowledge by using a corpus. The acquisition of knowledge from a corpus is an important research, but the completely automatic method is not practice. The approach to expand and modify the existing knowledge by a corpus is practical and effective. A problem of the proposed method is many mistaken estimations. The solution is our future work. 184"]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["The corpus used in our experiment was extracted from CD-ROMs '90—'94 sold by the Nihon Keizai Shinbun Company.
