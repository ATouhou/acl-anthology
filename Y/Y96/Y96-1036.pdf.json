But which semantic entities are they? f(predn is an attribute which is then extensionalized by Ext , but f (a) (a is a term of EL.) is an individual. (1) M (form), i.e. an infon, could be thought of as the intension of a sentence in the traditional sense. But there are following differences. First, the semantic correspondence of terms appears as individuals in infons, which represents the (alternative) opinion of Kripke(1972), Kaplan(1977,1978,1989) that proper names and indexicals directly denote individuals without intermediate entities such as intension. Second, attributes Attrl (which correspond to traditional intensions of predicates) are introduced as undefined elements, and their extensions are one of their properties induced by Ext. 40 m(form) is an semantic entity written in a general concept language which can be compared and posessed by different epistemic subjects. So, we could interpret that form expresses the Kaplanian character, 01)m(form) the Kaplanian content, and Mer, (1)/4(form)) represents the extension.","f and Ext enables the following distinction:","(20) i) Exti ( fi (red)) = {a, b} ii) Ext2 (fi (red)) = {c, d} iii) Exti (f2 (red)) = {c, dI (20i) is the extension of 'red' in the actual world (Exti ) by means of the 'correct' linguistic rule fi in a community. (20ii) is its extension in another world, but the linguistic rule as such is correct. But in (20iii), the linguistic rule is false. For example, the epistemic subject mistakes 'red' for yellow. And {c, d} could be the set of yellow things.","Now, consider the following example:","(21) i) John: \"I'm going to the party.\" ii) Marry (to John): \"You are going to the party.\" In (21), the character is different between i) and ii):","(22) i) go-to-the-party(I) ii) go-to-the-party(you) But the content is the same between them:","(23) i) go-to-the-party(john),\\t 351 ii) go-to-the-party(john), assuming that {Mi } represents John's context situation of (210 with fj (I) = john, and {Mm represents Marry's context situation of (21ii) with fm (you) = john."]},{"title":"3 Three-valued Interpretation of Natural Language Sentences","paragraphs":["3.1 Classification of Three-valuedness Here, I distinguish the following three types of three-valuedness:","(24) Type I: category error, failure of existence presupposition, Type II: undefined cases, Type III: failure of information, which are exemplified as follows:","(25) i) The capitalism is yellow. ii) Naomi is XYZ. iii) It's gold. (In the situation s where it's not certain if it's gold.)","Intuitively, the third truth value 'neutral' appears just in the case that an utterance is interpreted as neither true nor false. But the meaning of 'false' is not so clear. As to Type I, it should be understood as the predicate negation, so that the three-valuedness of (25i) w.r.t. M, 7r is formulated as","(26) i) M, r yellow(capitalism) ii) M, it 156 yellow(capitalism) Here, we assume","(27) M(ir, yellow) = Ext(yellow) = yellow + c Ind, M(ir, yellow) = Ext(yellow) = yellow — c Ind, Ext(yellow) fl Ext(yellow) = (/), Ind\\ (Ext(yellow) U Ext(yellow)) = yellowN, yellow = yellow, and call yellow+ , yellow — , yellow N the positive, negative, and neutral domain of yellow respectively.

The former appears w.r.t. an extensional model, but. the latter appears w.r.t. a situation. As we see from (10), s(c,inf) is interpreted in a modal fashion, i.e. in order to determine the truth value of in f w.r.t. s, we must refer to several extensional models. For this reason, we call the former types of three-valuedness the non-modal three-valuedness, the latter the modal three-valuedness. But this modality should not be understood in the traditional modal logical manner, because s(c, in f) is not determined w.r.t. other \"possible worlds\", but w.r.t. extensional models in s. So, we call this kind of modality \"epistemic modality\".","In order to enable an three-valued interpretation, we must a bit modify (10), (12) and (13ii) in the following manner:","(29) I) To (10) and (12), iii) Otherwise, s(c, in f) = N (N means 'neutral'.) and","352 iii) Otherwise, M (c, in f) = N are added respectively.","II) (13iia) is altered to\\t(c,\\t"]},{"title":"=","paragraphs":["N'.","III) (13iib) is altered to: 1) M (c,R Attr?(ti, • • • , tn)) = 1, if M(c,r, Attei )(M(c, ti ), • • • ,M(cor,t„)) = 1. 2) M (cor, Attrr (t i , • • • , tn )) = 0, if M(c,r, Attr i )(M(c, ti ), • • • ,M(c,r,tn)) = 1. 3) M(c,r, Attrr (ti , • • • , tn)) = N, otherwise.","IV) An appropriate three-valued interpretation are given to -1, A, V, D, \\tA, V.

According to them, an utterance of a sentence can be analyzed as follows: (34) I-say-so[it-is-so[prop]] And I-say-so part, it-is-so part, and prop part (i.e. the propositional content of the sentence) are called neustic part, tropic part, and phrastic part respectively.

The context situation corresponds to the utterance situation in Situation Semantics. However, if we want to treat tense, indexicals, belief sentences etc., we need another index corresponding to described (or focal) situation in Situation Semantics w.r.t. which m̀ust in f' and 'may in f' are interpreted more naturally.","Further, 'must' does not have the non-monotonicity which is captured by Data Semantics, although 'may' has it in the present framework too. In order to capture the non-monotonicity, we must introduce e.g. 'background of speech' (Germ.: Redehintergrund, see Kratzer(1978)).","But they do not mean defects of EL, but are all solved in an extended version of it."]},{"title":"Notes","paragraphs":["1 Generally, A* represents the set of non-empty concatenation of elements of A. 2 A similar interpretation w.r.t. a situation is found in Fagin et a1.(1995).
