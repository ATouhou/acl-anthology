For certain languages, C's TO-BINDILQUE feature must be null if TO-BINDIQUE is null.

In Sag's treatment, in which linguistic types are required to satisfy highly articulated linguistic type constraints, features are inherited through the head phrase, the presence of his QUE and REL feature being required to satisfy typing constraints on wh- and relative clauses. In contrast to Lappin and Johnson's treatment, the termination of QUE does not determine the scope of wh-expressions in Sag's treatment. Rather, the presence of QUE at a left peripheral daughter in a phrase structure in English presumably licenses the termination of wh-features (whatever we decide to call them and by whatever means they are inherited on to a higher level of structure). Although Sag does not deal with this problem, the scope of wh-expressions will presumably be determined along the lines of Pollard and Yoo's 1996 treatment of QSTOREs. I do not deal with the 320 problems of Pollard and Yoo's approach to quantifier scope determination here, but suggest that Lappin and Johnson's treatment of inherited features as purely \"syntactic\" features (rather than as necessarily stored interpretations to be unpacked eventually in the CONT feature structure) is attractive in that it promises a simpler and unified treatment of inheritance.","One obvious way to recast Lappin and Johnson's treatment in Sag's framework would be to have a type constraint preventing the INHERIQUE feature from appearing on S[fin] in Iraqi Arabic.

Watanabe's 1991 famous analysis assumed that there were two levels of movement, one an optional operator feature movement taking place at S-structure in order to trigger a CP[wh], the other at LF -- of the whole category -- to determine the scope of the wh-expression. This second level of movement was assumed to be free from subjacency restrictions. The approach recommended here has the advantage over Watanabe's solution that there is no need to consider different levels of movement, and therefore no need to motivate the claim that different constraints apply at those levels. Instead, we assume that language-particular constraints prevent certain features being inherited on to certain phrases, certain strategies being available to effect extraction.","A considerable body of data (Tancredi's 1990 evidence relating to"]},{"title":"only,","paragraphs":["for example) has seriously undermined the claim that whole categories moved at LF. In the development of the MP, the need to eradicate certain putatively unmotivated movement operations was widely accepted by linguists working in the Principles and Parameters tradition.

However, this solution is rejected for the Japanese data and appeal is made to a completely different mechanism.

Pollard and Yoo's 1996 approach to quantifiers suggests how \"nonlocal\" features can be terminated without recourse to (often invisible) functional heads.
