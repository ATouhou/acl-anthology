The stray element may be associated to the preceding foot or following foot at surface level. Stray element adjunction is the mechanism for achieving surface exhaustivity. Each language has its own unique mecbanism of stray element adjunction in order to achieve surface exhaustivity. In Japanese loanwords, the strict binary initial foot parsing creates stray moras. Inaba's (1996) phonetic experiment shows that the word-medial stray moras associate to preceding feet, and provides evidence for the initial unaccented mora as extrametrical. Since the theoretical points I advance are deeply embedded in other languages, I present a set of possible parameters. Based on the set of parameters, I create a computer program which derives the surface foot structures of input loanwords in Japanese, Fijian, and Ponapean. 1. Stray Moras and Surface Exhaustivity","Since the work of Liberman and Prince (1977), it has been assumed that stress is associated with a stress foot. Thus, as opposed to the taxonomic point of view that English stress is phonemic, theories of generative phonology assume that stress is predictable to an extensive degree. For instance, the word 'catamaran' is footed, as in (1), by employing Kager's (1993) moraic trochee. The main stress is assigned to the final visible foot. The upper-case sigma 'X' indicates an isochronous unit called a foot, and the mu\\tis used to refer to a mora. The main stress is marked by an acute accent \"' \" and the secondary by (1)\\tFeet in 'catamaran'"]},{"title":"I \\","paragraphs":["tt ca to ma ra n","The feet in (1) comply with foot exhaustivity without allowing stray elements. Halle and Vergnaud (1987) argued that the exhaustivity condition should be respected in foot parsing. 277","(2) Exhaustivity Condition (Halle and Vergnaud 1987) Rules constructing constituents apply exhaustively over the entire string.","Kager (1993), who clearly distinguishes initial parsing from surface representation, however, argues that exhaustivity is surface-representational rather than a condition of foot parsing. Under the bimoraic initial foot parsing, a stray mora may occur between bimoraic feet. Stray mora adjunction is the mechanism for achieving surface exhaustivity.","Each language has its own unique mechanism of stray mora adjunction. In English, it is assumed that stray elements attach to the preceding foot at the surface foot level. For instance, the word, 'catamaran', is footed as the result of strict binary initial parsing in (3-a), where feet are indicated by a pair of parentheses. The stray mora, which lacks its head element and is marked by without a pair of parentheses, is to be adjoined to the preceding foot at the surface foot level to achieve surface exhaustivity. (3) a.

He uses neither the term stray mom nor the distinction between the initial foot and surface foot, but I interpret his representations as follows. A stray mora is incorporated under the following bimoraic foot at the surface foot level, as in (4-ii). The output forms of initial parsing are represented in (4-0. I adopt pairs of square brackets to indicate moraic elements on which feet are built.

Inaba (1996) provides evidence for surface feet and shows that the word-medial stray moras tend to be associated with the preceding feet rather than with the following feet at the surface level in Japanese. Moreover, the initial stray mom is extrametrical, 278 Japanese. Moreover, the initial stray mora is extrametrical, which is indicated by '< >', as in (5-b).

This Japanese leftward surface-adjunction seems to be identical to the case in English, but is quite different from the type claimed for Fijian (Schutz 1985). This point is illustrated in (6).

Interestingly, they are very similar to syllable structures represented based on the x-bar theory (Inaba 1996), expanding the syllable internal structure proposed by Levin (1985). As I discussed, the syllable is viewed as the maximal projection (N\") of the nucleus (N), and thus it becomes very clear that nucleus and coda as the complement are tied up together in a single unit (N') in English, and onset and nucleus as the complement in Japanese.

This strict binarity is parallel to the labels S (strong) and W (weak), which are relationally defined in major metrical theories. Another parallelism is that in both the syllable-based and the foot-based analyses, the specifier either precedes or follows the head, depending on the language.
