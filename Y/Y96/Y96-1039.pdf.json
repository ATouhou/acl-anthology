So far many researches on similarity measures have been performed but none takes account of POVs. The similarity measure proposed in this paper is based on co-occurrence probabilities of words and this makes it possible to obtain preferable precision even if POVs are not given. This method consists of two parts of processes, POV reinforcement and similarity propagation. First, the POV reinforcement process, which affects the similarity between words, modifies the weights of links according to the relatedness between the link and the POV word. Second, the similarity propagation process propagates the weights of links and defines a similarity value for word pairs which do not actually cooccur in the corpus. Using those two processes this method becomes capable both to take POVs into consideration and to cope with the sparseness of corpora to some degree. This paper, however, focuses on the POV reinforcement and evaluates the effectiveness of the method.."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Rapid growth of computer networks has increased the number of machine-readable texts and also made it possible for us to use various search engines to get desired documents. They are, however, keyword-based and strict. Even if some documents are related to a user's interest, he or she cannot obtain them as long as they do not contain the keywords given in advance. Otherwise he or she will be handed too many documents which contain just the keywords but are not necessarily related to his or her interest.","To solve these problems, it is necessary to take account of similarity between words or concepts and to make use of the measure in search processing. However, because there are many similar words in a text, employing a similarity measure alone only will expand the range of relatedness and produce more and more results.","When considering meanings of words, we, human beings, do not consider the whole meanings at a time, rather some interesting aspects of their concepts just the same as we look at a landscape from some point-of-view. Hence in similarity of words it is required to take account of their POVs. This makes it possible both to expand the range of matching in some situations and to restrict the range in others. Expectation is that employing valid POVs has both the expansion and the restriction be suitable and search processing produces more appropriate results.","This paper proposes a similarity measure between words which measure takes account of the effect of POVs. So far many researches on concept (or word) similarity have been performed but none handles POVs in their similarity measures. The proposed method utilizes co-occurrence probability-based similarity as a basis 373 and extends this fundamental measure by weighting the values according to the relevance between input words and POV words. This fundamental measure and its evaluation with some traditional similarity measures are described in 2.

For example, in disam-","biguation of word senses it can help to detect appropriate word senses by selecting","most similar word senses to the senses of context words. In sentence production","similarity measures can also help to keep coherence of word sequences. The fact","that most researches on similarity measures have been performed with relation to","the word sense disambiguation indicates the significance of similarity measures. The similarity measures researched so far are classified as follows. 1. Similarity based on the structure of thesauruses or taxonomies","(Agirre 1995)(Resnik 1995)","Because thesauruses or taxonomies contain even infrequently used words (or","concepts), the similarity measures of this type can define similarity values","to most word pairs. The range of the word pairs they can handle is, thus,","broad. In contrast, these measures are also considered as class-based and","the degree of similarity is rather loose (they tend to judge the words or","concepts in a same class as similar).","2. Similarity based on the statistical information extracted from corpora (Dagan 1994)(Iwayama 1994)(Yang 1994)(Karov 1996) The range of the word pairs they can handle depends on the size of corpora used to extract the statistical information. In most cases, however, the problem of data sparseness arises. The main concern in these measures is how to estimate the values of unseen word pairs (Dagan 1994).","3. Similarity based on network structures (Kozima 1993)(Niwa 1994) Similarity values are defined on links in the network and a total value in a path, maybe processed somewhat, is interpreted as a similarity value.","4. Feature-based similarity In these measures each word (or concept) has a set of features which are semantically related to the word. Those features may be actual semantic features or co-occurrence words. The number of shared features is interpreted as a similarity value. 374"]},{"title":"2.2 Selectivity of Similarity Measures","paragraphs":["Before considering the similarity measure based on POV, it is necessary to clarify the ability of some fundamental similarity measures described in the previous section. With the result this evaluation the most promising measure is adopted as the base of the proposed method.","In many researches the evaluation of similarity measures depends on human beings' judgment. In this case the measures are estimated by the score subjects judged for output values of the measures or by the correlation between two judgments of subjects and similarity measures. Scoring similarity of word pairs by hand, however, costs a lot. In contrast to this approach this paper adopt another type of evaluation employing coverage and selectivity of similarity measures.","When some threshold of a similarity measure is determined, the measure can judge each pair of words as similar or as not similar. At this point the coverage of a word pair set by the similarity measure is defined as the proportion of the number of word pairs judged as similar to the size of the set (total number of word pairs in the set).","Employing this coverage ratio, selectivity of a similarity measure is described as follows. First, two groups of word pairs are prepared. One group,"]},{"title":"synonym set,","paragraphs":["contains pairs of synonyms which are similar in human beings' judgment. The other group,"]},{"title":"non-synonym set,","paragraphs":["contains pairs of non-synonyms which are not similar to each other. In practice, however, non-synonym set is approximated with word pairs randomly selected from a dictionary. When some threshold of a similarity measure is determined, two coverage ratios for those two sets can be computed and the relationship between the two coverage ratios is plotted with the threshold being a parameter (see Figure 1 and 2 as examples). This plotted relationship is defined as the selectivity of the similarity measure. In the graphs, the lower a data sequence is located, the higher the selectivity of the similarity measure becomes."]},{"title":"2.3 Evaluation of Fundamental Similarity Measures","paragraphs":["In this section some fundamental similarity measures are evaluated employing the selectivity.
