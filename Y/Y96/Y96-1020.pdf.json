Experiment 1 found that NP-ga sequences are rated substantially less favorably for processability ratings than their matched counterparts; thus, theories that predict processing load must offer an account of this special source of processing difficulty. Experiment 2 used an alternation in Korean nominative particles -i and -ka, phonologically triggered, to narrow the sense in which it might be said that the cost of NP-ga sequences arises because of a problem in discriminating among consecutive NPs. In this case, processability ratings provided no evidence that confusable NP-Nom's are made more distinct by purely phonological variation in their case-markers."]},{"title":"1.\\tIntroduction","paragraphs":["For some three decades now, arguments about the character of sentence processing mechanisms have taken the obvious difficulty of multiply center-embedded sentences as a major point of focus. In head-initial languages such as English, doubly-embedded relative clauses (and especially, doubly-embedded object relatives) can be peculiarly problematic. In head-final languages such as Japanese, multiply-embedded sentential complements induce something like the same difficulty. Summarizing the special burdens offered by multiply center-embedded sentences, Eady and Fodor (1981) concluded that the processor has particular trouble with sequences of consecutive NPs, separated in the surface word string from the remainder of their clauses.","Sentence processing theories routinely predict that repetitive sequences of this kind lead to comprehension breakdown, though the grounds differ between frameworks; for example, Stabler's (1994) theory of case-assignment relations supposes the processing mechanism to be restricted in its ability to keep track of grammatical relations of the same kind; and Lewis's (1993, 1996) theory of X'- relations supposes that a sharply limited working memory suffers similaritybased interference when it is overloaded. For Babyonyshev and Gibson (1995) (henceforth, B&G), the claim is that two factors determine level of difficulty for multiply center-embedded sentences: First, the number of structurally-cased NPs (Nom, Acc, and Gen) not yet assigned theta-roles; and second, the number of self-embeddings (SEs). In B&G's theory, sentences become unprocessable when the number of Processing Load Units (PLUs) they accumulate exceeds a critical limit which is set universally at 4 PLUs.","Native-speaker intuition suggests, for Japanese, that center-embeddings manifest a source of processing difficulty not yet recognized in B&G's metric, 187 and handled only indirectly by other theories of sentence processing; and that is, beyond the known problems of NP-repetition, a cost of NP-ga repetition arising when more than two consecutive NPs bear the nominative case-marker"]},{"title":"-ga.","paragraphs":["In this paper, we present our investigation of NP-ga repetition in multiply center-embedded sentences, and confirm that the ga-effect has a substantial impact on processing difficulty.

Subjects were asked to complete the questionnaire at their own pace, with no back-tracking, and were urged to read (and understand) sentences at the speed which felt most natural for them. 2.3 Results and Discussion. The analysis of Task 1's absolute processability judgment data assumed that subjects treated the 6-point rating scale as at least quasi-interval.

Given the problems the parser faces as it projects structural analyses in such sentences, what seems most likely is that repetition impairs discriminability among NPs which must be retained in memory awaiting their structural assignments.

Care was taken in selecting lexical items so that this phonological conversion would alter overall plausibility of sentence meanings as little as possible; moreover, kinship terms were replaced by kinship terms, proper names by proper names, and so on.","This basic design was expanded by the inclusion of a complexity factor. That is, 3 PLU sentences were created by dropping out the middle clauses (i.e., NP2 ...V2) of the 5 PLU originals; their complexity was lowered through loss of 1 structurally cased NP and 1 SE. Thus the final design reflected the factorial combination of Phonological Conversion and Complexity.","Four different sentences were created for each of the 3i and 31ca skeletons, differing only in lexical content. These 8 basic sentences were then adapted to achieve phonological conversion, as outlined above; and finally, each of the resulting 16 sentences was further adapted to reduce complexity.

For progress in theory-construction, we require that the precise problem with such sequences be appropriately characterized; and as a first step in this direction, we suggest that accounts should not be cast in terms of phonological discriminability. The difficulty apparently lies in repeated use of the same case, rather than repeated use of the same form; strictly, we should be speaking of a problem arising from repetition of the syntactic element. This last conclusion denies one component of the claim made by R&K for Korean; note, though, that these authors looked at the joint rather than the independent action of several kinds of non-syntactic information. To whatever extent—and in whatever way—sentence processing mechanisms can exploit additional information sources to make comprehensible an otherwise unprocessable multiply center-embedded structure, the suggestion must be that what is most likely to be beneficial is information that restricts the candidate set of constituent relations. 195 Notes","1 We gratefully acknowledge the contributions made by Janet Dean Fodor and John Whitman, who provided comments and advice in the course of this project, and also the contribution of Soon Ae-Chung, who assisted in the construction of Korean materials.","2 For reasons of space, materials lists could not be included in this paper.
