Introduction It has been proposed that there are two types of constraints on anaphor binding in various languages. These are the syntactic and discourse (or pragmatic) constraints as proposed by Roberts (1987), Reinhart and Reuland (1991, 1993), Iida (1992), Pollard and Sag (1992, 1994), Baker (1994), and Xue, Pollard and Sag (1994), among others. The dichotomy between syntactic and discourse constraints seems to pertain in Korean too.","The proposals of this paper are as follows. First, contrary to the general belief that the discourse constraint only affects long-distance anaphor binding (the case where an anaphor and its antecedent are not coarguments), the coargument binding possibilities of Korean"]},{"title":"caki (̀","paragraphs":["self) are affected by the discourse constraint when contrastive focus is introduced.

Third, the syntactic constraint hinges on \"syntactic prominence\" of an antecedent. The syntactic prominence is determined by two factors concerning the anaphor and its antecedent: obliqueness and linear order. Fourth, discourse constraint hinges on \"discourse prominence\" of an antecedent. The discourse prominence is partially determined by linear order and a set of presuppositions (the familiarity presupposition in Heim (1982) and the presupposition of contrastive focus). 307 2.

Syntactic Prominence and Syntactic Caki-Binding Condition The syntactic factors which determine the relative prominence among the arguments of a lexical head are their obliqueness and linear order. The independent linguistic motivations for each factor are discussed in sections 3.1 and 3.2. Then, in sections 3.3, we discuss the syntactic caki-binding condition. 3.1. Obliqueness Pollard and Sag (1992, 1994) assume the obliqueness hierarchy in (8) which states that the Subject is less oblique than the Primary Object, the Primary Object is less oblique than the Secondary Object, and so on.

In this paper, I assume that the distinction between the PO and the SO does not exist in the obliqueness hierarchy in Korean, and that they are treated as having the same degree of obliqueness.

However, in casual speech, this morphological distinction is often not made and both objects exhibit accusative case markings. In this case, unlike English, the order between the objects is free, as shown in (10), and passivization is allowed only when both accusative NPs become nominative, as shown in (11):","(10) a.

Passivization is generally assumed to be a test to distinguish the PO from the SO. However, even this test does not distinguish between them in Korean. Thus, we may say that at least in this construction, they are morphologically and syntactically indistinguishable.","On the basis of the construction mentioned above, I propose that the obliqueness hierarchy in (12) applies to Korean. This means that a subject is less oblique than a complement, and that complements are all equally oblique. (12) Subject < Complements <","Although relative obliqueness of an anaphor and its antecedent is crucial for the syntactic anaphor binding condition, we cannot explain all binding facts solely based on the obliqueness of the arguments. In section 3.2, we will discuss the other factor affecting syntactic binding possibilities, linear precedence. 3.2. Linear Precedence Even though Korean allows considerable freedom in constituent order, sentences with different constituent orders have distinct discourse functions. Following GivOn (1975), Kim (1985) claims that one of the factors most crucial in the constituent order variation in a sentence is the Principle of Information Flow:","(13) The constituents in a sentence tend to be sequentially ordered in such a way that a constituent expressing given information comes first, a constituent expressing new information next, and a constituent expressing unpredictable information last.","The statement in (13) is similar to saying that other things being equal, a more prominent constituent tends to linearly precede a less prominent constituent.

According to Culicover and Rochemont (1983), and Kim (1990) among others, the contrastive focus that we are concerned with in this paper differs from informational focus in such a way that the contrasted expressions carry old information that is presupposed to be familiar to the interlocutors. The familiarity presupposition guarantees that the referent of the focused expression, the man, and the target of the contrast, the woman, be members of the presuppositional set. That is, the set must include the referents of the man and the woman, in order for the sentence to be felicitously uttered. In this case,"]},{"title":"caki","paragraphs":["in (3) is bound by the referent of the man at the discourse level.","On this approach, it is naturally explained why a sentence with an atypical binding pattern does not allow an antecedent to be an indefinite (e.g. (2) and (5)). According to Heim (1982), the difference between definites and indefinites comes from their distinct presuppositions. Definites have familiarity presuppositions while indefinites have novelty presuppositions. Then the sentences in (2) and (5) where the antecedents are indefinites are predicted to be infelicitous due to the presupposition failure. Sentences with contrastive focus presuppose the focused expression to be familiar to interlocutors, but an indefinite NP cannot be felicitously used for that expression.","Also note that contrastive focus by itself cannot improve the acceptability of the atypical binding pattern. Comparison between (3) and (4) shows that the effect of contrastiveness must be reinforced by the effect of linear precedence. If we do not consider the effect of linear precedence or obliqueness there, the anaphor and its antecedent are equally prominent at the discourse level, because they refer to the same individual in the presuppositional set.
