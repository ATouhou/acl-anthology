We point out in Section 2.3 that Murasugi and Saito's analysis is inadequate in handling some data related to overt movement, such as relativization. We thus suggest maintaining Huang's null P hypothesis. Nevertheless, the examples given by Murasugi and Saito indeed pose a problem for Huang's null P theory. The goal of this paper is to look for an analysis so that we can preserve the null P on the one hand, and give a plausible account for the relevant examples in question. The answer, we believe, lies in an LF process, the Null-P incorporation, which we discuss in detail in Section 3. 2. On the distribution of temporal and locative WHs 2.1 Huang (1982) One of the curious generalizations reported in Huang (1982) is about the categorial status of locative and temporal WH-phrases.

(14a-c) should have the same status and contrast with (14d), according to Murasugi and Saito's analysis. Huang's (1982) analysis, on the other hand, has the potential of accounting for the facts in (14). For example, (14b-c) have two possible structures under his analysis, depending on what category (PP or NP) moves across the WH-island. (15) a. *This is the day [pp [p"]},{"title":"e]","paragraphs":["when]] I wonder [what.' you bought ti tj] b. *This is the day [ NI, when]] I wonder [what.' you bought ti [pp [p"]},{"title":"e]","paragraphs":["ti]] (16) a. *This is the place [pp. [p"]},{"title":"el","paragraphs":["where]' I wonder [what.' you bought ti"]},{"title":"tj]","paragraphs":["b. *This is the place [ NI, where]] I wonder [what; you bought ti [pp [p"]},{"title":"e]","paragraphs":["ti]] Recall that under Huang's (1982) analysis, temporal and locative PPs are adjuncts. Thus, the representations in (15a) and (16a) violate both Subjacency (i.e. WH-island) and the ECP, and those in (15b) and (16b) violate WH-island and the CED (Condition on Extraction Domain), which prohibits an overt extraction out of a non-properly governed domain: the PP from which extraction takes place is an adjunct 270 and hence is not properly governed, according to Huang (1982). In either case, some constraint in addition to Subjacency (i.e. WH-island) is violated. Hence, the fact that (14b-c) are worse than (14a) is expected under Huang's (1982) account, since (14a) violates only Subjacency (WH-island).","In addition, the presence of P is independently motivated cross-linguistically, at least in the case of locative WHs.

(32) Only the head of a chain CH enters into the operation (Attract/Move). Chomsky suggests that a copy is not visible for computational operations. Although it is not entirely clear if Chomsky's idea is justifiable, let us suppose for the sake of discussion that it is. Then in (31) the copy of the null P should not be affected by any movement operation.","There is a technical way out of this dilemma. Suppose the following. (33) Null P incorporation takes place at LF. Let us now reconsider the example in (31). This is not a legitimate LF representation in that the chain created by the movement of the PP is not an operator-variable construction: this is not a well-formed LF object in Chomsky's (1991) sense.

This also answers the question that we raised in (26a) concerning the level at which the null P incorporation takes place. According to the present proposal, the null P is an LF affix which must incorporate into a [-N] (or verbal) head without violating the HMC.6","Now that we have motivated the LF null P-incorporation, let us go back to (22), which illustrates the derivation for (2c).

Conclusion To summarize, we first reviewed two important works bearing on the grammatical status of locative and temporal WHs: Huang (1982) and Murasugi and Saito (1992).

Thanks also due to Kazuko Hiramatsu for proof reading this paper. 1 Murasugi and Saito (1992) are not very clear about this part. It is true, as observed by Culicover and Rochemont (1992), that overt adjunct extraction from the object NP is prohibited in English, suggesting that the object NP is a kind of barrier for adjunct movement (although it is a complement and hence is L-marked in the sense of Chomsky (1986)). This is illustrated below. (i) *[On which table]i did you read [the book ti]?\\t(Culicover and Rochemont 1992 : 497) See Murasugi and Saito (1992) and the reference cited there for more discussion. 2 This pattern is also observed in Serbo-Croatian and Korean. 3 Also, as Larson (1985) observes, locative phrases in English almost always occur with prepositions, the only exceptions being place and home, as shown below. (i)You have lived some place warm and sunny. (ii) You went home. 4 The following contrast may also be relevant to our discussions of P-incorporation. (i) a. John proved that/0 Mary is honest.","b. John's proof that/*0 Mary is honest In general, the null C is allowed if the CP which it heads is in the complement position of the V, but not of the N. This is accounted for if we assume that the null C must incorporate into a head with [-N] (cf. Ormazabal 1996). 5 See Chomsky (1993) for detail. 6 One empirical problem with this analysis is the grammaticality of examples like the following. (i) [N ̂the destruction of the city yesterday] Here, if yesterday is accompanied by the null P, as implied by the present analysis, it is not clear how the P-incorporation is possible. Notice, however, that this type of examples contain a deverbal noun (destroy --> destruction). Thus it may be possible that the null P incorporates into this deverbal noun. 275 References -- Anderson, Mona. 1979."]},{"title":"Noun Phrase Structure.","paragraphs":["Doctoral dissertation, University of Connecticut.","Aoun, Joseph, N.
