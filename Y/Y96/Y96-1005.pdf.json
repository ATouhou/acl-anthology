The integration of the search for such information into the transfer process provides an efficient solution. General transfer rules, preference rules and default rules are combined. The transfer includes conditions to make it possible to consider external knowledge. Thereby, grammatical and lexical knowledge of the source language, knowledge of lexical restrictions on the target language, domain knowledge and discourse knowledge are accessible."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["One of the significant problems in Japanese to German machine translation is that information on definiteness and number is in most cases not available on the surface of the Japanese utterance. Japanese has neither number agreement between verbs and nouns nor obligatory plural morphemes. Optional plural morphemes like tachi or domo are only available for nouns that refer to persons. However, for the generation of German utterances the generator needs such information, as in many cases determiners are obligatory. We analyzed the problem based on empirical material collected in the domain of appointment scheduling. In our setting, an interpreter translated 10 dialogues of Japanese and German speakers. Consider the following example from our data: Japanese: kayoobi wa\\twatashidomo no\\ttokoro de Tuesday TOPIC we\\tGEN side\\tCASE DE 43 wa\\tkyuujitsu na no\\tde tabun kaigi TOPIC holiday\\tcopula\\tmaybe meeting ni\\tsanka\\tsuru koto wa\\tdekimasen CASE NI participate do\\tNOM TOPIC cannot German translation: auf unserer Seite ist Freitag ein Feiertag vielleicht on our\\tside is Friday a\\tholiday maybe kOnnen wir an dem Treffen nicht teilnehmen can\\twe at the meeting not\\tparticipate (On our side Friday is a holiday and we maybe cannot participate in the meeting) The information that Feiertag has to be preceded by the singular indefinite (masculine) determiner ein and that Treffen has to be preceded by the singular definite (neuter) determiner dem does not come out of the surface of the Japanese utterance and therefore cannot be included in the parsing result. It is not an adequate solution to transfer an underspecified representation to the German generation module, because the information that is needed to decide on the definiteness and number of the noun phrase partly comes out of the Japanese surface, partly out of German lexical restrictions and partly out of domain and discourse restrictions. Not all of this information is available in the generation phase. We argue that it is an interlingual problem and therefore must be solved in the transfer module."]},{"title":"2 Previous approaches","paragraphs":["[Murata and Nagao, 1993] describe a solution model that searches for information at the surface of the Japanese utterances to give hints for the choice of determiners in the English counterpart. They state heuristics for the possibility of definiteness and number values concerning words or constructions in the Japanese utterances. Such information can be determiners in Japanese or particle and tense information. But this is only one of the relevant aspects, because it does neither consider restrictions on definiteness and number coming from the target language, nor restrictions based on domain and discourse. Just as little as it is an inherent German problem it is an inherent Japanese problem. [Bond et al., 1994] already state that the inclusion of information about the target language (English in their case) increases the rate of correct translations. 44 They enrich the heuristics with information on countability of English nouns. But their approach still lacks the integration of knowledge about discourse and domain, which is relevant as we will show. Every approach that is external to the transfer process cannot include source and target language information at the same time and be thus effective. It is essential to find a mechanism that makes it possible to consider discourse and domain knowledge."]},{"title":"3 Transfer rules","paragraphs":["Only in some cases, where definite articles, quantifying adjectives or certain genitive constructions can be found in the Japanese source language utterance, the parsing result can directly contain information on number and definiteness. The information that is necessary to generate the German determiners has to be searched in the surface of the Japanese utterance (as it is described by [Murata and Nagao, 1993]), in lexical information of the German target language (as it is described by [Bond"]},{"title":"et al.,","paragraphs":["1994]) and in external knowledge sources. The solution of our approach is based on the idea of transfer-based machine translation. The representation for the transfer rules are expressions in simplified RQLF-format [Aishawi, 1992]. An RQLF, Resolved Quasi-Logical Form, is an underspecified semantic representation that includes context information. Nouns with determiners are represented as"]},{"title":"qterms.","paragraphs":["An example is the representation for a"]},{"title":"house: qterm = (< t quant, p = inde f , n = sing, 1 =","paragraphs":["a >,"]},{"title":"house)","paragraphs":["t is the type of expression,"]},{"title":"p","paragraphs":["the phrase type, n contains number information and"]},{"title":"1","paragraphs":["the lexical realization. The integration of the search for definiteness and number in the transfer process reduces the complexity of the problem, because it is possible to state a number of transfer rules without searching for information on number and definiteness. Another advantage is that no extra process has to be activated to find information on the Japanese sentence surface. A practical aspect is therefore the avoidance of redundancy in the translation process, contrasting Murata/Nagaos approach. Only when no transfer rule can be found that directly gives information on definiteness and number, preference rules are activated to search for the missing information. The rule format of the transfer rules is the following:"]},{"title":"transfer(JapaneseRQLF\\tGermanRQLF) : conditions.","paragraphs":["It contains the Prolog predicate"]},{"title":"transfer,","paragraphs":["a translation rule expressing the relation between the source and target language expression and (optionally) one or more conditions. The RQLF expressions can be complex, including for example the representation of a determiner and the corresponding noun. They can 45 include variables. Conditions are optional Prolog clauses. They can restrict the transfer rule to a certain value in the RQLF or to a speechact. This makes it possible to include domain knowledge. They can also be transfer-predicates so that the rule is recursive. This is needed for the case that a rule inserts information on only number or definiteness and another one is needed to insert the missing information. Another possibility is the condition definiteness that looks for further information on definiteness after the information on number was found. These conditions are responsible for discourse knowledge. A combination of conditions is also allowed. The searching strategy of the transfer rules is determined by the Prolog mechanism of backtracking. 3.1"]},{"title":"Rules that avoid the necessity to insert information on number and definiteness","paragraphs":["In many cases a preferred German equivalent does not contain a noun, and therefore no more information on number and definiteness is needed. These are — on the one hand — general translation equivalents for complex expressions and — on the other hand — realizations of speechacts in the domain. Examples for the first ones are: • hayai jikan - friih (early time - early) • nagai jikan lange (long time - long) • yasumi - geschlossen (holiday - closed) Such general translation equivalents are easy to state, as for example nagai jikan - lange: transfer([jikanl,nagail]\\t[lang_ prop]). Temporal expressions are translated stereotypically without searching for information on number and definiteness, as for example niji ni um zwei Uhr (at one o'clock). Some Japanese noun phrases that contain two nouns connected by a genitive no can have German equivalents that contain only one noun: watashidomo no tokoro - wir (our side - we). Other Japanese noun phrases containing no-phrases have a German equivalent with a nominal compound: getsuyoobi no gogo - Montag Nachmittag (afternoon of Monday - Monday afternoon). The German nominal compound gets only one determiner; as soon as a restriction for one of the parts is found, the determiner can be decided on. Other cases are domain-specific: Japanese mina in our data is always translated as alle Mitarbeiter (all staff-members), but could be - for example in another domain","-alle Studenten (all students). It always (independent of the domain) has to be translated with plural. The rule in our domain is: transfer([mina] [qterm = [t = quant, p = de f, n = plural, l alle], Mitarbeiter]) . 46 An example, where the number information is dependent on the domain is the following: Japanese: kono\\thi\\twa\\tsham\\twa\\tkimasen this\\tday TOP staff-member TOP do not come German: An\\tdiesem\\tTag\\tkommen\\tdie\\tMitarbeiter on\\tthis\\tday\\tcome,pl.\\tthe,pl.\\tstaff members nicht not or: An\\tdiesem\\tTag\\tkommt\\tder\\tMitarbeiter on\\tthis\\tday\\tcome,sg\\tthe,sg.\\tstaff members nicht not The translation of sham depends on if the company has one or more staffmembers. It could be thought of adding a condition domain(D), if the rules are used in a system that concerns more than one domain. Strictly speaking, information on gender has to be found, too. But this is an inherent German problem and underlies German lexical restrictions and domain restrictions and is therefore left to generation. Examples for speechact realizations are yotei wo tatetai - schlage ich vor (I would like to set up the plan - I propose) and donna yotei ni naru ka - wie ist...? (what plan will become - how about...?). By using indicators for speechacts one can try to find pragmatic translation equivalents instead of literal ones: Both examples belong to the speechact proposal. Thus, transfer rules can include a condition that is an inquiry to the dialogue component. The project VERBMOBIL defines dialogue acts for the appointment scheduling domain, which could also be used for this purpose. See [Jekat et al., 1995] for further information. The empirical base is built by 10 collected dialogues of appointment scheduling between German and Japanese speakers that were translated by an interpreter. The data includes 566 noun tokens. 18.9% of these Japanese nouns have German equivalents that are not nouns. 34.63% are temporal expressions that are translated stereotypically. That makes more than 50% of all nouns where neither search for information on number nor for such on definiteness is necessary when first adequate transfer rules — general ones or domain specific ones — are searched for. This already is a strong argument to integrate the solution of the problem into the transfer process and to adapt the transfer to the domain. 47 3.2 General rules Numerals in Japanese give clear information on number and have an unambiguous German translation, as for example: • ichijikan, sanjikan - eine Stunde, drei Stunden (one hour, three hours) • hitori, futari - eine Person, zwei Personen (one person, two persons)","• hitori no hito, yonin membaa - eine Person, vier Mitglieder (one person, four members) • kenkyuuin no hitori - einer unserer Forscher (one of our researchers) These cases underly general transfer rules for number. Still, information on definiteness has to be found, as the following transfer rule shows: transferasanj ikan] [qterm = [t = quant, p P, n = plural, 1 = drei], Stunden]) : - definiteness (sanjikan, P). It translates sanjikan into drei Stunden or die drei Stunden. The condition definiteness is a predicate to test whether an entity is pre-mentioned (that is, included on a stack of pre-mentioned entities) and thus definite, or not pre-mentioned and thus indefinite. In our implementation, the stack is not only used for determining definiteness, but also for resolving zero pronominals (see [Siegel, 1996] for further information). These cases concern 7.42% of the nouns in our data base. In some cases Japanese nominal phrases contain determiners, as kono jikantai (this period of time/these periods of time) and sono jikan (that time/that times). In these cases the translation concerning definiteness is straightforward: transfer( [qterm = [t = quant, p = de f , n = N, 1 = kono], X] [qterm = [t = quant, p = de f, n = ND, 1 = dies], X DD : - transfer (X,XD). A definite (p = de f) Japanese nominal phrase with a determiner kono and without information on number (n = N) is transferred to a definite German nominal phrase with a determiner dies (this) and German number information ND. The call trans f er(X , XD) initiates the search for a transfer equivalent of the noun phrase and its number information and unifies the result with the found qterm. But not only determiners lead to a situation where transfer rules concerning definiteness can be stated straightforwardly. Other possibilities are some kinds of adjectives and genitive constructions, as for example: 48 • onaji shun - dieselbe Woche/dieselben Wochen (the same week(s)) • tsugi no hi - der ndchste Tag/die niichsten Tage (the next day(s))","• kondo no kaigi - das nachste Treffen/die niichsten Treffen (the next meeting(s)) All of these require a translation with definite determiner. 3.3 Preference rules and the default [Schmitz and Quantz, 1993] present an hybrid model for the search for information that combines exact knowledge with default knowledge. Default knowledge can be formulated as valid in a domain. Some entities in a domain are known and unique. These have to be translated singular and definite. Those are in our domain, for example, days of the week, the lunch break and the meeting. It is necessary to include domain-specific default transfer rules, as for example: transfer(kaisha [qterm\\t= quant , p = de f, n = sg , 1 = L], Firma]) . Pre-mentioned entities have to be kept in a stack and have to be translated with definite determiner. An option with strong preference is to copy the information on number from the previous mentioned entity, as in the following example: Japanese: kono","\\t jikantai","\\t wa","\\t","dekireba\\tsakete","this\\tperiod(s) of time\\t","TOP","\\t","if possible\\tkeep free","itadakitai\\tto\\tomoimasu","HON\\tCOMPL\\tthink German: Ich\\tdenke,\\tdaf3\\tich I\\tthink\\tthat","diese Zeitriume\\tmOglichst these periods of time\\tif possible diesen Zeitraum this period of time freihalten\\tmOchte keep free\\twant The translation depends on if it was spoken about one or more periods of time before. In German sentences with copula predicates number agreement between subject and x-complement is preferred. This can be stated as a preference rule. This is not a general rule, as the example wir sind ein Projektteam (we are a project team) shows. Consider the following examples: 49"]},{"title":"Japanese:","paragraphs":["getsuyoobi\\twa\\tkyuujitsu\\tdesu Monday\\tTOP\\tholiday\\tis"]},{"title":"German:","paragraphs":["Montag\\tist\\tein\\tFeiertag Monday\\tis\\ta\\tholiday and"]},{"title":"Japanese:","paragraphs":["getsuyoobi\\tto\\tkayoobi\\twa\\tkyuujitsu\\tdesu Monday\\tand Tuesday TOP\\tholiday\\tis"]},{"title":"German:","paragraphs":["Montag\\tand\\tDienstag\\tsind\\tFeiertage Monday\\tand\\tTuesday\\tare\\tholidays The transfer rule is as follows:"]},{"title":"transfer( [desu,QTERMJ,ARG1J,ARG2Jj [sein,QTERMD,ARG1D, [qterm = [t quant, p = inde f , n = N, 1 = L]], ARG2D]) : — transfer(ARG1J,ARG1D), \\t%transfer the first argument value(qterm/n,ARG1D,N),\\t%copy information on number transfer(QTERMJ,QTERMD).","paragraphs":["If no transfer rule or preference rule is applicable, singular indefinite is inserted as a default.

To solute the problem it is necessary to combine knowledge on the Japanese source language with such on the German target language and discourse and domain knowledge. Previous approaches lack this possibility to connect the different knowledge sources. We integrate preference rules and default rules concerning number and definiteness into the transfer and are therefore able to consider source and target language at the same time. Domain and discourse knowledge can be referred to by conditions that restrict the transfer rules. Preference rules are stated for domain-specific and discourse knowledge. Domain-specific knowledge is encoded in a stack of unique entities of a domain. Discourse knowledge is also encoded in a stack on pre-mentioned entities. The following picture shows the connection of different kinds of transfer rules to translate Japanese to German noun phrases.","discourse-specific transfer rules","general transfer rules domain-specific transfer rules transfer of nouns transfer with conditions on speechacts","preference rules general default","rules","domain-specific default rules We have shown that combinating transfer and the search for information on number and definiteness reduces the problem to a reasonable extend. It can be shown that though general rules have to be preferred to domain-specific ones, 51 domain-specific rules play an important role in translating Japanese noun phrases into German. The described transfer rules and preference restrictions are based on observations on a corpus. They are implemented in a Prolog program."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["[Alshawi, 1992] H.
