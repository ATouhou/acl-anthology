Based on the idea that a discourse structure basically consists of question/answer pairs, the proposed formalism shows 1) Korean contrastive topic corresponds to a certain prosody in English and the information structure for contrastive topic in both languages is essentially same, 2) Contrastive topic always presuppose a bigger question, and 3) the presupposition can be either explicitly satisfied by the preceding question, or implicitly accommodated so that the answer can be felicitous. 1. Introduction A widespread attitude to Korean topic marker,"]},{"title":"nun,","paragraphs":["is that it has two functions, one is theme presentation and the other is contrastive topic marking. It has been a lot of controversy on the nature of these two functions associated with the topic marker in Korean or Japanese, whether they are essentially one category or not. Based on Hoji's (1985) observation that they show quite different syntactic behavior from functional categories, assuming that the two functions correspond to two separate functional categories, I will concern contrastive topic only in this paper, postponing the analysis of the theme presentation function for a future research.","Most Korean or Japanese linguists acknowledge the notion of contrastive topic, but very few precisely captures the essential semantic and discoursal meaning associated with contrastive topic in a formal framework. In this paper, I attempt to provide a sketch of a formalism for the treatmen of Korean contrastive topic. For this, I will first show that Koran contrastive topic corresponds to a certain kind of prosody in English, which is a fall-rise intonation.","Given that English has the same function as Korean Contrastive Topic, recent increasing researches on information structure and prosodic focus theory (Rooth 1985, 1992, Partee 1991, Krifka 1992, Vallduvi 1992, Roberts 1996, Steedman 1991, Von Fintel 1994 etc.) deepen our understanding of information structure associated with Korean contrastive topic, too. Especially, by exploiting the idea of Robert and Buering, I will provide a formalism for a proper treatment of the notion contrastive topic not only for Korean but also in general. 2. Formalism for Contrastive Topic 2. 1 Correspondence between Korean and English Contrastive Topic Jackendoff(1972) categorizes two kinds of intonational pattern in terms of the 459 informational function of the expression dubbed with that particular intonation. One is called A-accent, which is a falling accent, and the other is called B-accent, which is a fall-rise accent. The A-accent is said to carry the information of"]},{"title":"rheme,","paragraphs":["whereas B-accent is said to carry"]},{"title":"theme","paragraphs":["information. The prosody that I believe correspond to Korean contrastive topic is this B-accent. Under Pierrehumbert's (1980) description of intonational patterns, this fall-rise contour is described as L+H* LH%, which is a pitch accent consisting of an ordered pair of two tones, low (L) and high (H), followed by L phrase accent and H% boundary tone. Since \"*\" marks accented syllables, the accented syllable is aligned with the H tone of the L+H*LH% pitch accent.","The corresponce between Korean and English contrastive topic is illustrated in the exmples in (1) and (2).","(1) a.

In the next section, let us examine the semantic formalism of contrastive topic. 2.2 Semantics of Contrastive Topic The function of B-accent seems to be of two kinds: From the sentential perspective, one function of this tune is to mark \"what the utterance is about\" and indicates a constituent whose translation corresponds to an open proposition established by the question, as discussed in Steedman (1991, 1994) and Pierrehumbert & Hirschberg (1990). Thus, in categorial grammar, the constituents marked by this tune in (1 b) and (2c) are translated as"]},{"title":"Ax eat ' (Fred' , x)","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"Ax eat' (x,beans)","paragraphs":["respectively. From the discoursal point of view, this particular intonation marks the proposition contrasted with the alternatives that are implicated by the previous discourse and/or context. In case of (lb),"]},{"title":"Fred","paragraphs":["is marked as standing in contrast to some other person in the discourse domain, and in (2c)"]},{"title":"the beans","paragraphs":["is contrasting with some other comestibles which is not known in this example. This interpretation of fall-rise intonation in English exactly matches with the interpretation associated with Korean contrastive topic. Given this correspondence, various researches on focus theory can provide us a good starting point for developing a more suitable framework that explains the function of contrastive topic in Korean, and further in general. For example, Steedman (1991, 1994) provides a framework that can nicely incorporates topic marking phenomena associated with fall-rise intonation based on combinatory categorial grammar in sentential level. Given that topic marking is essentially a discourse functional phenomenon, however, an analysis from the discoursal 460 point of view seems to be indispensable for understanding the discoursal function of topic marking. In that sense, Buering's (1994) and Roberts'(1996) formalisms for English contrastive topic associated with fall-rise intonation can be an excellent contribution to a proper analysis of Korean contrastive topic. They provide a proper"]},{"title":"information structure","paragraphs":["of"]},{"title":"context","paragraphs":["for contrastive topic by looking beyond a sentential level. Both approaches are essentially same in that they both are based on the perspective on information structure stemming ultimately from the work of Carlson's (1983) dialogue game approach, with the only difference that Roberts' is more like procedural algorithmic formalism, whereas Buering's is more like schematic formalism such as a filtering device.

This example is originated from Ward& Hirschberg(1985), where they claim this particular intonation should be distinguished from the other B-accent in both phonetic realization and interpretation. They claim that this intonation is L*+HLH% in which the high peak is much more delayed than the other fall-rise intonation L+H*LH%. Regarding this particular intonation, different people claim different stories. In spite of the various kinds of claims on this particular intonation, its meaning associated with this intonation contour has not been precisely characterized, let alone formal analysis. And there are very few that views this fall-rise intonation as virtually the same thing as the other fall-rise intonation. Jackendoff (1972) views this as a B-accent. Taking the same position as Jackendoff, I propose that these two kinds of fall-rise intonation are just allophonic variation of essentially the same intonation contour, in that they both correspond to Korean contrastive topic marking"]},{"title":"nun","paragraphs":["and that they both can be accounted for by the same mechanism developed for the previous cases. If we assume that"]},{"title":"pie in","paragraphs":["(13b) is the same kind of contrastive topic marking as in (1 b) or (2b), everything goes well within our framework. Let us see how it works.","In this discourse, the semantic values of the question (13A) will be a set of two propositions that would be potential answers, that is {you have Jell-O, you don't have Jell-0}. Thus, the proper answer for this question would be picking up one member of the set. But, the answer (13B) is not a member of the set. What the fall-rise intonation does as the topic marker in (13B) is to reconstruct a larger d-topic which is a set of propositions containing (13B) as a member of it. So, the bigger question that could determine T' as a d-topic for this discourse context would be something like \"Do you have anything for desert?\". If we assume this is the larger question, then, the d-topic will be something like (14): 465","(14)T = {you (do not) have ul u3D & u3desere}, where [[desert]]={pie, ice-cream, Jell-0, ...} Given this d-topic, (13B) is narrowing down this d-topic into an s-topic which should look like the following (15): (15) {I have pie, I don't have pie} If we verbalize the pragmatic implication associated with (13B), it will be something like this: \"if the topic is 'pie' instead of the one previously mentioned, I do have it. But, I am not in a situation in which I can provide a positive answer for the item you asked about.\" One possible reason for the speaker not to provide the direct answer for the given question is that they don not have it but don not want to directly say it in order to be polite. .","Not only this example, all the other examples that Ward&Hirschberg presented can be explained in the same fashion, and each of them corresponds to Korean topic marking. Let us look at some more examples. The square brackets indicate the location of the fall-rise intonation.","(16) A: What time should I come tomorrow? B: 3:30. ... Can you come in at 3? A: I [can]. Should I?","\\t","0-1 su- nun isse.\\to- aya-toi? come way CONT there is come should","(17) A: Will Uncle Michael and Aunt Carolyn be coming to the rehearsal dinner?

Friday CON date SUB not BE 17il-un\\tkumyoil-I anya. date CON Friday SUB not BE All these examples can be explained by the formalism (12), while showing consistent correspondence between the L*+HLH % intonation and Korean nun marking. The commonness regarding contrastive topic marking that is shared by all of the above examples is the following: As represented in the diagrams in Figure 1 and 2, the contrastive topic pitch accent, B-accent, is licensed only when the discourse structure contains a residual topic as well as the B-accented topic, whether they are pre-established or accommodated. In other words, contrastive topic marking is legitimated only when the topic marked item is contrasted with some other possible topic candidates existing under the big question, d-topic. This is the discourse structure of contrastive topic in both Korean and English. 3. Conclusion 466 It is concluded that the information structure that can capture the meaning of contrastive topic is showing the following facts:","(i) Contrastive topic always"]},{"title":"presupposes","paragraphs":["a bigger questions, that is the d-topic according to Buering's terminology, which is represented by the root node in the provided diagrams.
