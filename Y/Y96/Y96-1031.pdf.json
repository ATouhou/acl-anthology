From this point of view, these utterances would be nothing but d̀isfluencies', some kind of 'noise'.","Yet we believe these utterances have important functions in discourse, comparable in many respects to what is called"]},{"title":"discourse markers.","paragraphs":["In this paper, we show that these utterances are indeed characterizable as discourse markers, and that they comprise a well-defined category, characterizable in a regular manner by their phonologico-prosodic properties.","These expressions are important because, among other things, they often provide informatiQn about the structure of discourse they occur in and about the speaker's intention or plan. Sidner 1985 states that discourse markers are necessary for recognizing the relations between the intended acts and the 297 overall plans of the speaker. A number of researchers have noticed the relation between discourse structure and intonational, or prosodic, characteristics. Grosz and Hirschberg 1992, using an independently motivated theory of discourse model, show that there are significant associations between intonational features and discourse structure. Similarly, Nakajima and Allen 1992 discuss the correlation between prosodic information and the topic structure of discourse. One of the first works to discuss the relation between discourse markers and prosody, in the context of discourse structure, is Hirschberg and Litman 1987. Based on a study of \"now\" in natural recorded discourse, Hirschberg and Litman propose that, in speech, intonational characteristics play a crucial role in distinguishing between cue and non-cue uses, helping to disambiguate the structure of a discourse.","We are interested in these Japanese discourse markers for various reasons. First of all, in order to understand and explain the language in actual use, one cannot avoid treating these phenomena. Secondly, they may have particular functions, not required in written language but specifically called for in its spoken counterpart. There are also fair indications that these expressions play crucial roles in determining discourse structures, especially with respect to units of surface discourse as well as of speech acts and planning (Kawamori"]},{"title":"et al.","paragraphs":["1994). Elucidating such roles can not only clarify syntactically relevant features of discourse but may shed light on intended meaning and other issues concerning pragmatics (Takubo 1994).","In addition to these theoretical interests, clarifying these phenomena may serve more practical purposes. For example, constructing a truly friendly human-machine interface would most likely require a systematic knowledge of these features. Conversely, the inability to handle these utterances would limit the capacity of an expert system (Pollack"]},{"title":"et al.","paragraphs":["1982), (Whittaker and Stenton 1988). A system without such an ability may fail to allow the user to participate in the reasoning process by not letting her think while the system is giving answers or questions, or to give the exact answer the user wants by not noticing her hesitation or surprise.","Attempts at clarifying Japanese discourse markers, however, have not so far been a major enterprise. Even their status as discourse markers itself has not been widely accepted, nor is there a general agreement as to what constitute the category. Moreover, much of what little effort made has been exerted to the acoustic aspects of these expressions, (Kobayashi"]},{"title":"et al.","paragraphs":["1993), and the qualitative aspects of these Japanese discourse markers have not hitherto received much attention. But phonological study is essential in clarifying the exact phonologico-prosodic nature of these expressions.","We investigate this aspect of Japanese discourse markers, looking specifically into their intonational patterns. We analyze the intonational features of discourse markers in naturally occurring utterances of Japanese. The assessment of our analysis and characterization is made using empirical data.","The paper is organized as follows. The first section introduces the Japanese tone features represented in terms of a Japanese variant of Tobi system. In the second section, we give a general introduction to Japanese discourse markers. There we discuss the phonological characteristics of responsives and fillers, our main concern in this paper. The third section describes the nature of the experiment we conducted, and the results we obtained. 298"]},{"title":"2 Japanese Tone Features","paragraphs":["We use as a framework for describing prosodic features of Japanese a system of notation essentially the same, with some modifications, as what is used by Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg 1990.","In this system, intonational contours are described as sequences of low and high tones in the 'fundamental frequency ("]},{"title":"fo)","paragraphs":["contour, viewed as the physical correlate of pitch. This manner of description is basically the same as what has been widely practiced in representing lexical accent patterns of Japanese (Sugito 1994). Thus our description of the Japanese prosody is essentially based on the two tone features, H and L, which correspond to a higher tone and a lower tone, respectively.","Although different in some respects from each other, English and Japanese share certain prosodic features (Beckman and Hirschberg 1986). A prominent example is the tone that indicates a major break between phrases. Such a tone is represented in our notation as L%. Another example of a case in which Japanese prosody is like that of English is probably the tone that indicates a request for information. This pattern of intonation is represented as H%. In addition to these two boundary tone symbols, we introduce two new tone symbols: H& and L&. These symbols represent tones that are 'intermediate' in the sense that H& is not quite as high as H% and L& not as low as L%.","In addition to the above features, the length of a vowel is also to be considered. In Japanese, the long vowel and its short counterpart are phonemically distinct so that a word with a short vowel is distinguished lexically from a corresponding word with a long vowel, as can be seen from"]},{"title":"obasan","paragraphs":["(aunt) and"]},{"title":"obaasan","paragraphs":["(grand mother). Hence we add the following four features concerning the lengths of vowels","in our inventory: • H+H (for a lengthened vowel at higher pitch), • L+L (for a lengthened vowel at lower pitch), • H- (for a short vowel with an abrupt stop at higher pitch), • L- (for a short vowel with an abrupt stop at lower pitch).","Notice that + and — are used in a different manner from the way they are meant by Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg 1990. With such an inventory of symbols for representation, we may describe the prosodic characteristics of Japanese discourse markers."]},{"title":"3 Japanese Discourse Markers","paragraphs":["In this section, we give a general introduction to Japanese discourse markers.","As was mentioned in the introduction, what are often called redundant, interjectory utterances, such as"]},{"title":"aizuchi,","paragraphs":["or back-channels, and hesitations are here regarded as part of the category of expressions generally called"]},{"title":"discourse markers.","paragraphs":["Schiffrin 1987 gives the operational definition of discourse markers as \"sequentially dependent elements which bracket units of talk\", units that include such entities as sentences, propositions, speech acts, and tone units, the exact nature of which she deliberately leaves vague. She also suggests that, 299 conversely, discourse markers themselves may define \"some yet undiscovered units of talk\".","There are other terms used for the expressions denoted by Schiffrin's discourse markers. A"]},{"title":"cue phrase","paragraphs":["is one of the most recent, and probably the most frequently used, ones. Other terms include 'clue word' and 'discourse particles'. They seem to refer to roughly the same set of linguistic expressions (in English).

Notice that Schiffrin's idea of discourse markers is more general than Hirschberg's and Litman's of cue phrases, in that the former is not necessarily limited to phrases or words and that units of talk are not directly related to explicit information about the structure of a discourse. Because the expressions in which we are interested in this paper are not phrases, we refer to them as discourse markers.","Unlike their English counterparts, Japanese discourse markers are mostly non-lexical; they are not generally regarded as comprising a well-defined category. For example, in English, such words as \"well\" and \"now\" not only function as discourse markers, but also have inherent status as full-fledged lexical items in dictionary. They are easily recognized as 'words'.

They are conventionally grouped into interjections, that wastebasket category. The traditional view on these expressions is succinctly summarized in the words of Martin 1975, who says that \"these elements stand outside the domain of the well-formed sentence itself.\"","Another consequence of this fact is that the disambiguation between lexical and non-lexical uses, or that between non-cue and cue usages, of words used as discourse markers does not constitute a particularly urgent problem in Japanese. On the other hand, the question of distinguishing among the different functions born by discourse markers becomes important."]},{"title":"3.1 Types of Japanese Discourse Markers","paragraphs":["Although there is no received categorization, Japanese discourse markers can be roughly grouped into four categories: fillers, responsives, sentence final particles, and conjunctives and other adverbial expressions.
