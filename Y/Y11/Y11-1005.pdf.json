This paper investigates the effect of quantification in sentence processing. The experimental results show that temporarily ambiguous sentences that begin with the universally quantified NPs reduced the garden path effect in contrast to the ones that begin with bare NPs. This fact is accounted for by assuming that discourse representation structures are incrementally constructed, and a tripartite structure introduced by the universal quantifier gives a room for temporal ambiguity while a single box associated with a bare NP forces one interpretation and to get the correct interpretation, the single box must be rewritten, which results in the garden path effect.

To get the correct interpretation, the VP preceding otoko-ni ‘man- DAT’ must be construed as (part of) the relative clause modifying that NP, and the first NP must be construed as the subject of the sentence-final V itta ‘said’.

To account for the GP effect reduction in a TAS which begins with a universally quantified NP, we propose an incremental sentence processing algorithm under the framework of discourse representation theory (DRT). The DRT that we follow here is the standard one as proposed in Kamp and Reyle (1993) with one crucial difference. The standard DRT assumes that discourse representation structure (DRS) is constructed based on syntactic structure, which means they are built after syntactic parsing. In our model, in contrast, DRSs are constructed phrase-by-phrase, independently of syntactic parsing.","Let us begin with the standard definition of DRS and the operation of box merger.","(6) Box Merger <D1 , C1 > ⊗ <D2 , C2 > = <D1 ∪ D2 , C1 ∪ C2 > A DRS K is a pair of a set of discourse referents D and a set of conditions C, represented as K = <D, C>. This pair is also called a box. A box combines with the preceding one by the inter-sentential merger operator ⊗, which takes the union of the sets of discourse referents and the union of the sets of conditions as given in (6) above (Bos et al., 1994).","With this operation, a discourse representation proceeds, as shown in (7), where u and v are discourse referents and ‘u = John’, ‘u came in’, ‘v = Mary’, and ‘v left’ are conditions. 4 (7) John came in. (And) Mary left.","u u = John u came in ⊗","v","v = Mary v left =","u v u = John u came in v = Mary v left (Inter-sentential Merging) We assume that all lexical items are translated into a box notation. For example, the name John is translated into [u : u = John] and the adjective rich is translated into [ : λx[rich(x)] ]. These two boxes are then combined by the intra-sentential merging. 3 Kurafuji et al. (2007) examined the effect of NP types on the degree of GP effect. According to them, the sentence begins with demostrative NP sono keekan-ga ‘that police.officer- NOM’ also has less GP effect than (2), but the status of the sentence with existentially quantified NP aru keekan-ga ‘a certain police.officer- NOM’ is not clear since there was no significant diffrence of reading time between such a sentence and the other types of sentences. 4 We also use a box notation with brackets as in [u: u = John, u came in] as well as a representation like (7).

The inter-sentential merging ⊗ applies across a sentence boundary, while the intra-sentential merging ⊗ applies only in a sentence. The latter applies incrementally from left-to-right.","The λ-formula in conditions is combined with the discourse referent u by λ-reduction. 5"]},{"title":"4 Incremental Building of DRSs 4.1 The GP Effect","paragraphs":["The lexical items and their box-translations relevant to our discussion are given in table 1.

The second NP also gives another discourse referent and its condition in another box, as in (10b), and then the two boxes intra-sententially merge, as in (10c). The verb tsukamaeta ‘caught’ also introduces another box with an event argument e, and merges to the preceding box as in (10d). Here we propose that the DRS construction algorithm is subject to the following preference rule as a parsing strategy.","(11) The Locality Preference of λ-Reduction Reduce λ-operators in conditions in box K with (i) the discourse referents in K, or (ii) discourse referents in boxes accessible from them, if there is no discourse referent","available in the box. (11) says that the λ-reduction with a discourse referent in the local box is preferred to the same operation with one in a non-local box. It is worth noting that since (11) is a preference rule, it can be violated if a requirement by another principle forces it to be. In (10d), the box has two discourse referents of individual type, u and v, and the rule (11) requires that these discourse referents serve as arguments of tsukamaeta ‘caught’, yielding (12) below. (12) [e, u, v: police-officer(u), criminal(v), catching(e), agent(u, e), theme(v, e)] DRS (12) means “a police officer caught a criminal.”","Here we assume that the lexical relation between NPs and V and the information of case-markers determine which discourse referent bears the AGENT role and which bears the THEME role. For example, the nominative NP tends to bear the agent role and the accusative NP tends to bear the theme role, and so on. We also assume that after all λ-operators are replaced, the conjunction ‘ ∧’ are deleted in representations.","Now what happens when the third NP otoko-ni ‘man- DAT’ shows up? This NP introduces a new discourse referent in a single box, which intra-senentially merges to box (12), as in (13).","(13) [e, u, v: police-officer(u), criminal(v), catching(e), agent(u, e), theme(v, e)] ⊗ [r: man(r)] = [e, u, v, r: police-officer(u), criminal(v), catching(e), agent(u, e), theme(v, e), man(r)] The DRS (13) itself has nothing wrong in principle but it is not favored in processing. One of the possibilities for making (13) intelligible is to yield the reading “a police officer caught a criminal and there is a man.” However, to get such an interpretation, man(r) should be associated with an event argument, and the discourse referent r must be linked to a theme role, as in theme(r, e’), where e’ is an event argument different from e. In other words, man(r) itself is a well-formed condition, but without an event argument it is not a well-formed event-semantic proposition.","Another possibility is to regard it as an intermediate stage of a DRS of a sequence of sentences as in (14) below, where the dative NP is considered to be the first phrase in the second sentence.","(14) # Keekan-ga police.officer- NOM hanni-o criminal- ACC tsukamaeta. caught Otoko-ni man- DAT . . . ‘A police officer caught a/the criminal. To a/the man, . . .’ However the sequence of sentences in (14) itself sounds quite strange. To improve the sequence, a connective such as soshite ‘and’ should be inserted between the two sentences, maybe for the indication of a sentence boundary to introduce the inter-sentential merging operator ⊗. So the possibility of interpreting (13) as a sequence of sentences should also be rejected.","The last possibility is to interpret (13) as part of an incomplete sentence.

But here is the problem. In (12) the agent slot of tsukamaeta ‘caught’ has already been filled in by u associated with keekan-ga ‘police.officer- NOM’, so that there is no thematic role for otoko-ni ‘man- DAT’. In order for otoko-ni ‘man- DAT’ to be part of a sentence, the DRS (12) must be reconstructed, going back to the prior stage (10d). This is the cause of the GP effect.","The important point here is that in (10d), where the box translation of tsukamaeta ‘caught’ is merged, the λ-operators in λyλx[catching(e) ∧ agent(x, e) ∧ theme(y, e)] are replaced with the discourse referents u and v. One might ask what is wrong if λ-reduction does not apply at the stage (10d), and waits for another discourse referent (in this case r associated with otoko-ni ‘man- DAT’), and after its arrival does the λ-operator bind x with its new discourse referent r, as in (15).","(15) [e, u, v: police-officer(u), criminal(v), λyλx[catching(e) ∧ agent(x, e) ∧ theme(y, e)] ] ⊗ [r: man(r)] ⇒ [e, u, v, r: police-officer(u), criminal(v), λy[catching(e) ∧ agent(r, e) ∧ theme(y, e)],","man(r)] ⇒ [e, u, v, r: police-officer(u), criminal(v), catching(e), agent(r, e), theme(v, e), man(r)] If this option were taken, the GP effect would not be observed.

In order to account for the GP effect in the present approach, we propose another processing strategy, given in (16).","(16) The Early Completion Strategy Make a DRS complete as early as possible, where a complete DRS is a DRS which does not contain a λ-operator. The strategy (16) forces the λ-operators in conditions to be replaced with the discourse referents in the same box as early as possible. The idea behind (16) is that a parser tries to reduce λ-operators as soon as a verb shows up in Japanese. In other words, by (16) the NPs that immediately precede a verb are interpreted as arguments of that verb as long as the NPs’ case information is compatible with the verb’s argument structure. Given this strategy, the derivation in (15) is not allowed, since the two λ-operators remain not to be replaced in spite of the fact that they should have been replaced with u and v at the prior stage.","Now let us see how the rest of the sentence (9) is processed and the DRS is constructed.","(17) a.

Then the discourse referent associated with otoko-ni ‘man- DAT’ is introduced; it bears the agent role of tsukamaeta ‘caught’ as (17b). The boxes associated with ree-o ‘thanks- ACC’ and itta ‘said’ intra-sententially merge to DRSs in (17b) and (17c), respectively, resulting in (17d), the literal translation of which is “a police officer said thanks to the man who caught a criminal.”"]},{"title":"46 4.2 The Quantification Effect Case","paragraphs":["Next, let us consider the incremental derivation of the sentence (2), repeated as (18).","(18) Subeteno all keekan-ga police.officer- NOM","[VP hanni-o criminal- ACC tsukamaeta caught ] otoko-ni man- DAT ree-o thank- ACC itta. said ‘All police officers extended their thanks to a/the man who caught a criminal.’ The universal quantifier (Q) subeteno ‘all’ is translated into the complex DRS as shown in (19).

Given the usual translation of a universal quantifier λQλP∀x[P(x) → Q(x)], in which the antecedent and the consequent clauses share the same variable x, it seems reasonable to assume that the two subordinate boxes in (19) share the same variable in their conditions when a universal quantifier is translated into its box notation.","However, we do not take this position. In our approach such a cooccurrence of u’s is underspecified in the lexicon and the desirable result comes from something else such as the requirement of the ban on vacuous quantification, which requires that both the restrictive clause and the nuclear scope contain the same variable bound by the quantifier. We assume that there is a more limited version of this requirement in Japanese semantic processing, as given in (22).","(22) The Ban on Vacuous Quantification (a version of Japanese semantic processing) A variable introduced in the left sub-box by the tripartite structure rule must also appear in the right sub-box."]},{"title":"47","paragraphs":["In (21) the variable introduced in the left sub-box by the tripartite structure rule (20) is u, and the ban on vacuous quantification (22) requires that u should appear in the right sub-box.

In (24), the object is a bare NP and the wide scope reading of the object bare NP is easy to obtain as well as the wide scope reading of the Q NP subject. Likewise, sentences like (18) are ambiguous between the wide scope reading of the Q NP subject and that of the dative bare NP. The question is then what interpretation the participants in Kurafuji et al.’s (2007) experiment actually obtained.","In DRT, the scope ambiguity between a universally quantified NP and an existentially quantified NP is unambiguously represented, depending on where the discourse referent associated with the existentially quantified NP is introduced.

In what follows, just for the sake of presentation, we assume that the participants in their experiment interpreted sentences like (24) is interpreted as “There is a criminal such that all police officers caught her/him together,” since this kind of interpretation seems the easiest to obtain.6","The interpretation such as “all police officer caught a criminal together” can be represented by assuming that the discourse referent denoting an event of the sub-box is projected to the main box, as schematized in (25).7 (25) [main box : . . .

To account for this fact, we developed the new incremental DRS building algorithm under the framework of DRT (Kamp and Reyle, 1993), in which each lexical item is translated into a box-notation and such a box intra-sententially merges to another box from left to right.","When the subject is a bare NP, a single box is introduced, and boxes introduced by the second NP and the verb are combined with this single box, constituting a new single box. If the argument structure of the verb is saturated in this single box, there is no room for a new intra-sententially merged discourse referent. This is the cause of the GP effect. When the subject has a quantifier like subeteno ‘all’, on the other hand, a complex DRS is introduced, which provides a room for a new discourse referent, and thus the GP effect does not take place.","We also proposed two parsing strategies; the locality preference of λ-reduction and the early completion strategy. The effects of these strategies are similar to the effect of the minimal attachment (Frazier and Fodor, 1978). However, a syntactic approach with the minimal attachment cannot account for the fact that the universal quantifier reduces the GP effect. So our incremental DRT approach is different from a syntactic approach though they assume the similar strategies."]},{"title":"49","paragraphs":["Our approach can apply to some cases that we did not address in the paper. One is concerned with the interpretation of the Japanese topic marker wa. Inoue (1991) reported with a different experimental setting that the GP effect reduces when wa is used in the initial NP instead of the nominative case marker ga. If our account is on the right track, the fact suggsts that the topic-marked NP introduces a tripartite structure as [u: P(u)] ⇒ TOPIC [u: Q(u)], which roughly says “for the topic u, if u has the property P, it also has the property Q.” The functional similarity between conditionals and topic expressions has been pointed out in the literature (e.g. Haiman (1978) among others). Our approach thus hacks up such an idea with the experimental results.","We did not go into detail on other quantified NPs with an existantial quantifier like aru keekan ‘a police officer’ and numeral quantifier like san-nin-no keekan ‘three police officers.’ The status of the sentence begins with the former is not clear since there was no significant diffrence of reading time between such a sentence and the sentence with universal quantifier. Regarding the sentence with the latter, we have not conducted any experiments. We will leave the experiments and analyses of these quantifiers for future work."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Bever, T. 1970. The Cognitive Basis for Linguistic Structures.
