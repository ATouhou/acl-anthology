This paper provides a construction grammar perspective to identifying the ambiguity of prepositional phrase (PP) attachments (i.e., whether a PP is attached to the closest VP or NP1). Despite the wide discussion of these two structures (VP-attached and NP1-attached), we raise the possibility for a third parsing structure (about 11.3% from all 1845 instances analyzed), a co-attachment to both verb and noun. A co-attachment structure denotes the lack of [movement] feature in both the verb and noun surrounding a PP. This proposal is arrived when we annotate the semantic feature [-movement] to both VP and NP1, respectively, in a caused-motion construction of V NP1 into NP2 (e.g., vote an individual into the presidency; shamed us into pity; define ourselves into a box).

An example of motion event is the caused-motion construction involving a verb (V) and two noun phrases (NP1 and NP2) as a direct and an indirect object, respectively. Sentence (1), extracted from the Penn Treebank Wall Street Journal (WSJ) Corpus1","(Charniak, et al., 2000), illustrates such a V NP1 into NP2 construction (shown in bold with lexical categories glossed underneath). The basic semantics of the construction involves a motion event that requires the direct object (NP1) to be moved and directed to the confinement of indirect object (NP2). In this case, an unspecified number of airplanes undergo movement towards a deictic space. (1) To shove even more airplanes into this space is asking for trouble, V NP1 Prep NP2 experts say. (WSJ-V1141) However, this type of prepositional phrases poses an ambiguity problem in parsing. Sentence (1) serves as an example for one means of parsing in which the preposition closely associates with the verb but not NP1. The second possibility of parsing is where the PP is required to be interpreted with NP1, as illustrated in bold in sentence (2).","  * The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their comments on this work.

V NP1 Prep NP2 Here the head of NP1 (a flow) is to be interpreted along with into and NP2 (his account), rather than with the preceding verb (to show). Computational linguists have found these two structures causing parsing problems in natural language processing (NLP) and referred to this problem of determining the site of PP to be attached as the PP attachment problem (e.g., Hindle and Rooth, 1993; Volk, 2006). As illustrated in (1) and (2), this problem is conventionally formalized as a binary choice (Merlo and Ferrer, 2005), either verb-attached for (1) or noun-attached for (2). In the minimalist syntax, ternary structures like (3a) are to be transformed by deriving an explicit causative construction (3b) (Radford, 2004). The operation involves raising of the verb roll to join the causative verb made to adhere to a binary operation. (3a) He rolled the ball down the hill. V NP1 Prep NP2  (3b) He made + roll the ball (roll) down the hill. V-causative + V NP1 trace Prep NP2 (Radford, 2004, p. 337, with gloss added) Although the plausibility of equating the two constructions has long been questioned (e.g., Fodor, 1970), the causative structure (3b) cannot provide a direct solution to the PP attachment problem for (3a). Moreover, the binary solution to the problem has been challenged by computational linguists. For example, Merlo and Ferrer (2005) contend that such a dichotomous treatment may be a simplification. They propose to take into account of the nature of the attachment by distinguishing PP arguments from PP adjuncts. Sentence (4) is an example of two verb-attached PPs that maintain different relationships with the verb shown in the gloss. (4) Put the block on the table in the morning. V NP1 PP argument PP adjunct (Merlo and Ferrer, 2005, p. 342, with gloss added) Since PP arguments carry the core message and PP adjuncts provide additional information to the core meaning, their distinction further refines NLP tasks. Although studies like Merlo and Ferrer (2005) provide novel approaches to tackle the PP attachment problem, the notion of binary sites for PP attachment has not been scrutinized. The presupposition of binary attachment sites, however, may result in a forced selection from one of the two choices and may overlook other possibilities for correct parsing. Consider the construction in bold in sentence (5) for determining the PP attachment site. (5) Frank sneezed the tissue off the table V NP1 Prep NP2 (Goldberg, 1995, p. 152, with gloss added) According to our first choice, verb-attached parsing, the verb sneezed is to be analyzed with NP1 the tissue. The grouping is semantically invalid since the verb is normally intransitive without a direct object. Yet, it is not any less awkward as the noun-attached option is considered (the tissue off the table). In Goldberg’s (1995) seminal work on construction grammar, she discusses the basic semantics of caused-motion construction or that “the causer argument directly causes the theme argument to move along a path designated by the directional phrase: that is, ‘X CAUSES Y to MOVE Z’” (p. 152). In brief, the caused-motion construction includes a directional phrase like into PP and entails a movement feature. However, (5) illustrates an atypical example of caused-motion construction where the construction fails to be interpreted through its components or what the PP attachment problem is based on. According to Goldberg, the semantic meaning of (5) can only be derived by taking into account of the entire construction. In other words, to address the PP attachment issue in sentences like (5), we need to 608 take into account of a third possible structure in addition to a binary choice from verb- or noun-attachment.2"," In this study, we take the construction grammar approach to reformalize the PP attachment problem. In addition to the conventional binary approach to determining the PP attachment sites, we suggest a third possible structure where the PP co-attaches to both verb and noun based on the construction grammar framework. We also develop a semantic analysis of the feature movement (denoted as [+movement] or [-movement]) for the verb and direct object in the V NP1 into NP2 construction to determine the PP attachment site. Our proposal examines the WSJ corpus data by means of manual annotation."]},{"title":"2 A Semantic Feature Classification","paragraphs":["From our preliminary observations of the WSJ data, we noticed that the notion of movement is closely correlated to the verb and first noun in the V NP1 into NP2 construction, and the observation can be confirmed by the semantic meaning of the preposition into. According to Tyler and Evans (2003), the ‘proto-scene’, or illustration of the primary sense in spatial configuration, of into involves NP1 (figure) being outside NP2 (ground) and then entering the boundary of NP2. The movement feature is a distinctive feature for into to be distinguished from in as the latter expresses a locative sense. As the notion of path is encoded by the preposition, the parsing structure may reflect our proclivity to associate the notion of path with that of movement. We therefore hypothesize that the feature [±movement] can be used to determine the PP attachment site as summarized in Table 1.  Table 1: Hypotheses for determining PP-attachment sites from [±movement] specification at V","and NP1. [±movement] Hypotheses V NP1 + - Expected specification for verb-attached PP structure. - + Expected specification for noun-attached PP structure. - - Expected specification for co-attachment structure. + + Undetermined.  Table 1 demonstrates the four possible outcomes after specifying [±movement] at V and NP1, each elaborated below. Constructions (in bold) in (6) and (7) exemplify verb and noun attachment, respectively, and the feature is specified in plus or minus sign for each lexical item in gloss. (6) They threatened to crash the jet into Kuwait's royal palace. (WSJ-V924) V [+] NP [-] PP  (7) He describes his launch into American society In 1962,... (WSJ-V245) V [-] NP [+] PP It is not difficult to see that the concept of path encoded in the PPs is more semantically coherent when interpreted with [+movement] sites such as the verb crash in (6) and the noun his launch in (7). In contrast, when the potential attachment site is [-movement] like the NP the jet in (6) or the verb describe in (7), there is no strong semantic association with the PP. However, the binary distinction of verb and noun attachment sites is not sufficient to capture the parsing of  2 Such treatment appears to be in common with approaches that accommodate ternary branching such as Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar or HPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1994), or proponents like Jackendoff (2002) and Carrier and Randall (1992). In contrast to the other approaches, this study stresses the entirety of construction in which causative meaning of non-causative verbs can be derived as in the case of sneezed in (5). In addition, much earlier work concentrated on the analysis of ternary branching resultative constructions (e.g., Carrier & Randall, 1992; Wechsler & Noh, 2001). To the best of our knowledge, the results have not been applied to tackling the PP attachment problem. 609 some instances like (8). Sentence (8) exemplifies an unconventional caused-motion construction like those described by Goldberg (1995). (8) Watching the weekend spectacle, we return to the thought that the next U.S. President and","the rest of the West's leaders should keep in mind that their primary responsibility is not to baptize the Soviet Union into Western civilization. (WSJ-V30) V [-] NP [-] PP The verb baptize is commonly used in passive voice and is an unaccusative verb with its object as the argument. Yet, in sentence (8) we found a transitive use followed by a direction prepositional phrase. A semantic feature of movement can only be construed when the entire construction V NP1 into NP2 is processed simultaneously. This is the basis of our contention that in addition to previous two sites to attach PP, a co-attachment structure is required. The last feature category [+, +] is the most complicated one among the four. Consider sentences (9) and (10). Complication arises as the intensity of [+movement] could vary and compete between the verb and noun that would result in a differential reading. For example, sentence (9) demonstrates a stronger sense of movement in the verb that results in a verb-attachment interpretation. On the contrary, sentence (10) posits a stronger feature in the noun that results in a noun-attached reading. In addition, the rate of V-NP or NP-PP occurrence may also interfere with the feature reading.

(WSJ-V1337) V [+] NP [+] PP However, the determination of feature strength is subjective which requires a more objective approach such as cognitive experiments to be conclusive; therefore, we designate this category as ‘undetermined’."]},{"title":"3 Categorization Procedures","paragraphs":["The extracted WSJ corpus data were analyzed manually to identify the semantic category for all words in the lexical categories, V and NP1. According to Fellbaum (1990), there are 15 files or semantic domains of verbs in WordNet all of which are listed in Table 2 except for weather. The online WordNet Search 3.1 was used to identify the category of each verb by selecting “show all” in Display Options for each search word (Figure 1). The categorization fits our purpose of identifying the presence or absence of the semantic feature [±movement]. We based our judgment from the senses listed in the Oxford Online Dictionary (http://oxforddictionaries.com/) for into, except for the addition of two domains, body and possession, in Fallbaum. Table 2 summaries the semantic domains that reflect the [± movement] feature with examples. In Figure 1, the verb induct is used as an example to show the display of search results. While induct has at least five senses, the senses fall into three semantic domains, as designated in < >, namely, social, creation and communication. For each instance from the WSJ corpus, the sense of the verb was identified first by one of the authors and then matched to the WordNet search results. For example, the meaning of induct in sentence (11) is introduce, thereby assigning communication (sense five above) for categorization. (11) Typically, Mr. Grace inducts his Catholic recruits into the Knights of Malta and","encourages their participation in charity. (WSJ-V855) However, if the WordNet result did not have a match with the verb under search, dictionaries (e.g., Merriam-Webster online dictionary and Collins English Dictionary) were consulted. In total, there were 30 verbs (1.6%) (mainly words with prefixes such as reopen and unimpede) consulted dictionaries for their categories.  610 Table 2: Semantic Categories of Verbs (Fallbaum, 1990).

Different criteria were used for 611 categorizing nouns. The nouns in our constructions were grouped manually into six major categories. The [+movement] feature is found in the following three domains: movement (e.g., verb derivations like continuation, delivery and expansion), route/entry (e.g., way, window) and psychological/cognitive path (e.g., insight, inquiry, research). Most of the [+movement] nouns were easily identified as they are closely related to their morphological counterparts in the verb category (e.g., discharge, investigation, immigration and investment). The [-movement] nouns can be found under another three domains: entity (e.g., physical objects), abstraction (e.g., temporal and spatial concepts), group/person (e.g., name entities and pronouns)."]},{"title":"4 The Corpus","paragraphs":["The annotated Penn Treebank WSJ corpus was used for data analysis. Two sub-corpora that contain the V NP1 into NP2 were extracted based on the built-in annotation: verb-attached structure ((VP NP1)(into NP2))3","and noun-attached structure ((VP)(NP1 into NP2))4",". All the data were converted into Excel files for further processing. First, those instances without an NP (labeled as ‘None’ in WSJ) were excluded. Second, to provide a full coverage of verbs, only one instance per lexeme was selected for manual semantic analysis. For example, there are in total 29 instances of the V NP1 into NP2 construction for the lemma absorb (four for absorb, 22 for absorbed, and three for absorbing). Only one instance of each lexical form (absorb, absorbed and absorbing) was analyzed. In addition, instances which do not have a PP attached to either the verb or head noun in NP1 were manually eliminated. Sentence (12) exemplifies such a case as into is neither attached to V (sympathizes) nor NP1 (a bit), but rather to another NP (Belushi’s escape) subsumed under NP1.

In addition to the conventional approach that makes a 613 binary choice between verb- and noun-attached sites, we propose a third possible parsing structure that requires a co-attachment to both the verb and noun. By exploiting the linguistic properties of caused-motion construction, we propose the use the semantic feature [movement] to parse tree structure. The co-attached structure lacks the [movement] feature at both V and NP1 because the sense of motion resides in the construction per se rather than being imposed on the attachment sites. The results indicate that 11.3% (208 instances) of the 1835 types of verbs in V NP1 into NP2 constructions extracted from the WSJ corpus are co-attached. It is therefore worthy of further consideration in NLP tasks involving PP-attachment.","However, there are some limitations to the feature specification approach of this study. First, more stringent criteria for feature annotation are necessary. For example, some words in communication, cognition and social interaction domains denote rhetorical forces (e.g., entice, allure, pressure) and their movement feature may have been overlooked. Furthermore, refinement on the undermined category [+, +] is necessary to provide more accurate figures to support our approach. Future work should also include analysis of the nouns in depth, and extend the results of this study to other prepositions and PPs in other constructions.",""]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Carrier, J. and J.
