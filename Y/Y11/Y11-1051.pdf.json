With the increasing numbers of the arrivals to the Arabian countries; it is necessary to use Arabic language in writing names on official documents. Because of the difference in writing English names in Arabic language, many methods have been spread for translating English names which led to first, duplication in every single English name written in Arabic and this will lead to negative effects security and property rights. The second difference is that even if the transliteration of Arabic names is standardized, it is difficult for a layperson to implement it. This paper is to provide algorithms based on some rules that can be used in programming a system to transliterate English names automatically. The system uses only plan for Translate English Names to Arabic, and that can be processed and printed easily. Moreover, the Translated names can be read and recognized by ordinary people.

In our work, a set of hand-crafted transformations for locally editing the phonemic spelling of an English word to conform to rules of Arabic syllabification are used to seed a transformation-based learning algorithm. The algorithm examines some data and learns the proper sequence of application of the transformations to convert an English phoneme sequence to a Arabic syllable sequence. Our paper describes a data driven counterpart to this technique, in which a cascade model is used to go from English names to Arabic transliteration. The system uses only plan for Translate English Names to Arabic, and that can be processed and printed easily. Moreover, the Translated names can be read and recognized by ordinary people. This paper also discusses the problem background and provides solutions to Arabize almost all English Names. In section 2, we briefly highlight some related works. In section 3, we introduce description of translation system. In section 4, some specific phonotactic rules are shown. In section 5, the evaluation experiment for auto transliteration is presented. Finally, in Section 6, we draw some concluding remarks."]},{"title":"2 Related Works","paragraphs":["Transliteration has been of interest to researchers in automatic lexicon creation and cross-language information retrieval involving radical differences in writing systems, such as English/Arabic, English/Korean, English/ Chinese and Japanese/English.

Then the English pronunciation symbols are mapped to Arabic phonetic using a mapping table between the English phonetic characters. Then the Arabic phonetic sequences are mapped into diacritized Arabic name. Each diacritized symbol is mapped to the corresponding character. In Arabic language, the scripts are written right-to-left (RTL), so the system also manipulates the text direction. Finally, The Arabic name is represented without the Arabic diacritization."]},{"title":"3.1 English Name to English Phone","paragraphs":["There are two general methods to mapping English names stored in the Database which contains over 133 thousand names to phonetic representations. The simplest one, if lexicon exists translating each name to its phonetic representations, then one can simply look up the corresponding phonetic stored in the Database which contains 84 symbols. However, this method will not work if a name is not existed. A more general method is to use a model of the English syllables to the phonetic sequences, and to choose the sequences that maximize the occurrence. In our model, we translated the names with known pronunciations from a pronunciation dictionary. We also used the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) Speech Pronunciation Dictionary which applies 39 phonemes, each written as a sequence of Latin symbols (Carnegie Mellon University Project, 2007). We obtain the following English phonetic as an example for the name Obama:","OBAMA −→ OW2-B-AA1-M-AH0","Where each phone is separated by a hyphen ”-”. The CMU dictionary also provides the name representation since this seemed to be the most common pronunciation (Yan et al., 2003)."]},{"title":"3.2 English Phone to Diacritized Arabic Phone","paragraphs":["For mapping from an English phonetic existed in the CMU dictionary to an Arabic phonetic representation, we used phonotactic rules for mapping from English sounds to Arabic sounds. First, the system should map the English phonetic symbols to the Diacritized Arabic Phonetic symbols which a scan has been made for the universal phonetic symbols for (vowels), and linked it with the audio symbols for Vowels in Arabic so that we can convert the English names to the universal phonetic symbols, and then convert the universal phonetic symbols to the Arabic phonetic symbol. An obvious target inventory is the Arabic syllabary itself, shown in Table 1 as the short vowel symbols which are typically not written. Short vowels may be written with diacritics placed above or below the consonant that precedes them in the syllable, called harakat or diacritics. All Arabic vowels, long and short, follow a consonant; in Arabic, words like ”Ali” or ”alif”.","In the fully vocalized Arabic text found in texts such as Quran, a long ā following a consonant other than a hamzah is written with a short a sign (fatah) on the consonant plus an alif after it; long is written as a sign for short i (kasrah) plus a ya ; and long ū as a sign for short u (ammah) plus a waw. Briefly, a","a = ā, i","y = ī and u","w =ū. Long ā following a hamzah may be represented by an alif maddah or by a free hamzah followed by an alif (Wikipedia)."]},{"title":"486 Table 1:","paragraphs":["The values of Long and Short Vowels in Arabic","Symbols Name Trans.

The table also shows illustrative examples of the vowel usage. Table 2: The phoneme set","The regular Arabic short vowels are /AE/. /IH/, and /UH/ corresponding to the Arabic diacritical marks Fatha, Kasra and Damma, respectively. The /AA/ is the pharyngealized allophone of /AE/. Similarly, the /IX/ and /UX/ are the pharyngealized allophones of /IH/ and /UH/ respectively. When /AE/ appears before an emphatic letter, its allophone /AH/ is used instead. The regular Arabic long vowel allophones are /AE:/ /IY/ and /UW/ respectively. The length of a long vowel is normally equal to two short vowels. The allophones /AY/ and /AW/ are actually two vowel sounds in which the articulators move from one post to another. These vowels are called Diphthongs. The allophone /AY/ appears when a Fatha comes before an undiacritized Yeh. Similarly, /AW/ appears when a Fatha comes before an undiacritized Waw. The Arabic voiced stops phonemes /B/ and /D/ are similar to their English counter parts. /DD/ corresponds to the sound of the Arabic Dhad letter. The Arabic voiceless stops /T/ and /K/ are basically similar to their English counter parts. The sound of the Arabic emphatic letter Qaf is represented by the phone /Q/. The Hamza plosive sound is represented by the phone /E/, and the sound of Jeem (in many dialects) is represented by /G/. The voiceless fricatives are produced with no vibration of the voice cords (Mohamed, et al., 2007).

Each rule tries to match certain conditions on the context of the letter and provide a replacement from the phoneme list. Replacements can be one or more phonemes. Some letters dont have an effect on pronunciation or, depending on context, they might not be pronounced; in this case, the replacement will be empty (Mohamed et al., 2007).

The left hand side of the rule is pre-replacement and each letter in the pre-replacement is referenced by its name as defined in the Unicode standard. Multiple classes are defined to simplify the rules syntax. The right hand side of the rule defines the post-replacement, which can either be a phoneme or a sequence of phonemes from the phoneme list, or the letter might not have a matching phoneme and will be omitted from pronunciation.","Table 3: Symbols used in the Phonotactic Rules","Symbol Significance Symbol Significance / # Beginning of the word ( ) Character between brackets optional # / End of the word [ ] It corresponds to another character C & V Consonant & Short Vowels −→ Become","Character of the applicable rules Cn A series of consonants"]},{"title":"4.1 First Rule","paragraphs":["Short vowels can be normal ones or either emphatic or pharyngeal, depending on the surrounding letters.
