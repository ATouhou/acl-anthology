We propose a system for flexibly judging the misusage of honorifics in Japanese sentence. The system can point out misused words and phrases, and can also indicate how they are misused. The system uses judgment rules whose degrees of validity in modern Japanese society are quantified by psychological experiments. The system can judge sentences flexibly based on the learner's linguistic level by tuning thresholds regarding the degree of validity. The proposed system is expected to be applied in practical computer-aided education.

There are few languages in which such linguistic honorifics are as highly developed as Japanese.","One important function of linguistic honorifics is to awaken in each person a consciousness of the social-relationship among speakers, listeners, and individuals being addressed or referred to. Here, social-relationship is assumed to be represented by a combination of {relative social position among in the people in same group} and {in-group/out-group relationship} in our study.","The correct usage of honorific expressions is indispensable to maintain appropriate social distance between individuals and assists smooth communication in Japanese society.","Recently, however, increasing misusage of honorific expressions has been noted. One origin of such misusage may be poor education regarding linguistic honorifics. So, development of a computer-aided learning system for linguistic honorifics has been needed.","Recently, Shirado (2007) proposed a system to judge the misusage of honorific expressions in Japanese. The system uses judgment rules constructed from textbooks of Japanese honorifics. However, these textbooks are not necessarily consistent with the awareness among the people regarding normative honorific expressions in modern Japanese society. Most of these textbooks 25th Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation, pages 503–510 503   are based on traditional studies even though linguistic norms change over time. So, more practical system to learn linguistic honorifics is needed. In this paper, we propose a system to flexibly judge the misusage of honorific expressions in Japanese sentences. This system uses the framework of the system proposed by Shirado, but our system is more practical than the previous one due to the following points: 1. The judgment rules are generalized. 2. The degrees of the validity of rules are quantified. 3. Judgments are performed flexibly based on the learner's linguistic level."]},{"title":"2 Misusage of Japanese Honorific Expressions 2.1 Types of the Japanese Honorific Expressions","paragraphs":["Japanese honorific expressions can be divided into the following types:","Sonkeigo (in Japanese) shows respect toward a person, who is usually the subject of sentence's predicate, by elevating the person's status. Sonkeigo principally includes: (1) such honorific titles as \"san\"/\"sama,\" (2) respectful forms of verbs, (3) verb stems + auxiliary verbs, and (4) \"o\"/ \"go\" (prefixes) + verb stems + auxiliary verbs.","Kenjougo-I (in Japanese) shows respect toward a person, who is usually the object of the sentence's predicate, by humbling the speaker or the predicate's subject. Kenjougo-I principally includes: (1) humble forms of verbs, (2) verb stems + auxiliary verbs, and (3) \"o\"/\"go\" (prefixes) + verb stems + auxiliary verbs.","Kenjougo-II (or Teichougo) (in Japanese) shows politeness, but not necessarily respect, toward the listener by using humbling form of predicates regarding the speaker's action etc. Kenjougo-II includes \"mousu\"/\"mairu\"/ \"itasu,\" etc.","Teineigo (in Japanese) shows politeness, but not necessarily respect, toward a person, who is usually the listener. Teineigo includes an auxiliary verb at the end of a sentence, such as \"desu\"/\"masu\"/\"gozaimasu,\" etc.","Table 1 show examples of morphemes corresponding to each honorific type.","","Table 1: Honorific type.","Morphemes Honorific type","\"A\" \"san\"","\"B\" \"sama\" honorific title of person A honorific title of person B","\"osharu\" verb stem \"rareru\"","\"o\" verb stem \"kudasaru\"","\"go\" verb stem \"kudasaru\" verb stem \"itasu\" \"o\" verb stem \"suru\" \"go\" verb stem \"suru\"","\"mousu\"","\"go\" \"suru\" \"te\" \"kudasaru\" sonkeigo sonkeigo sonkeigo sonkeigo kenjougo-I kenjougo-I kenjougo-I kenjougo-II","kenjougo-I + sonkeigo \"desu\" \".\" \"masu\" \".\" teineigo teineigo "]},{"title":"2.2 Categories of Misusage of Honorific Expressions","paragraphs":["The misusage of honorific expressions can be divided into two categories:","Misusage in word form: The word form is not normative; i.e., the word form differs from the normative word forms mentioned in Section 2.1. For example, \"o\"(a pre-fix) + verb stem + 504   \"rareru\" (an auxiliary verb) is a misusage in word form because \"rareru\" is not allowed to be used in this word form.","Misusage in performance: The word form is normative, but is not consistent with the social-relationship among the speakers, listeners, and individuals being addressed or referred to in the sentence. For example, a sentence that does not contain Teineigo is usually considered a misusage in performance when the listener's social position is higher than the speaker's. ","The misusage in word form can be avoided simply by preparing a sufficient list of normative and non-normative word forms. The present study concentrated on misusage in performance."]},{"title":"3 Framework 3.1 Restriction","paragraphs":["In our study, each input sentence is assumed to satisfy the following conditions: 1) at most, four persons - speaker, listener, and two others (denoted as \"A\" and \"B\") being addressed or referred to - are involved in the sentence, 2) one predicate in the sentence that has one subject person and one object person"]},{"title":"3.2 Honorific Feature","paragraphs":["Since all sentences inputted to the system are assumed to satisfy the restrictions stated in Section 3.1, the honorific features of the sentence can be represented by the set of s, o, e, and p defined in Table 2.
