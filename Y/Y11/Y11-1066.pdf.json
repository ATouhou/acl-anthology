Twitter is a widespread social media, which rapidly gained worldwide popularity. Pursuing on the problem of finding related tweets to a given organization, we propose supervised and semi-supervised based methods.

How to manage this information to grasp the response of people to governmental policies, the feedback and comment of people on commercial products have received considerable attention in research community. There are some researches such as opinion mining, online reputation management, which focus on monitoring user generated media. One of the essential things of these researches is first to get the information which is related to the studied entity, such as product, company, or certain event.","This paper focuses on finding related tweets to a given organization. This is a challenging task due to the potential organization name ambiguity. For example, the name of company “Apple” which has a separate meaning fruit apple. The word “Amazon” could be used to refer river or company.

Twitter differs from the traditional user generated media. It allows users to generate each message with no more than 140 characters. Little context information is available. Therefore, it is a challenge for monitoring and analyzing them.","Dan et al. (2011) focus on identifying relevant tweets for social TV, they propose a bootstrapping algorithm which uses a small manually labeled dataset, a large dataset of unlabeled messages, and some domain knowledge to derive a classifier to filter microblogging messages which discuss television show. They extract features which contain general terms commonly associated with watching TV.","WePS-3 Online Reputation Management3","held in 2010, aimed to identify tweets which are related to a given company. It provides standard training and test dataset that enable researchers to carry out and evaluate their methods (Amigó et al., 2010). For this task, the research of (Yerva et al., 2010) shows the best performance in the evaluation campaign. They adopt support vector machines (SVM) classifier with external resources, which includes Wordnet, metadata profile, category profile, Google set, and user feedback. To overcome the problem of tweets containing little context information, they create several profiles with external resources as a model for each company. Yoshida et al. (2010) classify organization names into “organization-like names” or “general-word-like names”. They categorize each query in the first stage, and categorize each tweet in the second stage using the rules customized for each class of queries. Kalmar (2010) adopts bootstrapping method to classify the tweets. The research of (García-Cumbreras et al., 2010) shows the named entities in tweets are appropriate for certain company names. Tsagkias et al. (2010) prove that a general classifier can be employed to predict the presence of any company in Twitter.","Perez-Tellez et al. (2011) propose term expansion to the ambiguous words and words which highly co-occur with it.","Our work is different from theirs: supervised and semi-supervised methods are utilized in different stages for the classification of tweets. For the task, the set of organization names in the training and test corpora are different. The model could not be trained for a certain organization. Therefore, our method aims to utilize both training data and the test data to improve the accuracy of the performance. In detail, the tweets are firstly classified by Maximum Entropy classifier trained on training data. Then Label Propagation Algorithm is utilized to classify tweets based on the test data."]},{"title":"3 Overview 3.1 Problem Statement","paragraphs":["Given a set of tweets and an organization name, the task is to judge that each tweet in the set is related to the organization or not.  3 http://nlp.uned.es/weps/ 616  ","The input information per tweet contains: the tweet identifier, the entity name, the query used to retrieve the tweet, the author identifier and the tweet content. For each organization in the dataset, it gives the organization name and its homepage URL.","The output per tweet is True or False tag corresponding to related or non-related with the given organization.","Compared with the traditional classification task, this task has some challenges. One is tweets and organization name contain little information, context information is limited. The other is the set of organization names in the training and test data are different. That means no organization is present in both training data and test data, the features or model built on training data is not very suitable for the test data."]},{"title":"3.2 Our Method","paragraphs":["Overcome the challenges of this task, we import external resources to get more information","about the organization, such as related homepage, related Wikipedia page, and GoogleSet.

The","system includes the following parts: (1) Features extraction and representation. It includes both the features from the tweets and","the features of organization from external resources. (2) Maximum entropy classifier. It is trained with the features extracted in Step (1) on the","training data. (3) Label Propagation. It includes two parts: seeds selection and graph construction. We","select seeds based on the result gotten in Step (2). For one certain organization, we","construct graph based on the relationship between each tweets on test data. (4) Rule-based modification.

In this step, we pay more attention to the organization information, which is expanded with external resources. We induce related homepage, related Wikipedia page, and GoogleSet in the following way to get the features to represent the organization.","Homepage","The URL of each organization is provided in the input. The words in homepage are more related and indicative to the organization. Therefore, these words (removed the stopwords) are chosen to represent the organization. However, some organization webpages are created by java-scripts or even flash, no text information could be extracted from them at present. Therefore, we try to get other external resources. 617  ","Wikipedia page","Aim to get higher quality information of the organization, Wikipedia disambiguation page4"," is used. For each organization name, we get some entity candidates related with it through the disambiguation page. If the wiki-webpage of the entity candidate contains the organization's homepage URL, this webpage is treated as a description of the organization, words in this webpage are extracted as features. Metadata Meta tags in HTML page provide high quality keywords to represent its webpage. If the webpage has metadata, they are good features to represent organization. However, only a fraction of webpages have this information available.","GoogleSet","GoogleSet provides similar words with the query words. We utilize it to enrich organization information with related words. For example, given words “Yale” and “University”, associated words “Stanford”, “Columbia” are returned. This kind of information is useful, it gives latent semantic category information at some extent. Capital words Capital words are more likely to be important words or named entity, we reinforce these","words by selecting them as one type of features.

Compare our three systems, the performance is improved by adding LP algorithm and rule step by step. For the F-measure of related tweets, it improves 4%. The recall is improved 9% with a little loss of precision. The whole accuracy is also improved by 3%. It proves that combining supervised and semi-supervised methods is effective. The rule described in Section 3.2: if organization name consisting of more than one word, then the tweet contains full name is treated as related to this organization. Though only one piece of rule is used, it really improves almost all measurement value. It shows that important keywords are good features to distinguish entity.","Compared our systems with WePS participant system, our systems performance are less than the system of (Yerva et al., 2010).

This is a challenging task due to the potential organization name ambiguity. This task is more challenging caused by two problems: the tweets and organization contain little information, and the organizations in training data are different with those in test data. We induce external resources to enrich the information of organization. Supervised (ME) and semi-supervised (LP) methods are adopted in two stages to classify the tweets. This is a try to utilize both training and test data for this specific task. Our experimental results on WePS-3 are primary and encouraging, they prove the proposed techniques are effective in performing the task.","There is still a gap needed to be filled by further improving these techniques. For example, the performance can be improved through the semantic expansion of words using Ontology. 620  "]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["García-Cumbreras, M. A., M. García-Vega, F.
