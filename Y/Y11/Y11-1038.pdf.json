The NTU-MC compilation taps on the linguistic diversity of multilingual texts available within Singapore. The current version of NTU-MC contains 375,000 words (15,000 sentences) in 6 languages (English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Indonesian and Vietnamese) from 6 language families (Indo-European, Sino-Tibetan, Japonic, Korean as a language isolate, Austronesian and Austro-Asiatic). The NTU-MC is annotated with a layer of monolingual annotation (POS tags) and cross-lingual annotation (sentence-level alignments). The diverse language data and cross-lingual annotations provide valuable information on linguistic diversity for traditional linguistic research as well as natural language processing tasks. This paper describes the corpus compilation process with the evaluation of the monolingual and cross-lingual annotations of the corpus data.

Cross-lingual training using parallel corpora has been gaining popularity in NLP application tasks such as word sense disambiguation (e.g. Sarrafzadeh et al. 2011; Saravanan et al. 2010; Mitamura et al. 2007), information retrieval and questionanswering. In addition, parallel corpora are valuable resources for advancing linguistic annotations morphologically, syntactically and semantically (e.g. Snyder and Barzilay; 2008, Hwa et al. 2005; Resnik, 2004). The essential knowledge resource in building these language technologies are grounded on parallel corpora. The present pool of resources holds a sizable amount of European parallel corpora (e.g. Ralf et al. 2006; Erjavec, 2004), an increasing interest in building Asian languages-English bitexts (e.g. Xiao, 2004) but only a handful of parallel Asian language corpora (e.g. Zhang, 2005). To fill the lack of parallel corpora of Asian languages, the NTU–Multilingual Corpus (NTU-MC) taps on the array of multilingual texts available in Singapore; ranging from the multilingual sign boards with official languages of Singapore (English, Chinese, Malay, Tamil) to posters, signs and guides targeted towards migrants, expats and tourists (in Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai, Tagalog, etc.). Singapore‟s multicultural and multilingual 25th Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation, pages 362–371 362 society has necessitated the use of parallel text for signboards, public announcements and information dissemination. The NTU-MC presents multilingual data from a modern cosmopolitan city where people interact in different languages. Empirically, the NTU-MC represents unique societal linguistic diversity; computationally, the NTU-MC provides diverse parallel text for NLP tasks. The NTU-MC presents a wealth of data to inform our analysis of language in a modern multicultural city from the traditional and computational linguistic point of view. This paper discusses the compilation of the NTU-MC from data collection to the present state of POS tagged and sentence-aligned parallel texts. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the sub-tasks in the corpus compilation, the monolingual annotation and cross-lingual annotation process; Section 3 present the NTU-MC outputs and evaluates the layers of annotations; Section 4 presents future work on the NTU-MC and Section 5 concludes."]},{"title":"2 Corpus Construction","paragraphs":["The NTU Multilingual Corpus adopts an opportunistic data collection approach and it is representative of the linguistically diverse data available within the Singapore language habitus. Currently, the corpus data contains the tourism domain of Singapore where multiple foreign languages are used on Singapore Tourism Board's website to entreat the tourism from the countries that speaks the respective languages. The NTU-MC is built on a Linux operating system with UTF-8 as the standardized encoding for its outputs."]},{"title":"2.1 Data Collection","paragraphs":["The corpus project was granted the permission to use the websites1","that are published by Singapore Tourism Board (STB). In the initial phase we have built a corpus totaling 375,000 words (15,000 sentences) in 6 languages (English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Indonesian and Vietnamese), from 6 language family trees2","(Indo-European, Sino-Tibetan, Japonic, Korean as a language isolate, Austronesian and Austro-Asiatic) based on texts from the Singapore Tourism Board‟s www.yoursingapore.com website."]},{"title":"2.2 Crawling and Cleaning","paragraphs":["Httrack (Roche, 2007) was used for data-collection and it was completed with a single command httrack http://www.yoursingapore.com -o +*.yoursingapore. com/content/traveller/*/*.html -p1 .The raw HyperText Markup Language (HTML) files were downloaded without the embedded media files (e.g. images, flash files, embedded videos, etc.) from the webpages. As the markup language used to construct the websites were consistent, a custom-made perl script was created to extract the main body paragraph instead of using the commonly used Condition Random Field (CRF) algorithm (Marek et al. 2007). The markup cleaning extracted the text bounded by <p>...</p> within the <div class = paragraph section>...</div> attributes. The perl script successfully extracted the main body text from each webpage and ignored the subtexts that were headers to other pages. During the annotation tasks, non-break spaces (0xa0) were found in the extracted text. These caused errors in POS tagging and sentence alignment. They appear before the start of the sentence and after the full stops in the sentence. A second round of cleaning was carried out to  1 STB hosts a series of tourism related websites in particular websites with parallel texts, viz. http://www.singaporemedicine.com/index.asp , http://app.singaporeedu.gov.sg/asp/index.asp and www.yoursingapore.com 2 Language family in this paper refers to the highest level of language classification from the Ethnologue (Lewis, 2009) 363 remove non-break spaces and the texts were then re-tokenized and re-annotated. All the textfiles were saved in UTF-8 encoding."]},{"title":"2.3 Sentence Segmentation","paragraphs":["The English, Korean and Indonesian Texts use the same punctuation and the Natural Language Tool Kit (NTLK) sent_tokenize module (Bird et al, 2009) was sufficient to segment the English, Korean and Indonesian text. The sent_tokenize program uses stop punctuations (i.e. ! ? . ) to identify the end of the sentence and it also correctly segmented sentence with websites by differentiating the sentence end full stop and full stops within a website. The multi-byte Chinese and Japanese sentences were separated by the same sets of ! ? 。 punctuations. Thus the nltk.RegexpTokenizer(u'[!̂ ? 。 ]*[!?。]') was used to segment the Chinese and Japanese sentences. The Japanese regex has a minor tweak from the common nltk.RegexpTokenizer(u'[̂「 」 ! ? 。 ]*[ ! ? 。 ]') , as recommended by the Hagiwara‟s Japanese chapter of the 「入門 自然言語処理」nyumon shizen gengo shori “Japanese Natural Language Processing with python” (Bird et al, 2010). The tweak was necessary to include non-sentence phrases bounded by 「 ... 」 brackets. Normally the Japanese「」brackets would have an individual sentence within the bracket, the text from www.yoursingapore.com used the 「」differently by embedding not only sentence but also proper names (e.g. 「マリーナ貯水池」mari-na chosuichi “Marina Reservoir”; 「ス ターバックス」suta-bakkusu “Starbucks”) or loan phrases(e.g.「三歩一拝」san ho ichi hai “three step a bow” - a Chinese Buddhism term; 「ハラール」 hara-u “halal”; 「カルーセ ル」karu-seru “carousal”) ."]},{"title":"2.4 Tokenization","paragraphs":["The tokenization (i.e. word level segmentation) tasks splits sentences up into individual “meaningful units” and these meaningful units are dependent on the philological stance of different word segmenter programs. In this paper, the term word and token will be used interchangeably to refer to the individual tokens output by the POS taggers and tokenizers. For English and Indonesian data, whitespaces are the delimiter for the tokens. Although Vietnamese words are separated by whitespaces in the orthography, sometimes two “words” separated by whitespace are supposed to mean a single thing. For example, the Vietnamese word „quốc tế‟ mean international but the individual “word” separated by the space does have its meaning („quốc‟ means country and „tế‟ means to run). Thus the JVnSegmenter module within JVnTextPro (Nguyen and Phan, 2007) was used to tokenize the Vietnamese data. For the Japanese and Korean word level segmentation, the segmenter is incorporated into the POS-taggers that this corpus project is using. The Stanford Chinese word segmenter was used to segment the Chinese sentences in this corpus (Tseng et al, 2005). Mis-segments generated from Stanford segmenter were local street names that were transliterated from English to Chinese. For example, the Stanford Chinese word segmenter wrongly tokenized 乌节路 wujielu “Orchard road” as 乌 节路 wu jielu “black joint-road”. These topological terms were re-segmented with a manually crafted dictionary built using Wikipedia‟s Chinese translations of English names of Singapore places and streets."]},{"title":"2.5 Monolingual Annotation – Part Of Speech (POS) Tagging","paragraphs":["Different programs were used to tag the individual languages with their respective POS tag sets. Due to the lack of an open source POS-tagger for Bahasa Indonesian, the Indonesian texts were not POS-tagged. All the tagged output was formatted into the Corpus Work Bench (CWB) verticalized text format with eXtensible Markup Language (XML) tags to encode the start and end of a sentence (i.e. <s>...</s>). Table 1 presents a brief summary of the sentence segmentation and POS-tagging task for the corpus compilation. 364  Table 1: Summary of Tokenization and Monolingual Annotation (POS tagging) Task","Language Sentence Segmenter Word Segmenter POS-tagger (Tagger Encoding) Tagset English (en)","NLTK sent_tokenize Whitespaces HunPos (ISO-8859-1) Penn Treebank II Japanese (ja)","NLTK RegexpTokenizer MeCab MeCab (UTF-8) IPAdic Korean (ko)","NLTK sent_tokenize POSTAG/ Sejong POSTAG/Sejong (EUC-KR) Sejong Vietnamese (vi)","NLTK sent_tokenize JVnSegmenter JVnTagger (UTF-8) VSLP Chinese (zh)","NLTK RegexpTokenizer Stanford Segmenter Stanford POS tagger (UTF-8) Penn Chinese Treebank Indonesian (in) NLTK sent_tokenize Whitespaces – –  The HunPos tagger applied the Penn Treebank II POS annotations to the English texts (Halacsy et al, 2007). The pre-trained Wall Street Journal English (en_wsj.model) model was used with the HunPos tagger to tag the English data. The Japanese data was tagged by the MeCab tagger (Kudo et al, 2004). The MeCab tagger was used with the -0chasen model, which was trained by the ChaSen tagger (Matsumoto et al. 1999). Different from the other POS-tagger used in this project, the MeCab morphological analyser provided more than a layer of POS annotations; MeCab output adheres to the IPADIC 2.7.0 standards (Matsumoto and Asahara, 2004). The POSTech TAGger –Korean (POSTAG/Sejong) was used to tag the Korean text. As an agglutinative language, POSTAG/Sejong tagged the tokens at a morpheme level rather than a word level. A custom tagset with 41 tags was used by POSTAG/Sejong to suit the Korean morphemes. The POSTAG/Sejong tagger is only available on Microsoft Windows OS but we managed to run it under the WINE emulator (scripts for this are available with the corpus). The JVnTagger (part of the JVnTextPro tool) with the MaxEnt model was used to annotate the Vietnamese text. The tagset used by JVnTextpro sets the standards for Vietnamese NLP as they pioneered the VLSP project (2006-2010) to “building basic resources and tools for Vietnamese language and speech processing”, a five year long project from 2006 – 2010. The Stanford Chinese POS tagger tags the Chinese data with the chinese.tagger model; the Chinese Penn Treebank tagset were used by the Stanford tagger (Tseng et al, 2005). The primary issues with multilingual corpus POS annotation is the difference in encoding of the sources and the encoding that the POS tagger accepts as input and produce as output. When feeding data into the English (HunPos) and the Korean (POSTAG/Sejong) tagger, the encoding needed to be changed to the respective encoding that the tagger accepts (ISO-8859-1 and EUC-KR respectively). This caused some problems for Korean, as the input text contained characters that cannot be represented in the EUC-KR encoding used by POSTAG/Sejong (such as the – , é and © characters). We mapped them to - , e and (C) during the POS-tagging task for the Korean texts. We hope that more systems will produce UTF-8 versions of their morphological analyzers in the future. 365 Table 2: A sample of the monolingual annotation from the NTU-MC","Language Segemented, Part of Speech tagged Text","English <s>If_IN you_PRP only_RB have_VBP time_NN for_IN one_CD club_NN in_IN Singapore_NN ,_, then_RB it_PRP simply_RB has_VBZ to_TO be_VB zouk_JJ ._.</s>","Japanese <s>シンガポール_名詞-固有名詞-地域-国 で_助詞-格助詞-一般 一つ_名詞-一般 の_ 助詞-連体化 クラブ_名詞-一般 に_助詞-格助詞-一般 しか_助詞-係助詞 行く_動詞- 自立 時間_名詞-副詞可能 が_助詞-格助詞-一般 なかっ_形容詞-自立 た_助動詞 と_ 助詞-格助詞-引用 し_動詞-自立 たら_助動詞 、_記号-読点 間違い_名詞-ナイ形容 詞語幹 なく_助動詞 、_記号-読点 この_連体詞 ズーク_名詞-一般 に_助詞-格助詞- 一般 行く_動詞-自立 べき_助動詞 です_助動詞 。_記号-句点 </s>","Korean <s>싱가포르_NNP 에서_JKB 클럽_NNP 한_NNP 군데_NNB 밖에_JX 가_VV ᄅ_ETM 시간_NNG 이_JKS 없_VA 다면_EC ,_SP Zouk_SL 를_JKO 선택_NNG 하_XSV 시_EP 어요_EF ._SF</s>","Vietnamese <s>Nếu_C bạn_N chỉ_R có_V thời_gian_N ghé_V thăm_V một_M câu_lạc_bộ_N ở_E Singapore_Np ,_, hãy_R đến_V Zouk_Np ._.</s>","Chinese <s>如果_CS 您_PN 在_P 新加坡_NR 只_AD 能_VV 前往_VV 一_CD 间_M 俱乐部 _NN ,_PU 祖卡_NN 酒吧_NN 必然_AD 是_VC 您_PN 的_DEG 不二_JJ 选择 _NN 。_PU </s>"]},{"title":"2.6 Cross-lingual Annotation - Sentence-level Alignment","paragraphs":["As machine-readable dictionaries are only available for certain languages in the NTU-MC, the dictionary and length based hunalign tool is suitable for aligning the NTU-MC as the algorithm “remains completely meaningful even in total absence of a dictionary” (Varga et al. 2005).

The human annotators were assigned to verify the POS tags and mis-segmented tokens. The accuracy of the human annotation might be primed by what the POS tagger had tagged.

Thus a different POS tagger, ChaSen morphemic analyzer, was used to calculate IAA. Both programs uses the ipadic POS, but the noticeable difference is that ChaSen is more conservative when tagging unknown words: ChaSen applied the 未知語 michigo “unknown word” tag to tokens for unseen words whereas MeCab forces the closest fit POS to the unknown tokens.

The evaluation metrics adheres to standards set by the ARCADE II project (Chiao et al. 2006); the recall, precision and F-score is computed on the hunalign output of word segmented sentences. F-scores were computed using sentence and character granularity (with and without space). From Figure 1, the alignment task on Japanese, Korean and Chinese is a much more difficult task than aligning Indonesian or Vietnamese data; even with the dictionaries‟ input, alignments for non-Latin character-based languages are poorer in alignments. Possibly, it is the difference in sentence order (refer table 4) that affected the lexicon quality of the Japanese-English and Korean-English alignments. Nevertheless, +human alignments were manually crafted for English-Japanese and English-Chinese sentences and the English-Korean alignment is reasonably good in terms of character granularity.  Figure 1: F-measure of hunalign on English-Asian Language alignments   The primary advantage of pivoting alignments to generate other language-pairs alignments is the simplicity to leverage on Gold Standard alignments to produce alignments where the 368 bilinguals of the language pairs are scarce. Similar to the idea of increasing number of language pairs quadratically by sourcing parallel sources with more languages (Eisele & Yu, 2010), +pivot alignments can produce +human like alignments quadratically with each +human alignments. Although it is possible to create more alignments through other pivoting permutations, generating pivoted alignments from crude -dic alignments will be perpetuating the original mis-alignments that hunalign had produced. Thus only the pivoted Gold Standard alignments was worth the effort as it can be able to produce word-level alignments of similar quality to the +human alignments."]},{"title":"4 Discussion and Future work","paragraphs":["A comparable corpus to the NTU-MC is OPUS which taps open source parallel text (Tiedemann, 2009). The OPUS is representative of a global open source enthusiast‟s community, while the NTU-MC targets data from a specific cosmopolitan society. The OPUS covers a wider range of domains with large sub-corpora and it provides automated monolingual (POS tags and syntactic parses) and cross-lingual (sentence and word level alignments) annotations; whereas the NTU-MC is a corpus of a smaller size but more diverse in Asian language data with deeper annotations. Over time we intend to achieve Gold Standard annotations beneficial for NLP tasks. The NTU-MC is an ongoing effort to add content, layers of annotation and usability as it continues to make multilingual resources machine readable for NLP tasks. Future work on the NTU-MC involves increasing the amount of data, the layers of monolingual annotations and cross-lingual annotations. The immediate expansion of the corpus would be to use the parallel texts (English, Malay, Chinese and Tamil) distributed by National Environment Agency of Singapore (NEA) and Sembawang Town Council (SBTC).4","Also, we are constantly requesting for parallel public informational text from other governmental authorities. Although we have exploited prior knowledge put into the design of the POS tag sets and token segmentations using different (ad-hoc) tools, the philological perspective on segmentations and POS varies within each individual language and across languages. To fill these philological and cross-lingual gaps in the monolingual annotations, we are working to provide syntactic annotation with the Deep Linguistic Processing with HPSG Initiative (DELPH-IN) 5","and semantic annotation with the Global WordNet Association (GWA).6","From the parses of the individual languages, the multi-layered annotation will allow extraction of the syntactic annotations (e.g. POS from HPSG word classes, word boundary from HPSG lexicon) and semantic annotations (e.g. semantic constraints from HPSG lexicon and its corresponding word senses mapped to WordNet). For cross-lingual annotation, sentence-level and word-level alignments will be carried out as resources permits; then alignment pivoting will be done in a mesh manner to achieve Gold Standard sentence alignments for all language pairs and proceed with word-level alignments. These word alignments from the hitherto under-represented language pairs should provide rich data for language technologies like MT and IR."]},{"title":"5 Conclusion","paragraphs":["This project has produced the initial text collection of the NTU Multilingual Corpus, small in size but rich in language diversity.

This project urges future research to continue to draw diverse data through readily available yet untapped resources for corpus compilation. By progressively extending the NTU-MC with a larger dataset and multiple layers of annotation, it expands the scope of the usage and becomes a better corpus for general or computational linguistics researches. By building corpora of more diverse cross-lingual nature, it provides information on the unique sociolinguistic situation in linguistically diverse societies (e.g. translatability researches, language choice and language domain researches); also it pushes the state-of-the-art NLP techniques through more robust cross-lingual training (Matsumoto et al. 1993)."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Bird, S., Klein, E., Loper, E., 萩原正人 (Hagiwara, M.), 中山敬広 (Nakayama, T.) and 水野貴 明 (Mizuno, T.)
