This paper presents a listwise approach as an alternative to commonly used pairwise approaches to the task of coreference resolution in multiple languages. In this listwise approach, all antecedent candidates are examined simultaneously and assigned corresponding scores expressing the probability that each candidate is coreferent with a given mention. The experimental results on the corpora of SemEval-2010 shared task 1 showed that our proposed system gave the good results in English and Spanish, and comparative results in Catalan when compared to previous participating systems. These results prove that this approach is appropriate and quite efficient for Coreference Resolution in Multiple Languages.

This task plays an important role in a large number of NLP applications such as Information Retrieval, Question Answering and Machine Translation. Therefore, it has attracted many attentions within the NLP community. Many works on various aspects (linguistic features (Ng, V., 2007), (Haghighi and Klein, 2009); machine learning models (Soon et al., 2001); multiple languages (Recasens et al., 2010a); and so on) of the coreference resolution task have been published.","Until the release of the SemEval-2010 task 1 (Recasens et al., 2010a), there has no competition or public corpus that allows evaluating different coreference resolution systems in multiple languages. Most published systems only focus on a specific language and use the same data sets for example ACE or MUC corpora to train and test the systems. This makes the systems easy to unintentionally adapt themselves to the corpus but not to the problem in general. Therefore, this SemEval-2010 task 1 (Recasens et al., 2010a) made it possible to evaluate and compare various automatic coreference resolution systems in the aspects of: (i) the portability of systems across languages, (ii) the relevance of different levels of linguistic information, and (iii) the behavior of scoring metrics.","This shared task attracted lots of researchers’ attentions, but finally only six teams submitted their final results. The participating systems differed in terms of architecture, machine learning methods, etc. These systems mostly based on pairwise models, graph partitioning and entity-mention models. Unfortunately, these models suffered from an important weakness (Ng, V., 2010). In these models, each antecedent candidate is resolved independently with the other candidates. So the models could not determine the best candidate in the relation with the other candidates. To address this drawback, ranking models were proved to be a useful solution (Denis and Baldridge, 2007), (Ng, V., 2005), (Yang et al., 2003). Motivated from ranking models, in this paper, we present our proposal approach for learning-based reference resolution task in multiple languages.","Copyright 2011 by Oanh Thi Tran, Bach Xuan Ngo, Minh Le Nguyen, and Akira Shimazu 25th Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation, pages 400–409"]},{"title":"400","paragraphs":["We exploit the listwise approach, which is originally proposed for learning to rank task in information retrieval (Cao et al., 2007), to solve the SemEval-2010 Task on Coreference Resolution in Multiple Languages.

This means that all candidates will be examined simultaneously and the candidate with the highest score will be selected as a correct antecedent. This listwise approach has been successfully applied to information retrieval task (Cao et al., 2007). Our experimental results on the corpora of SemEval-2010 shared task 1 showed that when applied to coreference resolution task, this new listwise approach usually gave the better results than previous approaches. When estimated on the latest metric BLANC, our proposed system got the state-of-the-art performance.","The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

The typical machine learning approach of these three systems includes two steps:","• Classification: systems evaluate whether each pair of mentions is coreferent with each other or not.","• Formation coreference chain: Given the previous classification, the systems form coreference chain (mostly based on best-first clustering).","The approach presented in RelaxCor system joined classification and chain formation into the same step.

First, it does not give any credit for single-mention entities since no link can be found in these entities. Second, all errors are considered to be equal because in some tasks, some coreference errors do more damage than others. These drawbacks lead to the proposal of BCUB metric. This metric first computes a precision and recall for each individual mention, and then takes the weighted sum of these individual precisions and recalls as the final metric. The choice of the weighting scheme is determined by the task for which the algorithm is going to be used.","CEAF (Luo, 2005)","The BCUB metrics still has its own problems: for example, the mention precision/recall is computed by comparing entities containing the mention and therefore an entity can be used more than once. Thus, they proposed Constrained Entity-Aligned F-measure or CEAF metric. It finds the best one-to-one mapping entities between the subsets of reference and system entities.

This situation makes it hard to successfully compare systems. Getting the state-of-the-art performance based on all this four common metrics seems to be a difficult task. Until now there is no common agreement on a standard measure for coreference resolution task.","However, based on formulas and characteristics of each metric, we saw that later-proposed metrics usually give the better quality than metrics proposed early. If using this criterion, we saw that we got the highest F-score for the latest proposed BLANC metric in all three languages. In other words, our proposed system got the state-of-the-art performance for coreference resolution task in multiple languages."]},{"title":"5 Conclusion and Future Work","paragraphs":["In this paper, we present a new listwise approach to the task of SemEval-2010 task 1 on coreference resolution in multiple languages. This new listwise approach allows all candidate antecedents are considered simultaneously and therefore brings in more benefit than traditional pairwise approaches. The experimental results on the public corpora showed that this new proposed approach gave relatively good performance in all three languages. For the latest proposed metric BLANC, we got the state-of-the-art performance for this coreference resolution task in multiple languages.","For the future works, we will continue to do experiments using other settings of the SemEval-2010 task 1 to fortify the strength of this listwise approach.","A straightforward generalization of twin-candidate model is the ranker model proposed by (Denis and Baldridge, 2007). In this ranker model, the computation of the model’s expectation of a feature is directly based on the probabilities assigned to the different candidates by using supervised maximum entropy ranking approach. In the future, we also would like to investigate other ranker models like this one on the corpora of this SemEval-2010 shared task number 1."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This work was partly supported by the 21st Century COE program ‘Verifiable and Evolvable e-Society’, Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research, Education and Research Center for Trustworthy e-Society."]},{"title":"408 References","paragraphs":["Attardi, G., Rossi, S.
