Trying to develop English-writing support tools that will enable non-native speakers to produce nearly perfect English sentences for mixed English-Japanese sentences–in which expressions without know translations are simply written in Japanese–Ma et al. (2008; 2009) have developed systems that can provide support at the word and phrase levels. That is, the given Japanese parts in the mixed English-Japanese sentences can be words or phrases. For phrase-level support in those systems, the Japanese parts are extracted from the mixed sentences and segmented into words, the candidate English equivalents of the segmented Japanese words are identified by searching through a Japanese-English dictionary, and the best equivalents of the Japanese phrases are selected from the combinations of the candidate translations of the single words. This kind of support, however, has two problems. One is the variety of the phrase patterns that the system can support is limited because the English phrases are generated only from the combinations of the candidate translations of single words. The other is the processing is time-consuming because a large number of the translations of single words results in an enormous number of combinations. ⋆","This work was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI (C) 19500133) from the Ministry","of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan.","Copyright 2011 by Qing Ma, Shinya Sakagami, and Masaki Murata 25th Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation, pages 577–586"]},{"title":"577","paragraphs":["We think that an effective way to solve these problems would be to use an approach based on translation patterns: to first construct a dictionary of the Japanese-English translation patterns and use that dictionary to provide English-writing support.

(2008; 2009) are mixed English-Japanese sentences that contain Japanese words or (noun and verb) phrases. The Japanese parts are first identified and extracted. For the word-level support, stemming is performed to provide the base forms of the words. The phrase-level support, on the other hand, starts with word segmentation. Words are stemmed and segmented using the Japanese morphological analysis tool Chasen. The candidate English equivalents of the single Japanese words are then identified by searching through the Japanese-English dictionary Eijiro. Queries for word-level support are then constructed by using the equivalent candidates and their contexts, and queries for phrase-level support are constructed by using the combinations of the candidate equivalent of the single words.2","All queries constructed in this way are searched for in high-quality corpora using an originally developed, flexibly searchable system and searched for in huge amounts of Web data using Google Web APIs to obtain their hits. Finally, the N-best English equivalent candidates with which the queries are constructed that have the largest N numbers of hits are selected as the answers for the systems.","One problem, however, is that the system can support only an extremely limited variety of the phrase patterns. The only noun phrases that can be supported are compound nouns and noun phrases composed of adjectives and nouns, and the only verb phrases that can be supported are those composed of nouns and verbs. Gerund phrases such as “” [(1) hashitteiru inu, (2) running dog, (3) a running dog]3",", for example, cannot be supported. Neither can translations to different patterns, such as noun phrases to infinitive phrases, be supported. Another problem is that the processing for phrase-level support is time-consuming because the number of combinations of the translations of single words is enormous.","We think that an effective way to solve these problems would be to take an approach based on translation patterns: to first construct a dictionary of the Japanese-English translation patterns and then use that dictionary to provide English-writing support. We therefore tried first to extract broad-scale, high-precision parallel translation expressions of Japanese-English from large aligned parallel corpora. 1 Related work is discussed in Sec. 3.1. 2 Acquiring candidate equivalents in phrase-level support is more complicated. See Ma et al. (2009) for details. 3 The non-English examples are also rendered in (1) alphabetized form, (2) English glosses, and (3) English translation (or grammar explanations if there are no proper translations) complying with the PACLIC 25 Paper Submission Guidelines. The English translations, however, will be skipped if they appear in the pairs of the parallel translation expressions."]},{"title":"578 3 Extraction of Parallel Translation Expressions 3.1 Related work","paragraphs":["The earlier studies most closely related to our work were done by Sainoo et al. (2003) and Kitamura and Matsumoto (1996; 2005). The principal techniques used in those studies were used as our baseline in this study and are described in Sec. 3.2.1. In the study of Sainoo et al., the research object was limited to a small corpus of 8,500 Japanese-English parallel sentences, which were examples from a number of bilingual dictionaries, and only a couple dozen parallel translation expressions were extracted. The first study of Kitamura and Matsumoto (1996), on the other hand, used Japanese-English parallel corpora of three distinct domains: a computer manual, a scientific journal, and business correspondence letters. Each had about 10,000 parallel sentences, and lots of stock phrases would have been used because of the natures of the domains. Pairs therefore can be expected to be easier to extract from these corpora than the copora that cover diverse fields. From each corpus, however, no more than 3,300 pairs were extracted with precisions of 0.87, 0.92, and 0.80. The extraction scale was extremely small, and the extraction precisions were low. In addition, the recall computed on the basis of the definition given in Sec. 4.1.3 was less than or equal to 0.29, a very low figure. Furthermore, single Japanese and English word n-grams were extracted and pairs of the parallel translation expressions were acquired through a repetition processing, which fed back the interim results. However, the whole processing is time-consuming and the extraction is therefore not easy to scale up. In Kimura and Matsumoto’s second study (2005) they confirmed the interim results manually, used more linguistic resources than they did in their earlier study, and introduced a method for halving the extraction time by dividing a corpus into quarters. Their method is still hard to scale up, however, because the repetition processing is costly and the results can be manually confirmed only in small-scale extraction.","Among other interesting studies on the extraction of Japanese-English parallel translation expressions are those done by Yamamoto and Matsumoto (2000) and Sato and Saito (2002-1; 2002-2). The methods proposed in those studies, however, like those proposed in the earlier studies mentioned above, have low precisions and recalls and also cannot be scaled up. These methods are thus not practical for use in the extraction of large-scale parallel translation expressions. In a study by Sato and Saito (2002-1), for example, even though the test corpus used for extraction consisted of only about 3,000 parallel sentences, whereas the training corpus consisted of 30,287 parallel sentences, more than ten times the number in the test corpus, the extraction precision was still less than or equal to 0.65. Also, in the study by Yamamoto and Matsumoto (2000), the extraction recall was extremely low: only 461 pairs of parallel translation expressions were extracted with a precision of 0.9 from 13,000 pairs of parallel sentences (meaning the recall was 0.03 based on our definition).","In contrast to the approaches used in these earlier studies, our approaches are practically oriented and intended to be used for extracting broad-scale, high-precision parallel translation expressions useful in English-writing support for all kinds of phrases. Since none of methods proposed by Sato and Saito (2002-1; 2002-2) or by Yamamoto and Matsumoto (2000), the repetition processing used by Kitamura and Matsumoto (1996), or the manually confirmation conducted by Kitamura and Matsumoto (2005) are suitable for this, we instead adapted the methods proposed by Sainoo et al. (2003) and part of the methods proposed by Kitamura and Matsumoto (1996) as the baseline method. To acquire broad-scale parallel translation expressions, we improved the baseline method for extracting single Japanese and English word n-grams so that as many parallel translation expressions as possible can be extracted. To achieve high extraction precision, we first used hand-crafted rules to prune the unnecessary words often found in expressions extracted on the basis of word n-grams, and we further used the lexical information from a Japanese-English dictionary to refine the parallel translation expressions.

Because this can result in many fragmented expressions that do not make sense being extracted, we used inhibition treatment to inhibit the generation of these kinds of expressions. Suppose there are two sentences in a corpus:","s1: a b c d e f","s2: g b c d h where a, b, · · · , h are words and sequences (b c d), (b c), and (c d) are the word n-grams appearing at least twice in both the Japanese and English sides of the parallel corpora. Only (b c d) is extracted, and (b c) and (c d) are not extracted because they are the parts of (b c d).","In step (2) the similarity between Japanese and English word n-grams is calculated using the Dice coefficient (Kay and Röschesen, 1993) below. sim(xj, xe) =","2f (xj, xe) f (xj) + f (xe) , (1) where xj and xe are respectively the Japanese and English word n-grams, f (xj) and f (xe) are respectively the appearance frequencies of xj and xe in the parallel corpora, and f (xj, xe) is the frequency of xj and xe co-occurring in the same pairs of Japanese-English sentences. That is, the similarity between the Japanese and English word n-grams in each pair extracted in step (1) is computed, and a pair is considered a pair of parallel translation expressions if the similarity is larger than a threshold value. 3.2.2 The improved method for n-gram extraction To acquire as many parallel translation expressions as possible, we improved the method for extracting single Japanese and English word n-grams, step (1) of the baseline method described in Sec. 3.2.1.","By examining the experimental results with the baseline method, we found that a number of parallel translation expressions that could be extracted when the maximum n-gram lengths was set to a small value could not be extracted when the maximum n-gram lengths was set to the larger one. The main reasons can be considered to be as follows. In the baseline method we used inhibition treatment to remove the fragmented expressions. Thus, if the expressions that can originally be extracted when the maximum n-gram length is short, are included in the longer ones that can be extracted when the maximum n-gram length is longer, then the short ones are removed. The parallel translation expression { J: [(1) wagan shokoku to, (2) the gulf states with], E: with the gulf states} , for example, could not be acquired when the maximum n-gram lengths was set to six because the longer English expression “E: with the gulf states is” was extracted.","To resolve this problem, we do not extract word sequences with an arbitrary length until n-gram in a lump as done in the baseline method. Instead, we extract the word sequences from 1-gram to 2-gram, from 1-gram to 3-gram, · · · , from 1-gram to n-grams in independent steps. When 3-grams are extracted from the sentence “Natural language processing is a field of computer science”, for example, the word sequences from 1-gram to 2-gram, i.e., 1-grams: Nature / language / processing / is / a / field / of / computer /science 2-grams: Natural language / language processing / processing is / is a / a field / field of /","of computer / computer science"]},{"title":"580","paragraphs":["and the word sequences from 1-gram to 3-gram, i.e.,","1-grams: Nature / language / processing / is / a / field / of / computer /science","2-grams: Natural language / language processing / processing is / is a / a field / field of /","of computer / computer science,","3-grams: Natural language processing / language processing is / processing is a / is a","field / a field of / field of computer / of computer science are extracted in each independent step.4","We also perform the inhibition treatment on them and acquire the parallel translation expressions in these independent steps. We finally assemble the parallel translation expressions obtained in these steps and remove the overlapping ones.","Parallel translation expressions are therefore acquired with the improved method by (1) initially setting the n-gram length to two; (2) extracting the single Japanese and English word sequences from 1-gram to the n-gram from parallel corpora, performing the inhibition treatment on them, and acquiring the parallel translation expressions by computing the similarity between the Japanese and English n-grams extracted; (3) incrementing the n-gram length with 1 and repeating steps (2) and (3) until the maximum n-gram length set beforehand is reached; and finally (4) assembling the parallel translation expressions obtained by steps (2) and (3), and removing the overlapping ones. 3.2.3 The hand-crafted rules By examining the experimental results with the baseline method, we found that ungrammatical Japanese expressions starting with words such as “” [(1) koto, (2)(3) thing] and “” [(1) iru, (2)(3) a progressive form] and ending with the words such as “” [(1) kono, (2)(3) this] and ” ” [(1) iroiro-na, (2)(3) various] were extracted. Similarly, ungrammatical English expressions starting with possessive forms and ending with articles and auxiliary verb, for example, were extracted. We therefore manually created the following rules and used them to suppress the extraction of ungrammatical single Japanese and English word n-grams.","Rule1","Expressions are eliminated if they end with the words in the list.","List","Japanese","adnominal e.g., [(1) kono, (2)(3) this], [(1) ano, (2)(3) that], [(1) iroiro-na, (2)(3) various]","prefix e.g., [(1) moto, (2)(3) the former], [(1) anchi, (2)(3) anti- ], [(1) chou, (2)(3) super], [(1) han, (2)(3) anti-], [(1) shin, (2)(3) new]","adverb e.g., [(1) taisou, (2)(3) very], [(1) itsumo, (2)(3) always], [(1) hotoichibai, (2)(3) more than others]","conjunctive noun e.g., [(1) ken, (2)(3) and], [(1) tai, (2)(3) versus]","English article (e.g., a, the), preposition (e.g., about, at, by, in, out, of), auxiliary verb (can, may, will, must, shall), to, 4W1H (what, where, who, which, how) Rule2 Expressions are eliminated if they start with the words in the list.

Each pair of parallel translation expressions is refined as follows. (1) Independent words are extracted from the Japanese side, and their English translation candidates are obtained from a Japanese-English dictionary.5","However, the word sequences (i.e., word n-grams) with arbitrary lengths that include both independent and function words are regarded as single words, and their English translation candidates are searched for through the dictionary. (2) The translation candidates obtained in the first step and the English words of the English side are compared. For the translation candidates that match the English words, their original Japanese words and the matching English words are classified into the “matching list”. Those that do not match, on the other hand, are classified into the “non-matching list”. Also, the words for which translations cannot be found in the dictionary are not classified into either list. (3) The numbers of words in the two lists are compared. If the “matching list” has more words than the “non-matching list”, the pair of parallel translation expressions then passes. Otherwise, the pair is eliminated. Furthermore, if the passing pairs are in many-to-many relationships, which means a Japanese expression has multiple English translations and vice versa, then the pair with the largest number of words in the “matching list” is finally selected.","We use the parallel translation expression { J: [(1) wagansensou no shouri, (2) the gulf war of victory], E: victory in the gulf war} as an example to explain the refinement procedure described above.

Thus, we also make n-grams with arbitrary lengths and regard them as single words for dictionary searching. As a result, we obtain the following eight expressions6",": “” [gulf coast], “” [war], “” [victory], “” [gulf war], “” [of war], “” [victory of war], and “ ” [victory in the gulf war]. We then obtain their English translation candidates by searching the dictionary. In step (2), we first check the English translation candidates of the independent words and the English expressions. As a result, “” and “war” and “” and “victory” are matched and classified into the “matching list”, while “” and “gulf” are not matched and are classified into the “non-matching list”. We then check the English translation candidates of the n-gram words and the English expression. Since the English translation candidates of “ ” match “gulf war”, we compare them with the words in the “non-matching list”. Since these words partially match the words “” and “gulf”, which are in the “non-matching list”, they are moved to the “matching list”. In this way, “matching list” has six words and and the “non-matching list” has none. Since the “matching list” has more words than the “non-matching list”, the parallel translation expression passes.

On the basis of these observations, the maximum n-gram length for extraction was set to six (however, to see the extraction results with shorter values, the experiment with a maximum n-gram of three was also performed for the baseline method.) Also, the pairs in which the difference between the number of words in Japanese and English sides is larger than three were removed from the parallel expression candidates before their similarities were computed. Single Japanese and English n-grams were extracted if they appeared at least twice on both the Japanese and English sides of the corpora. The parallel translation expression candidates were acquired on the condition that the Japanese and English n-grams co-occurred at least twice in the same pairs 6 To reduce the processing time for making n-grams, we used the rules described in Sec. 3.2.3 to exclude expressions such as “” [(1) no shouri, (2) of victory, (3) victory of]."]},{"title":"583","paragraphs":["of Japanese-English sentences and their similarities were greater than or equal to 0.5.

We then see that the Improved ex. (6-gram) dramatically increased the number of extracted expressions, while achieving higher precision than the baseline methods. As a result, the recall was tremendously improved, and the F-measure was also largely improved. By examining the results obtained by the baseline methods and the Improved ex. (6-gram), on the other hand, we found lots of parallel translation expressions, as shown in the below examples, that could be extracted using the Improved ex. (6-gram) but not the baseline methods. That is, the Improved ex.

(6-gram). Thus, although the number of extracted expressions largely reduced, the recall and F-measure were still largely better than those of the Improved ex. (6-gram). Further-more, although the number of extracted expressions largely reduced, by examining the results we could also find some parallel translation expressions that could only be extracted by using the Rule. The parallel translation expression { J: [(1) kiyo suru hitsuyou ga aru, (2) contribute need], E: need to contribute} , for example, has different numbers of Japanese words (five words) and English words (three words). To extract such an expression, we first need to extract all the English word sequences between 1-gram and 5-gram, as well as all those of the Japanese, and then compute their similarities. However, since the 4-gram “need to contribute to” existed in the corpora, the 3-gram “need to contribute” was removed by the inhibition treatment in the baseline methods and the Improved ex. (6-gram). This parallel expression therefore could not be extracted in these methods. In the Rule, however, since the 4-gram “need to contribute to” ended with the word “to” and was removed by the rules, the word sequence “need to contribute” was therefore not inhibited. Thus, this parallel translation expression could be extracted by the Rule.","Finally, from Table 1 we see that the Lexicon dramatically improved the extraction precision and had a precision of 0.96, thus reaching a level high enough for practical use. Although its recall was lower than that of the Rule, its F-measure is much higher than that of the Rule and is the highest among the all methods. One reason for the lower recall with the Lexicon can be considered to be as follows. As mentioned in Sec. 4.1.1, the NICT corpus, a part of the parallel corpora we used, for example, is composed of Mainichi newspaper articles (Japanese) and their translations done by professional translators. This means that a number of parallel sentences of the corpora are in free translation relationships. Thus, the English words used are usually different to the translations of the Japanese words obtained from the Japanese-English dictionary, and the expressions in correct parallel translations might be judged as incorrect and removed from the final extraction results. Specifically, the parallel translation expression { J: [(1) chiu masao zaiseibuchou, (2) chiu paul finance minister], E: finance minister paul chiu} , for example, could be extracted with the Rule and should be regarded as a correct one. Since the Lexicon, however, has no translations of “” [(1) chiu], “” [(1) masao], or “” [(1) buchou] that matched “chiu”, “paul”, or “minister”, these were classified into the “non-matching list”. Also, since there were no translations for the n-grams such as “” [(1) chiu masao, (2) chiu paul, (3) paul chiu] and “” [(1) zaiseibuchou, (2)(3) finance minister], the words in the “non-matching list” could not be moved to the “matching list“.

We think that these figures show that the proposed methods for extracting a broad range of parallel translation expressions have reached a level high enough for practical use, and to our knowledge, ours are the first practically oriented approaches for extracting a wide range of Japanese-English parallel translation expressions.","We plan to construct a dictionary of Japanese-English translation patterns using the parallel translation expressions acquired in this study and build it into an English-writing support system."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Kay, M. and M.
