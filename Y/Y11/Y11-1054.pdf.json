Event nouns can lexically encode eventive information. Recently these nouns have generated considerable scholarly interest. However, little research has been conducted in their morphological and syntactic structure, qualia modification, event representing feature, and information inheritance characteristics. This study has these main findings. 1) Morphologically, the modifier and the head is either free or bound morpheme. Syntactically the modifier is a nominal, adjectival, verbal or numeral morpheme, while the head is a nominal morpheme. 2) The modifier acts as a qualia role of the head. 3) All heads represent events, while the modifier is or is not an event. 4) The semantic information of a compound event noun can be inherited from the modifier or the head.

In recent years, there has been growing interest in these nouns. Previous research in Mandarin Chinese includes patterns that they usually appear (Chu 2000; Han 2010; Ma 1995), their classifiers (Ma 1995; Wang & Zhu 2000; Wang & Huang 2011), internal and external temporal attributes (Liu 2004), semantic type system of the event noun huìyì (Wang et al. 2011). However, little attention has been devoted to the morphological and syntactic structure, qualia modification, event representing feature, and information inheritance characteristics of event nouns. Compound nouns can be divided into seven groups according to their syntactic structure: modifier-head, coordinative, predicate-object, predicate-complement, subject-predicate (topiccomment), reduplicative, and abbreviatory compound nouns (Chang 1995). This study focuses on ‘modifier-head’ compound nouns that represent events. The data in this study are from three sources. 1) The balanced modern Chinese corpus Sinica Corpus 1",". 2) The Grammatical Knowledge-base of Contemporary Chinese——A complete Specification. It is complied by (Yu et al. 2003) and includes more than 400 event nouns. 3) A few example sentences are searched online by using the search engines Google and Baidu. The following sections are organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the structure of compound event nouns of the ‘modifier-head’ type. Section 3 examines the qualia role in an event noun. Section 4 is about the event representing ability of the modifier and the head. Section 5 demonstrates event ordering. Section 6 analyses information inheritance from the modifier and the head. Finally Section 7 draws the main conclusion and suggests future work."]},{"title":"2 Structure of the ‘Modifier-head’ Type Event Nouns 2.1 Morphological Structure ","paragraphs":["Either the modifier or the head can be a free or bound morpheme in a ‘modifier-head’ type event noun. 1) bound morpheme + free morpheme: tŒ̂ruì-xuě ‘auspicious snow’, Rujù-  1 http://db1x.sinica.edu.tw/kiwi/mkiwi/ 25th Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation, pages 511–518 511 tòng ‘sharp pain’. 2) free morpheme + bound morpheme: ]O\\ gōngzuò-cān ‘working lunch’, fłl\\Ushūfǎ-zhǎn ‘handwriting exhibition’. 3) bound morpheme + bound morpheme: O¿[·biàn-yàn ‘informal dinner’, Wp}huáng-zāi ‘plague of locusts’. 4) free morpheme + free morpheme: mw¤hǎi-fēng ‘sea breeze’, WW tuányuán-fàn ‘reunion dinner’."]},{"title":"2.2 Syntactic Structure","paragraphs":["The modifier can be a nominal, adjectival, verbal or numeral morpheme, while the head is a nominal morpheme. 1) N+N: h8b0r- hé-zhànzhēng ‘nuclear war’, vxp zhícháng-yán ‘rectitis’, f%l[ chūn-xùn ‘spring flood’. 2) Adj+N: Y’Ł dà-yǔ ‘heavy rain’, měi-cān ‘delicious meal’. 3) V+N: WW tuányuán-fàn ‘reunion dinner’, ddœ yáobǎi-wǔ ‘rock and roll’. 4) Numeral+N: v~b0 bǎi-zhàn ‘hundreds of battles’. "]},{"title":"2.3 Productive Right Morphemes","paragraphs":["Compound event nouns are morphologically productive, with the right morpheme as an event stem. Examples are shown below. ~b0zhàn ‘battle’: ḃ0zīxùnzhàn ‘information warfare’, }0b0xìjūnzhàn ‘germ warfare’, S[xb0huàxuézhàn ‘chemical warfare’, ¿fb0màoyìzhàn ‘trade war’ ~sài ‘match’: NNRshìpīngsài ‘the world Table Tennis game’, ahx̧iàngqísài ‘chess match’ ~cān ‘meal’: ujfānqiécān ‘tomato meal’, lWfǎguócān ‘French food’, [xu xuéshengcān ‘student meal’ ~ ghuì ‘meeting, gathering; council’: Hgwǔdǎohuì ‘dance council’, h!cgxiàodǒnghuì ‘school direct council’, T[xgzhéxuéhuì ‘philosophy council’ ~ ub̄ìng ‘disease’: _ûx̄īnzāngbìng ‘heart disease’, _@̂{¡ux̄īnxuèguǎnbìng ‘cardiovascular disease’, ûw̄èibìng ‘gastric disease’ These examples show that compound event nouns have double roots. The right root is the head of an event noun, expressing generic event types, while the modifying left root elaborates information on the event."]},{"title":"3 Qualia Modification of the ‘Modifier-head’ Type Event Nouns","paragraphs":["Pustejovsky (1991, 1995) shows how lexical items encode semantic information in the qualia structure. There are four roles in the qualia structure, and each is associated with some values. 1) The constitutive role is the relation between an object and its constituents or parts. The role values include material, weight, parts and component elements. 2) The formal role can distinguish the object within a larger domain. Orientation, magnitude, shape, dimensionality, color, and position are its role values. 3) The telic role is about the purpose and function of the object. 4) The agentive role describes factors involved in the origin of an object, such as creator, artifact, natural kind, causal chain. Under the theoretical framework of qualia structure, Johnston & Busat (1996) analyze the nominal compounding phrases in English and Italian. They find that the modifier can specify the type of an argument to a predicate in a telic, agentive or constitutive role. Lee et al. (2010) demonstrate the qualia modification within a noun-noun compound. Following (Johnston & Busat 1996; Lee et al. 2010), we examine the qualia roles involved between the modifier and head in event nouns. Telic modification: the modifier is the function or aim of the head. For example, mlptáotài-sài ‘elimination game’, xbxuǎnbá-sài ‘selective trial’, [Qwèimiǎn-sài ‘championship fight’. 512 Agentive modification: the modifier is origin or cause of the head. For instance, ZZ[·dìnghūn-yàn ‘a betrothal party’, {T[·dáxiè-yàn ‘return Banquet’. Constitutive modification: the modifier is the component of the head. For example, jDkt gǎnlǎnqiú-sài ‘rugby match’, 9̂fānchuán-sài ‘yacht match’. Formal modification: one type is the modifier is a subtype of the head, such as >rhānshēng ‘snoring sound’, Urhǎn-shēng ‘shouting sound’, T<rhǒu-shēng ‘roaring sound’, kaT| rhuānhū-shēng ‘acclamation sound’. The other type is the modifier is the scale of the head, such as N-Łzhōng-yǔ ‘moderate rain’, Y’¤dà-fēng ‘strong wind’."]},{"title":"4 Event Representing Ability of the Modifier and Head in Event Nouns ","paragraphs":["‘Modifier-head’ type event nouns have three types of event-representing patterns, depending on whether the modifier or the head represents an event. 1) Both the modifier and the head refer to events, such as kLRgēwǔ-jù ‘song and dance opera’. The modifier kLgēwǔ ‘song and dance’ is about the singing and dancing event. The head Rjù ‘opera’ is a performing event. 2) Only the head refers to an event, such as mwl4mthǎishuǐ-yù ‘sea bath’, g(Pvb2mùǒu-xì ‘puppetoon’. The heads mtyù ‘bath’ and b2 ‘drama’ are events themselves, while the modifiers mwl4hǎishuǐ and g(Pvmùǒu ‘puppet’ are entities. 3) The head refers to an event, and the modifier is coerced to be an event. An instance of this type is Qg̋uànjūn-sài ‘championships’. sài ‘game’ is an event in itself while Q ̋ guànjūn‘’ is coerced to be an event through the telic role ‘competing for the champion’."]},{"title":"5 Event Ordering of Compound Event Noun with Two Events","paragraphs":["When there are two events in a ‘modifier-head’ type event noun, there is an ordering issue between them. TLINK is one type of the Time Markup Language tags. It is a temporal link which represents two temporal elements' relation. TLINK distinguishes 14 relation types: Before | After | Includes | Is_Included | During | Simultaneous | I-after | I-before | Identity | Begins | Ends | Begun_By | Ended_By | During_Inv2 . TimeML does not have overlap relation, as this relation does not naturally occur in real texts (Verhagen 2004). However, in compound event nouns, overlap relation is common. We have detected two kinds of overlapping events in compound event nouns. The first type is partially overlapping. For instance, Œp}xuězāi ‘snow disaster’ contains both a snowing event and a disaster event. Snowing happens first. As time goes on, the heavy snow continues and consequently it becomes a disaster. The disaster lasts even after snowing ends. The relation between the two events is demonstrated in (1).  (1) Œxuě ‘snow’ p}zāi ‘disaster’  The second type is completely overlapping. In Qg̋uànjūn sài ‘championship’, Q̋ guànjūn ‘champion’ is coerced to be an event, meaning competing for the champion, and sài ‘game’ is having a match. The two events completely overlap with each other."]},{"title":"6 Information Inheritance of the ‘Modifier-head’ Type Event Nouns 6.1 Inheriting Information from the Modifier ","paragraphs":["2 http://www.timeml.org/site/publications/timeMLdocs/timeml_1.2.1.html#tlink 513 Righthand Head Rule (RHR) states that the head of a morphologically complex word is the righthand member of that word (Williams 1981). This entails that the properties of a word is determined by the rightmost constituent. This section examines the compound jgyīnyuèhuì ‘concert’. Different from RHR, the results demonstrate that in many cases the left side modifier contributes more semantic information than the right side head. In ‘Modern Chinese Dictionary’(Dictionary Editing Room of the Language Institute 2005), ghuì ‘meeting’ has the following 6 senses, out of which only the first one is an event. ghuì ‘meeting’ 1) Gathering with certain purpose. 2) Certain groups. 3) Temple fair. 4) Collective activities that are organized for civil pilgrim or praying for harvest, such as incense will, temple events, etc. 5) Small-scale mutual assistance economic organization that the joined members pay on average on schedule and they can use the organization in turn. 6) Primary cities. The qualia structure of ghuì ‘meeting’ is depicted below.  huì‘meeting’ FORMAL = meeting (2) QUALIA = CONSTITUTIVE = attendee and topic TELIC = certain purpose AGENTIVE = organize  The qualia structure of jyīnyuè ‘music’ is illustrated below. jyīnyuè ‘music’ FORMAL = auditory communication, entertainment (3) QUALIA = CONSTITUTIVE = songs TELIC = listen AGENTIVE = play; sing; compose  The qualia structure of jgyīnyuèhuì ‘concert’ is shown below.  jgyīnyuèhuì ‘concert’ FORMAL = performance (4) Qualia = CONSTITUTIVE = songs; audience, player TELIC = listen AGENTIVE = play, sing; organize  In the following part, seven evidences show that jgyīnyuè huì‘concert’ usually inherits information from the modifier jyīnyuè‘music’. 514 1) Nominal Modifier of jgyīnyuè huì‘concert’ If we utter Y‹jgBèiduōfēn yīnyuèhuì‘Beethoven concert’ at present time, the nominal modifier Y‹Bèiduōfēn ‘Beethoven’ is the composer. Y‹jgBèiduōfēn yīnyuèhuì ‘Beethoven concert’ is a concert which plays the music composed by Y‹Bèiduōfēn ‘Beethoven’. That is, Y‹Bèiduōfēn ‘Beethoven’ is the composer. (5) Y‹jgBèiduōfēn yīnyuèhuì‘Beethoven concert’ Qualia = AGENTIVE = play music composed by Y‹Bèiduōfēn ‘Beethoven’ (5) shows that the agentive role of Y‹jgBèiduōfēn yīnyuèhuì‘Beethoven concert’ is the same as the ‘compose’ agentive role of jyīnyuè ‘music’ as shown in (3). This indicates that Beethoven modifies the modifier j rather than the head gin the compound jg. In sYUj̄gChén yìxùn yīnyuèhuì ‘the concert of Eason Chan’, the nominal modifier s YUC̄hén yìxùn ‘Eason Chan’ is the singer. sYUj̄gChén yìxùn yīnyuèhuì ‘the concert of Eason Chan’ is a concert on which sYU‘̄Eason Chan’ sings.  (6) sYUj̄gChén yìxùn yīnyuèhuì ‘the concert of Eason Chan’ Qualia = AGENTIVE =sYUC̄hén yìxùn ‘Eason Chan’ sings on the concert  The agentive role of sYUj̄gChén yìxùn yīnyuèhuì ‘the concert of Eason Chan’ is the same as the ‘sing’ agentive role of jyīnyuè ‘music’ as shown in (3). Therefore, Eason Chan modifies jyīnyuè ‘music’ rather than g. In \\c—t4jgxiǎotíqín yīnyuèhuì ‘violin concert’, the nominal modifier \\c—t4xiǎotíqín ‘violin’ is the exclusive instrument used to play music on a concert. The constitutive role of \\ c—t4jgxiǎotíqín yīnyuèhuì ‘violin concert’ is the songs played by violin, which is identical with the constitutive role ‘songs’ of jyīnyuè ‘music’. Thus \\c—t4xiǎotíqín ‘violin’ modifies jyīnyuè ‘music’ instead of g. 2) Adjectival Modifiers of jgyīnyuèhuì‘concert’ |_ivjgjīngcǎide yīnyuèhuì ‘splendid concert’ expresses the splendid music on a concert, not a splendid meeting. Thus, |_ijīngcǎi ‘splendid’ inherits information from jyīnyuè ‘music’ rather than ghuì ‘meeting’. 3) Verbal Modifier of jgyīnyuèhuì‘concert’ The agentive role of shU1jgdúchàng yīnyuèhuì ‘vocal recital’ is ‘sing’; the agentive role of shYOjgdúzòu yīnyuèhuì ‘instrumental recital’ is ‘play’. They are the same as agentive role of jyīnyuè ‘music’ as depicted in (3). 4) Nouns Modified by jgyīnyuèhuì‘concert’ The constitutive role of jgfv yīnyuèhuì qǔmù ‘concert songs’ is the songs on a concert, which is the same as the constitutive role of jyīnyuè ‘music’. 5) jgyīnyuèhuì‘concert’ as a Subject 515 In jgoQœyīnyuèhuì yǎnchū/dúzòu ‘concert performance’, the agentive role is ‘play’, which is identical with the agentive role of jyīnyuè ‘music’, not ghuì ‘meeting’. 6) jgyīnyuèhuì‘concert’ as an Object In F}jglíngtīng yīnyuèhuì ‘listen carefully to a concert’, the constitutive role is songs, which shares the same constitutive role with jyīnyuè ‘music’. 7) Classifiers of jgyīnyuèhuì ‘concert’ In Sjgzhè tái yīnyuèhuì ‘this concert’, Stái is a stage where the performance takes place. Thus it is related to jyīnyuè ‘music’. For ghuì ‘meeting’, it is related to the gathering of audience who seats in the concert hall, not the Stái ‘stage’. In sum, contrary to RHR, the ‘modifier-head’ event noun jgyīnyuèhuì ‘concert’ indicates that the modifier, which is on the left, holds more semantic information gives the event structure of the whole noun, while the head, which is on the right, is more bleached and generic in meaning. Other similar examples are Hgwǔdǎo huì ‘dance party’, oYOgyǎnzòu huì ‘playing concert’, WrG\\Utúpiàn zhǎn ‘photo exhibition’. "]},{"title":"6.2 Inheriting Information from the Head","paragraphs":["It is more conventional that the main information is inherited from the head, which is in conformity with RHR. Examples are shown in (7) and (8).

"]},{"title":"6.3 Inheriting Information from Either the Modifier or the Head","paragraphs":["The semantic information of some compound event nouns can be inherited either from the modifier or the head. 1) Inheriting information from the head (9) W0 b0 æ̃ dìléi zhàn yīngxióng landmine warfare hero ‘heroes in the landmine warfare’ (10) W0 b0 bS Y’ dìléi zhàn yuè dǎ yuè dà landmine warfare more fight more large ‘The Landmine warfare becomes larger and larger.’ 516 In W0b0dìléi zhàn ‘landmine war’, the left morpheme W0dìléi ‘landmine’ is a physical object, while the right morpheme b0zhàn ‘war’ is an event. (9) refers to heroes in b0zhàn ‘wars’ rather than W0dìléi ‘landmine’. In (10), Y’dà ‘large’ modifies the right morpheme b0zhàn ‘wars’ rather than the left morpheme W0dìléi ‘landmine’.  2) Inheriting information from the modifier (11) W0 b0 p‚ x4 eu ‰","dìléi zhàn zhà pò dí dǎn","landmine warfare explode broken enemy gallbladder","‘The landmine warfare frightens the enemy and defeats their morale. ’ In (11), p‚zhà ‘explode’ indicates the exploding event of W0dìléi ‘landmine’ rather than the warfare event of the head b0zhàn ‘wars’. The above examples illustrate that the semantic information of W0b0dìléi zhàn ‘landmine warfare’ can be inherited either from the modifier or the head. A similar example is W0Sb0 dìdào zhàn ‘tunnel warfare’."]},{"title":"7 Conclusion and Future Work","paragraphs":["This study has the following findings for compound event nouns of the ‘modifier-head’ type. 1) Both the modifier and the head can be free or bound morphemes. Moreover, the modifier can be a nominal, adjectival, verbal or numeral morpheme, while the head is a nominal morpheme. Some compound event nouns have a morphologically productive right-side event morpheme. 2) The modifier is a telic, agentive, constitutive or formal role of the head. 3) The modifier can directly or be coerced to represent an event, while the head represents an event all the time. 4) In a compound, the head usually provides the semantic and syntactic information. However, this research finds that the modifier can sometimes provide more semantic information and gives the event structure. For future work, compound event nouns with other syntactic structures, such as coordinative, subject-predicate, need to be investigated in order to get an overall view of event nouns.
