This study incorporates computational and perceptual methods to classify Filipino speech rhythm. Speech rhythm may be described as a language‟s distinguishing durational sound pattern, resulting from the complexity of the language‟s syllable inventory. 1","Computational methods involve the correlation of rhythm-types to acoustic features such as the vocalic and consonantal intervals, one of which is the implementation of Multivariate Discriminant Analysis (MDA). Perceptual methods involve contrasting the rhythm of an unclassified language from prototype syllable-timed and stress-timed sentences. In order to isolate rhythm from speech, a data-stripping technique called flat sasasa resynthesis was implemented wherein the consonants are replaced with /s/ and vowels with /a/, producing a resynthesized alternating “sasasa” sounds at a constant pitch (F0). The rhythm discrimination and classification were closely examined for consistency between the data modeling and listening test results. The computational experiment was able to show that an MDA classifier trained to distinguish English and Japanese sentences tend to label Filipino sentences as Japanese 67% of the time, vis-à-vis the perceptual experiment showing that the listeners perceive Filipino to be more similar with Japanese, this study shows computational and perceptual validation that Filipino is syllable-timed, just like Japanese.

Pitch, duration, and intensity are some of the prosodic components that dictate the naturalness of speech and differentiate contextual meaning. The objective of this study is to present computational analyses and perceptual experiments to confirm the existence and applicability of rhythm classes to Filipino; to find their salient features for computational classification; and to find the rhythm typology of Filipino speech. Among the prosodic characteristics of speech, this study focuses on the temporal or the duration aspect. Speech prosody or suprasegmentals refer to the features of speech that can modify the meaning and information being carried by the words not found in the lexicon. Speech intensity, duration, pitch, and rhythm are the most common features that differentiate one prosodic unit from another. Embedded in the human perception is the distinction of speech rhythm or timing to discriminate between languages. Languages are traditionally classified as stress-timed or syllable-timed where syllable-timed language were said to exhibit near-equal duration for each syllable, and stress-timed languages were said to have near-equal duration between stresses or","","1","Some languages allow a variety of complex syllables Cn","V, CVC, etc., while some languages strictly adhere to","simpler CV syllables (C-consonant, V-vowel).","25th Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation, pages 450–458 450 what is called isochrony (Pike, 1943). Years of research on the subject has shown development in which evidences have been piling up against isochrony theory, and there emerged other rhythm classes such as Mora-timing (Abercrombie, 1967; Benadon, 2009). New models have been developed to accommodate intermediate languages, and a continuous language distribution plane was proposed (Dauer, 1983). Instead of actually having equal duration between stresses and syllables, Dauer observed that the impression of syllable saliency for stress-timed and equal-saliency for syllable-timed is a result of the phonetic inventory, specifically syllable structures, of a language. Dauer‟s continuously-distributed model of rhythm postulates that a characteristic typical to stress-timed languages is a wider syllable inventory (occurrence of Cn","V, CVC, etc.) resulting in heavier intervals. As a result, there are more frequent vowel reductions in the unstressed syllables, in a manner of speaking a compensation for the lengthening. These elements are consistent with stress-timed language‟s underlying concept of syllable stress that makes some syllables longer than others. For languages that seem to be more syllable-timed, it‟s just the opposite of the stress-timed. The simplicity of syllable (frequency of the simpler CV syllables) and fewer vowel reduction results in more controlled syllable durations (Fenk & Fenk-Oczlon, 2006). From these characteristics, some prefer the term compensating and controlling instead of the traditional syllable and stress timing, respectively. Despite Japanese being classified as a distinct rhythm class called Mora (Bloch, 1950), in the course of this paper, we refer to Japanese as “syllable-timed,” in adherence to the phonological model where we considered Japanese Mora as an extreme case of syllable-timing. As shown in (Ramus, Nespor, & Mehler, 1999), Japanese is located at the extreme syllable-timed side of the syllable/stress-time spectrum. Similarly, English was chosen since it has a great degree of stress-timing characteristic (Tajima , 1998)."]},{"title":"2 Material","paragraphs":["For this project, 120 sentences were taken each from Filipino and two other rhythmically distinct prototype languages. English was chosen as the prototype for highly-compensating rhythm or stress-timed, and Japanese for highly-controlling rhythm or syllable-timed.

Syllables were kept at around 11 to 19 per sentence; as much as possible, and the average duration was kept at about 3 seconds per sentence, ranging from 2 to 4 seconds.

Each phone was labeled as either vowel or consonant, with the following rules to be applied: Pre-vocalic glides (as in Filipino /wa/: “wa·lâ” or /yâ/: “kan⋅yâ”) was treated as consonants, whereas post-vocalic glides (as in Filipino /áw/: “i·káw” or /áy/: “ka·máy”) were treated as vowels. This convention was based on the assumption that infants rely on a coarse segmentation of speech; the infant only distinguishes clusters of vowels and non-vowels. Adults have more perceptual cues taken into consideration since they have knowledge of phonotactics and have more linguistic memory. However, the rudimentary vowel-consonant coarse segmentation becomes apparent in situations where the sentences are lexically unintelligible to the adult listener. There are studies done to confirm this inherent human capability (Narayan, 2006), but a simple thought experiment could give us an idea. For example, when listening to a speaker of a completely unfamiliar language, the listener tends to just recognize an alternating pattern of the salient vowels and consonants while maintaining very minimal recognition of specific phonetic sounds. This is the reason why when one tries to mimic a foreign language, just a very small phoneme set is used whereas rhythm is actually retained; case in point, when one tries to mimic a speaker using ‘blah blah blah.’"]},{"title":"3.1 Acoustic Correlates","paragraphs":["For each i-th sentence with Ni and Mi vocalic and consonantal intervals respectively, the duration of the n-th vocalic interval (Vi,n) and the duration of the m-th consonantal interval (Ci,m) were taken from the phonemic transcriptions.

It can be observed that aside from %V and ∆C, ∆V is also a good predictor for rhythm classification which is consistent with (Ramus, Nespor, & Mehler, 1999). It can be said that the results support the suggestion of the Phonological model of rhythm that the variation of rhythm types is a product of respective phonological properties, and that these properties can be independent and cumulative in forming the distinction of a language‟s rhythm.

It is composed of two phases, translation and synthesis. Firstly, the phonetic transcription was translated into unintelligible transcriptions, and then the original speech recordings were reproduced based on the transcriptions. For the transcription translation, adjacent vowels were transformed into a long /a/ and adjacent consonants to one long /s/ sound, while maintaining the duration of the original vocalic and consonantal clusters. The outcome was a transcription of alternating vocalic and consonantal intervals, from which each vocalic interval was replaced by „a‟ and each consonantal interval was replaced by „s.‟ As an example, the phrase “higit sa lahat” will have the following sasasa translation : /h/ /i/ /g/ /i/ /ts/ /a/ /l/ /a/ /h/ /a/ /t/ - /s/ /a/ /s/ /a/ /s/ /a/ /s/ /a/ /s/ /a/ /s/. The resynthesis was done by simply truncating and concatenating pre-recorded /s/ and /a/ segments, using the sasasa transcription as basis. The pitch was held constant by using only one source of /s/ and /a/ sound taken from one recording of the diphone /sa/. In order to lessen the effect of boundary mismatch, the duration of each /s/ and /a/ were controlled by dropping samples at the head and tail of the /sa/ diphone recording."]},{"title":"4.2 Listening Test","paragraphs":["The listening test followed the AAX perceptual test developed by (Ramus, Dupoux, & Mehler, The psychological reality of rhythm classes: perceptual studies., 3 August 2003). It is a modified 2-Interval 2-Alternative Choice (2I2AFC) Test and Same-Different Test (SD), described by the confusion matrix Fig. 3 (a). For each language pair, the subjects were asked to listen to 3 resynthesized (flat sasasa) sentences per trial. The first two sentences were of the same language (AA in AAX), and functions as the context. The third was either the same or a different group (X in AAX). After listening to each AAX group, the subject was asked whether the third sentence (X) was the same language as the previous two (AA). The two alternatives being same and different, makes it basically a Same-Different (SD) test despite taking the form of 3-Interval 2-Alternative Choice (3I2AFC). The inter-stimuli-interval was 500ms as prescribed by RNM which was consistent with the suggestions from (Levitt, 1971) for psychoacoustic tests. The test subjects were given visual cues on the GUI as to which sentence was playing.  Figure 3: AAX Listening Test (a) Confusion Matrix (b) GUI. There were 40 AAX triplets for each language pairing of the three languages: Filipino-Japanese (FJ), Japanese-English (JE), and Filipino-English (FE). The trials were randomly distributed in the test, for a total of 120 trials. It is a basic assumption in psychophysical experiments that there is a level of observer fallibility wherein the observer does not only „miss‟ the presence of a response, but also can falsely assume a positive response (Green & Swets, 1966). Hit and false alarm rates are computed from the correct percent scores. Hit rate (PH) is the proportion of correct “same” trials and false alarm rate (PFA) is the proportion of incorrect “different” trials as indicated in Fig. 3-a. Without going through the intricacies of the complex internal processing procedures of 455 perception, we simplify the analysis of the listening test results from Table 3 by establishing a baseline for discriminability between two disjoint rhythm groups in the JE experiment, and looking for a language pair that has almost a chance-level or “good-as-guess” result of 50%."," Table 3: Listening Test Results  Fil-Eng(FE) Fil-Jap (FJ) Jap-Eng(JE) PFA‟ 64.47 % 59.47 % 73.16 % PH 57.11 % 52.89 % 62.63 % PCmax 60.79 % 56.18 % 67.89 %   The listening test is comprised of 19 listeners, 12 were male and 7 were female. As expected, listeners have performed well in distinguishing Japanese from English just by rhythm alone. Higher discriminability scores for JE test than both the FE and FJ tests is consistent with the result from the objective feature-plane that Filipino rhythm is in-between Japanese and English. For the discrimination of Filipino from English and Japanese, listeners have performed relatively higher for the FE tests. This suggests that Filipino is more similar with the Japanese rhythm, causing the confusion as manifested by the 52% true-positive score (PH), very near the 50% „good as guess‟ performance."]},{"title":"5 Conclusions","paragraphs":["Placing the results on the feature plane, Filipino sentences lie in between Japanese and English, consistent with the suggestion that instead of discrete rhythm classes, rhythm is continuously distributed where opposite sides represent extreme and ideal conditions of syllable and stress timing. On a computational perspective, the acoustic correlates were shown to contribute cumulatively to the distinction of the rhythm of a language. A 3-group, 2-feature to 5-feature MDA classifier was able to identify the languages without the aid of lexical or semantic information at a rate of 67% to 75% accuracy. This characteristic of rhythm, and the significance of the features selected is valuable for Language Identification (LID) systems at the front-end of multilingual speech recognition systems. We have shown that the features for speech rhythm investigated may be used for objective speech rhythm and accent discrimination; hence, the speech rhythm features extraction may be automated to be used in modern automatic speech systems. It can be further expanded to not just discriminate between language, but to be able to distinguish whether a certain sentence is spoken in either its natural rhythm or in a different „accent‟ due to the interference of another language (probably a speaker‟s native tongue). This is especially useful in the context of second-language learning. Language development, historical linguistics, and other linguistic issues can benefit from similarly-done studies to observe the changes in the natural rhythm of Filipino from recordings a couple of years ago to the modern globally-influenced Filipino language. The computational and perceptual experiments yielded supporting results where the MDA predictive model classified the Filipino sentences as Japanese 67% of the time, despite Filipino being closer to English in the sense of Eucledian-mean distance. The perceptual experiment showed that human listeners have a hard time of telling the difference between Japanese and Filipino when presented with the rhythm-isolated sentence, where the correct distinction 52% was very near the chance-level of 50%. Both experiments done in respective objective and subjective manner were showing compelling evidence that Filipino is rhythmically similar to the rhythm of Japanese which is syllable-timed.  456  Table 4: Computational and Perceptual Results Analysis  The combination of computational and perceptual analysis, as summarized in Table 4, can be used as a good interdisciplinary template for resolving some of the issues in Filipino language standardization, and for performing similar tasks for other Philippine-type languages.
