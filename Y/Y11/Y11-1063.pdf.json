This study proposes an index of representativeness for analyzing the characteristics of academic paper categories.

The number of tokens, i.e., the frequency of words in a document, is the simplest. Some indices use information related to words that appear only one or two times in the text, while others take the entire frequency spectrum into account (Kageura, 2000; Tweedie and Baayen, 1998). Textual indices have been studied for various applications such as authorship analysis, genre detection, and chronological text mining (Argamon et al., 2007; Koppel et al., 2009; Stamatatos, 2009), but they have three flaws in common: (a) they shed light only on the styles of text; (b) they return an absolute value, meaning that they do not consider the relative values for different keyword sets or the relative position of a document in the document set; and (c) they are based on the number of tokens.","Our problem is the use of textual indices to analyze the characteristics of the categories of academic papers. Since a wide variety of texts are available, these types of the ‘characterization’ problems, as well as the ‘classification’ problems, are currently increasing in importance. To deal with the characterization problems, we aim at deriving a meaningful level of knowledge ⋆ This study was supported by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research 21800087 for Young Scientists (Start-up) and 23700288 for Young Scientists (B), from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Sciences and Technology, Japan, and Grant for joint research from National Institute of Informatics.

Our categories are stylistic (genre) as well as content-dependent (subfield); thus, our index must be capable of analyzing both of them. The categories we deal with are similar to each other but different from the conventional ones used in genre detection or topic classification. Thus, it is desirable for our index to be able to deal with the relative position of a document in a document set. Token number-based indices have a common problem in that they are affected by several frequent words. This means we should create indices that do not directly use a token number that will also require less computational effort.","Against this background, we propose an index of representativeness that overcomes the drawbacks of the previously used indices. Our index is based on the h-index that was originally proposed in the field of scientometrics (Hirsch, 2005). After transforming this index for textual data, we use it for measuring how well a document represents the entire document set regarding several perspectives determined by keyword lists. It can analyze stylistic categories as well as content-dependent ones; our index uses content words (keyword lists); that means it can be used for analyzing content-dependent categories. Furthermore, it is based on the rank-type information, instead of the token-number information; that means it can be used for analyzing genre-based categories, because the rank-type information is usually considered to represent styles (Tweedie and Baayen, 1998). Our index captures both stylistic and content-dependent characteristics (Suzuki and Kageura, 2007) based on this information. In addition, it can use different keyword lists and takes into consideration the relative position of a document in a document set; and it also uses the ranks of the types, i.e., the ranked frequencies of different words (keywords) appearing in a document. We assessed the effectiveness of our index in analyzing the different characteristics of four genres and three subfields in Japanese academic papers.","The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We first explain the original h-index and its characteristics in Section 2. In Section 3, we explain the proposed method, including the redefinition of the index for textual data. We explain the experimental setup in Section 4 and discuss the results in Section 5. We review the related work in Section 6 and conclude with final remarks in Section 7."]},{"title":"2 h-index","paragraphs":["The h-index was first proposed in the field of scientometrics by (Hirsch, 2005) and is defined as follows. A scientist has index h if h of his or her X papers each have at least h citations and the other (X − h) papers each have ≤ h citations.","For example, a scientist whose h is 30 has published 30 papers, each of which has at least 30 citations.","This index has many advantages over other indices. Other possible indices and their limitations are as follows: (a) the total number of papers is not a measure of the importance or impact of papers; (b) the total number of citations can be inflated by a small number of highly cited papers; (c) the citations per paper rewards low productivity papers while it penalizes high productivity papers; (d) the number of significant papers is arbitrary as to the ‘significance’ criteria; and (e) the number of citations for each of the q most-cited papers is not a single number and is more complicated to obtain and compare. The h-index avoids all the drawbacks of these indices, yet it can measure the broad impact of scientists’ productivity. That is why it is one of the most frequently used indices for evaluating the scientific research. It was pointed out that the h-index can be defined and used for any data that follows a power law (Egghe and Rousseau, 2006b). Here, we shall redefine it for textual data. There are many modifications and sophistications associated with this index for better interpreting the phenomena in scientometrics (Egghe and Rousseau, 2006a; Sidiropoulos et al., 2007), but most of these modifications and sophistications"]},{"title":"588","paragraphs":["do not directly lead to better interpreting the textual data from our point of view, thus we added our own modifications to this index."]},{"title":"3 Proposed method","paragraphs":["First, we briefly describe our method and our redefinition of the h-index. After that, we explain the keyword lists used in the experiment."]},{"title":"3.1 Overview","paragraphs":["We analyze the characteristics of categories according to the following process. (i.) Given a target category (a set of documents), (ii.) extract a set of words using the keyword lists,1 (iii.) collect the document frequencies (DF (w, d)) of (ii) in (i), (iv.) using (iii), calculate the t/b ratio (see below) for each document in a category. (v.) The category index is the median and the iqr value of (iv). 3.1.1 Redefinition of h-index for textual data Our basic idea is to deal with the scientometric data and textual data from the integrated viewpoint of quantitative informatics. Although making a reference to a paper and using a word in a paper seems to be a different activity, many previous studies have indicated that the mathematical and quantitative characteristics shown in these two phenomena were very similar to each other.2","Accordingly, we can define the relations between these two types of data as follows. • researchers: documents, • number of publications: number of word types included in the document,","• number of citations: number of documents including the word types, i.e., document frequencies (DF (w, d)). The redefined h-index for the textual data is basically as follows. A document has an index h if h of its X word types each have DF (w, d) ≥ h and the other (X − h) word types each have DF (w, d) ≤ h.","This index, based on the information about the ranks of the types instead of the number of tokens, reflects how general words (words with high DF (w, d)) are used in the texts. It is an index of the ‘representativeness’ of the text in a document set. A high h-value means that general words are frequently used in the texts, whereas a low h-value means that general words are infrequently used in the texts. This index is superior to indices (a) - (e) mentioned in Section 2 because it succeeds the characteristics of the original h-index. 3.1.2 Scaling The number of types and DF (w, d) are quite different in scale from the number of publications and the number of citations; thus, we shall use the following scaling.3","DF ′ (w, d) = ⌊DF (w, d) × α × VN (d)","maxw∈ω(DF (w, d)) ⌋ 1 In this paper, we used keyword lists for extracting a set of words, but part-of-speech tags or automatic term extraction can also be used according to the purposes and target data of the researches. 2 We will investigate the reason for this in future. See also (Egghe, 2009; Kageura, 2000). 3 The number of publications of an author will be at most 101","(yearly) to scale and the number of citations of a paper will be at most 1010","(yearly) to scale, but the number of types and DF will have larger differences in many cases."]},{"title":"589 Table 1:","paragraphs":["Basic data of our corpora","IPSJ author","VN (d) VN (d)","doc median iqr doc median iqr JNL 2452 91 31.00 2753 220 80.00 MAG 1194 75 41.00 1212 201 100.25 SIG 6751 63 29.00 7333 152 76.00 TRANS 933 96 31.00 1035 214 75.50 CS 2113 65 33.00 2328 141 120.25 IE 2856 61 24.00 3108 155 66.00 FR 1782 66 30.00 1897 162 77.00 where maxw∈ω(DF (w, d)) represents the maximum DF (w, d) value of the keyword w in keyword lists ω for every document, and VN (d) represents the number of types, i.e., the number of different keywords appearing in the document.","The scaling factors adjust the difference in scale between VN (d) and DF (w, d). In particular, the α parameter determines the best ratio between VN (d) and DF (w, d) for every used dataset; a higher (lower) α means that a larger (smaller) number of types are included in h. We select the α that gives the highest inter-quartile range (iqr), from 0.1 to 3.0 incremented by 0.1, because large variances between documents are desirable for our purposes. Moreover, by observing the stability of the results after changing α, we can confirm the reliability of the results.4","The final definition of our h-index for textual data is as follows.

It is not necessary to use several keyword lists for our methods, but by selecting two different (or opposite) types of keywords, we will strengthen our discussion of the results. In this study, we used keyword lists that included (a) general and (b) specific keywords in the field of information sciences, and then we can effectively analyze the characteristics of four genres and three subfields in Japanese academic papers.","More precisely, we extracted keywords from the data by using two keyword lists: (a) the IPSJ handbook index list (Joho Syori Gakkai, 1995) and (b) the author index list. List (a) is an index that includes 5,958 basic, low-expertise terms used in information sciences. List (b) is an index list that includes 16,935 terms that authors themselves added to their papers. While (a) includes basic conceptual keywords used in information sciences, it also (b) includes high expertise keywords based on the authors’ selection. List (b) also includes numbers, mathematical expressions, and symbols. Both of them include high frequency words as well as low frequency words, and include terminology words as well as rather general words. After we applied morphological analysis to the data and keyword lists, we extracted the keywords by matching. Note that we used a Japanese morphological analysis system called MeCab5","for this purpose.","We use these two types of keywords for calculating the h′","-index in order to shed light on the different characteristics of the genres and subfields; i.e., the t/b ratio using IPSJ keywords should show the representativeness for basic, low-expertise keywords, and the t/b ratio using the author keywords should show the representativeness of special, high-expertise keywords.
