In this paper, we proposed a novel approach for Tibetan word segmentation using the conditional random field. We reformulate the segmentation as a syllable tagging problem. The approach labels each syllable with a word-internal position tag, and combines syllable(s) into words according to their tags. As there is no public available Tibetan word segmentation corpus, the training corpus is generated by another segmenter which has an F-score of 96.94% on the test set. Two feature template sets namely TMPT-6 and TMPT-10 are used and compared, and the result shows that the former is better. Experiments also show that larger training set improves the performance significantly. Trained on a set of 131,903 sentences, the segmenter achieves an F-score of 95.12% on the test set of 1,000 sentences.

At present, Tibetan script is used to write both Tibetan language and Dzongkha (Bhutanese) language. The former is a language spoken by about 6 million people in China, India, Bhutan, Sikkim, Ladakh and Nepal, while the later is spoken by about 130,000 people in Bhutan as a national and official language.","Just like Chinese, Tibetan text is written without natural word delimiters, so word segmentation is an essential, fundamental and foremost step in Tibetan language processing. Researchers mainly use maximum matching method and some grammar rules to segment Tibetan text at present.","In this paper, we reformulate Tibetan word segmentation as a syllable tagging problem, and propose an approach using the conditional random field (CRF) for Tibetan word segmentation. The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we recall related work on Tibetan word segmentation and Chinese word segmentation methods by character tagging. In Section 3, we simply introduce Tibetan script. We propose the approach in Section 4. Then, in Section 5 we make experiments to evaluate the segmenter, compare it with other Tibetan segmenters.

Syllables are separated by a marker known as “tsheg”, which is simply a superscripted dot. Linguistic words are made up of one or more syllables and are also separated by the same symbol, “tsheg”, thus there is a lack of word boundaries in the language.

For example, when the genitive case word “” follows the word “ལ་” (king), we dont put a “tsheg” between them and get the fused form “ལ་” (king[+genitive]), in which “” is an abbreiated syllable. When the ergative case word “ས” follows the word “ང་” (we), it forms “ང་ས” (we[+ergative]), in which “ས” is an abbreviated syllable. In the above two examples, either abbreviated syllable should be broken into two parts while segmenting, and the left part has to be combined with the previous syllable(s) to form a word, while the right part is a 1-syllable word. In addition, the word before the AM can be 1-syllable word.

At present, almost all Tibetan segmenters are using maximum matching method based on dictionary except the proposed one. All of them have inherent weakness on segmentation disambiguation and Out-Of-Vocabulary word identification. The proposed approach doesn’t have those weakness. What is more, our segmenter is test on a larger test set. Considering these factors, our approach is effective and acceptable."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Cairangjia. 2009.
