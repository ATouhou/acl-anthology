This is the third time that the PACLIC conference comes to Singapore after its two previous visits in 1998 and 2003. This year, the PACLIC 25 is organized by Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and the Chinese and Oriental Languages Information Processing Society (COLIPS).","The PACLIC conference has a long history, dating back to 1982. Over the years, the conference has developed into one of the leading conferences in the research community. Like previous PACLIC conferences, PACLIC 25 has received a wide range of interesting research papers in the fields of theoretical and computational linguistics. The specific research topics that the papers focus on can be classified into the following: cognitive linguistics, corpus linguistics, discourse analysis, formal grammar theory, grammar and parsing, human and machine language processing, information extraction, information retrieval, language acquisition, language resources, language technology and its application, machine translation, morphology, natural language processing, phonology, pragmatics, semantics, speech processing, syntax, and typology.","The paper submissions we received are from 21 countries or regions, including Australia, Canada, China, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Korea, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and the United States of America. To ensure that all papers accepted meet the high quality standard of the PACLIC conference, we had each submission reviewed by three to four experts in the field. As a result, of the 125 valid submitted papers, we accepted 50 (40%) for oral presentations and 25 (20%) for poster sessions.","With such a wide variety of research topics to be presented and participants from all over the world, we believe that this conference will be a truly stimulating scholarly forum. New research findings, new approaches, new ideas for tackling technical challenges and further explorations of a particular research topic, and new information on current research trends will be discussed and shared both within and across disciplines. This scenario is the sign of a most successful conference, which will benefit all the participants as well as the development of the research fields.","A successful conference is the result of many people’s efforts and contributions. The quality papers included in the program are the results of our participants’ on-going contributions as well as the tremendous efforts made by the program committee members in their paper reviews. Besides the oral and poster paper presentations, the program is enriched by the keynote and invited speakers, Professor Paul Kay from the University of California at Berkeley, Professor Key-Sun Choi from KAIST, and Dr Jian Su, Senior Scientist from the Institute for Infocomm Research. We have also scheduled a panel discussion on multilingualism by several distinguished experts. The panel will be chaired by Prof James German from Nanyang Technology University and the discussion will be led by presentations from Prof Chu-Ren Huang from Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Prof Laurent Prevot from Aix en Provence, and Prof Francis Bond from Nanyang Technology University. Their expertise in their respective fields will provide us with new insights for the current and future research. On behalf of the program committee, we express our heartfelt thanks to them all.","We would like to thank the steering committee for their guidance, and the local organizing committee chaired by Professor Francis Bond at Nanyang Technological University and Dr. Min Zhang at the Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore, for their dedicated efforts and their excellent coordination with all parties, which has ensured that this conference will be a successful event.","Finally, we wish that you will all enjoy the conference presentations, discussions, and exchanges between old and new friends on the beautiful campus of NTU.

The basic insight on which this approach to MWEs is based holds that many or all MWEs can be analyzed as composed exclusively of special idiom lexemes, frequently homophonous with canonical (non-idiom) lexemes; these interact with the familiar phrasal constructions of the grammar to license idiomatic expressions. The original insight is due to Nunberg et al. (1994). The framework in which the theory is expressed is Sign-Based Construction Grammar (SBCG), which combines some of the insights of Berkeley Construction Grammar (Fillmore et al. 1988, Kay and Fillmore 1999) with recent developments in HPSG (Sag 2010, to appear). Part of the purpose of the talk will be to introduce some of the workings of SBCG via informal exemplification."]},{"title":"Biodata","paragraphs":["Paul Kay is Emeritus Professor of Linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley.

Key-Sun Choi, KAIST, Korea Abstract","paragraphs":["If we call Wikipedia or Wiktionary as “web knowledge resource”, the question is about whether they can contribute to NLP itself and furthermore to the knowledge resource for knowledge-leveraged computational thinking. Comparing with the structure inside WordNet from the view of its human-encoded precise classification scheme, such web knowledge resource has category structure based on collectively generated tags and structures like infobox. They are called also as “Collectively Generated Content” and its structuralized content based on collective intelligence. It is heavily based on linking among terms and we also say that it is one member of linked data. The problem is in whether such collectively generated knowledge resource can contribute to NLP and how much it can be effective.","The more clean primitives of linked terms in web knowledge resources will be assumed, based on the essential property of Guarino (2000) or intrinsic property of Mizoguchi (2004). The number of entries in web knowledge resources increases very fast but their inter-relationships are indirectly calculated by their link structure. We can imagine that their entries could be mapped to one of instances under some structure of primitive concepts, like synsets of WordNet. Let’s name such primitives to be “intrinsic tokens” that are derived from collectively generated knowledge resource under the principles of intrinsic properties. The procedure could be approximately proven and it will be a kind of statistical logic. We then go to the issues about what area of NLP can be solved by the so-called intrinsic tokens and their relations, a resultant approximately generated primitives.","Can NLP contribute to the user generation process of content? Consider the structure of infobox in Wikipedia more closely. It will be discussed about how NLP can help the population of relevant entries, like the social network mechanism for multi-lingual environment and information extraction purpose.","The traditional NLP starts from words in text but now also works have been undergoing on the web corpus with hyperlinks and html markups. In web knowledge resources, the words and chunks have underlying URIs, a kind of annotation. It signals a new paradigm of NLP."]},{"title":"Biodata","paragraphs":["Dr. Key-Sun Choi is a tenured full professor and the head of Computer Science Department, KAIST, Korea.

Despite its importance, it was merely discussed in previous studies. In this talk, I present our recent work on a globally optimized coreference resolution system dedicated to various sophisticated event coreference phenomena. Seven resolvers for both event and object coreference cases are utilized, which include 5 event coreference resolvers for event NP-NP, Verb-NP, Verb-Pron, NP-Pron as well as Verb Verb cases with quite some linguistic features different from the object counterparts. Three enhancements are further proposed at both mention pair detection and chain formation levels. First, the object coreference resolvers are used to effectively reduce the false positive cases for event coreference. Second, a revised instance selection scheme is proposed to improve link level mention-pair model performances. Last but not least, an efficient and globally optimized graph partitioning model is employed for coreference chain formation using spectral partitioning which allows the incorporation of pronoun coreference information. The three techniques contribute to a significant improvement of 8.54% in B3 F-score for event coreference resolution on OntoNotes 2.0 corpus."]},{"title":"Biodata","paragraphs":["Jian Su is a senior scientist and group leader at the Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore.
