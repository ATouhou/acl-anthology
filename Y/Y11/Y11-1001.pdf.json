Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) system uses dictionaries for information retrieval. However, out of vocabulary (OOV) terms cannot be found in dictionaries. Although many researchers in the past have endeavored to solve the OOV term translation problem, but little attention has been paid to hybrid translations “α1-antitrypsin deficiency (α1-抗胰蛋白酶缺乏症)”. This paper presents a novel OOV term translation mining approach, which proposes a new adaptive rules system for hybrid translations and a new recursive feature selection method for supervised machine learning. We evaluate the propose method with English-Chinese OOV term translation. Our experiments show that adaptive rules system and recursive feature selection with Bayesian Net can significantly outperform existing supervised models.

To ensure a perfect CLIR system, it must use a perfect multilingual dictionary. However, a perfect multilingual dictionary would never be existed due to OOV terms. OOV terms are typically new terms that cannot be found in dictionaries, such as personal names, place names, new technical terms and translated words etc. New OOV terms are emerging every day, this makes it difficult for multilingual dictionaries to cover all translations of OOV terms. Generally speaking, OOV terms can be translated by three methods, they are: human translation with field of specified knowledge; automatic translation from parallel corpus or comparable corpus (Zhou, Truran et al. 2008); and automatic mining from the Internet (Lu, Chien et al. 2004). Most OOV terms have their correspondent human translation nearby on the Internet (Cheng, Teng et al. 2004; Zhang, Huang et al. 2005; Udupa, K et al. 2009). The quality of the translation is incomparable between human translation and automatic translation. However, automatic translation offers the speed and low cost over human translation. While automatic mining takes the advantage of both human and automatic translation. The translations mined from the Internet are usually high quality and require low man power cost. According to our observation, some translations of the technical OOV term are hybrid translations. Hybrid translations use part target language and part source language, for example, a English OOV term: “DiGeorge's syndrome” and its Chinese translation “DiGeorge's 症候群”. “DiGeorge's” are source languages and “症候群” are target languages. Solving Hybrid translations is important because existing approaches would retrieve “ 症 候 群 ” as the translation of “DiGeorge's syndrome”. If this translation is applied to CLIR, many disease documents unrelated to “DiGeorge's syndrome” will be retrieved, because many Chinese medical terms end with the term “症候群”. In this paper, we propose an OOV term translation method that employs the automatic mining, a novel adaptive rules system for hybrid translations, and a novel recursive feature selection using supervised machine learning by Bayesian net with Adaboost.  25th Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation, pages 1–10 1"]},{"title":"2 Related Research Work","paragraphs":["Many researchers in the past have endeavored to solve the OOV term translation problem (Cheng, Teng et al. 2004; Lu, Chien et al. 2004; Zhang and Vines 2004; Zhang and Vines 2004; Zhang, Vines et al. 2005; Yuejie, Yang et al. 2009). However, new OOV terms are emerging every day, a perfect method that is able to handle all OOV terms is yet to be discovered. Existing methods for name type OOV terms usually cannot handle technical type OOV terms (Zhang and Vines 2004). Zhang and Vines extract 30 Chinese characters before and after the OOV term when source OOV term is found, then they use lengths and frequencies of translation candidates to select the correct translation. Most researchers approach the OOV term problems with brute force translation candidate extraction (Cheng, Teng et al. 2004; Zhang and Vines 2004), this approach may generate many noises, and it is difficult to handle technical type OOV terms. Especially for hybrid type translations which use part target language and part source language “DiGeorge's syndrome (DiGeorge's 症 候 群 )”, “α1-antitrypsin deficiency (α1- 抗胰蛋白酶缺乏症)”. Recently, many researchers started to translate the OOV terms using supervised machine learning (Tiffin, Kelso et al. 2005). Never the less feature selection has always been a problem for supervised machine learning. Traditional feature selections may be time and memory consuming to get high performance. Many supervised machine learning approaches for OOV term translation use support vector machine (SVM) as the classifier for translation selection (Yuejie, Yang et al. 2009), Yuejie, Yang et al. use PAT-tree and local maximum algorithm to extract the Chinese translations, then use SVM to select the correct translations. However, SVM works well with OOV terms that have similar properties. Technical OOV terms have very different properties, some can be found in over 100 webpage on the Internet, while others can be found in as little as 3 webpages on the Internet. We propose an OOV term translation method with a novel adaptive rules system for translation candidate extraction to reduce the noise and to handle hybrid translations. We also propose a new recursive feature selection method to gain the advantage of better feature set and high speed with low memory usage. We employee Bayesian Net which can handle diversity of OOV terms together with Meta level-Adaboost that helps with over fitting.","OOV query","SnippetsInternet","retrieval","Regular expression Translation candidates Adoptive rules","T","r","a n s l a t","i","o","n","","features","Feature extraction Internet feature","extraction Selected features Feature selection","update Translation selection Selected translations Translation Selection using","updated features","","Figure 1: Flow chart of our proposed approach"]},{"title":"3 The Proposed Method","paragraphs":["Our approach is developed into four parts, they are: firstly, the Internet retrieval; secondly, the translation candidate extraction; thirdly, the feature extraction and finally the translation selection.

According to our observation, we found out some hybrid translations of the OOV terms may not only use the target language alphabets or characters, but also use some alphabets, characters or symbols from the source language. We propose to include the alphabets, characters or symbols of the source language by using an adaptive rules system.","The adaptive rules system uses a set of predefined regular expression matching rules as the base rules. The base rules are modified by each OOV term to form the adapted regular expression matching rules for translation candidate extraction. The base regular expression matching rules are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Regular expression matching rules # Regular expression matching rules 1 Chinese characters 2 Chinese characters/Other characters 3 Chinese characters/Other characters/Chinese characters 4 Chinese characters/Other characters/Chinese characters/Other characters 5 Other characters/Chinese characters 6 Other characters/Chinese characters/Other characters 7 Other characters/Chinese characters/Other characters/Chinese characters Note: Chinese characters = all Chinese characters","Other characters = all non-Chinese language alphabets, characters, symbols.   The adaptive rules system is developed as follows. Let Sn be the snippets retrieved from the Internet, OOV be the source OOV terms, A be any alphabets, characters or symbols, Ac be any Chinese characters, Re be regular expression matching rules, Ar be adopted matching rules, and Tc be Chinese translation candidates. For each OOV term, if it is found in the snippets, we add the substring of the OOV term to the regular expression matching rules to create the adopted matching rules. Then we scan for the nearest Chinese character in front of or after the OOV terms. Once we find the Chinese character, we try to match the string around the Chinese character with the adopted matching rules. If there are one or more rules that match the string, we extract the matched parts of the string as the Chinese translation candidates. The detailed algorithm of this method is explained below. Algorithm Translation candidate extraction Input: Snippets retrieved from the Internet Sn, OOV terms OOV, Any alphabets, characters or symbols A, Any Chinese characters Ac, Regular expression matching rules Re,  Output: Adopted matching rules Ar, Chinese Translation candidates Tc,  For each OOV found in Sn do Ar = Re + Substring OOV, If (Ac found in front or behind OOV)then Continue; If(Ar found near Ac+A)then Matching Ar with Ac+A; Tc = Ac+A; End End End 3 An example of translation candidate extraction is shown in Table 2. As can be seen from this example, the OOV term is α1-antitrypsin deficiency, we created the adopted matching rules using the substring of the OOV and the base regular expression matching rules in Table 1.

These features include: average distances, co-occurrence distance, term frequencies, symmetric conditional probability (SCP), modified association measures, chi-square, lengths of OOV and translation, and length similarity. We describe the details of these features as follows.  1) Distances between OOV and translation The closer a translation candidate to its source OOV term the more likely that translation is correct (Cheng, Teng et al. 2004). Some translations occur in front and after the OOV term, but some translations only occur in front or after the OOV term. To present the actual locations between the OOV and translations, we need to consider the average distance , average front distance and the average back distance .  2) Co-occurrence distance Co-occurrence distance is the sum of average distance between OOV and translation candidate over the co-occur frequency between OOV and translation candidate. It is computed as follows. ","    (1) A modification of this feature ( ) was proposed by (Yuejie, Yang et al. 2009), they use the web retrieved page count instead of the . It is computed as follows.

Equation (2) shows the calculation of , where is the web retrieved page count of translation candidate.  3) Term frequencies Term Frequencies are very important statistical features for OOV term translation, the more a translation co-occurs with an OOV term the more likely to be the correct translation. We collect 4 the term frequencies of the translation candidates , OOV , and the co-occur frequencies of translations and OOV . Furthermore, to cope with the average front distance and average back distances, we also collect the front frequency and back frequency for the translation candidates.  4) Symmetrical Conditional Probability Symmetrical Conditional Probability ( ) (Silva, Jos et al. 1999; Cheng, Teng et al. 2004; Lu, Xu et al. 2007) checks each alphabet, character and substring in the possible translation. By calculating the frequency of each substring in the corpus and compare them to the frequency of the translation, it results higher if the substrings of the translation occur less often in the corpus than they occur only within the translation itself. If a translation has higher SCP value, the translation is more likely to be a word phrase and less likely to be a sentence.  "," ∑    (3)  Equation (3) shows the calculation of SCP, where is any possible translation candidates, is the number of characters in this translation candidate, is the frequency of the translation candidate, and or is the frequency of any substring of the translation candidate.  5) Modified Association Measures We propose the modified association measures, which do not require the total number of pages in the Internet. They take the webpage count of OOVs , translations , the webpage count of OOVs co-occur with translations and the webpage count of OOVs occur without translations from the Internet. These features utilize the search engines to remove some possible wrong translation candidates, because search engines use some predefined segmentation tools to eliminate the meaningless Chinese strings.","a) Support Support is an undirected measure that finds the ratio when and occur together in a same webpage, and it is computed as follow.

It is developed into two parts, the statistical filter, and the Bayesian net candidate selection with recursive feature selections. One OOV term can retrieve up to few hundreds of translation candidates, most of them are substrings of the correct translation, and some of them are the longer strings of the correct translation. Two features in our feature set can simply filter some wrong candidates, they are co-occur frequency ) and location distance ( ). Both features are very important to the candidate selection, if a Chinese translation co-occurs very often with the source English OOV term and this translation is found very close to the source English OOV term, then this translation may less likely be the wrong translation (noise). Our filter takes the top 70% of the co-occur frequency and the shortest location distance between OOV and the translations. A recall test was performed to evaluate the setting of this filter, the result is shown in Figure 3.   Figure 3: Recalls of frequency rank  To handle the diversity of OOV terms, we employed the Bayesian net which can establish an inference reasoning and causality between OOV terms and the translation candidates. We also employ the Meta level-Adaboost to handle the over fitting problems (Rapidminer 2009). In order to achieve a low memory usage and high performance feature selection method, we developed a recursive feature selection method. This method loops backward elimination by updating the inputting feature sets with the selected features from the backward elimination. This method is developed as follows. Let OOV be OOV terms, Tc be translation candidates, F be inputting feature sets, N be number of iterations, Ct be Chinese translations, and SF be selected feature sets. We use Bayesian net for candidate selection with N times of iterations, backward elimination is employed as the base feature selection method. For each iteration, a set of features will be selected by backward elimination, we then update the inputting feature set for next iteration with the selected features from backward elimination. The detailed algorithm of this approach is shown below. Algorithm Recursive feature selections Input: OOV terms OOV, Translation candidates Tc, Inputting Feature sets F, Number of Iterations N.

The Bayesian net with Adaboost outperforms SVM in translation candidate selection with an accuracy of 91.17%.
