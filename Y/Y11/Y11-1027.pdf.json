This paper outlines the creation of the Wordnet Bahasa as a resource for the study of lexical semantics in the Malay language. It is created by combining information from several lexical resources: the French-English-Malay dictionary FEM, the KAmus Melayu-Inggeris KAMI, and wordnets for English, French and Chinese. Construction went through three steps: (i) automatic building of word candidates; (ii) evaluation and selection of acceptable candidates from merging of lexicons; (iii) final hand check of the 5,000 core synsets. Our Wordnet Bahasa is only in the first phase of building a full fledged wordNet and needs to be further expanded, however it is already large enough to be useful for sense tagging both Malay and Indonesian.

However, WordNet, originally created by academics at Princeton University, is just as important if not greater (Fellbaum, 1998). In fact, it is a source of reference that takes the traditional dictionary to a whole new level. While a dictionary can provide information such as the meaning, synonyms and parts of speech, and can organise them in alphabetical order, a wordnet is able to organise the words into a set of cognitive synonyms (synsets) which express distinct concepts. This reason has been the motivation for the creation of the various wordnets for various languages.","There is currently no wordnet available for Malay despite the great number of wordnets available for many languages. Hence, this paper will attempt to create a lexical database for the Malay language based on alignments with other lexical resources — the French-English-Malay (FEM) dictionary, the English wordnet, KAMI and wordnets for Chinese and French. Crossing lexicons over several languages contributes to the accuracy of the Wordnet Bahasa. This wordnet will be released under an open source license (Creative Commons Attribution) in order to make it fully accessible to all potential users.","Bahasa Melayu “the Malay language” is one that had been standardized over time with the aim of formal usage of the language. It derived from the variety of Malay languages that exist in the different parts of the Malay Archipelago, and is now widely used in Malaysia, Singapore, parts of Thailand and Brunei. The language spoken in Indonesia (Bahasa Indonesia) is very similar, and largely mutually intelligible. In this paper we will use Malay for standard Malay (the official language of Malaysia, ISO 639-3 code zsm), Indonesian to refer to the official language of Indonesia (ind) and Bahasa to refer to the generic Malay language that includes both (msa). Bahasa is the official language of four South Eastern Asian countries, namely Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei and ⋆","We would like to thank Key-Sun Choi for allowing us to use the Goi-Taikei–CoreNet–Wordnet mappings; Nippon","Telegraph and Telephone Corporation for allowing us to use KAMI, the FEM developers for allowing us to use FEM,","and all the developers of the various Wordnets.

Some people from The Philippines, Thailand, Burma, Sri Lanka, Cocos Island and Christmas Island also use it. There are about 40 million native Bahasa speakers worldwide.1","Spelling reforms in the 1970s harmonized the orthographic conventions of Malay and Indonesian, making the written forms very similar (Asmah Haji Omar, 1975). Because of the enormous overlap in vocabulary (close to 98% by our measure, see Section 4.3) we decided it was possible to create a single wordnet for both languages: the Wordnet Bahasa. The vast majority of words are usable for both Malay and Indonesian and we specially mark those words that are used exclusively in one language. We hope that by building a single, open wordnet for both Malay and Indonesian we can help to create a strong lexical resource for the region."]},{"title":"2 Previous Work","paragraphs":["The most common approaches to building a wordnet for a new language are automatic or semi automatic approaches. There are two main methods: the merge and the extend approach (Vossen, 2005). The merge approach would require the construction of an independent lexicon for a certain language based on monolingual resources, after which, it is mapped to other wordnets. The extend approach on the other hand is executed by obtaining a set of synsets from Princeton WordNet (PWN), and then translating it into the target language. This method allows the preservation of the original structure of the wordnet. We have opted for the extend approach both because of its simplicity and because the resulting wordnet is automatically aligned to all other wordnets.","The idea of extending the synsets with reference from not just the PWN but at least one other wordnet in a different language provides a much stronger foundation laid before the construction of a new wordnet. In Bond et al. (2008), the authors pointed out that by using wordnets in multiple languages to disambiguate the target language (Japanese in their study), a more reliable prototype could be provided. This multiple-pivot technique was then adapted to suit the needs of the Wordnet Bahasa, as will be explained in the next section.","There has already been some work on building wordnets for Malay and Indonesian. Lim and Hussein (2006) serves as a good head start for the building of a Malay wordnet. The paper suggests finding the prototype based on sense alignments with Kamus Inggeris Melayu Dewan (KIMD) and the English wordnet.","According to Lim and Hussein (2006), this “. . . fast prototyping exercise (would require the creation of) semantic relations between the Malay synsets based on the existing relations between their English equivalents”. This method is an elaboration of the merge methodology. Lim and Hussein (2006) managed to build 12,429 noun synsets and 5,805 verb synsets. While this is by no means exhaustive, it is at the very least a rough gage of the minimum possible range of words in a Malay wordnet. In the final discussion of the paper, Lim and Hussein (2006) point out that the bottleneck for their prototype “is in the dictionary used”. Unfortunately, we do not have access to the same Malay lexicon, so we cannot directly implement their approach.","There have been two approaches to building an Indonesian wordnet. The first was an expand approach, and created a small prototype (Putra et al., 2008). The second also used an expand approach, and then corrected entries using the infrastructure from the Asian Wordnet Project (Riza et al., 2010). The Indonesian Wordnet at the Asian Wordnet currently has 33,726 synsets; 38,394 words and 65,206 senses (word-synset pairs).2","The lexicons used to expand were bilingual English-Indonesian and thus did not enable the use of multiple pivots."]},{"title":"3 Resources","paragraphs":["We used two lexicons: FEM, which contains entries with French, English and Malay as well as hypernyms in French; and KAMI, which contains Malay, English and Chinese as well as semantic classes from the Goi-Taikei ontology. 1 http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=msa 2 http://id.asianwordnet.org/"]},{"title":"256","paragraphs":["We used four wordnets: one for English, one for Chinese and two for French as the original French Wordnet has not been maintained, so we supplemented it with the new Wordnet Liberé du Franca̧is (WOLF).

To map between the Goi-Taikei ontology and wordnet, we used the mappings produced by CoreNet (Kang et al., 2010)."]},{"title":"3.1 Malay Lexicons","paragraphs":["We used two lexicons FEM and KAMI.","The Malay-English Dictionary KAMI: KAmus Melayu-Inggeris was compiled by NTT-MSC (Quah et al., 2001), based on a dictionary produced originally by a translation company. The dictionary currently has 67,670 Malay words with English translations. 69% have only one translation, 19% have two, 7% have three; the average number of translations is 1.57, giving 106,558 Malay-English pairs.","Each entry in the dictionary consists of the following fields: (1) Malay index word; (2) Malay root word; (3) Malay POS; (4) detailed syntactic features; (5) semantic classes; (6) English translation; (7) English comments; (8) Chinese translation. All entries have values for fields 1,2 and 3; most have syntactic features. 22% have Chinese translations and 28% have semantic classes from the Goi-Taikei (GT) ontology (Ikehara et al., 1997). The Goi-Taikei ontology consists of 2,710 semantic classes, providing an upper level ontology. It was originally designed for Japanese, but has also been used for Chinese, English, Korean and Malay.","English and Chinese translations and comments are provided for use in a machine translation system, as well as an aid for non-Malay speakers. Semantic classes were automatically produced from a variety of sources, including deducing them from the associated classifiers and finding them in other lexicons or resources such as International Standard Organization (ISO) language and currency names (Quah et al., 2001), and still contains some errors.","We also used FEM: the French-English-Malay Lexicon (Lafourcade et al., 2003). We combined the general lexicon and a specialist lexicon of computational terms, giving 33,022 lexical entries. Each entry comes with: (1) French headword; (2) pronunciation; (3) part of speech; (4) superordinate term in French (46% of entries); (5) English equivalent; (6) Malay equivalent; (7) French example (30%); (8) English example (30%); (9) Malay example (30%). The dictionary had been automatically compiled and hand-corrected with some errors remaining, especially in the Malay equivalents.","We converted both lexicons to the following format (ignoring fields that we won’t use): (1)             lexical entry Malay m0, . . . mn English e0, . . . em French/Chinese f0, . . . fo Part-of-Speech { noun, verb, adjective, adverb, other } Hypernym { French word | GT class }            ","Each entry has one or more words in Malay, English and French/Chinese plus possibly a hypernym, expressed either as a French word or as Goi-Taikei semantic class.

For Chinese, we used the Chinese Wordnet created by (Xu et al., 2008), with some normalization (removing bracketed data, leading and trailing punctuation and white space, removing affixes attached to adjectives and adverbs such as 的 de and 地 zi). For French, we created a new wordnet (which we will just call the French Wordnet) by combining entries from the French part of Euro WordNet (Vossen, 1998) and the Wordnet Liberé du Franca̧is (Sagot and Fišer, 2008). The combined wordnet had considerably better coverage than either of its components.","All of the wordnets were linked to some version of the English wordnet (shown in Table 1).

We were also given a table matching GT classes to CoreNet classes. The GT-CoreNet mapping is very accurate, as CoreNet design was strongly influenced by Goi-Taikei (Korterm, 2005).

If we take out the high frequency synsets and consider just the average ambiguity of the high-quality automatic candidates it is only 1.05.","Looking at the results in section 4.2, we can see that adding the hypernym matching gave us over a quarter of the good entries (the sem cell for FEM in Table 2). The hypernym matching was less useful for KAMI— an analysis of errors showed that this was mainly due to errors in the (automatically assigned) semantic classes. The classes tended to be too general, and this gave them little disambiguating power. Matching through multiple pivots was much more effective for KAMI. In this case, we hypothesize that the more different language (Chinese) gives more disambiguating power than French, when combined with English. Because French and English are closely related, they often show the same ambiguity. 5","http://wordnet.cs.princeton.edu/downloads.html"]},{"title":"261","paragraphs":["We measured how close Malay and Indonesian are by calculating the distribution of the language tags.

However, in both languages capung can also be used to describe this insect, showing that the two languages are highly interrelated in terms of meaning and spelling.","Another example of a difference is in translation of worms. When translated in Bahasa (both Malay and Indonesian), a worm is cacing. However, once the basic word divides in subordinate categories, the two Bahasa languages also divide. The Indonesian language has cacing parasit “roundworm” as a subordinate word for cacing whereas the Malay language uses cacing keruit/cacing kerawit “threadworm” to describe the same creature.
