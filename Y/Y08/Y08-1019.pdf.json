It is well-known that an adjective is not a universal part of speech. As pointed out in the previous researches, many oceanic languages do not have a morphologically distinguished adjective class. The only criteria which distinguish adjectives from verbs and nouns could be whether they appear in comparative construction or not. However, even comparative construction is not universal. Whereas most languages have a specific morpheme to construct comparatives like inflection, some languages do not. In this paper I investigate various languages in the Pacific Asia region and discuss the difference in comparative construction in the framework of formal semantics. I suggest two parameters to distinguish the four language groups and propose a new typology of comparative construction.

Introduction","paragraphs":["It is well-known that many oceanic languages have no adjective class which is distinguishable from noun and verb classes (Wetzer, 1996). The only criteria which distinguish adjectives from nouns and verbs could be comparative constructions (Dixon, 2004). However, comparative construction is not universal. Some languages in Papua New Guinea do not have any comparative morpheme or any comparative-specific structure. In this paper I focus on the comparative forms of various languages in the Pacific Asia region and suggest a new typology of comparatives in the framework of formal semantics. The structure of the paper is as follows: in section 2, I summarize the previous studies on semantics of comparatives and define the denotation of adjectives; in section 3, I show the data from various languages in the Pacific Asia region and classify them into four groups depending on the morphological/syntactic markedness; in section 4, I show how to analyze each type of comparative construction in the framework presented in section 2; in section 5, I show that two parameters are relevant to the classification of adjectival systems."]},{"title":"2. Semantics of Comparatives","paragraphs":["The denotation of an adjective is property, i.e. an expression of type <e,t>. In comparative construction, however, adjectives need to be abstracted over degrees, because what is compared is the degree of property of more than one object. I call this process degree abstraction and define the degree abstraction operator as follows:  1) Degree Abstraction operator Π is a function from expressions of type <e,t> to <e <d,t>>","Π<<e,t>, <e,<d,t>>> = λA<e,t>λx<e>λd<d> [RA(d)(x)]","where the domain of type <d> is a set of degrees and RA is a function which relate objects","to degrees on the scale of A. 197 22nd Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation, pages 197–206  Ex. λx<e> [tall(x)] → λx<e>λd<d> [Rtall(d)(x)]  After an adjective undergoes the process of degree abstraction, we obtai\\n a function from individuals to a set of degrees. An adjective tall now means a set of degrees which the individual x has on the scale of tallness. However, this procedure is not enough for an adjective to be comparative. When we compare two sets of degrees, we need to pick up the maximal degree in each degree set. This process is conducted by the maximization operator ‘MAX’ (Rullmann, 1995).  2) MAX (λd<d> [RA(d)(x)]) = ιd [RA(d)(x)]  Degree abstraction and maximization work together with comparative morphemes to construct comparatives. For example, English comparative morpheme –er is defined as (3) (Kennedy, 1999)1",". Each argument of –er has to be abstracted over degrees and maximized.  3) Definition of comparative morpheme","||MORE(MAX(D2))(MAX(D1))|| = 1 iff MAX(D1) > MAX(D2)","","Ex. ||Bill is taller than John||","= MORE (MAX(λd<d> [Rtall(d)(John)]))(MAX(λd<d> [Rtall(d)(Bill)]))","= ιd<d> [Rtall(d)(Bill)] > ιd<d> [Rtall(d)(John)] "]},{"title":"3. Four Types of Comparative Forms","paragraphs":["Investigation on a wide variety of languages reveals that there are at least four types of comparative constructions: Enlish-type, Chinese-type, Japanese-type and Dom-type. The former three languages have adpositions to introduce standards of comparison, while Dom-type languages has none. In other words, Dom-type languages cannot describe comparison in one sentence, as there is no way to introduce a standard of comparison into adjectival construction. The sense of comparison is described by coordination of positive and negative adjectives. Other three languages are different in morphological markedness of adjectives. English-type languages mark comparative form and Chinese-type languages absolute form, while Japanese-type languages do not have any morpheme or word to distinguish aboslute and comparative.

(25) is well-formed because we can apply degree abstraction and maximization on main clause and than-clause respectively. It means both operators are available in syntax in English-type languages. "]},{"title":"4.2. Chinese-type Adjectival System","paragraphs":["In 3.2, I mentioned that Chinese adjectives are inherently comparative. However, Chinese adjectives are not homogeneous. In this section I first discuss the different types of adjectives and then define the Chinese adjectival system.","Chinese adjectives can be classified into two major groups: simple adjectives and complex adjectives. Simple adjectives are well-known for their ‘nouny’ behavior: they can modify nouns directly (26) (a noun can modify another noun directly in Chinese). Complex adverbs are known as ‘verby’, as they take the form of relative clauses when they modify a noun (27).  26) shuai ge","cool guy","‘cool guy’ 27) shuaishuai de ge","cool-cool REL guy","‘very cool guy’ REL=relative clause marker  Observing several different behaviors of the two types of adjectives, Huang concluded that simple adjectives are expressions of type <e>, while complex adjectives are of type <e,t> (Huang, 2006). However, this conclusion is not attested by the most basic criterion which distinguishes the two types of adjectives, i.e. (26)-(27). As nouns are expressions of type <e,t> and modification is possible by generalized conjunction (Partee and Rooth, 1983), simple adjectives may well be expressions of type <e,t>. Huang’s conclusion cannot explain why only simple adjectives can appear in comparative construction either.  28) Zhangsan bi Lisi shuai.","Zhangsan compare Lisi cool","‘Zhangsan is cooler than Lisi.’ 29) *Zhangsan bi Lisi shuaishuai.","Zhangsan compare Lisi cool-cool","‘Zhangsan is much cooler than Lisi.’  I assume that simple adjectives in Chinese are abstracted over degrees and maximized in lexicon as (30a). They are already prepared for comparison, hence they sound natural in comparative construction. On the other hand, complex adjectives go too further. They not only designate the property but also mention that the degree to which the object is cool exceeds the usually expected degree. Hence they cannot take another standard of comparison.  30) a.||AdjectiveSIMPLE|| = λxιd[RA(x)(d)] → λd’λxιd[RA(x)(d)] > d’","b.||AdjectiveCOMPLEX|| = λxιd[RA(x)(d)] > the usually expected degree  202 Another important point is that degree abstraction is applied in lexicon. When degree abstraction is applied to an adjective in lexicon, the abstracted degrees must be on the scale of the adjective. This is the reason why the counterpart of (25) is not well-formed in Chinese. Chinese native speakers do not consider “long” and “wide” are on the same scale even if they describe degrees on the same dimension.  31) *Zheige men bi [neige zhuozi chang] kuan.","this door compare that table long wide","‘This door is wider than that table is long’  Let us now see how simple adjectives behave in absolute construction. As mentioned above, a simple adjective cannot construct a predicate in Chinese. It needs the support of a degree adverb like hen ‘very’ to be absolute.  32) ?Zhangsan shuai.","Zhangsan cool","‘Zhangsan is cooler.’ 33) Zhangsan hen shuai.","Zhangsan very cool","‘Zhangsan is cool.’  As simple adjectives are already abstracted over degrees and maximized, they tend to be interpreted as comparative (34). Degree adverb hen ‘very’ takes the adjective and fills the argument of standard degree, makes the adverb to be absolute.  34) ||Zhangsan shuai|| = ιd<d> [Rcool(d)(Zhangsan)] > ? 35) a. ||hen|| = λA<d,t> [A(c)] c = the standard degree given by the context","b.||hen shuai|| = ||hen||(||shuai||)","= λA<d,t> [A(c)](λd<d> [ιd<d>[Rcool(d)(x)] > d])","= ιd<d> [Rcool(d)(x)] > c]  4.3. Japanese-type Adjectival System Japanese-type adjectives can occur both in absolute and comparative construction without morphological change. Hence we can assume that maximization is not lexical, as lexical maximization usually induce comparative reading as mentioned above. On the other hand, degree abstraction is lexical in Japanese-type languages as argued in Beck et al (2004). The most striking evidence is the ill-formedness of subcomparatives. Since degree abstraction is applied in lexicon, adjectives in different dimensions cannot be compared in Japanese.  36) *Kono doa-wa [ano tsukue-ga nagai]-yori hiroi.","this door-TOP that table-NOM long than wide","‘This door is wider than that table is long’ ","Another important aspect of their claim is the way yori-clause is interpreted. Yori-clause is different from English than-clause in that it provides a clue to obtain the standard of comparison but does not provide the exact degree to compare with. According to their analysis, the standard of comparison is obtained by pragmatic inference.","In sum, the denotation of Japanese adjectives in comparative construction is as follows:"," 37) a. ||AdjectiveJ|| = λx<e>λd<d> [RA(d)(x)]","b.||MAX((||AdjectiveJ ||))|| =λx<e>ιd<d> [RA(d)(x)] 38) ||Taroo-wa Jiroo-yori wakai|| = ιd<d> [Ryoung(d)(Taroo)]) > c 203 where c is provided by yori-clause. "]},{"title":"4.4. Dom-type Adjectival System","paragraphs":["In Dom-type languages, comparative construction consists of positive and negative adjectives on the same dimension. We can formalize the construction as (39). In this construction neither degree abstraction nor maximization seems to be relevant.

As early maximization induces comparative reading, comparative forms in Chinese-type languages are unmarked so that adjectives need ‘absolute operator’. In Japanese-type adjectival system degree abstraction is limited to lexical level so that they do not allow subcomparatives, whereas maximization is not obligatory in lexicon so that adjectives can feed both absolute and comparative operator. Dom-type languages utilize a unified strategy to noun conjunction and adjective conjunction, which leads these languages to develop a particular way to express comparative.
