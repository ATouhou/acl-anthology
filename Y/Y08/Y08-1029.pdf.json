This paper describes desiderative constructions in Japanese with the main focus on ta(i) ‘want’ desideratives. In spite of the morphological one-word status, desiderative constructions have been claimed to have a complex structure at some abstract level of representation. We claim that there are two types of desideratives, and that their predicates have different lexical representations within the framework of Combinatory Categorial Grammar. Building on the proposed analysis, we also discuss the difference between the two types of desideratives in terms of adverbial modification and passivizability.

Introduction","paragraphs":["Ranging across a number of differing expressions in differing languages, there are various constructions described as complex predicates. Japanese also abounds in such predicates, which consist of a stem verb or gerundive expression followed by another morpheme. Passives and causatives, for example, have been a focus of attention in many linguistic studies. However, only few attempts have so far been made at desideratives by comparison. In this paper we conduct a detailed examination of desiderative constructions in Japanese with the main focus on the suffix, ta(i) ‘want’.","Ta(i) ‘want’ is suffixed to a stem verb and forms an adjective as exemplified in (1):"," The active counter part for (1) is the following (2):"," As shown in (1), the object argument of the stem verb can be marked with either nominative ga or accusative wo, though the stem verb originally marks its object by only accusative as in (2).  * We are indebted to two anonymous PACLIC reviewers and Paul Crook for their invaluable comments on an earlier version of this paper. Our thanks also go to Mr. Yoshiyasu Shirai, the president of Osaka Gakuin University. All remaining inadequacies are our own.  Copyright 2008 by Akira Ohtani and Mark Steedman 290 22nd Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation, pages 290–301 We call the type with nominative object ga-desiderative, and the type with accusative object wo-desiderative.","One question here is why the object of desiderative construction can be marked with either nominative or accusative. Under the previous approaches based on series of transformations or movements, the desideratives have been claimed to have different complex structures at some abstract level of derivation or representation. However, there are some data that cannot be accounted for in terms of the only structural distinction.","In this paper we discuss the syntactic and semantic properties of desideratives with the main focus on ta(i) ‘want’, show the lexical representation of the suffix, and answer to the quest\\ion."]},{"title":"2. Previous Analyses and Adverbial Modification","paragraphs":["Kuno treats ta(i) as a sentential predicate (Kuno 1973) and then as a ‘transitive’ Deep Structure predicate (Kuno 1983). The latter predicate, for example, creates a biclausal control-type Deep Structure, which is reduced to a monoclausal Surface Structure by Predicate Raising and Tree Pruning. Inoue (1989a, 1989b) and Nishigauchi (1993) propose that complex predicates such as desideratives are formed by the process of Verb Incorporation, following Baker (1988). Inoue, for example, proposes that the two desideratives share the same D-structure but two patterns of incorporation available for the structure derive two types of S-structure, whose object NP is marked with nominative and accusative, respectively.","There are, however, some problems in those analyses both empirically and theoretically. Putting aside the theoretical problems, we point out that all the above analyses fail to capture adverbial modification. See (3):1"," One prediction resulting from their view is that both ga-desideratives and wo-desideratives should allow the same range of time and place adverbials, asita-kara ‘tomorrow-from’ and tonari-no heya-de ‘in the next room’, to be modifiers of the stem verb. Such adverbials, however, are restricted in the case of ga-desideratives as shown in (3). Thus, the contrast on adverbial modification in (3) cannot be explained by their analyses.","Sugioka (1984) claims that ta(i) is suffixed to a V' as an instance of syntactic suffixation, thereby producing a wo-desiderative predicate. She also notes certain monoclausal properties of ga-desiderative predicates regarding adverbial modification. Adverbials that modify the stem verb alone cannot be placed between a nominative NP and a desiderative predicate as shown in (4) below:"," This observation, together with other considerations, has led her to propose that the nominative case marking results from the restructuring of a complex complement structure to a simplex structure at Surface structures as in (5):2  1 One reviewer pointed out that some native speakers judge (3) (and some other examples) as not so bad and the degree of naturalness of (3) is the same as that of (i) for such people."," The reviewer also offered the comment that the relevant difference between (3) and (i) is that the former tends not to carry focus, whereas the latter does. Although a kind of focus theory (of ga) may be responsible for the (un)naturalness of the examples, such a theory should be inquired with respect to pragmatics and is beyond our study that investigates the syntactic and semantic properties of desideratives. 2 The case alternation of the desideratives can be accounted for in terms of ‘reanalysis’ (Kageyama 1982). 291"," This restructuring converts a structure like (5a) into one like (5b), and therefore an adverbial cannot intervene between an NP and a stem verb.","There are also some empirical problems in her analysis. We only point out here that the analysis fails to capture adverbial modification. Compare (3) with (4), and note the position of adverbials as indicated in (6):3","","The ungrammaticality of (3) also suggests that adverbials modifying the stem verb alone are restricted in the case of ga-desideratives. Note that such adverbials do not interrupt the surface restructuring shown in (5) because they do not intervene between a nominative object NP and a stem verb. Thus, the restructuring analysis cannot straightforwardly account for the restriction observed in (3).","Sugioka’s analysis also misses the semantic restriction on the kind of verbs that can be used in ga-desideratives (Matsumoto 1996). See (7) below:","","In (7), while all of the desiderative predicates can take an accusative object, only some can take a nominative object. Matsumoto (1996) points out that those verbs whose meaning allow the object of the stem verb to be the target of the desire to obtain something (e.g., wanting to collect the old stamp means wanting the stamp itself) sound better with a nominative object than do other verbs. Within the restructuring account, it is not clear how such a restriction on ga-desiderative predicates could be stated.","For explaining the variable patterning of adjunct modification in (4), Sells (1990) proposes another account in which the two kinds of desiderative predicates may differ in the phrase structure position of their object NP, as shown in (8) below:"," According to Sells’s analysis, an accusative object NP in Japanese can appear in two different positions as shown in (8a) and (8b). A nominative object NP, on the other hand, can only appear within a VP governed by a stative predicate hanasi-tai ‘want to speak’ as in (8b). He also assumes that adjuncts such as asita-kara and tonari-no heya-de are S-level adjuncts and  3 There is a slight difference in the acceptability of the adjuncts in (4) and (i):"," Some adjuncts are more clearly ruled out. This can be attributed to a surface constraint disfavoring a long distance interruption between a nominative object and a predicate (Shibatani 1978). 292 suggests the reason why they cannot intervene between a nominative object and a stative predicate is because the nominative object occurs only under a VP.","Sells’s analysis has the same problem as Sugioka’s. The contrast found in (3) and (4) also cannot be attributed to constituency difference in (8), since the adjuncts that are excluded in the case of ga-desiderative in (4) cannot appear even in sentences where they do not intervene between a nominative object and a stative predicate as shown in (3).","Moreover, the following sentence shows that it is possible to place the adjuncts between a nominative object NP and a desiderative predicate: See (9):"," Hontooni ‘truly’ in (9) modifies the whole desiderative predicate, while asita-kara ‘from tomorrow’ in (4) modifies the stem verb only. Thus, Sells’s analysis cannot account for the restriction on adjunct modification.","In this section we have discussed that the nominative and accusative case distinctions of the object of desideratives plays a crucial role for licensing adjunct modification. We have also argued against several previous analyses since they cannot explain the behavior of adverbials."]},{"title":"3. Gar(u) Verbalization and Passivizability 3.1.Passivizability of Complex Predicates","paragraphs":["Gar(u) is a verbal suffixal element that turns an adjective denoting ‘an internal feeling’ into a verbal expression which behaves as an ordinary predicate with the meaning ‘showing the feeling x’ (Sugioka 1984). Consider the following:"," Since ta(i) is an adjectival suffix forming an adjective as sasoi-ta(i) ‘want to ask out’ in (11a), the newly created predicate with gar(u) also turns the adjective into the verb as sasoi-ta-gar(u) ‘is envious of’ in (11b) through verbalization.","With regard to gar(u)-verbalization, there is an interesting contrast which is first brought to attention by Sugioka (1984). Note that the verbalized predicates in (10b) and (11b) show the difference in passivizability. See (12) below:4   4 Note that (12b) is acceptable as the so called adversative passive. In this paper, we make a distinction between the adversative passive and the direct passive, and the relevant passive is the latter. See also fn. 6. 293 One question here is why the sentence with “an adjective + gar(u)” in (10b) is passivizable as in (12a) while the one with “a desiderative + gar(u)” in (11b) is not as shown by the ungrammaticality of (12b).","The question here is, however, not so simple. There are verbalized desiderative predicates that can undergo passivization (Nishigauchi (1993), Matsumoto (1996)). Consider (13):"," (13a) is a passive counterpart of a desiderative in (13b). Thus, another question here is why (11b) cannot be passivized as shown in (12b) while (13b) can as shown in (13a)."]},{"title":"3.2.Conditions on Passivization","paragraphs":["As Nishigauchi (1993) argues, one crucial difference between (10a) and (11a) is that the complex predicate urayamasii ‘envious’ in (10a) is derived lexically by combining the verb urayam ‘envy’ with the ‘adjectival morpheme’ -asi, while the predicate sasoi-tai in (11a) is a syntactically complex predicate. The resulting expression of the former as a whole is syntactically a simple adjectival predicate urayamasii, and the verb sasow ‘ask out (for a date)’ and the desiderative adjectival element ta(i) originate as distinct syntactic elements.","For explaining the passivizability in (12), Nishigauchi claims that NP-movement is subject to a locality condition, which is claimed to be Subjacency defined on maximal projections. Consider below:"," Except the VP headed by gar(u),5","the object NP-movement in (14a) skips only one projection, AP, while that in (14b) skips two projections, AP and VP headed by sasoi. Since NP-movement across one projection is permissible but that across two projections causes violation of Subjacency, only (14b) is ungrammatical.","One prediction resulting from Nishigauchi’s account is that syntactically complex ga- and wo-desideratives should not allow their verbalized form to be passivized, since those have the uniform structure shown in (14b). However, this is the wrong prediction. Remember the semantic restriction on ga-desideratives in (7), repeated with slight modification as (15), and then compare them with their passive counterparts with gar(u) shown in (16): 6   5 This VP does not count as a projection crossed by the object NP-movement. See Nishigauchi (1993). 6 Another reviewer pointed out that the adversative passive may be more widespread than the direct passive in Japanese and passive sentences as in (12), (16), etc. get marginal readings on that basis. Our claim here is as follows: if the distribution of nominative object exemplified by judgment as in (15) is clear, (16a) is acceptable as the direct passive but unacceptable as the adversative passive because of the animacy requirement for its subject, and (16b) and (16c) do not make a sense as any passives, then a desiderative sentence that has a nominative object can have a direct passive counterpart. Thus, we get the condition in (17). 294"," As (16) suggests, passivization of the whole verbalized desiderative predicate is possible only when the non-passivized plain desiderative can take a nominative object. In other words, ga-desiderative predicates but not wo-desiderative predicates are passivizable. Thus, the condition on passivization of desideratives is as follows:7"," Now compare the grammaticality of (12b) with that of active counterpart whose object NP is","marked with nominative ga and accusative wo shown in (18):"," (18) cannot take a nominative object and therefore it is not passivizable.","It is worth noting that the object of (10a) occurs in the nominative case like other simple stative predicates. Thus, the contrast between (12a) and (12b) is a\\ccounted for by our claim that the passivization of the verbalized stative predicate is possible when the non-verbalized plain stative predicate can take a nominative object.","In this section we have discussed that the nominative and accusative distinction of the base object NP plays a crucial role for licensing the passivization of the verbalized desiderative predicates. That also accounts for the contrast between (12a) and (12b), because such a distinction also depends on the semantic restriction which is placed on the kind of predicate that can have a nominative-marked object."]},{"title":"4. Lexical and Syntactic Desideratives","paragraphs":["In this section we seek the answer to the following questions posed in the previous sections examining how the desiderative constructions can be dealt with within the framework of Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) (Steedman 1996, 2000)."," To answer the first question in (19a), we propose two types of predicates with desiderative constructions, i.e., ga-desiderative and wo-desiderative constructions in Japanese. These desideratives are correlated with the difference not only in the case marking of the object but also in a number of differences that we have shown in the previous sections. Based on those data, we discuss the lexical entries and the derivations for ta(i) ‘want’ in the following sections."]},{"title":"4.1.Lexical Entries of Desiderative Suffix Ta(i)","paragraphs":["We claim that ga-desideratives are derived via lexical operations with the morpheme ta(i) where the crucial operations are the change of the value of case feature of the object NP, the value of  7 It is worth noting that the syntactic condition in (17) is also related with the semantic constraint on ga-desideratives discussed in Section 2. See (7) and the following discussion. 295 sentential feature and semantics of the original predicate. The following is the lexical entry that we propose for such a derivational morpheme:  See the following derivation, where the input verb is hanas(u) ‘speak’:"," The valence is not affected by the derivation but the object NP is marked with nominative for the lexically derived predicate. The change of the value of sentential feature tentatively referred to as [+/-stative] is important. The feature indicates the stativity referring to the semantics of the predicate.","In Japanese, an object NP of stative predicates is generally marked with nominative:"," In the previous sections, we also argued that the nominative case marking of an object in desiderative constructions is restricted to be the object of the stem verb that can be the target of the desire to obtain something. The pattern appears here is determined by the stativity of the predicate, and thus we claim that the generalization for the nominative marking of an object in Japanese is as follows:"," (23) is certainly consistent with the obligatory nominative case marking of the object of stative predicates as in (22).","In contrast with ga-desideratives, wo-desideratives involve syntactic embedding. Namely, the desiderative suffix ta(i) of the wo-desiderative functions as a word with its own lexical contents. The following is the relevant part of the lexical entry and the derivation of the wo-desiderative with the syntactic particle ta(i):"," We propose that the wo-desiderative suffix is a predicate subcategorizing for one NP and a VP,\\ i.e., S \\ NP","nom. The embedded VP intuitively corresponds to a sentence headed by the stem verb. The reason for positing a VP-embedding structure instead of a S-embedding is the facts that the former is not available for passivization. Here we do not go into the detail of the passive morpheme and particle but the point is that there is no accessible object NP whi\\ch is promoted by passivization once S \\ NP","nom is derived with ta(i). Thus, the wo-desiderative has no passive counterparts. 296","One of the crucial points of our approach concerns the advantage of CCG as a lexica\\l grammar formalism. Because of the way pieces of lexical information are put together in constructing successively larger linguistic objects, when the wo-desiderative particle ta(i) is combined with its VP-complement, the information about the stem verb is supplied. Notice that the semantics in (25) is identical to that of the output of the ga-desiderative in (21b) at the end of derivation."]},{"title":"4.2.Adverbial Modification and Complex Constituency","paragraphs":["As shown in Section 2, some adverbials are restricted in the case of ga-desideratives. Wo-desideratives, on the other hand, do not have such a restriction. We have discussed the differing patterns of adverbial modification in the two types of desiderative constructions. This provides support for our analysis in which the two types of desiderative derivation exist. The crucial data is repeated below:"," (3), repeated as (26) with additional data Naomi-ga ki-tara ‘when Naomi comes’ suggests that both adverbials and an adverbial clause are acceptable in the case of wo-desideratives but not ga-desideratives.","Note that the acceptability of adverbial modification is also observed in the case of non-stative predicate hanasi-masu ‘speak’. See (27) below:"," We claim the acceptability found in these data can be attributed to the compatibility of time and place adverbials with non-stative predicates and the complex constituency of wo-desideratives. Since the predicate of ga-desiderative is lexically derived with the stative specification, it is not compatible with such adverbials. The predicate of wo-desiderative, on the other hand, maintains non-stative stem verb in the embedded VP and the adverbials can modify it although desiderative ta(i) itself is stative.","Then, consider the difference between (26) and (28):"," The adverb hontooni ‘truly’ in (9), repeated as (28a) can modify both the stem hanasi ‘speak’ and ta(i) ‘want’ and hence the ga-desiderative of (28a) is acceptable, while the adverbials in (26) is intended to modify only the stem.","This is the reason for the difference between ga-desideratives and wo-desideratives in terms of adverbial modification, and this is the answer to the second question in (19b)."]},{"title":"4.3.Gar(u)-Verbalization and Passivization","paragraphs":["This section is devoted to answer to the third question in (19c) examining gar(u)-verbalization and passivization. The objects of the verbalized adjective in (29b) and desiderative in (30b) obligatorily occur in the accusative below: 297"," It is also worth noting that gar(u) is also attached to intransitive verbs. See below:"," Based on these observation, we claim that gar(u)-verbalized forms are derived by lexical","operations with the following derivational morphemes:"," In (32), the valence of stem verb is not affected by the morphemes but the object NP is marked with accusative for a lexically derived predicate. The change of the value of sentential feature is specified as non-stative.","Next let us see how the derivational morphemes in (32) change the lexical entries of the predicates in (29b) and (30b):"," The remarkable difference on the derivations between (33) and (34) is the valence of the matrix predicate. The former urayamasi-gar(u) involves an accusative NP, but the latter ta-gar(u) does not. It is also involved in the embedded predicate machi. 298","Based on this difference, we can account for the difference between ga-desideratives and wo-desideratives in terms of passivizability. Since gar(u)-verbalization in the case of both stative predicate and ga-desideratives take a lexically derived predicate, the whole complex predicate can be passivized through the promotion of the object NP of the predicates. Wo-desideratives, on the other hand, involve VP-embedding structure. The object NP cannot be the target of the passivization, since it is located within the valence of embedded stem verb where the passive morpheme or particle cannot access. This is why the passivizability difference exists."]},{"title":"5. Some Implications of the Present Approach 5.1.The Range of Adverbials and Monoclausality","paragraphs":["One prediction resulting from our approach is that simple stative predicates should allow the same range of adverbials as ga-desideratives. In Section 2, we discussed that adverbials modifying the stem verb alone are restricted in the case of ga-desideratives. The crucial data is repeated below:8"," This restriction is also observed in the case of simple stative predicate. See (36) below:"," The unacceptability shown in (36) also cannot be attributed to constituency as Sugioka (1984) and Sells (1990) assume because the predicate has the status of a single word syntactically. In addition to this, time and place adverbials cannot co-occur with stative predicate in general. Thus, not only the nominative case-marking of an object NP but also the incompatibility of such adverbials support the analysis that the ga-desiderative sentence involves a lexically derived stative predicate, which consists of the derivational morpheme ta(i).","The restriction on adverbial modification of the stem verb is also reflected in the lack of the ambiguity of adverbial scope interpretation in ga-desideratives (Matsumoto 1996). Consider (37) below:"," The wo-desiderative sentence in (37a) is ambiguously interpreted, with zutto ‘for a long time’ modifying either the desire to embrace the child, interpreted as (i) or the action of embracing a child, interpreted as (ii). The ga-desiderative sentence in (37b), on the other hand, does not allow such ambiguity. The time adverb can only be interpreted as indicating the duration of the desire to embrace the child, interpreted as (i).  8 Compared with (35b), (35a) sounds worse because of a surface constraint disfavoring a long distance interruption between a nominative object and a stative predicate. See fn. 3. 299"]},{"title":"5.2.Constituency Tests","paragraphs":["Japanese has a structure corresponding to English do-support. It is triggered by emphatic particle mo ‘also’. Mo can be attached to the stem of desiderative predicate, but when this happens, an interesting difference turns up between ga- and wo-desideratives. See (38) below:"," As shown in (38b), the emphatic particle mo and the supportive s(u) ‘do’ can intervene between the stem verb and the desiderative suffix only in the wo-desiderative.","The differing pattern of the verbal anaphora in the two types of desideratives also provides support for the analysis in which the two types of desiderative predicates exist. Consider (39):"," The desiderative predicate with an accusative object, i.e., wo-desiderative in (39) allows the replacement of the complement predicate and its argument by soo suru ‘do so’, but this is not fully possible with those when there is a nominative object, i.e., the ga-desiderative.","Asymmetries in the two types of desideratives with these putative ‘coordinated VPs’ as in (40) provide further support for the present approach (Sugioka 1984)\\:  In (40) above, only wo-desideratives allow coordination.","The data (38)-(40) suggest that the ga-desiderative predicate as a whole is morphologically a single word where it is not possible to separate the two morphemes by inserting a particle, replacing and coordinating only its stem verb. The wo-desiderative, on the other hand, has no such restrictions. These observations support for the present analysis, whereby the wo-desiderative predicate subcategorizes for a syntactic complement structure, while the ga-desiderative predicate is a lexically derived word."]},{"title":"6. Concluding Remarks","paragraphs":["The Japanese desiderative construction has been claimed to have a complex structure at some abstract level of the representation in spite of its morphological one-word status of the predicate. In this paper we have conducted a detailed examination of the constructions with the main focus on the suffix ta(i), and then have made the argument that there are two types of ta(i), a morpheme suffixed to the stem verb and a particle which adjoins to VP. The object argument of such complex predicates is marked with nominative ga or accusative wo, respectively. Building on the CCG analysis proposed, we also discussed the difference of ga- and wo-desideratives in terms of adverbial modification and passivizability. We believe that our study will be helpful to explore other complex predicates at which only few attempts have so far been made.  300"]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Baker, M. C. 1988.
