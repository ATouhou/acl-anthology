","I have been eagerly anticipating the hosting of the 22nd PACLIC this year 2008 for it also marks the 12th year of our involvement in natural language processing (NLP) research in the country. Way back in 1996, Allan Bor\\ra and I started a funded project on IsaWika!, a machine translation (MT) system involving the Filipino language. We have come a long way in our NLP rese\\arch since then. For the past years, we have considered not only MT, but also text summarization, text simplification, natural language generation, information extraction, information retrieval, and language documentation, to name a\\ few. ","Secondly, consistent with the vision of PACLIC, we are also happy with the growth of the collaboration between experts on linguistics and computational aspects of languages in the country. This is evidenced by this year’s 5th National Natural Language Processing Research Symposium, which reflects the zeal and commitment of researchers from all over the country to get involved in this area of research and maximize the potential of bringing these two areas of knowledge together. ","And last, but not the least, we have come to realize that our attempts to remain in our comfort zone of textual information had become futile, and we have consequently expanded on input data from pure text to audios (speech) and videos (Filipino sign language). ","This growth of our activities and participation is consistently reflected in Pacific Asia researches as evidenced by the papers that are presented in this Conference, and by the topics of our invited and plenary speakers to this conference. We have received a wide variety of papers on linguistics, information, and computation projects of researchers from thirteen countries (namely: Brazil, Canada, China, France, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan, United Kingdom, and the United States). Our Program Committee members have done a difficult undertaking in examining the 71 papers submitted to us for evaluation. Through double-blind review, 41% were accepted as regular papers (or 29 papers) and another 20% as posters (or 14 papers), or an overall acceptance rate of 61%. PACLIC \\ Conference proceedings are ISI indexed and is made possible through the coordination of Professor Yasunari Harada through the Waseda University Library Institutional Repository.  i","Our colleagues from all over the world have graciously accepted our invitation for them to speak at our Conference this year to share with us their expertise in various fields in linguistics, information and computation. We have the privilege of having Mr. Adam Pease as invited speaker, and Professors Danilo Dayag, Trevor Johnston, Chungmin Lee, Haizhou Li, Patrick Saint-Dizier, Sachiko Shudo and Gary Simons as plenary speakers. ","I would also like to thank our partners in academe, government, and industry for the support that they have provided for the successful hosting of this Conference. ","Gratitude is also expressed to our program committee co-chairs, Professors Hee-Rahk Chae and Tom Lai, and of course, to our local organizing commit\\tee headed by Professor Charibeth Cheng, with members Nathalie Rose Lim, and local Cebu partners, Professors Cherry Lyn Sta. Romana and Robert Roxas, and their institutions, the Cebu Institute of Technology and the University of the Philippines Visayas Cebu College (which generously hosted the venue for the conference), and to our staff and students. ","I sincerely hope that we will all benefit and be refreshed by the ideas shared in the Conference, and enjoy the beautiful Cebu City, Philippines.      Rachel Edita O.
