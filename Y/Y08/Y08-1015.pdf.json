One of difficult issues in pattern-based machine translation system is maybe to find how to overcome the domain difference in adapting a system from one domain to other domain. This paper describes how we have resolved such barriers among domains as default target word of any domain, domain-specific patterns, and domain adaptation of engine modules in pattern-based machine translation system, especially English-Korean pattern-based machine translation system. For this, we will discuss two types of customization methods which mean a method adapting an existing system to new domain. One is the pure customization method introduced for patent machine translation system in 2006 and another is the upgraded customization method applied to scientific paper machine translation system in 2007. By introducing an upgraded customization method, we could implement a practical machine translation system for scientific paper translation within 8 months, in comparison with the patent machine translation system that was completed even in 24 months by the pure customization method. The translation accuracy of scientific paper machine translation system also rose 77.25% to 81.10% in spite of short term of 8 months.

Introduction","paragraphs":["The use of on-line systems is the biggest growth area in the use of machine translation. People are translating web pages or very large documents by using machine translation system as the solution, as human translation of pages which need to be continually updated or are very large scale is not feasible (Mellebeek et.al., 2005). Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI, henceforth) in Korea has developed the web-based English-Korean machine translation system till 2004, under assumption that as the size of patterns grows, the performance of the system can be incrementally improved (Hong et. al., 2003). During 2 years (2005- 2006) it implemented an English-Korean patent machine translation system on the basis of the web-based English-Korean machine translation system. The English-Korean patent machine translation system was installed in International Patent Assistance Center (IPAC, henceforth) under Ministry of  * This work was supported by the IT R&D program of MKE/IITA, Domain Customization Machine Translation Technology Development for Korean, Chinese, and English.

It was due to the customization method (Kwon et. al., 2007) that we could change successfully an existing machine translation system from general domain to patent domain. Figure 1 shows us an example of patent machine translation service at IPAC.   Figure 1: An Example of Patent Machine Translation Service at IPAC"," ETRI had upgraded the customization method applied to the English-Korean patent machine translation system since 2007 and completed the practical level of English-Korean scientific paper machine translation system within 8 months. The English-Korean machine translation service for scientific paper translation is expected to be launched for students since September, 2008. This paper describes how we have resolved such barriers among domains as default target word of any domain, domain-specific patterns, and domain adaptation of engine modules in pattern-based machine translation system, especially English-Korean patterns-based machine translation system. Especially, we will describe a difference between the pure customization method for patent machine translation system and the upgraded customization method applied to scientific paper machine translation system. The construction of this paper is as follows: in section 2 the pure customization method will be sketched and its experiment will be showed. The limits of the pure customization method will be uncovered in the section 3. To deal with the problems found in the experiment, an upgraded customization method will be proposed in the section 4. In section 5 another experiment will be conducted to evaluate the proposed method. The discussion of the previous sections will be summarized in the concluding section 6."]},{"title":"2. Pure Customization Method 2.1.Customization Steps","paragraphs":["As mentioned before, a domain customization method means a method adapting an existing system to new domain. The pure customization method was designed in the course of changing the web-based English-Korean machine transaltion system with general domain into the domain-specific English-Korean machine translation system such as patent domain. It was basically dependent on an idea of Zajac R. (2003) consisting of following steps:  Step 1. Collecting a large scale of domain-specific documents Step 2. Linguistically studying about characteristics of the collected documents Step 3. Automatically extracting unknown words and semi-automatically constructing their","equivalent words 162  Step 4.

Problems of Pure Customization Method","paragraphs":["We tried to analyze the automatic translation results of scientific paper translated by patent machine translation system to find the problems of the pure customization method. We evaluated 200 blind test sentences of scientific paper with the patent machine translation system. The average length of the sentences was 21.69 words. The translations were evaluated by 3 translators with the scoring scale from 0 (no translation) to 4 (perfect translation) point.

That is, 60.97% of total translation errors are caused by translation knowledge. This means that the extraction of unknown dictionary entries and unknown patterns as well as the adaptation of existing dictionary entries and patterns to new domain are very important to 163  tune the existing machine translation system to new domain. It would be first problem of the pure customization method not to have the step such as the tuning of existing dictionary entries (Ayan et. al., 2003) and the corpus-assisted expansion of existing patterns (Yamada et. al., 2002). The second problem of pure customization method is that it has no step of automatic tuning for existing translation engine modules. We corrected the existing system modules such as tagger, parser, transfer and generator whenever we found their errors. Its problem was to spend a long tuning time. Therefore, we needed a new step for semi-automatic tuning of translation engine modules to cut tuning time. Finally, the weakness of pure customization method was related to only human evaluation for translation assessment. To reduce the expenses and much time, we added an automatic evaluation like BLEU (Papineni et.al., 2002) to the human evaluation."]},{"title":"4.

From the answer set we collected the correct answers of morphologically or syntactically ambiguities. On the basis of them, the English part-of-speech tagger and parser were able to be checked automatically. For customization of the morphological tagger we have first collected the tagging errors with morphological ambiguities of scientific papers that occur frequently. Then the tagging errors were corrected manually if they were matched with the corresponding parts of the answer set. For example, a word with ‘-ing’ can be a noun (NN) or a gerund (VBG). We could find that the par-of-speech of the word with a form ‘-ing’ became noun (NN) or adjective (JJ) before lexical words ‘system’ and ‘method’. The semi-automatic customization of parser could be achieved by semi-automatically controlling the probabilistic weight of parsing rules including the different attachment ambiguities, such as infinitive phrase attachment and prepositional phrase attachment."]},{"title":"5.

The translations for human evaluation were scored at the same manner described in the section 3. In the first experiment described in the section 3, the 616 patterns increased every month, while about 4,000 patterns are growing every month due to a step ‘semi-automatic construction of domain-specific patterns’ in upgraded customization method.
