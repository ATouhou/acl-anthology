Metaphors are pervasive in human language and developing methods to recognize and deal with metaphors is an indispensable task in Natural Language Processing (NLP). This paper proposes an unsupervised method to recognize metaphors from real texts. Firstly, source domain candidates are determined based on automatically acquired selectional preferences. And then metaphors are recognized with the source domain knowledge. Experiment results show that this unsupervised method outperforms the baseline by a great improvement. In addition, the source domain knowledge can also be used for metaphor comprehension. Keywords: Selectional Preference, Source Domain, Metaphor Recognition, Concept Concreteness  "]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["Conceptual Metaphor Theory (Lakoff and Johnson, 1980) considers metaphor as a mapping from the concrete source domain to the abstract target domain. Abstractions and enormously complex situations are routinely understood via metaphors. Metaphorical expressions are pervasive in human languages and must be treated for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) (Carbonell, 1982). As an important figure of speech, metaphor processing has interesting applications in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks like machine translation, paraphrasing, information retrieval and question answering. Metaphor processing can be divided into three tasks, recognition, comprehension and generation, among which recognition is the basic step. Metaphor recognition is to decide whether a sentence contains metaphorical expressions (a word, phrase or the whole sentence). This paper focuses on verb metaphor, to decide whether a verb is in metaphorical usage or literal usage. In selectional preference violation view, a satisfied preference indicates a literal semantic relation, while a violated preference indicates a metaphorical one. Take the following two sentences as examples.

The fact that literally 培植 ‘cultivate’ requires the object to denote some plants suggests that selectional preferences offer a cue to the presence of a metaphor. But the selectional preferences automatically induced by conventional computational models may not reflect semantics in the literal usage. On the other hand, concept concreteness or abstractness is an important indicator of literal usage, where concrete concepts usually indicate literal usage while abstract concepts correspond to non-literal usage. This paper makes use of concept concreteness based on automatically acquired selectional preferences for verb metaphor recognition. Though metaphorical usage could be considered as a different sense of the target \\word, but when performing inference, it is beneficial to differentiate literal usage from metaphorical usage, because they share inferential structure. For example, the aspectual structure of 培植 ‘cultivate’ is the same in either domain whether it is literal or metaphorical. Further, this sharing of inferential structure between the source and target domains simplifies the representational mechanisms used for inference making it easier to build the world models necessary for knowledge-intensive tasks like question answering. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is a review of related work. Section 3 describes the details of selectional preferences acquisition. Section 4 shows the method of source domain determination based on selectional preferences. Section 5 uses this source domain knowledge for metaphor recognition. Experiments and conclusions are given in section 6 and 7 respectively."]},{"title":"2. Related Work","paragraphs":["Previous work on automatic metaphor recognition using selectional preferences idea includes (Martin, 1990), (Fass, 1991), (Mason, 2004) and (Krishnakumaran and Zhu, 2007). (Martin, 1990) detects metaphors by comparing new sentences with an empirically collected metaphor knowledge base and gives some interpretation of metaphorical sentences. (Fass, 1991) uses collative semantics to identify metaphors and distinguish metaphor from metonymy. But they both require hand-coded knowledge bases and thus have limited coverage. (Mason, 2004) develops a corpus-based system CorMet for discovering metaphorical mappings between concepts. It finds selectional preferences of given verbs from automatically compiled domain-specific corpora, and then identifies metaphorical mappings between concepts in two domains based on differences in selectional preferences. (Krishnakumaran and Zhu, 2007) uses lexical resources like WordNet and bigram counts generated from a large scale corpus to classify sentences into metaphorical or normal usages. It does not compute selectional preferences explicitly and the bigram counts omit grammatical relations. Later researches treat metaphor recognition task as a classification problem between normal and metaphorical usage. (Gedigian et al., 2006) uses a maximum entropy classifier to identify metaphors and takes verb arguments as features. (Wang et al., 2006) also uses a maximum entropy approach to recognize Chinese noun phrase metaphors. However, both need manually annotated corpus to train the classifier. In order to reduce manual work on annotation, (Birke and Sarkar, 2006) use a clustering approach with a smaller seed corpus to classify verb usages. One advantage of selectional preferences based method is that it does not need training. One thing that sets our work apart is that all previous selectional preferences based methods do not make use of concept concreteness information. In contrast, we use it and show that it is effective information for metaphor processing. 208"]},{"title":"3. Selectional Preference Acquisition","paragraphs":["The automatic corpus-based induction of selectional preferences was first proposed by (Resnik, 1993). All later approaches have followed the same two-step procedure, first collecting argument head words from a corpus, then generalizing to other similar words. They are different mainly in the generalization step, some using manual semantic taxonomy like WordNet, while others using clustering methods. Different from previous approaches, the first step in this approach is based on grammatical collocations. It makes use of various statistical measures for computing collocations or combination of some of them, not just word frequency used in previous approaches. For generalization, a semantic lexicon containing synonym and hypernym relations is employed."]},{"title":"3.1. Grammatical Collocation","paragraphs":["Grammatical collocation means that the target word and its collocation are in a certain grammatical relation, such as subject-verb, verb-object or modifier-noun. In order to obtain grammatical collocations for the target word, this paper uses Sketch Engine (Kigarriff and Tugwell, 2001), a query system extracting collocations of different grammatical relations from a large scale corpus. Collocations are sorted in descending order according to the salience value, which is estimated as the product of Mutual Information and log frequency. However, (Kilgarriff and Tugwell, 2001) modify the Mutual Information value by considering of the overall frequency of the grammatical relation as compared to other relations. The purpose of doing so is to avoid cases of low frequency collocations such as those which occur once but have high mutual information values because it is the only time they appear together with the target word. Therefore, the salience value is a reliable calculator instead of the frequency value. The corpus for grammatical collocation extraction is the Simple Chinese Gigaword corpus, which has 706,427,624 tokens. The input parameters for Sketch Engine are as follows: the minimum frequency is 5; the minimum salience value is 0.0; the maximum number of items in a grammatical relation is 999, which is the upper bound due to licensing limitation. As an example, table1 shows the top 20 collocations of the target verb 培植 pei2zhi2 ‘cultivate’ in the verb-object relation.

Semantic Mapping ","paragraphs":["209 Collocation words need to be generalized into semantic level to reflect the semantic preferences of the target word. A Chinese semantic lexicon named TongYiCiCiLin is used for this purpose. In the lexicon, about 80,000 words are arranged into 5-level tree struct\\ures (see figure1) according to semantic relations like synonym and hypernym. In the tree structure, the bottom level is called Atomic Word Group Level, where a node represents a synonym set. The parent node is the hypernym of the children. In total, 12 root nodes partition all words into 12 super classes, and the lower nodes further partition words into more detailed classes. The super classes include Human, Substance, Time and Space, Abstraction, Features, Motions, Psychological Activity, Activity, etc.  ... ... ... ... ... ... Figure1: The 5-level tree structure of TongYiCiCiLin  With the tree structure, collocations can be mapped to different semantic levels as required. After semantic mapping, collocations are grouped and semantic classes are sorted according to the number of collocations they contain. The sequence of semantic classes reflects the selectional preferences of the target word. The more collocations a semantic class contains, the more it is preferred. Table2 shows the top 10 semantic classes of level 2 of the target word 培植 ‘cultivate’. The first column is the semantic class ID in TongYiCiCiLin. The second column is the semantic class name.

Source Domain Determination","paragraphs":["Semantic classes acquired in the last section need to be refined for metaphor processing. Some preferred semantic classes may denote metaphorical usage. For example, in table2, semantic class Al, ability and insight, is used metaphorically as the object of the target word 培植 ‘cultivate’. Only source domain candidates, semantic classes denoting literal usage, are useful knowledge for metaphor recognition and comprehension (Chung and Ahrens, 2006). Usually, a concrete concept is used as the source domain while an abstract concept as the target domain. So the concept concreteness or abstractness is useful to determine source domains. Information of concept concreteness can be found in TongYiCiCiLin, where class Substance is concrete while class Abstraction is abstract. We choose all concrete concepts in the top N (N=10 by default) semantic classes as the source domain candidates, and the choosing method is flexible. If no concrete concepts exist, the first semantic class is considered as the source domain candidate. The most preferred source domain candidate is considered as the real source domain when a metaphor occurs. The blocked lines in table3 show the source domain candidates of the target verb 培植 ‘cultivate’ and the semantic class ‘Bh’ is the most preferred source domain, which agree well with human judgment. The semantic class ID beginning with ‘B’ denotes concrete class Substance."," Table 3: Source domain candidates of 培植 ‘cultivate’ SDC* SCID* #of collocations Collocations No Al 6 人才 新秀 人材 骨干 艺术家 好手 Yes Bh 6 幼苗 木耳 蘑菇 兰花 花卉 蔬菜 No Db 5 税源 财源 货源 资源 办法 No Di 5 工业 党 工作 地方 组织 No Dd 5 实力 项目 方面 地方 组织 No Ae 4 球员 选手 干部 厂商 Yes Ba 4 农产品 产品 资源 植物 No Cb 3 生长点 方面 地方 Yes Bk 3 细胞 皮肤 骨干 No Da 3 势力 过程 信息 *SDC=Source Domain Candidate, SCID=Semantic Class ID."]},{"title":"5. Recognition Algorithm","paragraphs":["After the source domain candidates are determined, whether the target verb is literally or metaphorically used can be decided. If the object or the subject of the verb belongs to the source domain candidates, then it is literal usage; otherwise, it is metaphorical usage. For example, the source domain candidates of 培植 ‘cultivate’ are {Bh, Ba, Bk} as shown in table3. In 培植幼苗 ‘cultivate young plants’, the object 幼苗 ‘young plants’ belongs to semantic class Bh. So this is a literal expression. However, in 培植人才 ‘train talents’, the object 人才 ‘talents’ does not belong to Bh, Ba or Bk. So this is a metaphorical expression. The pseudo code for the unsupervised metaphor recognition is as follows: 1. Parse the sentence and obtain object or subject headword of the verb. 211","2.

Conclusions This paper proposes an unsupervised metaphor recognition method based on selectional preferences. Different from other selectional preferences based methods, this approach utilizes concept concreteness information. Firstly, selectional preferences are extracted from a large scale corpus. Then source domain candidates are determined based on the acquired selectional preferences and concept concreteness information in a lexicon. Finally, source domain candidates are used for metaphor recognition and good performance is achieved. In addition, source domain knowledge is also helpful for metaphor comprehension. More extensive experiments will be carried out to test the effectiveness of this approach. For comparison, supervised and semi-supervised classification methods will be examined. 213 Contextual information is useful for metaphor recognition, so more contextual information will be exploited to improve the method proposed in this paper."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Birke, J. and A.
