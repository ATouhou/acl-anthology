This international conference is organized by the Faculty of Computer Science, Universitas Indonesia and is supported by the I-MHERE DIKTI project. We are very keen to host a conference about language processing fields which involves many researchers in this Asia Pacific region. We believe that this international conference will open up the opportunities for sharing and exchanging original research ideas and opinions, getting inspiration for future research, and broadening knowledge about various new topics and approaches in language study. We hope that in this conference, the attendees would have the opportunity to meet with new people and discuss the opportunity to collaborate together. We chose to organize PACLIC 26 in Bali so that aside from attending this interesting conference, you can also enjoy the scenery and the culture of Bali. We realize that there might not be enough time to see all the nice places in Bali, but we hope that you can bring home some good memories. We would like to express our sincere appreciation to the members of the Program Commitee for a fruitful reviews of the submitted papers, as well as the Organizing Commitee for the time and energy they have devoted to editing the proceedings and arranging the logistics of holding this conference. We would like to give an appreciation to the authors who have submitted their excellent works to this conference. Last but not least, we would like to extend our gratitude to the Ministry of Education and Culture of the Republic of Indonesia and the Dean of the Faculty of Computer Science at Universitas Indonesia for their continued support towards the PACLIC 26 conference. Have a nice time in Bali and enjoy the conference.

This is the first time that the PACLIC conference is being held in Indonesia, and we are very excited about this fact. By all accounts, Indonesia is a linguistic treasure trove, with over 700 living languages today according to the Ethnologue report. Moreover, with an increasing number of its 240 million population active on the Internet via the Web and social networks, clearly these are exciting times to be engaging in computational approaches towards the languages of Indonesia. However, this PACLIC conference in 2012 is special for other reasons, most notably the commemoration of 25 years of the conference series. Over the years, the conference has developed into one of the leading conferences in the fields of theoretical and computational linguistics, extending beyond the Asia-Pacific region. This year, the specific research topics that the papers focus on can be classified into the following: discourse & pragmatics, grammar & syntax, information extraction, information retrieval, lexical semantics, machine translation, parsing, sentiment analysis, text summarization & paraphrasing, and word sense disambiguation & distributional semantics. Moreover, there is an interesting mix of both theoretical and computational approaches to almost all of the aforementioned topics. We received paper submissions representing immense diversity, with authors from 29 countries or regions, namely Australia, Bahrain, Belgium, Canada, China, Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Macau, Malaysia, Pakistan, Philippines, Qatar, Singapore, Slovakia, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, Tunisia, United Kingdom, United States, and Vietnam. To ensure that all accepted papers met the high quality standard of the PACLIC conference, all papers were sent to three reviewers. Of the 117 submissions that we received, 39 papers (33%) were accepted for oral presentation, and another 18 papers (15%) were accepted for poster presentation. We believe this has yielded an interesting, diverse, and high-quality collection of papers, and are confident that the conference will be successful as a result. A successful conference is the result of many peoples efforts and contributions. Aside from the efforts of the authors who will be presenting their current work, thanks must be given to the tremendous efforts made by the program committee members in their paper reviews. Besides the oral and poster paper presentations, the conference is enriched by several invited speakers. Firstly there is a Special Session commemorating 25 years of PACLIC, which brings together Prof Kiyong Lee from Korea University, Prof Yuji Matsumoto from the Nara Institute of Science and Technology, and Prof Benjamin T’sou from the Hong Kong Institute of Education, three figures who have been instrumental in the formation of the PACLIC tradition. We have also scheduled invited talks from Prof I Wayan Arka from ANU & Universitas Udayana and Prof Tim Baldwin from the University of Melbourne. The expertise in the respective fields of all five speakers will undoubtedly provide us with new insights for research. On behalf of the program committee, we express our heartfelt thanks to them all. We would also like to thank the steering committee for their guidance, and the local organizing committee at Universitas Indonesia for their dedicated efforts and their excellent coordination with all parties, which has ensured that this conference will be a successful event. Finally, we wish that you will all enjoy the conference presentations and resulting discussions between old and new friends, and also have some time to enjoy the wondrous setting that is the island of Bali.
