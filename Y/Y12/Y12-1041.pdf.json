Since the language is one of the major communication tools in every society, the ability to paraphrase what we want to say or write can also imply the society’s civilization.","Paraphrasing techniques for the sentence level and others in several languages have been examined and suggested during the past several years (Stede, 1996; Dras, 1999; Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Pang et al., 2003; Qiu et al., 2006; Ellsworth and Janin, 2007; Zhao et al., 2009; Madnani and Dorr, 2010). These paraphrasing techniques were enormously used in several areas of Natural Language Processing such as Question Answering (Duboue and Carroll, 2006), Machine Translation (Shimohata, 2004; Barreiro, 2008), Summary Evaluation (Zhou et al., 2006) and Textual Entailment Recognition (Marsi et al., 2007; Malakasiotis, 2011).","In Thai language, its writing structure contains no space between words and no full stops between sentences. This could be potential problems in doing research pertaining to Thai computational paraphrasing. Nevertheless, the construction and patterns of Thai sentences have been partially investigated by a number of renown Thai linguists (Vongsantivanit, 1983; Kanchanacheeva, 1996; Thonglor, 2007; Songsilp, 2008; Settanyakan, 2011). Some researchers classified Thai verbs, identified their arguments, as well as recognized their corresponding thematic roles (Wongsiri, 1981; Sungkhavon, 1984; Panthumetha, 2010).","To be able to work on Thai sentence paraphrasing, previous research regarding constructing and paraphrasing sentences in other languages was essential and therefore surveyed (Shimohata, 2004; Barreiro, 2008; Dorr, 1994; Kozlowski et al., 2003; Fujita, 2005). It was subsequently adjusted by (Phucharasupa and Netisopakul, 2011) to fit Thai language more appropriately. Thai sentence paraphrase patterns were categorized into fourteen groups, some of which will be explained and used as examples in this research.","To achieve the goal of automatic paraphrase generation, two critical considerations must be addressed. One is that an appropriate semantic structure of the original sentence must be designed so that it facilitates the automatic system to easily generate paraphrases. The other is that the algorithm must be able to generate syntactically correct paraphrases of the original sentence and these paraphrases must faithfully preserve its original meaning.","381 Copyright 2012 by Krittaporn Phucharasupa and Ponrudee Netisopakul","26 th Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation pages 381-390","The focal method for semantic representation of this research is the Lexical Conceptual Structure (LCS) associated with each lexical item (Fujita, 2005; Jackendoff, 1990; Dorr and Palmer, 1995) whereas the method of interest for syntactic structure representation is the Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar (LTAG) (Joshi, 1999; Palmer and Rosenzweig, 1999) that captures the realization of the lexical item. In addition, the LTAG operations, namely, substitution and adjoining, ensure that the resulting sentence is well-formed. The above two representations, i.e., LTAG and LCS have been utilized to facilitate multilingual generation (Dorr and Palmer, 1995; Netisopakul, 1997).","In this paper, six paraphrasing techniques for generating Thai sentence paraphrases are proposed based collaboratively on LCS and LTAG. This paper is organized as follows. In the next section, the process of the Thai–sentence Paraphrase Generation (TPG) system is described in details. In Section 3, how each of the six paraphrasing techniques works is illustratively explained. Then, in Section 4, combinations of the proposed Thai sentence paraphrasing techniques used in some of the fourteen Thai sentence paraphrase patterns are identified along with one particular combination explicitly illustrated in details. In the last section, a conclusion and suggestions of this research are provided."]},{"title":"2 Processes of TPG System","paragraphs":["Thai sentence paraphrase generation in the designed TPG system is driven by the semantic input or the Composed LCS (CLCS), that is, the meaning of complex phrases composed from several Root LCSs (RLCSs) corresponding to individual words (Dorr, 2001). This TPG system contains three primary processes, namely, the CLCS Decomposition, the Thai LTAG (TLTAG) Selection, and the Surface Realization as illustrated in Figure 1.","In the very first process of the TPG system or the CLCS Decomposition process, one CLCS is semantically broken into many elementary LCSs corresponding to each individual word. Each elementary LCS is then normalized into its semantic base form according to the Thai Lexical Conceptual Structure with Thai Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar (TLCS–TLTAG) Resource.","In the second process called the TLTAG Selection, each semantic base formed LCS is mapped with TLCS part in the TLCS–TLTAG Resource so as to pull out the corresponding TLTAG tree which defines the syntactic structure of the elementary word.","The last process entitled the Surface Realization combines all TLTAG trees using the LTAG operations. This process produces syntactically well-formed sentences, each of which can be read off of the leaf nodes of a combined TLTAG tree."," Figure 1: The Architecture of TPG System","The TLCS–TLTAG Resource is designed to","assist the TPG system in generating the paraphrases","because it encapsulates information necessary for","the paraphrase generation process. The information","in the TLCS–TLTAG Resource contains the","following:"," General information of each Thai word such as the part of speech, the word sub-category, the synonyms, the antonyms, and the definition. For example, the word “เปลง ประกาย/shine” has “intransitive verb” as its part-of-speech, “Immotion Action” (Sungkhavon, 1984) as its sub-category, “สอง ประกาย/glitter” as its synonym, “หมอง/cloud” as its antonym, and “สะทอนแสง/reflect light” as its definition."," Thai LCS or TLCS semantics corresponding to individual words useful for the CLCS Decomposition process and the TLTAG Selection process."," Syntactic structures in the TLTAG portion projected from Thai lexicon items based on the LTAG theory (Joshi, 1999).","The Surface Realization of TLCSs can be processed by mapping semantic arguments to the substitution nodes in TLTAGs. Considering an 382 example drawn from the TLCS–TLTAG Resource shown in Figure 2, a TLCS consists of a category event, a predicate ACT and its arguments agent-agt, factitive-fac, and cause-cau of the verb “ทํา/do”. Each argument is mapped to each corresponding substitution node in the TLTAG of the verb “ทํา/do” as illustrated in Figure 2(a) for an affirmative sentence and in Figure 2(b) for a productive causative sentence. ","Figure 2: A Semantic (TLCS) of “ทํา/do something activated by a cause” Represented in Different","Constructions (TLTAGs)","During the automatic paraphrasing, an initial sentence represented by a CLCS is decomposed into many TLCSs in the CLCS Decomposition process. Next, each decomposed TLCS is looked up in the TCLS–TLTAG Resource during the TLTAG Selection process to find a mapped TLCS in order to obtain its associated TLTAG. Note that the number of the obtained TLTAGs can be more than one depending on the numbers of the mapped TLCSs. The TLTAG Selection process may therefore result in several surface structures indicated by each TLTAG paired with the mapped TLCS as shown in Figure 2(a) and Figure 2(b). The Surface Realization process links the TLCS arguments to the TLTAG empty substitution nodes according to the hierarchical order of the arguments in the thematic roles.","The TLTAG Selection and the Surface Realization processes are performed based on the fourteen Thai sentence paraphrase patterns previously suggested by (Phucharasupa and Netisopakul, 2011) using the six Thai sentence paraphrasing techniques proposed in this paper and described elaborately in the following sections."]},{"title":"3 Thai Sentence Paraphrasing Techniques","paragraphs":["In Phucharasupa and Netisopakul (2011), besides exploring Thai sentence paraphrase patterns from Thai linguistic phenomena, previous research related to the analysis of language constructions and paraphrases was also reviewed. The paraphrase patterns were classified based on Thai verb classes proposed by Sungkhavon (1984). During the classification, it was noticed that one paraphrasing technique was used in several paraphrase patterns and in turn, several paraphrasing techniques could be used in one Thai paraphrase pattern.","Hence, this analysis of paraphrase patterns and techniques gives a total of six Thai sentence paraphrasing techniques to be proposed here. Later in this section, these techniques along with their operating procedures and examples will be described. Out of these six, three techniques including the Replacement Technique, the Movement Technique, and the Left-Out/Insert Technique involve changing individual words or phrases, all by itself. The second group of the proposed paraphrasing techniques includes the Switching Technique and the Promotion/Demotion Technique. These techniques involve making a change of the words, phrases, or clauses in pairs. Finally, the remaining paraphrasing technique called the Nominalization Technique changes the structure of the original sentence or phrase.","Throughout this section and the next, the initial sentence to be paraphrased for demonstration purposes of the six paraphrasing techniques is given in the following Si. 383","(Si) เขา/he-Agent และ/and-ParallelMarker เธอ/she-Dative ทองเที่ยว/travel-MotionAction อยาง/AdverbMarker สนุกสนาน/joyfully-Quality ใน/in-PositionMarker กรุงเทพฯ/Krung Thep-Locative"]},{"title":"He and she travel joyfully in Krung Thep.","paragraphs":["In addition, the meaning of Si is represented in the CLCS form shown in Figure 3 to be used as an input for starting the paraphrase generation processes.  Figure 3: The CLCS Form for Si  Figure 4: The Decomposition of the CLCS for Si","When the TPG system is triggered, the CLCS input is decomposed into many TLCSs in the CLCS Decomposition process. Then TLCSs are normalized into semantic base forms, which will be hereafter called the “TLCSs input”, as illustrated in Figure 4. Afterwards, the TLTAG Selection and the Surface Realization processes will be activated on the TLCSs input for all fourteen Thai sentence paraphrase patterns under the restriction of each pattern using the following six Thai sentence paraphrasing techniques to be described in more details now."]},{"title":"3.1","paragraphs":["The Replacement Technique This Replacement Technique makes use of the variety of words having similar meanings. One existing word or phrase in a sentence can then be replaced by a new word or phrase with the similar meaning in the same syntactic category without changing its position and its thematic role. Figure 5 also show two types of elementary TLTAG trees, according to the LTAG theory (Joshi, 1999), which correspond to TLCSs of the initial sentence Si.","An example of using this Replacement Technique will be illustrated in the context of one paraphrase patterns, namely, the Lexical Replacement by Its Synonym pattern. Typically, the TLTAG Selection process selects all elementary TLTAG trees from the TLCS–TLTAG Resource in which their TLCSs precisely agree with the TLCS input. However, in this case, the Lexical Replacement pattern forces the process to specifically choose the trees not just only whose TLCSs are identical to the TLCS input but also whose syntactic structures are the same as that of the TLCS input tree.

Since α2 has both the same TLCS and TLTAG as α1, α2 is thus selected as a 384 synonym of α1. Similar process can be applied to another original decomposed word “กรุงเทพฯ/Krung Thep” and results in the TLCS and TLTAG α6 whereas α7 is TLCS and TLTAG for the synonym “บางกอก/Bangkok” of this decomposed word.","In the next step, these elementary trees are realized into well-formed surfaces by LTAG’s operations shown in Figure 6.

Its syntactic category and thematic role remain unchanged (Thonglor, 2007; Songsilp, 2008). For example, this Movement Technique is used in the Direct Object Promotion pattern of the fourteen Thai sentence paraphrase patterns by moving the direct object to the front of the sentence.","In another example, moving around the negative marker in a sentence can reduce or sometimes increase the negative sense of the sentence and thus make it more or sometimes less polite than the initial sentence as demonstrated in the Moving Negation Separated from Adjective/Adverb pattern.","The Movement Technique in the Preposition Phrase Promotion pattern will be explained here. For the given initial sentence Si, the TLTAG Selection process selects TLTAG elementary trees corresponding to TLCS inputs. These elementary trees are realized into surface strings which contain the preposition modifier of the main verb. Subsequently, the Moving Technique will move the entire preposition branch around these three locations, namely, the front of the sentence, right after the main verb, or the back of the sentence, depending on its promotion/demotion switch.","In Figure 7, each sentence paraphrase can be read off of the leaf nodes of its associated TLTAG derived tree as follows. 385","(Sp4) ใน/in-PositionMarker กรุงเทพฯ/Krung Thep-Locative เขา/he-Agent และ/and-ParallelMarker เธอ/you-Dative ทองเที่ยว/travel-MotionAction อยาง/AdverbMarker สนุกสนาน/joyfully-Quality"]},{"title":"In Krung Thep, he and she are joyfully traveled.","paragraphs":["(Sp5) เขา/he-Agent และ/and-ParallelMarker เธอ/you-Dative ทองเที่ยว/travel-MotionAction ใน/in-PositionMarker กรุงเทพฯ/Krung Thep-Locative อยาง/AdverbMarker สนุกสนาน/joyfully-Quality"]},{"title":"He and she travel in Krung Thep that they are joyfully.","paragraphs":["Figure 7: The TLTAG Derived Trees for Both Sp4 and Sp5 Obtained from the Movement Technique"]},{"title":"3.3","paragraphs":["The Removal/Insertion Technique This technique comprises of two independent operations. One involves removing a word from the sentence in order to make it more compact and probably more appealing. The other operation of this technique involves inserting a word into the sentence in order to make it clearer or more sophisticated. These operations are both in fact employed in the Quantifier Removal/Insertion pattern but only the insertion operation will be explicitly demonstrated here.","The Insertion Technique first investigates the TLCS input. For the case that the initial sentence has more than one agent doing the same action such as “เขา/he and เธอ/she” of Si taking the same action “ทองเที่ยว/travel”, the quantifier “ลวน/all” can be inserted after the agents and before the action/modifier to emphasize that every single component really performs the same action or share the same property at the same time. By inserting this type of word, the meaning of the sentence is stressed more strongly. Caused by the Insertion Technique, an additional tree for the quantifier “ลวน/all” is selected by the TLTAG Selection process and then realized as part of the sentence paraphrase during the Surface Realization process as shown in Figure 8.","","Figure 8: The Elementary Tree for “ลวน/all” and","the TLTAG Derived Tree for Sp6 Obtained from","the Insertion Technique The sentence paraphrase is read off of the leaf","nodes of the Sp6 tree, as follows.","(Sp6) เขา/he-Agent และ/and-ParallelMarker เธอ/she-Dative ลวน/all-Amount ทองเที่ยว/travel-MotionAction อยาง/AdverbMarker สนุกสนาน/joyfully-Quality ใน/in-PositionMarker กรุงเทพฯ/Krung Thep-Locative "]},{"title":"All he and she are joyfully traveled in Krung Thep.","paragraphs":["As for the next three paraphrasing techniques, the ideas behind each technique along with its operating procedure will be briefly discussed in this section.

The verbs in this class must be followed by the preposition “กับ/with-ParticipantMarker” to indicate the togetherness of its subject and object. Every word in the Reciprocity Action verb class such as “เผชิญหนา/confront”, “ตอสู/fight”, “สัญญา/engage”, and “หมั้น/engage” etc. can switch its arguments, i.e., its thematic roles. This Switching Technique is exercised in the Arguments Switching in the Reciprocity Action paraphrase pattern as follows:","(exi1) สมศรี/Somsri-Agent หมั้น/engages-ReciprocityAction กับ/with-ParallelMarker สมชาย/Somchai-Participant"]},{"title":"Somsri engages (with) Somchai.","paragraphs":["(exp1) สมชาย/Somchai-Agent หมั้น/engages-ReciprocityAction กับ/with-ParallelMarker สมศรี/Somsri-Participant"]},{"title":"Somchai engages (with) Somsri.","paragraphs":["The switching technique can also apply to other paraphrase patterns, such as Verb/Adverb Position Switching, which will be demonstrated in Section 4, and Switching Clauses in Multi-Clause sentence as explained in the following example.","(exi2) ขโมย/a thief-Agent หนีไป/flee-MotionAction กอน/before-TimeMarker ตํารวจ/a policeman-Agent มาถึง/arrive-MotionAction "]},{"title":"A thief had fled before a policeman arrived.","paragraphs":["(exp2) ตํารวจ/a policeman-Agent มาถึง/arrive-MotionAction หลัง/ after-TimeMarker ขโมย/a thief-Agent หนีไป/flee-MotionAction แลว/ago-PastTense "]},{"title":"A policeman arrived after a thief had fled. 3.5","paragraphs":["The Promotion/Demotion Technique The Promotion mechanism usually occurs at the same time with the Demotion mechanism. The idea behind this technique is that as one word/phrase is promoted, another grammatically related word/ phrase must be demoted. Since this technique is often used in conjunction with other techniques in generating paraphrases, the generation procedure will then be explained in Section 4."]},{"title":"3.6","paragraphs":["The Nominalization Technique The last technique to be presented changes the structure of a simple sentence/phrase but still preserves the original meaning of its initial sentence.","In Thai language, there are two prefixes for transforming a verb into an abstract noun (Thonglor, 2007). The first prefix is “การ-/karn-” comparable to the suffix “-ing” in English, to put in front of an action verb, e.g., “กิน/eat” to make a noun, e.g., “การกิน/eating”. The second prefix is “ความ-/kwam-” comparable to the suffix “-ness” to put in front of a mental verb, e.g., “เสียใจ/sad” to make a noun, e.g., “ความเสียใจ/sadness”. Notice that in this case, to and maintain its similar forms in both Thai and English, the Thai mental verb becomes an adjective in English.","This process can be extended to nominalize a simple sentence into a noun phrase for use in combination with the previous paraphrasing techniques for obtaining a new sentence paraphrase.","Given a simple sentence, the first step of this Nominalization Technique inserts the prefix “การ-/ karn-” or “ความ-/kwam-” in front of the verb phrase. Then, the subject is moved to the end of the sentence and connected to the just-constructed noun phrase using the preposition marker such as “ของ/of” or “โดย/by”. The new noun phrase is often used as a subject phrase or an object phrase or a modifier phrase in generating a new and more complex paraphrase as shown in the following example.","(exi3) นิวตัน/Newton-Agent คนพบ/discover-TargetAction แรง","โนมถวง/gravity-Target",""]},{"title":"Newton discovers gravity.","paragraphs":["(exp3) [การ-prefix/karn คนพบ/discover-TargetAction แรงโนมถวง/","gravity-Target]/AbstractNoun ของ/of-PossessorMarker นิวตัน/","Newton-Agent",""]},{"title":"Gravity discovering of Newton","paragraphs":["."]},{"title":"4 Combinations of the Proposed Thai Sentence Paraphrasing Techniques","paragraphs":["To generate a new and probably more complex Thai sentence paraphrase, a combination of the paraphrasing techniques in Section 3 will be 387 employed. All possible combinations for use in the Thai sentence paraphrase patterns are depicted in Table 1. For illustration purposes, the paraphrase generation process of a combination of these particular three techniques, namely, the Switching, the Promotion/Demotion and the Nominalization Techniques will be applied to the Verb/Adverb Position Switching pattern and also fully explained now as follows.","In Thai grammar, an adverb usually acts as a modifier or sometimes an intransitive verb. This is where the Switching Technique comes in. However, since the syntactic functions of the verb and the adverb should also be interchanged, the adverb is grammatically promoted to a new verb while the current verb is demoted to a modifier of the new verb. Consequently, the Promotion/ Demotion Technique is therefore used. Last but not least, during the Demotion mechanism, the Nominalization Technique is also needed in transforming the current verb into an abstract noun in order to make the modifier complete.","Figure 9 illustrates an example of the above process in generating a paraphrase of the initial sentence Si using the combination of the three mentioned techniques.","After the TLTAG Selection and Surface Realization processes yield the TLTAG Derived Trees for Si, the Verb/Adverb Position Switching pattern guides the process to look for the main verb and the adverb of the sentence. The obtained main verb “ทองเที่ยว-vi/travel” and its adverb “สนุกสนาน- adv/joyfully” are switched constituting the Switching Technique. Then, the adverb is promoted to a new verb “สนุกสนาน-vi/enjoy” while the old verb is demoted to a modifier for the new verb constituting the Promotion/Demotion Technique. During the demotion mechanism, a new elementary tree “กับ-perp/with” is acquired. This step then forces the Nominalization Technique to activate and form a newly transformed abstract noun “การ-prefix/karn ทองเที่ยว-vi/travel” into a new branch of the Sp7 TLTAG Derived Tree so that the new resulting paraphrase will be grammatically correct. Finally, the obtained sentence paraphrase can be read off of the leaf nodes of the Sp7 tree as follows.","(Sp7) เขา/he-Agent และ/and-ParallelMarker เธอ/she-Dative สนุก สนาน/enjoy-AdditionAction กับ/with-GoalMarker [การ- prefix/karn ทองเที่ยว/travel-MotionAction]/AbstractNoun-Complementary ใน/in-PositionMarker กรุงเทพฯ/Krung Thep-Locative"]},{"title":"He and she enjoy (with) traveling in Krung Thep.","paragraphs":["In addition, other Thai sentence paraphrase patterns may use different combinations of the proposed six paraphrasing techniques to generate more complex paraphrases.
