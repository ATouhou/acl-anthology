In light of the semantic classification from Semantic Knowledge-base of Contemporary Chinese (SKCC) and Qualia Structures introduced by Pustejovsky (1991, 1995), we analyze the combinations of the semantic classes of the noun compounds, and thus, discover the implicit predicates of the noun compounds. Based on these semantic relations of the nouns, we summarize the semantic patterns of the noun compounds and built up an interpretation template database of the paraphrasing verbs for the noun compounds. In conjunction with this database, we further develope an automatic interpreatation program of Chinese noun compounds."]},{"title":"1 Background","paragraphs":["As the society is developing rapidly with a lot of new ideas and technologies, noval names sprout out to denote these new concepts, products and etc.. Many noval names are created in the form of noun-noun compound. The phrase pattern “n1+n2” is ambiguous, since it represents different syntactic constructions,such as predication construction, modifier-head construction, appositional construction, and paratactic construction. Among these constructions, the inner semantic relation of the modifier-head “n1+n2” construction is especially complicated. There is a semantic compression with an invisible predicate implied in the noun compounds. Since the predicate is invisible, the semantic relations between the head and the modifier are not quite clear","1",".For example, “木头桌子”(the wood table, which means that the table is made of wood), “ 爱情故事”(love story, which means that the story is about love2","), “钢材仓库”(steel warehouse, which has two different meanings: the warehouse to store  1 Some modifier-head constructions have implicit nouns, for example, “封面女郎”(cover girl, which means that the girl whose photos are on the cover) .   2 Cf. Yuan Yulin (1995). 609 steel, and the warehouse made of steel3","). We suggest that the implicit predicate could be the paraphrase verb that reveals the semantic relations between the modifier and the head in noun compounds. Thus, the aim of this paper is to discover the implicit predicate of the noun compounds and to generate the paraphrases of the noun compounds.","The modifier-head noun compounds are basic constructions in almost all languages. As they are “derivative, easily composed but ambiguious”(Wang Meng, et al. 2010), they have aroused much interest in Theoretical Linguistics and Computational Linguistics. As Wang Meng et al. (2010) points out, the research on Chinese noun compounds interpretation can be applied in the fields like question answering, information retrieval and lexicography. We suggest that the noun compounds interpretation is crucial in information retrieval.","A basic information retrieval process contains the following steps: submiting searching request → sending the request → sorting → seaching index → selecting pages → ranking results → presentation of the results. The information retrieval appears to be a simple behavior accomplised in just a few seconds, while a lot of analysis and operations are needed after a simple query","4",". The operating procedures in information retrieval are generally divided into two parts: one part is to analyze the users’ search intention which is top-down, and the other part is to analyze the structure and meaning of the searching words which is bottom-up. Both parts are important to obtain the required results.","Therefore, if we want to interprate the   3 Cf. Zhou Ren (2007). 4 Cf. Sina Reports on Science and technology, Mar. 12, 2012. http://www.sina.com.cn. noun compounds automatically, we need to understand the ontological meaning of the noun compounds that submitted by the web user, and provide references of the users’ search intentions as well. For example, when a user inputs “蔬菜大王”(vegetable king) as the searching word, we guess that he maybe wants to know the news about “蔬 菜大王”(vegetable king). However, the noun compound “蔬菜大王”(vegetable king) happens to be an ambiguous noun compound. It might means someone who sells/buys vegetables, or someone who plants vegetables, or someone who eats vegetables. If we can decote these different meanings of the compound “蔬菜大王”, we can provide the different searching results for the user. Thus, to recover the implicit predicates of the noun compounds is helpful to understand the users’ search intentions.","In order to have a better understanding of the search intentions, we have collected 850 Chinese noun compounds from the daily top search terms of Baidu news","5"," (2010.9 to 2011.4) and some other literature texts. Besides the basic analysis of the semantic relations and the implicit predicates of these noun compounds, we need the following steps to arrive at their semantic patterns: (1) we summarize the combination patterns according to the semantic classes of the nouns from SKCC. We thus can predict the implicit predicates according to the semantic classes of the modifier and head nouns; (2) in light of the Qualia Structures introduced by Pustejovsky (1991, 1995), we find out that most implicit verbs of the noun compounds are agentive roles or telic roles of the head noun. We thus treat them as paraphrase verbs to reveal the semantic relations of the noun compounds. (3) In the base of the paraphrase verbs, we build up a paraphrase database and an    5 http://top.baidu.com 610   automatic paraphrase program of the noun compounds."]},{"title":"2 The semantic classification of nouns","paragraphs":["The Semantic Knowledge-base of Contemporary Chinese (SKCC) is a large scale Chinese semantic resource developed by the Institute of Computational Linguistics of Peking University. It provides a large amount of semantic information such as semantic hierarchy and collocation features for 66,539 Chinese words and their English counterparts (Wang and Yu, 2003). Because the classification of nouns is designed for the need of grammatical research (Wang Hui, et al. 2006) and is based on grammatical analysis (Wang and Yu, 2003), we adopt this classification standard as the basis to construct the interpretation templates of the noun compounds. The semantic classification of nouns in SKCC is as follows:","","1 thing","1.1 entity","1.1.1 organism 1.1.1.1 person","1.1.1.1.1 individual","1.1.1.1.1.1 name","1.1.1.1.1.2 profession","1.1.1.1.1.3 identity","1.1.1.1.1.4 relation","1.1.1.1.2 group","1.1.1.1.2.1 organization","1.1.1.1.2.2 society 1.1.1.2animal 1.1.1.2.1 beast 1.1.1.2.2 bird 1.1.1.2.3 insect 1.1.1.2.4 fish 1.1.1.2.5 reptile 1.1.1.3 plant 1.1.1.3.1 tree 1.1.1.3.2 grass 1.1.1.3.3 flower 1.1.1.3.4 crop 1.1.1.4 microbe","1.1.2 object 1.1.2.1 artifact","1.1.2.1.1 building","1.1.2.1.2 clothes","1.1.2.1.3 food","1.1.2.1.4 drug","1.1.2.1.5 cosmetics","1.1.2.1.6 works 1.1.2.1.7 software 1.1.2.1.8 hardware 1.1.2.1.9 asset 1.1.2.1.10 bill 1.1.2.1.11 certificate 1.1.2.1.12 symbol 1.1.2.1.13 material 1.1.2.1.14 instrument","1.1.2.1.14.1 tool","1.1.2.1.14.2 vehicle","1.1.2.1.14.3 weapon","1.1.2.1.14.4 furniture","1.1.2.1.14.5","musical-instrument","1.1.2.1.14.6 electricity","1.1.2.1.14.7 stationery","1.1.2.1.14.8 sports-instrument","1.1.2.2 natural object 1.1.2.2.1 celestial body 1.1.2.2.2 geography 1.1.2.2.2.1 land 1.1.2.2.2.2 water 1.1.2.2.3 weather 1.1.2.2.4 mineral 1.1.2.2.5 element 1.1.2.2.6 substance","1.1.2.3 excrement","1.1.2.4 shape","1.1.3 part","1.1.3.1 body-part","1.1.3.2 object-part","1.2 abstraction 611","1.2.1 attribute 1.2.1.1 measurable 1.2.1.2 fuzzy attribute","1.2.1.2.1 property_of_human","1.2.1.2.2 description_of_event","1.2.1.2.3 property_of_object 1.2.1.3 color","1.2.2 information","1.2.3 field","1.2.4 rule","1.2.5 physiological_state","1.2.6 psycho feature 1.2.6.1 feelings","1.2.6.2 cognition 1.2.7 motivation","2 process 2.1 event 2.2 natural phenomenon","2.2.1 visible phenomenon","2.2.2 audible phenomenon","3 space 3.1 location 3.2 direction","4 time 4.1 specific time 4.2 relative time"]},{"title":"3 The Qualia Structures of nouns: Agentive roles and Telic roles","paragraphs":["The generative lexicon theory (here after GLT), which is proposed by Pustejovsky (1991, 1995), has a great impact in the field of linguistics and natural language processing. Based on the computation and cognition background, this theory deals with natural language semantics, in particular the semantics of words, both alone and in combination, i.e. the problem of compositionality. It aims to explain the meanings of words in the specific contexts by using a detailed description of semantics of words and building a limited semantic operation mechanism.","GLT has divided the semantics of words into four levels: argument structure, qualia structure, event structure and lexical inheritance structure. Argument structure is a specification of number and type of logical arguments, and how they are realized syntactically. Qualia structure is the modes of explanation that includes Formal, Constitutive, Telic and Agentive roles. Event structure is the definition of the event type of a lexical item and a phrase, whose sorts include State, Process, and Transition. Lexical inheritance structure is the identification of how a lexical structure is related to other structures in the type lattice, and its contribution to the global organization of a lexicon. A set of generative devices connects these four levels, providing for the compositional interpretation of words in context (Pustejovsky, 1995: 61).","The qualia structure is inspired by Aristotel’s Four Causes. A qualia structure has four roles: constitutive role is the relation between an object and its constituents, or proper parts (including Material, Weight, Parts and Component elements); formal role is the basic category which distinguishes the object within a larger domain (including Orientation, Magnitude, Shape, Dimensionality and so on); telic role is the purpose and function of the object; agentive role is the factors involed in the origin or “bringing about” of an object. In fact, a noun’s qualia structure illustrates the things, events and relationships related to the object, which is very helpful to the interpretation of noun compounds.","In light of this idea, we find that most implicit predicates of the noun compounds (n1+n2) are n1 or n2’s telic roles or agentive roles. So we can use nouns’ telic roles or agentive roles to build the database of   612 interpretation templates of noun compounds6","."]},{"title":"4 The cognitive basis of noun compounds","paragraphs":["From the perspective of cognition, every noun compounds (n1+n2) has a hidden event (we call it “background event”). When events in concept are expressed in the level of language,it always includes verbs and the arguments dominated by the verbs. The words of n1 and n2 are usually the arguments of the verbs. For example, “红木家具”(mahogany furniture), whose background event is making furniture by mahogany. “Mahogany” is the Material role of “make”, while “furniture” is the Product role of “make”. Another example is “ 体操奶奶”(gymnastics grandma). Its background event is that a grandma does gymnastics. “Grandma” is the Agent role of “do”, while “gymnastics” is the Result role of “do”.","When the speaker wants to emphasize a certain semantic role (noun) of the event in a declarative way, de structure , a correspondent analytic pattern of NN compound, such as “NP1+V+的+NP2” or “V+NP1+的+NP2”, could also be used. In Chinese, particle de is ususuall considered as a marker introducing a relative clause for the head.","When the speaker use de structure, the the head of the noun is emphasized, while the modifiers,namely the verb and other arguments, are downgraded in the de structure, for example, “(用)红木制作的 家具”(the furniture which is made of mahogany) and “ 做体操的奶奶”(the grandma who does gymnastics). When the speaker usese “n1+n2”pattern, he wants to   6 Song Zuoyan (2010) has pointed out that the implicit predicate of noun compounds could be gotten by n1 or n2’s telic roles or agentive roles. But the details need to be further investigated and generalized. emphasize both the head n2 and the modifier n1, while the verb connecting n1 and n2 is omitted in the phonological level. For example, we use the Material “ 红 木 ”(mahogany) to be the modifier, the Product “家具”(furniture) to be the head, and get the noun compound“ 红木家 具”(mahogany furniture). Another example is that we use the Activity “ 体 操”(gymnastics) to be the modifier and the Agent “奶奶”(grandma) to be the head, and then we get the noun compound “体操奶 奶”(gymnastics grandma).","The listener usually intends to decode the noun compounds in the background events, which is built on the basis of common sense. Therefore, we can interpret the noun compounds just in a reverse process. We need to recover the semantic roles of n1 and n2 through their semantic classes and find out the predicate that dominates them. Then we can recover the whole background event completely. Especially, to find the verb that dominates the two nouns is the key to interpret the noun compound (n1+n2) 7",".","","As different kinds of noun compounds have different kinds of background events and implicit verbs, we have summarized different interpretation templates that express different background events from 850 noun compounds instances (n1+n2). Among these interpretation templates, we find that most implicit verbs of the noun compounds (n1+n2) are n1 or n2’s telic roles or agentive roles. For example, the explanation of “ 摩托妈妈”(Motorcycle Mom) is “骑/坐/造/修摩托的妈妈”(“the mom who rides on/makes/repairs the motorcycle”). In this case, the semantic class pattern is “artifact+ relation”. The verb “骑/坐”(ride on) is the telic role of n1“摩 托 ”(motorcycle), and the verb “ 造 /    7 Cf. Yuan Yulin (1995). 613 修 ”(make/repair) is the agentive role of n1“摩托”(motorcycle). Another example is “ 司机餐馆”(drivers restaurant), whose explanation is “(专门供)司机吃饭的餐 馆 ”(the restaurant is specially for the drivers). The semantic class pattern is “occupation+ building”. The verb “ 吃 饭 ”(eat) is the telic role of n2 “ 餐 馆 ”(restaurant). In the interpretation templates, we indicate the roles of the verbs. Meanwhile, we add their telic roles and agentive roles in the noun knowledge database. We thus build up a data model that is based on the knowledge and approach of linguistics for the interpretation of noun compounds."]},{"title":"5 The computation procedures and the interaction between semantic patterns and interpretation templates 5.1 The computation procedures Electronically-available resources","paragraphs":["Based on the analysis in the above chapters, we deal with the 850 instances of the noun compounds (n1+n2) in the following proeduress:","(1) Use the segmentation software to split all the noun compounds (n1+n2) into n1+n2.","(2) Find all n1s’ and n2s’ semantic classes in SKCC and describe the semantic class combination patterns with the semantic classes of n1 and n2. We abstract the tokens of noun compounds into types of combination patterns. We thus can predict the implicit predicates (paraphrasing verbs) according to the semantic classes of the modifier and head nouns","Since the lexicon database in SKCC is limited, we can add an unknown word’s semantic class manually.","(3) Paraphrase the interpretation template with implicit predicates for every noun compound. We also specify the roles of the verbs. Is it the role of n1 or n2, and is it an agentive role or telic role? If it is a qualia structure role of n1, we mark it as v1; if it is a qualia structure role of n2, we mark it as v2.","(4) Every noun compound (n1+n2) has a semantic class combination pattern and an interpretation template. We sort out these semantic class patterns and interpretation templates to build up a noun-noun coordination database."]},{"title":"5.2 The interaction between semantic patterns and interpretation templates","paragraphs":["We have summarized 326 semantic class patterns (here after semantic patterns) and 208 interpretation templates in total. These semantic patterns can be divided into two classes: (1) a sematic pattern in correspondence with one interpretation template; (2) a semantic pattern in correspondence with two or more interpretation templates.","(1) a sematic pattern in correspondence with one interpretation template;","We have gotten 212 such semantic patterns, and 62 corresponding interpretation templates. We choose ten interpretation templates and the corresponding semantic patterns randomly, and list them below:","i. If the semantic class of n1 is “tool” and the semantic class of n2 is “cognition”, the interpretation template is “(通过)+n1+ 表现+ 的 +n2” ((through)+n1+express+De+n2). The verb “表现” (express) can be seen as the agentive role of n2. For example, “瓷器爱国主义” (china patriotism), the interpretation is “(通 过)瓷器表现的爱国主义”(the patriotism which is expressed through the china).","ii. If the semantic class of n1 is   614 “relative time” and the semantic class of n2 is “field”, the interpretation template is “n1+ 产生+ 的 +n2/ 产生于+n1+的 +n2” (n1+be produced+De+n2/Be produced in+n1+De+n2). N1 is the time when n2 is/was produced. For example, “当代文学” (contemporary literature), the interpretation is “当代产生的文学/产生于当代的文学” (the literature which is produced in contemporary age).","iii. If the semantic class of n1 is “organization” and the semantic class of n2 is “location”, the interpretation template is “n1+建立+的+n2” (n1+build+De+n2). The verb “建立” (build) can be seen as the agentive role of n2. For example, “网易养 猪场” (Wangyi Pig farm), the interpretation is “ 网易建立的养猪场” (The pig farm which is built by Wangyi).","iv. If the semantic class of n1 is “profession” and the semantic class of n2 is “organization”, the interpretation template is “ 供 +n1+v2+ 的 +n2” (For+n1+v2+De+n2). The verb v2 is the telic role of n2.

If the semantic pattern is “building+material”, or “food+drug”, the interpretation template is “v1+n1+ 用 + 的 +n2” (v1+n1+use+De+n2). The verb v1 is the agentive role of n1 (such as “修建” (build), “ 制作” (make), etc.). The corresponding examples are “ 建筑钢材” (building steel), “ 食品添加剂” (food additives), their corresponding    9 Most nouns that are n2s are monovalent nouns, and n1 is an argument of n2. 615 interpretations are “ 修建建筑用的钢材” (the steels that are used for building), “制作 食品用的添加剂” (the additives that are used for food).","x. If the semantic pattern is “location+cosmetics”, or “location+excrement”, or “location+food”, or “location+tool”, the interpretation template is “ 产自+n1+ 的 +n2” (produce in+n1+De+n2).

Its corresponding interpretation is “由社会等 诸因素组成的环境” (the environment which is composed of society and other factors); f. “ 考虑+n1+ 的 +n2” (consider+n1+De+n2). For example, “政治 头脑” (politics mind). Its corresponding interpretation is “考虑政治(方面问题)的 头脑” (the mind which considers about politics). There are many meanings of this semantic pattern. That’s because the meanings of nouns of filed and nouns of abstraction are very fuzzy, and it’s hard to decide which verb connects the two nouns."]},{"title":"6 Summary","paragraphs":["All in all, we build up an interpretation template database that contains the paraphrasing verbs for noun compounds in Chinese. Based on this database, we exploit some other language resources (such as Hownet) to generate the telic roles and agentive roles of every noun automatically. Finally, we develop a program to automatically interpret the meanings of the noun compounds. The accuracy of this program is 94.23% by manual evaluation. 13",""]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Rumshishy, Anna and James Pustejosky. 2011.
