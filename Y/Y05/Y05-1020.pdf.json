Their symmetric and asymmetric contrasts are accounted for with idealized cognitive models (ICMs) and metonymic models. These models are used to delineate the core meaning and main meaning extension routes of nei4 and wai4: from the area of a region to the length of the radius or side, and then to distance. Locations of the observer, marked foci, container metaphors and social backgrounds also contribute to the asymmetry of the two terms. The synchronic difference between nei4 and wai4 can also be attributed to diachronic changes.  1. Introduction 1.1 Symmetry and Asymmetry of nei4 and wai41  Nei4 內 ‘in’ and wai4 外 ‘out’ are two Mandarin location terms that represent speakers’ conceptualization of space. It is shown that they behave similarly and share an extensive set of collocation patterns as in (1). 1a. wu1nei2 屋內 ‘in the house/room’ wu1wai4 屋外 ‘out of the house/room’ b. nei4ce4 內側 ‘inside’ wai4ce4 外側 ‘outside’ c. nei4xiao1 內銷 ‘sell domestically’ wai4xiao1 外銷 ‘export’ d. zai4 huang2gong1 zhi1 nei4 在皇宮之內 ‘in the palace’ zai4 huang2gong1 zhi1 wai4 在皇宮之外 ‘out of the palace’. e. yi4bai3 kong1chi3 yi3nei4 一百公尺以內 ‘within one hundred meters’ yi4bai3 kong1chi3 yi3wai4 一百公尺以外 ‘beyond one hundred meters’   1 Mandarin tones are marked with numerals. 1 stands for the first tone, a high level tone, 2 the second tone with a rising contour, 3 the third tone, a falling and rising tone, 4 the fourth tone, a high falling tone, and 5 the neutral tone.  However, there are also significant contrasts in terms of compound word formation as in (2): 2a. *ye3nei4 野內 ye3wai4 野外 ‘the field’ *yi4nei4 意內 yi4wai4 意外 ‘unexpected, accident’ ren4nei4 任內 ‘during one’s tenure’ *ren4wai4 任外 b. *nei4guo2 內國 wai4guo2 外國 ‘foreign country’ *nei4qi1 內戚 wai4qi1 外戚 ‘maternal relatives’ nei4mu4 內幕 (xiao1xi2 消息) ‘inside (news)’ *wai4mu4 外幕(xiao1xi2 消息) c. *nei4yu4 內遇 wai4yu4 外遇 ‘extramarital affairs’ nei4ding4 內定 (ren2xuan4 人選) ‘tapped (candidate)’ *wai4ding4 外定 (ren2xuan4 人選) d. *pai2nei4 排內 pai2wai4 排外 ‘exclude foreigners; xenophobia’ jian4nei4 賤內 ‘(my) humble wife’ *jian4wai4 賤外 e. zai4 wu3 nian2 yi3nei4 在五年以內 ‘within five years’ * zai4 wu3 nian2 yi3wai4 在五年以外 f. yi4bai3 yuan2 yi3nei4 一百元以內 ‘less than one hundred dollars’ *yi4bai3 yuan2 yi3wai4 一百元以外  The goal of this paper is to account for both the similarities and contrasts in terms of lexical conceptualization.  1.2 Internal structure of nei4 and wai4 collocations One possibility to account for the above asymmetry is to examine structural and functional contrasts. As noted, the above examples fall into the following patterns according to their internal structures: 3. a. Noun+ nei4/wai4, e.g. examples in (1a) and (2a) b. nei4/wai4+ Noun, e.g. examples in (1b) and (2b) c. Verb+ nei4/wai4, e.g. examples in (2d) d. nei4/wai4+Verb, e.g. examples in (1c) and (2c) e. zai4/yu2+ NP+yi3/zhi1+nei4/wai4, e.g. examples in (1d), (1e), (2e) and (2f)  It is clear that an explanatory account of the contrasts between nei4 and wai4 cannot rely solely on structural terms. In this paper, we will present a concept-based lexical account.  ","Proceedings of PACLIC 19, the 19th Asia-Pacific Conference on Language, Information and Computation..  2. Literature review and comparison of English in and Chinese nei4 As it turns out, the literature on nei4/wai4 (in/out) has as wide range as their distribution. In this section, we will review English in and then propose questions regarding Chinese in and out.  2.1 Literature review on English in Clark (1973), Talmy (1983), Jackendoff (1983:162-164), Herskovits (1986), Jackendoff and Landau (1992, 1993), Levinson (1996:186-187), Talmy (2001) have studied English in and explicitly showed the following properties of English in: 3a. In belongs to a Place concept. (Talmy 1983, 2001) b. In denotes a three-dimensional space, which can be entirely enclosed, partially enclosed, bounded or unbounded. (Clark 1973, Jackendoff and Landau 1992, 1993, Levinson 1996:186-187) c. The ground of in should contain an interior. (Jackendoff and Landau 1992, 1993) d. The relation between the Figure and Ground of in should be close. (Herskovits 1986) e. Other factors: (i) Perspective: close-up view, precise knowledge of the position (ii) salience, (iii) penetration, (iv) convention, (v) function.\\ (Herskovits 1986)  Comparing with absolute coordinates, north, south, west, east, and relative or anthropocentric coordinates, left, right, front, back, scholars seem to have implicitly suggested that English in denote an intrinsic coordinate, cf.: 4a. John came in. b. John went in. c. John came out. d. John went out. 5a. John is in the house. b. John is out of the house. 6a. John is inside the house. b. John is outside the house.  Come and go are deictic verbs and both of them can co-occur with in and out as in (4a) to (4d), which suggests that in and out are not underspecified by a perspective. Whether the observer is in the house or not, s/he can describe another person’s being in or out the same house as in (5)-(6). Viewpoints of the observer do not seem to play an important role in in and out orientations. Further, as long as the Ground contains an interior, in and inside are synonyms, so are out and outside. They can be replaced by the other without violate any syntactic, morphological, or semantic rules.    2.2 Comparison of in and nei4 Does Chinese nei4 act like English in? The answer may be both ‘Yes’ and ‘No’, because morphologically, both nei4 and in can be pre-nominal modifiers, e.g. nei4lu4 內陸 and inland. Furthermore, from the point of view on asymmetry, there are differences between Chinese nei4 and wai4, so are there between English in and out. For example, (7a)-(7c) below are symmetric: 7a. inboard/outboard; inland/outland; inside/outside; indoor/outdoor; infield /outfield; incurve/outcurve; b. inflow/outflow; input/output; inrush/outrush; inlet/outlet; inner/outer;\\ c. inpatient/outpatient; insight/outsight; insole/outsole; inward/outward  And (7d)-(7g) are asymmetric2 : 7d. into/*outto/out of e. include /*outclude/exclude; f. influx /?ouflux; inscribe /?outscribe g. outcast/?incast; outspread/?inspread; outstretch/?instretch Furthermore, both in and nei4 show the penetration property. They select not only solid objects, but also the liquid, comparing (8) and (9) 3 : 8a. sugar and milk in the coffee (Herskovits 1986:151) b. ka1fei1 nei4 you3 tang2 咖啡內有糖 9a. in the clay (Herskovits 1986:151) b. nian2tu3 nei4 黏土內 However, English in and Chinese nei4 may behave differently. Concerning on the static spatial uses, in is a preposition whereas nei4 is a postposition in (10). Though both in and nei4 can collocate abstract nouns such as guan1xi5 關係 ‘relation, relationship’, only in can take memory as shown in (11). In as a preposition can co-occur with other spatial terms, but nei4 cannot, cf. (12a) and (12b). In addition to expressing states, in can also denotes certain functions as wearing in (13a) and receiving education in (13b) (Herskovits 1986). These sentences cannot be interpreted with nei4. 10a. John is in the house. b. Li3si4 zai4 wu1nei4 李四在屋內。  2 Other asymmetric examples such as interior/*outterior/exterior, intramural /*outtramural/extramural, intrinsic /*outrinsic/extrinsic, etc. have French and Latin origins. 3 Herskovits (1986:151) shows the difference between in and inside. Inside selects only objects only, e.g. sugar and milk in/*inside the coffee vs. in/inside the clay. Chinese li3(mian4) can take both kinds of objects.","Proceedings of PACLIC 19, the 19th Asia-Pacific Conference on Language, Information and Computation..  11a. in his memory b. *ta1de5 ji4yi4 nei4 他的記憶內 12a. in front of the house b. * wu1qian2nei4/*wu1nei4 qian2 屋前內/*屋內前 13a. a girl in red. b. He is in school.  It is reasonable to assume that mapping principles contributed the above asymmetrical phenomena. The direction of this metaphorical extension is from space to the others. (q.v. Heine, Claudi and Hünnemeyer 1991: 161, OBJECT>SPACE>TIME>QUALITY.) We will try to tackle their metaphorical extensions.  3. Metaphorical extension of nei4 and wai4 In this section we adopt the idealized cognitive models (ICM) proposed by Lakoff and Johnson (1999) to account for the data of nei4 and wai4.  3.1 Idealized cognitive models of nei4 and wai4 What semantic elements can be used to delineate nei4 and wai4? Let us start to think about this issue from the symmetrical cases in (1a)-(1d). Those nouns in (1a) and (1d) denote an area or an object which denotes a region, e.g. guo2 國 ‘country’, xiao4 校 ‘school’, wu1 屋 ‘house, room’, ch1 車 ‘car’, quan1 圈 ‘circle’ in (1a), and huang2gong1 皇宮 ‘palace’ in (4a). They may function as a container. Nei4 and wai4 refer to the position of the object as inside or outside of the region or container. The region or container may have entrances or boundaries such as men2 門 ‘door’, sai4 塞 ‘citadel’, and guan1 關 ‘barrier’. It is obvious that the size and shape of the region or container are topological. The region/container may be as large as a country or as small as a car or a circle. It may have a regular shape as a circle or a square like a door, yet it may also have an irregular outlook as a country or a school. Hence, the idealized cognitive model for nei4 and wai4 may be a region, totally or partially enclosed, with or without an entrance, but normally with sides and boundaries or angles. The most important of all is that it must have a certain area which can be recognized as an interior. Therefore, the idealized cognitive model, a region or a container, can be illustrated as (14) below. 14. ICM of nei4 and wai4 Region/container: area boundary/sides angles entrance   The brackets mark the optional element of a region. The component elements in (14) help to delimit the range of the elaborations.  3.2 Metonymic models of nei4 and wai4 A region may be depicted by an entity which covers the whole area such as guo2 國 ‘country’ and xiao4 校 ‘school’ and so on. It may be described by its area, the total coverage of the region. If the entity is in a square shape and the exact side length is known, then one may use an expression like ‘its area is 100 m2 ’ or ‘it is 25 cm2 π’ when it is a circle. Here are two simple arithmetic formulas: the area of a square is the square of the length of its side, and the area of a circle equals to the square of it radius multiples π. Therefore, it is possible for boundaries and sides to stand for regions: 15. Metonymic models of nei4 and wai4","Region: area ○= (1⁄2diameter=radius)2 x π radius boundary □= (the length of a side) 2 side length side  Further more, since the radius and side length denote not only an area but also a length from a center to a boarder or an end of a line to the other end of the line, and hence there is an area-distance transfer as shown in (16): 16. Metonymic models of 內 and 外 and the denotation","Region: area ○= (1⁄2diameter=radius)2 x π radius boundary □= (the length of a side) 2 side length side  Sentences in (17a) and (17b) prove this metonymic transfer: 17a. Fan1yuan2 bai3 li3 zhi1 nei4 wu2 ren2yan1 方圓百里之內無人煙 ‘There are no people within the area of 100 miles.’ b. Yi4 bai3 gong1li3 yi3nei4 dou1 mei2you3 ren2 一百公里以內都沒有人. ‘There are no people in 100 km.’ (17b) is more colloquial than (17a), in which fan1yuan2 方圓 ‘square and circle/area’ marks bai3 li3 百里 ‘100 miles’ a radius or the length of a side. There is no area marker in (17b), and hence yi4 bai3 gong1li3 一百公里 ‘100 km’ is interpreted as an area from the area-distance transfer.  3.3 Perspective and embodiment The above ICM can account for most of cases in (1a), and the metonymic models provide us a better understanding of (1d). However, nei4 and wai4 do allow different distance","Proceedings of PACLIC 19, the 19th Asia-Pacific Conference on Language, Information and Computation..  perspective and embodiment. When the area is viewed with a neutral perspective, both the inside and outside of the region are transparent as illustrated in (18a) below: 18a.  In (18a), the observer takes an objective view of the region and both nei4 and wai4 are of the same transparency. Consequently, nei4 and wai4 are symmetric as in (1a)-(1d): guo2nei4 國內 ‘inside the country; domestic’/guo2wai4 國外 ‘outside the country; abroad’; nei4meng2 內蒙 ‘Inner Mongolia’/ wai4meng2 外蒙 ‘Outer Mongolia’; nei4xiao1 內銷 ‘sell domestically’/wai4xiao1 外銷 ‘export’, etc.  In addition, there is also a common metaphor, BODY IS CONTAINER, in cases of (18a). A body is conceptualized as having an inside, an outside and a surface. Lexicons construed in this way include nei4ke1 內科 ‘internal medicine’/wai4ke1 外科 ‘surgery’, nei4shang1 內傷 ‘internal injury’/wai4shang1 外傷 ‘external injury, trauma’, nei4yi1 內衣 ‘underwear’/wai4yi1 外衣 ‘outer garment(s)’, and nei4fu2 內服 ‘for internal use’/wai4yong4 外用 ‘for external use’ .4 Nei4 is conceptualized as inside the body (e.g. nei4shang1 內傷 ‘internal injury’), closer to the body (e.g. nei4yi1 內衣 ‘underwear’), inward direction (e.g. nei4fu2 內服 ‘to take (medicine)’), as well as being forced by physical needs (e.g. nei4ji2 內急 ‘hurry to the toilet (internal needs)’ and nei4jiu4 內疚 ‘feel guilty’). Wa i 4 also has similar converse senses. However, since need and guilty are conceptualized as driven by internal force, they do not collocate with wai4.  It is important to remember that human perception identifies a region by its contour, and such perception is also reflected in the linguistic description of shapes. Hence when we define a region in an ICM for IN and OUT, it is the description of the contour that is critical. And the description of a contour allows the possibility of the observers being internal to the contour or outside of the contour. However, when the region has an embodiment of a container, then the transparency is dependent on the perspective of the observer. In this case, what is contained in the container cannot be perceived from outside as shown in (18b) below.  4 In addition to nei4fu2 內服 ‘for internal use’/wai4yong4 外用 ‘for external use’, (18a) can be applied to other parallel expressions such as wai4biao3 外表 ‘appearance, surface, outside’/nei4zai4 內在 ‘internal, inside’, and nei4zang4 內臟 ‘internal organs’/wai4bu4qi4guan1 外部器官 ‘internal organs’, where nei4 and wai4 are followed by different morphemes within the same semantic domain. For example, both fu2 服 ‘to eat, to take’ and yong4 用 ‘to use, to apply’ are different ways for medical cure, zai4 在 ‘to be located’ and biao3 表‘to appear, to show, surface’ can both denote the position of a Theme, and zang4 臟 ‘internal organ(s)’ is a hyponym of qi4guan1 器官 ‘organ’.   18b. This perspective gives nei4 a privileged status and hence the only member allowed in compound formation, such as in nei4mu4 內幕 (xiao1xi2 消息) ‘inside (news)’, nei4ding4 內定 (ren2xuan3 人選) ‘tapped (candidate)’ etc. In each case, the region defined is an exclusive container and hence the contained is the only salient concept to be lexicalized. It is important to note that in this case the concept of container is the most important, while the position of the observer is not. This is why nei4mu4 (xiao1xi2) ‘inside (news)’ can be used by both a speaker who knows the information and a speaker who is seeking the information. This applies similarly to nei4xin1 內心 ‘in the heart’, which refers crucially to heart as a container of emotion as in nei4xin1 hen3 gao1xing4 內心很高興 ‘glad at heart ’, but does not refer to whose emotion.  Last, and perhaps the unmarked, case of ICM for IN/OUT does involve the location of the observer. The only possible position in this explicit observer model is that the observer is inside the region as in the following (19): 19.  In this model, the crucial concept is that the area defines the identities of the speaker. In this sense, there is no more need to refer to what is, but only to what IS NOT. In this case, then the salient concepts are the ones that do not belong to the speaker. Hence, for this conceptualization, it is wai4 ‘out/outside’ that is asymmetrically lexicalized. It is important to note that this scheme does produce the most number of lexicalization.  Besides, from human experiences, a nearer object is more controllable than a further one; one may get more familiar with it, and regard it as formal or take it for granted and consider it as legal. On the other hand, objects which leave one far are more uncontrollable, and one usually is not as familiar with them as those near ones. Far objects turn out to be unfamiliar, new (e.g. wai4guo2 外國 ‘foreign country’, wai4bi4 外幣 ‘foreign currency’, wai4lai2yu3 外 來語 ‘foreign language’, wai4xiao4 外校 ‘other schools, not the referring one’, wai4zu2 外","Proceedings of PACLIC 19, the 19th Asia-Pacific Conference on Language, Information and Computation..  族 ‘other tribes, not the referring one; people not of the same clan’, wai4ren2 外人 ‘outsider(s)’, pai2wai4 排外 ‘exclude foreigners; xenophobia’, mei4wai4 媚外 ‘to fawn on foreign powers’, jian4wai4 見外 ‘be considered as an outsider’), unexpected, special (e.g. yi4wai4 意外 ‘accident’, li4wai4 例外 ‘exception’, ge2wai4 格外 ‘especially’, extra (e.g. wai4kuai4 外快 ‘extra income’)5 , or informal (e.g. wai4hao4 外號 ‘nickname(s), wai4shi3 外 史 ‘an unofficial history’), abnormal (e.g. fa3wai4 法外 ‘beyond the law’ (shi1en1 施恩 ‘to bestow favor’)) and illegal (e.g. wai4yu4 外遇 ‘extramarital affairs’, hun1wai4qing2 婚外情 ‘extramarital liaison’).  4. Social backgrounds Chinese society is a paternal society contrary to maternal societies such Amis and Siraya societies, where husbands move to live with their wives and fathers and mothers in law. Chinese society is husband or father centered. This hierarchy and relationship project to lexicons.  Since husbands have power over wives, they are free to call their wives as jian4nei4 賤 內 ‘my humble wife’ while wives are not allowed to name their husbands as . * jian4wai4 賤 外 ‘my humble husband’. Maternal relatives are more remote than paternal relatives because, usually, people do not live with maternal relatives but paternal relatives. This makes paternal relatives bear a shorter distance and closer relation and hence are more familiar with children and the family, and also makes maternal relation marked: maternal relatives are wai4qi1 外戚 ‘outside relatives’, mother’s mother is wai4po2 外婆 ‘outside grandmother’, and mother’s father is wai4gong1 外公‘outside grandfather’ literally.  5. Other factors and future study Nowadays nei4zi3 內子 ‘my wife (inside person)’ and wai4zi3 外子 ‘my husband (outside person)’ seem to be symmetric.6 However, nei4ren2 內人 ‘my wife’ and wai4ren2 外 人 ‘outsider’ are asymmetric. The fact that wai4ren2 外人 ‘outsider’ is not comprehended as ‘my husband’ nor does nei4ren2 內人 ‘my wife’ refer to ‘insider’ may be under influence of the blocking effect.  In Chou Li 周禮 (the ritual of the Zhou dynasty, written in about 770 B.C.-403 B.C.), nei4ren2 內人 is a name for waitresses in the palace, and wai4ren2 外人 can be observed to  5 Yuan2wai4 員外, an old name for`a rich person’ usually used as a vocative, comes from an official name which means ‘an extra official, not a regular formal official’ during Jin dynasty (265 A.D.-420 A.D.) and Qing dynasty (1644 A.D.-1912 A.D.). 6 They may not be symmetric in Song dynasty (960-1279 A.D.) when wai4zi3 外子 is a son born outside.  have the meaning of outside people in Mencius 孟子 (about 385 B.C.-304 B.C.). In other words, the original conceptualization is symmetric based on the area defined by the palace. At that time, it is quite natural for an empire to name females inside his court as nei4ren2 內人 and people outside as wai4ren2 外人. Hence it may be symmetric to the king at that stage. Later, when nei4ren2 內人 shifts to refer to ‘wife, concubine (a woman who has marital relation with a man)’ in Li Chi 禮記 (The book of rites), it cannot have wai4ren2 外人 as its counterpart ‘husband’ because wai4ren2 外人 already has the meaning of outsider.7   In addition, the asymmetric phenomenon shown in (2e) did not appear in Jing Hua Yuan 鏡花緣, in Qing dynasty ((1644 A.D.-1912 A.D.): 20a. fan2 shi4bi4 nian2 er4shi2 yi3wai4 shang4wei4 hun1pei4 zhe3, 凡 侍婢 年 二十 以外 尚未 婚配 者, all waitress year twenty over not yet married person ‘waitresses who are over twenty years old and not yet married,’ ling4 qi2 fu4mu3 ling3hui2, wei4 zhi1 hun1pei4 令 其 父母 領回, 為 之 婚配 order their parents get back, for them marry ‘make their parents fetch them back and arrange marriage for them’ (Jing Hua Yuan 鏡花緣, chap.44:160) b. fan2 xiao3er2 wu2lun4 nan2 nü3, san1 sui4 yi3nei4, yong4 chuan1lian4zi3 jiu3 ge5 凡 小兒 無論 男 女, 三 歲 以內,用 川練子 九 個 all children no matter boy girl, three years old within, use Chuanlianzi-medicine nine unit ‘all the children, no matter boys or girls, take nine Chuanlianzi if they are younger than three’ (Jing Hua Yuan 鏡花緣, chap.55: 223) As shown in (20a) and (20b) above, both nei4 and wai4 can serve as the line of demarcation between a numeral range and the rest; nei4 marks the maximum limit and wai4 the minimum limit of the range. In modern Chinese, yi3wai4 is not used in non-spatial domain when preceded by a numeral phrase. Yi3shang4 以上 serves as a counterpart of yi3nei4 in this  7 In Li Chi 禮記 (The book of rites) both nei4ren2 內人 and nei4zi3 內子 carry the meaning of wife, but nei4ren2 內人 ‘wife’ is a hypernym of nei4zi3 內子 which refers to the formal wife of a senior official. Later, nei4zi3 內子 can have the meaning of your wife in Yan Zi Chun Qiu 晏子春秋 (about 200 B.C.) and my wife in Tang dynasty (618 A.D.-907 A.D.). ","Proceedings of PACLIC 19, the 19th Asia-Pacific Conference on Language, Information and Computation..  respect. Detailed accounts for the asymmetric phenomenon of modern nei4 and wai4 in non-spatial domain still await further study in historical language change.  6. Conclusions In this paper, we used ICM to account for the grammatical distribution as well as lexicalization and meaning extension of nei4/wai4 IN/OUT in Mandarin Chinese. They both express spatial, referential and social relations, but when preceded by numerals only nei4 denotes temporal and the other non-spatial relation. We also show how human conceptualization is reflected linguistically and how conceptualization underlines and predicts linguistic representations.  References: Chao, Yuen Ren. 1968.
