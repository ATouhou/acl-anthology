It focuses on two main aspects of this interface: (1) intonation patterns vs. speech acts and (2) stress vs. topic-focus articulation. First, four terminal contours are proposed: fall, mid, rise, and high rise. They are then mapped into the speech-act types of asserting, asking, requesting, etc., centering on the grammatical constructions of nonstandard questions. Second, four levels of stress are also proposed: 0, 1, 2, 3. They are linked to the four types of topic-focus articulation: zero topic, topic, narrow focus and contrastive topic/focus. With these prosodic markings, various discourse-oriented data are analyzed to illustrate and support the principle of compositionality for building up of lexical to phrasal constructions as well as various principles and conventions in CUG such as principle of ordering, stress lineup, and TFA composition.  1. Introduction Two aspects of prosody-pragmatics interface in Korean, intonation vs. speech act and stress vs. topic-focus articulation (TFA) are presented in descriptive terms: first, four types of terminal contours (fall, mid, rise, and high rise) are set up and mapped to the speech-act types of asserting, asking, requesting, etc. on the basis of the prosodic features of echo utterances and tag questions. Second, four types of stress (0, 1, 2, 3) are also set up and mapped to four types of TFA: zero topic, topic, (narrow) focus and contrastive topic/focus. The interface between prosody and pragmatics is then presented in formal terms in the framework of Constraintbased Unified Grammar, analyzing discourse-oriented examples of nonstandard questions and a dialogue exchange to explicate building up of lexical to phrasal constructions along with grammar-internal principles and conventions such as principle of ordering, stress lineup, and TFA composition.  2.

Concluding remarks Being fuzzy areas in general linguistics, both prosody and pragmatics have been neglected in the main stream of grammar. In CUG, however, they are properly treated as mutually interacting components of language and information. Hopefully, this work has shown with some degree of success how they are systematically constrained by various principles and conventions laid out in the grammar. It is a desideratum, however, that more detailed work be carried in the future especially for the prosodic linking of ontologically more relevant modal relations that represent the finer-grained cognitive mindset of the speaker with properly subtyped terminal contours as well as well-defined and prosodically distinctive boundary tones.
