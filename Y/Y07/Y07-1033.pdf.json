This paper reports on the application of network analysis approaches to investigate the characteristics of graph representations of Japanese word associations. Two semantic networks are constructed from two separate Japanese word association databases. The basic statistical features of the networks indicate that they have scale-free and small-world properties and that they exhibit hierarchical organization. A graph clustering method is also applied to the networks with the objective of generating hierarchical structures within the semantic networks. The method is shown to be an efficient tool for analyzing large-scale structures within corpora. As a utilization of the network clustering results, we briefly introduce two web-based applications: the first is a search system that highlights various possible relations between words according to association type, while the second is to present the hierarchical architecture of a semantic network. The systems realize dynamic representations of network structures based on the relationships between words and concepts. Keywords: Network analysis, Graph clustering, Japanese word associations.

Introduction","paragraphs":["As an approach to deepening our understanding of lexical knowledge, many areas of cognitive science, including psychology and computational linguistics, are seeking to unravel the rich networks of associations that connect words together. Key methodologies for that enterprise are the techniques of graph representation and their analysis that allow us to discern the patterns of connectivity within large-scale resources of linguistic knowledge and to perceive the inherent relationships between words and word groups.  * This research has been supported by the 21st Century Center of Excellence Program “Framework for Systematization and Application of Large-scale Knowledge Resources”.

Copyright 2007 by Maki Miyake, Terry Joyce, Jaeyoung Jung, and Hiroyuki Akama 321 Although studies applying versions of the multidimensional space model, such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and multidimensional scaling, to the analysis of texts have been fairly fruitful, the methodologies of graph theory and network analysis are particularly suitable for elucidating the important characteristics of semantic networks. Recently, a number of studies have applied graph theory approaches in investigating linguistic knowledge resources (Church and Hanks, 1990; Dorow, Widdows, Ling, Eckmann, Danilo and Moses, 2005; Steyvers and Tanenbaum 2005; van Dongen, 2000; Watts and Strogatz, 1998). For instance, Dorow, et al (2005) utilize two graph clustering techniques as methods of detecting lexical ambiguity and of acquiring semantic classes instead of word frequency based computations. This paper applies graph theory and network analysis methods to the analysis of semantic network representations of Japanese word associations. After briefly outlining the two separate Japanese word association databases used—the Associative Concept Dictionary (Okamoto and Ishizaki, 2001) and the Japanese Word Association Database (Joyce, 2005, 2006, 2007)—the paper calculates some basic statistical features, such as degree distributions, clustering coefficients and the average clustering coefficient distribution for nodes with degrees. We also apply the recently developed Recurrent Markov Clustering (RMCL) algorithm (Jung, Miyake and Akama, 2006) which enhances the bottom-up classification method of the basic MCL algorithm by making it possible to adjust the proportion in cluster sizes. Given this greater control over cluster sizes, the RMCL clearly provides a very appealing approach to the automatic construction of condensed network representations, which, in turn, can facilitate the creation of hierarchically-organized semantic spaces as a way of visualizing large-scale linguistic knowledge resources.

Specifically, the section briefly describes two separate databases of Japanese word associations—the Associative Concept Dictionary (ACD) and the Japanese Word Association Database (JWAD)—and the semantic network representations created from them."]},{"title":"2.1.Existing word association norms","paragraphs":["As frames of reference concerning the scales of the two Japanese word association databases, it worth noting that large-scale, comprehensive word association normative data has existed for some time for English. For example, Moss and Older (1996) collected between 40-50 responses for some 2,400 words of British English, while Nelson, McEvoy and Schreiber (1998) compiled perhaps the largest database of American English covering some 5,000 words with approximately 150 responses per item. Notwithstanding the early survey by Umemoto (1969), which gathered free associations from 1,000 university students for a very small set of 210 words, clearly there has been a serious lack of comparative databases of Japanese word associations. Both the ACD and the JWAD seek to redress this situation, especially the ongoing JWAD project which is committed to constructing a large-scale database for its current survey corpus of 5,000 basic Japanese kanji and words. "]},{"title":"2.2.Associative Concept Dictionary","paragraphs":["Okamoto and Ishizaki (2001) created the Associative Concept Dictionary (ACD), which is organized as a hierarchal structure of higher/lower level concepts. The data consists of 33,018 word association responses provided by 10 respondents according to specified response categories for 1,656 nouns. By excluding response words with a frequency of 1 and a clustering coefficient of 0, 9,373 words were selected for use in creating a semantic network representation.  322"]},{"title":"2.3.Japanese Word Association Database","paragraphs":["The Japanese Word Association Database is being constructed as part of a project to investigate lexical knowledge in Japanese by mapping out Japanese word associations (Joyce, 2005; 2006; 2007). While the particular task—specifying in advance the associative relationship for responses—employed in creating the ACD can arguably be justified in terms of constructing a dictionary of associated concepts, the data provides little insight into the rich and diverse nature of word associations. Accordingly, the JWAD employs the free word association task in collecting association responses. Also in contrast to the ACD, which only examined nouns, the JWAD is surveying words of all word classes. Version 1 of the JWAD consists of a random sample of 2,099 items from the survey corpus of 5,000 basic Japanese kanji and words that were presented to up to 50 respondents. For the JWAD network, only words with a frequency of 2 or more were selected, which resulted in set of 7,966 words to be clustered. \\ "]},{"title":"3. Analyses of the Network Structures","paragraphs":["As already suggested, graph representations and the techniques of graph theory and network analysis are particularly promising techniques with which to examine the intricate patterns of connectivity within large-scale linguistic knowledge resources. For instance, Steyvers and Tenenbaum (2005) conducted a noteworthy study that examined the structural features of three semantic networks. By calculating a range of statistical features, including the average shor\\test paths, diameters, clustering coefficients, and degree distributions, they observed interesting similarities between the three networks in terms of their scale-free patterns of connectivity and small-world structures. Following their basic approach, we analyze the characteristics of the two semantic network representations of Japanese word associations by calculating the statistical features of degree distribution and clustering coefficient—an index of the interconnectivity strength between neighboring nodes in a graph.

In this study, we define the clustering coefficient of n nodes as:  2/)1)(()( neighbors sn' among links ofnumber )( −× = nNnNnC  where N(n) represents the number of adjacent nodes. Accordingly, a clustering coefficient is a value between 0-1. Moreoever, Ravasz and Barabasi (2003) introduce the notion of clustering coefficient dependence on node degree as an index of the hierarchical structures found in real networks— such as the WWW, the Actor Network based on the www.IMDB.com database—which are based on the hierarchical model of (Dorogovski, Goltsev, & Mendes, 2001).

In the case of the ACD, the average clustering coefficient is quite high at 0.35, which can be regarded as indicating the small-world property. In the case of the JWAD, the average clustering coefficient is 0.04, which indicates that the complete network basically consists of many star graphs connected together.

Graph Clustering: Recurrent Markov Clustering 4.1.Algorithm","paragraphs":["Jung, et al. (2006) have recently proposed an improvement to Markov Clustering (MCL), called Recurrent Markov Clustering (RMCL), which provides for greater control over the sizes of clusters by making it possible to adjust graph granularity and, thus, the generality of concepts. MCL is an effective method for the detection of patterns and clusters within large and sparsely connected data structures. The first step in the MCL consists of sustaining a random walk across a graph by ‘expansions’. The recurrent process incorporates feedback about the states of overlapping clusters prior to the final MCL output stage. This reverse tracing procedure is a key feature of the RMCL making it possible to generate a virtual adjacency matrix for nonoverlapping clusters based on the convergent state that emerges from the MCL process. The resultant condensed matrix provides a simpler graph that can highlight the conceptual structures that underlie similar words. "]},{"title":"4.2.Results","paragraphs":["The RMCL algorithm is realized as a series of calculations executed with gridMathematica. Taking the JWAD as an example of the calculation steps in the RMCL, Figure 3 presents the transition in cluster sizes as a function of the MCL process. Starting from the adjacency matrix for co-occurrences, the MCL process finally generated a nearly-idempotent stochastic matrix at the 19th clustering stage with 1,441 hard clusters, where the average number of cluster components is 5.6 with a standard deviation (SD) of 3.1. In contrast, the RMCL resulted in just 759 hard clusters with an average of 1.9 cluster components (SD = 1.5). Among the representative nodes for RMCL clusters, 1,176 nodes (83%) were found to be words that had been presented as stimulus words. Figure 4 presents MCL and RMCL cluster sizes for both the ACD and the JWAD, which illustrate the transitions occurring in downsizing the networks generated from graph clustering. Figure 5 plots the number of components for both MCL and RMCL clusters as a function of frequency. In the case of the ACD, the MCL resulted in 1,408 hard clusters (average cluster size = 6.7, SD = 8.6), while the RMCL resulted in 118 hard clusters, where the average number of cluster components was 11.9 with a rather high SD of 68.6.  325  0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 0 5 10 15 20 MCL Process N u m b e r o f M C L C l u s t e rs Figure 3: Cluster size transitions during MCL process 1 10 100 1000 10000 Data MCL RMCL C l u s t e r S i ze ACD JWAD","","Figure 4: Cluster sizes for MCL and RMCL    1 10 100 1000","1 10 100 1000 Cluster Size Clu s t e r s MCL RMCL (a).

Applications of the RMCL","paragraphs":["As Widdow, Cederberg, and Dorow (2002) astutely observe, graph visualization is a particularly powerful tool for representing the meanings of words and concepts. In order to utilize the MCL and RMCL clustering results of the networks, we have developed two web-based applications implemented by webMathmatica: the first is an ‘Associative Composition Support System (ACSS)’ to search for free association words according to different types of association information, while the second is ‘RMCLnet’ which elucidates the hierarchical architecture of large-scale networks. "]},{"title":"5.1.The Associative Composition Support System","paragraphs":["The free web-based ACSS proposed by Jung et al. (2006) seeks to promote associative thinking ability, and so, in turn, to foster language learning and creativity. ACSS is developed based on a database that makes it possible to retrieve three types of associative information such as word-based, concept-based and group-based associations. Such associative information is apparently sufficient to support system users in improving their associative thinking and creativity by encouraging them to move beyond literal, direct and superficial aspects to richer, freer, and 326 more inspired conceptual associations. The variety of links between words can foster free, flexible, integrative, and imaginative thinking, while simultaneously encouraging users to discover the implicit relevance of words and even to occasionally fill in the semantic gaps between words with imaginative creations. Figure 6 presents a screen shot of the main page for the ACSS system. Users can access the online system at http://atheneum.dp.hum.titech.ac.jp/semnet/ACSS/index.jsp. The entire interface on the user side is controlled by Javascript. When retrieval requirements are sent to the remote web server, search results are calculated in real-time by WebMathematica through the JSP and Mathematica kernel. The database was constructed in the form of a semantic network and is stored on the web server after calculating original Japanese word associations with GridMathematica.

Clustering results from both the MCL and RMCL processes can dynamically represent the relationships between words, with MCL components possibly corresponding to concepts (Figure 7). The implementation method is quite straightforward, as it is sufficient to simply store the multiple files that are created automatically when the RMCL process is executed.
