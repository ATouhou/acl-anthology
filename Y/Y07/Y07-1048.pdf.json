This study explores the textual characteristics, more precisely the quantity and diversity of nouns, of Japanese prime ministers' Diet addresses.

Introduction","paragraphs":["In the field of stylistics, as computational approaches have been developed and many on-line corpora have been constructed, statistical textual characteristics have been systematically examined. These textual characteristics have traditionally been used for detecting the authors, registers, and chronological variations of texts. Recently, they have also been used for more practical applications such as spam filtering (Argamon, Whitelaw, Chase, Raj Hota, Garg, and Levitan, 2007). With this expansion in the scope of stylistics and the production of a wide variety of new types of texts especially with the growth of the Web (Aitchison and Lewis, 2003), the microscopic characterization of different types of texts has become more and more important. Turning our eyes to the field of political science, the content of political speeches is regarded as important for analyzing the policies, attitudes and thoughts of political actors (Axelrod, 1976). Among such speeches, prime ministers' Diet addresses are recognized as the most  * This study was supported by a Suntory Foundation Research Grant, 2007-2008.

As the role of the media and the performance of politicians increase in importance in contemporary politics (Kusano, 2006), the style of prime ministers' speeches, as well as their content, have attracted more attention (Ahrens, 2005; Azuma, 2006). Against this background, this study explores the textual characteristics of Japanese prime ministers’ Diet addresses, focusing on (a) the difference between the two types of Diet addresses and (b) the perceived changes made to these addresses by two powerful prime ministers, comparing the characteristics of their addresses with those of all prime ministers from 1945 to 2006. In order to clarify these points, we focus on the quantity and diversity of nouns, textual characteristics strongly related to the content of texts, instead of conventional content-independent stylistic characteristics, because the purpose of this study is to analyze these characteristics in order to better understand two political phenomena: the difference and changes in political content. From the point of view of computational linguistics, this study can be seen as a case study for exploring microscopic textual characteristics. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review previous work, and in Section 3, explain our two research questions in detail. In Section 4, we describe our data, and in Section 5, discuss the results. In Section 6, we make concluding remarks. "]},{"title":"2. Previous work","paragraphs":["In the field of stylistics, many textual characteristics have been examined (Grieve, 2007). Those which have been frequently measured are the length of sentences, the length of words and the relative frequency of different parts of speech (Kenny, 1982). Lexical richness measures including those we use in this study have been systematically examined by Tweedie and Baayen (1998). Textual characteristics have been examined for formalizing the mathematical characteristics of texts (e.g., Simpson, 1949; Yule, 1944), and also for authorship attribution (Hoover, 2003) and genre-based text classification (Cortina-Borja and Chappas, 2006). They have proved to be reliable measures for classification because they take the information of function words as well as content words (Garcìa and Martìn, 2007). But for our purpose, the lexical diversity of specific parts of speech need to be examined, and there are few studies examining these characteristics. Some studies in political science examine prime ministers’ Diet speeches using quantitative methods, but most studies focus only on the frequencies of specific words (e.g., Watanabe, 1974). Though Azuma (2006) examined sentence lengths and other specific functional expressions in the speeches, and Reinem (2005) used comprehensive types of content words for her analysis, the lexical quantity and diversity of Diet speeches have not been examined fully.

The SEB, on the other hand, is delivered at extraordinary Diet sessions in which the budget is not a major issue. In the SEP, prime ministers deal with many political issues related to the budgets, while in the SEB they highlight the particular political goals they wish to achieve. But some studies insist that the two types of addresses need not be distinguished when analyzing their content because they are  1 Both of these two types of addresses are normally translated as 'general policy speech' in English. 460 similar (Reinem, 2007). By examining the textual characteristics of the two types of Diet addresses, we will clarify this point. It will help us to determine which (or both) types of addresses should be analyzed when we wish to investigate the political content related to the budget or content related to political goals prime ministers would especially like to achieve."]},{"title":"3.2 The perceived changes made to these addresses by two prime ministers","paragraphs":["Nakasone, one of the strongest and most powerful prime ministers in Japanese political history, is reported to have increased the length of his Diet addresses by developing his own philosophy and ideas in order to show the concentration of political power in the o\\ffice of prime minister (Shinoda, 1994). Koizumi, another powerful and strong prime minister, is famous for having used more dramatic and entertaining style of speech (Kabashima and Steel, 2007). His speech style is thought to have been characterized by the repetition of specific topics (typically privatization of the postal system). He succeeded politically partly because he was able to attract people by his way of speaking (Otake, 2006). However, these perceptions about the distinctive styles of speech of these two powerful prime ministers have never been empirically examined. We do so by measuring the textual characteristics of their Diet addresses, thus provi\\ding empirical evidences for discussion of their political styles or media strategy as revealed through their speeches.

This kind of index suits our purposes because the number of times each kind of political content is repeated is important, as is inequality among different kinds of political content when we discuss repetition in political speech.

The finding that N is significantly larger including and after Nakasone than before him corresponds to the argument that Nakasone increased the length of his addresses (Shinoda, 1994). This must have been driven by his intention to concentrate political power on himself. As opposed to that, the diversity of nouns does not change much before Nakasone, and including and after Nakasone. This means that he did not change the way he speaks in the addresses.

This shows that Koizumi in fact mentioned more diverse political content in a balanced way, despite the common perception that his speaking style was characterized by the repetition of specific political content many times. One possible reason for this may be that the common perception of his speaking style is based on speeches he made outside the Diet.
