This is a semantic pilot study which concentrates on how people in Taiwan process the temporal metaphors, ego-moving metaphor and time-moving metaphor. Motivated by the research of Gentner, Imai, and Boroditsky (2002) in which the English native speakers comprehend ego-moving metaphors faster than time-moving metaphors, the present study attempts to reexamine whether the faster reaction to ego-moving metaphors is shared by both the Chinese native speakers and EFL learners. To achieve the goals, 25 Chinese/English bilinguals are invited to be examined via the16 Chinese and 16 English test sentences. The recordings of their accuracy on each item are served as the databases used to compare with the study of Gentner, Imai, and Boroditsky (2002). The two finding presented here are: (1) when the subjects tested in their native language, Chinese, they process ego-moving metaphors better. (2) when tested in the foreign language, English, they conceptualize time-moving metaphors much better. Keywords: metaphors, time-moving metaphor, ego-moving metaphor, EFL  "]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["This is a semantic study which attempts to explore how Taiwanese process time metaphors. According to Shuell (1990: 102), “If a picture is worth 1,000 words, a metaphor is worth 1,000 pictures!” By breaking literal meanings, metaphors create thousands of possibilities. The way we structure the thousand pictures relies on conceptual metaphor. Conceptual metaphor is people’s underlying cognitive level as the bridge between language and thought. By  * Copyright 2007 by May, Hsin-mei Huang & Shelley, Ching-yu Hsieh  173 assimilating the two different domains, conceptual metaphor specifies the concrete idea into abstract entity. In general, conceptual metaphor is the surface structures which make metaphors understandable. (Lakoff and Johnnson, 1980; Goddard, 1998; McGlone, 2007; Charteris-Black & Ennis, 2001). As Lakoff (1993:228) claims, “We do not have detectors for time. Thus, it makes good biological sense that time should be understood in terms of things and motion.” That is, the comprehension of the abstract time understood via space is biologically determined. The two space → time metaphors under examination are time-moving and ego-moving metaphors. Based on the study of Gentner, Imai, and Boroditsky (2002) in which English native speakers conceptualize ego-moving metaphor faster, two research goals are proposed: Chinese native speakers and EFL learners process ego-moving metaphors better. In order to answer the two research questions, this paper is organized as follows, (1) Introduction, (2) the theoretical framework on temporal metaphors, (3) the methodology, (4) results, (5) discussion, and (6) conclusions.

The introduction of the two time metaphors, the different perspective that Chinese and English speakers hold, and the study conducted by Gentner, Imai, and Boroditsky (2002) are covered.

The primary difference is that they posit different assignments of front and back in a time line. "]},{"title":"Time-moving metaphor","paragraphs":["Time-moving metaphors identify the events temporally ordered with another in the time line. In time-moving metaphors, time can be conceived of as preceding and following one another in which time flows from the future via the ego, the point of reference, to the past (Li, 2005; Ahrens and Huang, 2002 ). In this metaphor, the future is in the back and the past is in the front (Gentner, Imai, and Boroditsky, 2002: 539). For example, ‘The final exam is before Thursday’ in which ‘before’, a space term, indicates ‘the final exam’ is proceeding ‘Thursday’. Therefore, the final exam is in the relative the past and Thursday in the relative future. (see Figure 1.)   174"]},{"title":"Ex. The final exam is before Thursday.  Past _______________________________________________ Future ","paragraphs":["the final exam Thursday Figure 1. An example of time-moving metaphor "]},{"title":"Ego-moving metaphor","paragraphs":["Ego-moving metaphor recognizes the event in the time order with the ego/observer. It attributes motion over a landscape to an entity. Li (2005: 16-17) proposes that “the observer comes from the past and moves via the present to into the future, while time as the reference ground remains stationary.” Indicated by this metaphor, front is assigned to the future and back to the past (Gentner, Imai, and Boroditsky, 2002: 539). For instance, ‘The final exam is before us’ in which the space “before” specifies the linear time relationship of “us” as the present time and “the final exam” as the future event. (see Figure 2) "]},{"title":"Ex. The final exam is before us.  Past _______________________________________________ Future ","paragraphs":["Now the final exam Figure 2.

However, in Chinese, ego has dual orientations: a front-to-the-future orientation and a front-to-the-past orientation, while the latter is predominant in Chinese. (Li, 2005: 40). For instance, ‘The best is before you.’ means that the best is waiting in the ‘future.’ However, for the Chinese speakers, qian suo wei jian 前 所未見 ‘it has never been seen before’ refers to the event that has never been seen in the past.

The three experiments conducted show that the English native speakers, apart from relying on an ego-moving framework to interpret time, conceptualize ego-moving metaphor faster than time-moving metaphor.

They are chosen, for they have no problem conceptualizing English and Chinese metaphors. Thirty-two test sentences are designed to examine the participants’ accuracy. Sixteen of them are in Chinese in which nine used the time-moving metaphors and the others used ego-moving metaphors. As for the other sixteen, they are mostly taken from the study of Gentner, Imai, and Boroditsky (2002) in which eight used the time-moving metaphors and the others used ego-moving metaphors. For example, Christmas is six days ahead of New Year’s Day. "]},{"title":"Procedures","paragraphs":["After the participants read the sample in Chinese and English, they are tested by Chinese test sentences and followed by the English sentences. They see each sentence one at a time by indicating the event ‘I will see you’ happened in the past or future relative to the reference (4 o’clock). (see Figure 3.) Totally, there are thirty-two such blocks. The arrangement of all the testing sentences is randomized, so the subjects will not notice the two metaphorical types.  I will see you before 4 o’clock.

Surprisingly, four of the participants entirely fail to process any of the test sentences. From the two figures presented above, the comprehension of the two metaphors in Chinese version makes a great difference compared with the Chinese version.

"]},{"title":"Ego-moving metaphors as the easier metaphorical type","paragraphs":["Based on Gentner, Imai, and Boroditsky (2002:559), ego-moving metaphors identify the time relation between the observer and the event so, it “contains only two points on the time line: an event and an observer” whereas time-moving metaphors specify the time relation between two events “with the ego as the third point.” The two-term relation of ego-moving metaphors, which not only involves the ego as the center but also involves only two points in the time line, decreases the degree of processing difficulty.

People’s schemata, the mental representation of a typical instance, are “used in discourse processing to predict and make sense of the particular instance” (Cook, 1994:11).The participants’ obscure schemata of ego-moving metaphors makes them fail to fail to structure ego-moving metaphors. "]},{"title":"The interference from the participants’ first language","paragraphs":["Boroditsky (2001: 18) claims that “one’s native language appears to exert a strong influence over how one thinks about abstract domains like time.” Contrastive Analysis Hypothesis claims that when L2 is learned, the negative transfers from learners’ L1 will slow down the speed (Lightbrown and Spada, 2004: 35). English and Chinese as two different languages have different interpretations of time. The differences make the participants confused so that they process ego-moving metaphors with difficulty. "]},{"title":"6 Conclusion","paragraphs":["This study has two main findings. First, Chinese native speakers, in line with Gentner, Imai, and Boroditsky (2002), process Chinese ego-moving metaphors better, for they are the natural expressions which accord to people’s cognitive process. However, inconsistent with Gentner, Imai, and Boroditsky (2002), the Taiwanese, as the EFL learners, process English ego-moving metaphors with great difficulty. This phenomenon points out that the fostering of a foreign language involves the factors, like a great amount of language input and the minimization of the negative transfer from their first language.
