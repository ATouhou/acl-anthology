The present paper targets on the excessive structural article dao in the “X1","+ dao + si” phrases, aiming to see the possible generation of the excessive meaning. The generation of excessiveness will be analyzed from the aspect of cognition, including conceptual structure and metaphor. It will be concluded that the position indicated by si in concept plays a crucial, which then tells the importance of collocation. What is more, the comparison of dao and Southern Min kah will be made to see the degree of grammaticalization of dao.

Introduction","paragraphs":["It is not easy to explain “extent” since it is somewhat abstract; however, extent seems to exist in our daily lives. Everything bears a relation to extent: the redness of roses, the extent of saltiness, or even the maturity of a man. Mentioning extent, hen is always the term for use in Mandarin, such as Ta hen mei 她很美 (She is very beautiful). However, hen cannot indicate the highest extent. To show excessiveness, there is a construction which is popular with the young generation in Taiwan nowadays. The excessive construction is structured as “X + dao + si”, and it pragmatically emphasizes the speaker’s subjective emotion."," (1) 我 今天 累 到 死 wo jin-tian lei dao si I today tired DAO die “I’m extremely tired today.”"," The phrase is always used to indicate the very high extent of a certain state; therefore, we name the construction “the excessive construction” and dao the excessive structural particle, which appears in sentences mainly to link the word or phrase that precedes it to the elements that immediately follows it. In example (1), dao links the predicate lei and the complement si. As for the excessive construction, dao is worthy of discussion. Dao originally is a spatial term indicating “arrive at”. Since we failed to find dao’s use as an extent marker in ancient Mandarin, it might be until this modern time it is used to indicate excessive extent. How could a spatial term derive extent meaning? In addition, dao is not obligatory; that is, it could be omitted.  (2) 我 今天 累 死 了 wo jin-tian lei si le I today tired die ASP “I’m extremely tired today.”   ∗ Copyright 2007 by Hsiu-Ying Liu  1 The symbol X refers to either a verb or an adjective.

The paper works on the excessive structural particle dao in Taiwan Mandarin. The data are collected mainly from google search engine. The main discussion falls on how dao derives from a spatial word to an excessive structural particle. We will look into the conceptual structure of the construction, in hopes to see the operation of human cognition and the generation of excessive meaning. The paper will be organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the literature. The theoretical framework adopted in this paper is introduced in section 3. Section 4 presents the discussion which mainly focuses on the generation of excessive dao. A comparison between dao and Southern Min kah will be made in section 5, and the last section provides a summary and a tentative conclusion.  "]},{"title":"2. Literature View","paragraphs":["The typical structural article in Mandarin is de, which has some variants, i.e. 得, 的. According to the discussions on de, it could be an extent structural particle, as in the expressions “Hao de hen 好得很(Very good)! ” Comparing with the great number of papers about de, there is no considerable amount of studies regarding the excessive structural particle dao, possibly because of the lack of long history. Dao as an extent marker is not listed in dictionaries, neither classic nor modern ones. Indeed, the term “excessive structural particle” is first proposed here. As to dao, Huang (1984), by looking into modern Mandarin, discusses the extent use of “V(Adj) + dao + ...” construction. Indicating the reaching to a certain extent, the construction takes the following kinds of predicates.  A) gradable adjectives leng qing dao le ji-dian 冷清到了極點 cold clear DAO ASP very end “It’s extremely desolate.” B) psych verbs pei-fu dao le ji-dian 佩服到了極點 admire DAO ASP very end “admire someone very much” C) verbs denoting change or action ji-hua dao yi-ding cheng-du le 激化到一定程度了","agitate DAO certain extent ASP “agitate to some extent”  Liu (2006) studies the degree modification of adjectives in Mandarin Chinese, and the dao-clause is discussed. As to the following sentence, Liu states that the dao- clause offers an endpoint which is neither temporal nor locative but an extent of height.  (3) Yuehan gao dao keyi mo dao tianhuaban 約翰高到可以摸到天花板 John tall DAO able touch-arrive ceiling “John is tall enough to touch the ceiling.”  He treats the dao- clause the adjectival construction, and the thesis mainly discusses its interaction with the degree modifier guo. His discussion regarding incompatibility of guo and the dao- clause is not the concern here; however, he contributes to point out that the dao- clause displays the properties of a complement and semantically is a “scale adjuster”. In addition, the dao- clause possesses the ability “to saturate and restrict the degree argument of adjectives and alter the limit of the scale structure of associated adjectives.” Li (2006) studies the rich polysemies of the motion verb kao in Taiwanese. She offers a complete discussion on the derivations of excessive kah from kao (see CHART 1), and it reveals that cognitive operations (i.e. metaphor and metonymy) play crucial roles.

To complement this gap, the present study will trace the possible derivational routes of excessive dao. Li’s analysis of kah would be referred. However, in her study, the metaphorical extensions are not presented in details; what is more, collocation is not mentioned in her study. In my opinion, collocation is the key that brings the grammaticalization. Basically, when two or more words appear together with a very high frequency, there will be syntactic or semantic changes of the composed terms. Therefore, in this study, collocation and metaphor extension will be carefully examined. The proposition is: the complement si is the key that brings the excessive meaning to dao. In concept, dao takes si as the goal; si stands for the very end in conceptual structure (Liu 2006), which further metaphorically means “excessive extent”. The high-frequency occurrence of dao with si later makes dao change from a content spatial word to an excessive structural particle.  "]},{"title":"3. Theoretical Background","paragraphs":["Since the conceptual structure of dao will be examined first, the introduction of Conceptual Structure is necessary. Conceptual Structure, by definition, is an autonomous level of cognitive "]},{"title":"295","paragraphs":["representation (Ray Jackendoff 1983,1987,1990), representing concepts in terms of a small number of conceptual primitives, such as GO, STAY, BE, etc. The theory of conceptual structure is decompositional since it decomposes meanings in terms of conceptual primitives. It is also conceptualist because it identifies meanings with concepts, i.e. mental entities. In addition, in its origin, conceptual structure is localistic, for it elaborates the idea that notions of location and movement are central in the semantic analysis of verbs and sentences. Since the verb indicating “arrive” involves spatial movement, the conceptual structure of it should be examined. The theory of metaphor is also necessary for review here, for the conceptual metaphor (Lakoff & Johnson 1980) of si will be discussed. In cognitive linguistics, conceptual metaphor refers to the understanding of one conceptual domain in terms of another, for example, we understand time in terms of space (e.g. Time flies.) Si evokes the concept of life, which is metaphorically regarded as a journey.   si  metaphor the whole human life  JOURNEY  The journey metaphor requires a source and a goal, and it is si that plays the role of goal. Basically, both dao and si undergo grammaticalication. In historical linguistics, grammaticalisation refers to a process of linguistic change by which a content word (lexical morpheme) changes into a function word or further into a grammatical affix. It also includes the processes of phonological reduction and semantic bleaching. Therefore, either metaphor or metonymy could be regarded as a kind of grammaticalization since it, most of the time, brings semantic bleaching.  "]},{"title":"4. Main Discussion 4.1 Dao","paragraphs":["In Taiwan Mandarin, the phrase X-dao-si is popular with the young generation. And in many informal situations, the construction is used to express the highest of a state.

To trace the origin, dao, a motion verb, prototypically refers to “arrive at”. "]},{"title":"296   ","paragraphs":["(7) Wo yi dao Taipei le 我已到台北了 I already DAO Taipei ASP “I’ve arrived at Taipei.”  Through grammaticalization, it also takes the use as a preposition which introduces a goal.  (8) Ta zou dao Taipei. 他走到台北 He walk DAO Taipei. “ He walks to Taipei.”  By way of metaphor, dao then is extended to the temporal domain.  (9) Ta deng dao wu dian 他等到五點 He wait DAO five o’clock “He waited until five o’clock.”  This metaphorical extension is a natural process in human cognition. The cognitive process is “concrete abstract”, and SPACE is a concrete source that further extends to abstract TIME. As a motion verb, dao basically requires three theta roles. Mostly, motion verbs involve change of position and assign three theta roles: theme, source and goal. Theme is obligatory whereas the other two are optional."," (10) che zi zou le 車子走了 The car is gone. (theme)"," (11) ta qu Ta i pei 她去台北 She went to Taipei.

(theme, source, goal)  Without prepositional source and goal assigners (from, to), a verb itself also could do the assigning. Some verbs assign SOURCE (e.g. li-kai 離開), and some assign GOAL to the objects (e.g. qu 去). Adopting Jackendoff's Lexical Conceptual Structures (LCS), a motion verb could be conceptualized as “AGENT MOVE/GO VIA PATH”. The path TO highlights the source whereas FROM emphasizes the goal. Based upon Jackendoff’s, the conceptual structure of dao would be AGENT/THEME MOVES TO A GOAL. As to the goal, it prototypically refers to a concrete location and later metaphorically extends to abstract TIME and STATE.  TIME: (14) Tie-ta de shi-jian dao 23:00 鐵塔的時間到 23:00","tower time DAO 23:00","“The tower is not closed until 23:00.”  STATE: (15) Ta dao lao dou hai-shi xing-nan 他到老都還是型男 he DAO old all still dandy man “He will always be a dandy man.”  A stative goal is regarded as a result and hence the phrases after dao are resultative complements. Being preceded by a predicate, dao gradually becomes a proposition. The "]},{"title":"297","paragraphs":["prepositional dao preserves the thematic properties of the verbal dao. First, it assigns GOAL to the object. In addition, the goal could be a location, time, or a state.

When it is an extreme state that plays the role of goal, the excessive dao appears. In other words, the excessive meaning of dao is mainly brought by the element(s) following it. Then, how does si derive such a meaning? Many scholars study X-si construction, but only few touches this issue. Liu (2002) states that the excessive si is derived via metaphor; Chu (2006) proposes it is human’s traditional concept about death that makes si excessive. In my opinion, however, there is a more convincing way for explanation. Similar to Liu, I also adopt metaphor; but differently, the metaphor on discussion is more directly related to excessiveness. "]},{"title":"4.2 Si","paragraphs":["Si originally refers to “death”. The excessive meaning of it probably is made possible through conceptual metaphor. Human life is always conceptualized as a journey; therefore, there is always the expression “zai rensheng de lutu shang 在人生的旅途上 (in the journey of life)” uttered. A journey, basically, has a starting place and a destination, corresponding to SOURCE and GOAL. And in this life journey, death plays the very end.  alive die  Accordingly, the conceptual structure of si is AGENT/THEME MOVES TO THE END OF A GOAL. Generally, arriving at a destination might not imply an end. V-si, differently, has an inherent end which makes the whole process bounded. Analyzing it from the aspect of climbing up a building, the entering into a building exemplifies the former conceptual structure, in which the building refers to the goal, the final destination. Climbing up to the top floor, the end of the building, takes the second conceptual structure.","    AGENT/THEME MOVES TO A GOAL     "]},{"title":"298 ","paragraphs":["AGENT/THEME MOVES TO THE END OF A GOAL  The second not only mentions the result but also amplifies the inner state of this result.

It is hypothesized that words found together with a high frequency come to be cognitively processed as single units, and that these units then evolve as individual words. In colloquial Taiwan Mandarin, dao is always combined with si to indicate the excessiveness of a state. The combination will gradually fix dao to an excessive complement, which then makes dao an excessive structural particle linking the predicate and the complement. To process the construction, the predicate first invokes a scale, dao makes the pointer move, and the occurrence of si leads the pointer to the highest volume.      pang (fat) dao si  Once when dao is so closely linked to the excessive meaning that it takes over the semantic meaning of the complement, si could be deleted.

If the existence of dao makes no difference, why is there still the X-dao-si construction prevailing? In my opinion, an expression with dao is somewhat different from that without dao. The two structures seem to share the same meaning – excessiveness; however, dao appears to emphasize more the excessive state. First, the two sis are phonologically different. Through my personal observation, si in X-dao-si is more stressed. On the other hand, si in X-si construction cannot be strongly stressed, probably because of the following le. X-si always takes le at the end to be the aspect marker. Differently, there is always a period put at the end of V-dao-si phrase. Therefore, the sentence final si could be prolonged and results in stronger emotion. Cognitively, dao might more directly link the predicate and si (do something until dying). The associating process then progresses smoothly and can successfully express the extent the speaker intends to tell. Without dao, the predicate and si usually cannot be associated directly, for example, it is hard to combine shuai (handsome) with death. This then requires more processing time and the dramatic effect is reduced.  "]},{"title":"5. Degree of Grammaticalization","paragraphs":["In some dialects, the excessive structural article would further grammaticalized to a final particle. Basically, a final particle is more grammaticalized than a structural one, for the later more or less obeys the original syntactic requirements. Dao, as a verb, takes two arguments. Being a structural particle, the argument after dao is still required, but not limit to nouns only. The structural particle dao could also take a clausal complement.

The structural particle dao is derived from the arriving dao through grammaticalization. And the excessive meaning of dao mainly comes from its adjacent element, namely, si. Si, by symbolizing the very end of the life journey, metaphorically indicates excessiveness. And its high-frequency occurrence with dao makes the excessive meaning spread to dao. It is not specific that the motion verb denoting to “arrive at” becomes an excessive structural particle because there are many southern dialects displaying such a phenomenon.
