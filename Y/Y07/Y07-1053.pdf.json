The text categorization is an important field for the automatic text information processing. Moreover, the authorship identification of a text can be treated as a special text categorization. This paper adopts the conceptual primitives’ expression based on the Hierarchical Network of Concepts (HNC) theory, which can describe the words meaning in hierarchical symbols, in order to avoid the sparse data shortcoming that is aroused by the natural language surface features in text categorization. The KNN algorithm is used as computing classification element. Then, the experiment has been done on the Chinese text authorship identification. The experiment result gives out that the processing mode that is put forward in this paper achieves high correct rate, so it is feasible for the text authorship identification.

Introduction","paragraphs":["Along with the progress of social information industry, especially with the Internet development, more and more documents exist in the electronical form. It provides convenience for information automatic processing. The text categorization is the basic work for the automatic processing, and it is the foundation for the information retrieval, information mining, and question-answer system too. In some applications, it is need to identify the text authorship. The identification need use the documents written by the author as reference. Since the literary style of an author is relatively steady in some time, if we can mine the style character of the author then the identification is realized. Of course, the more documents which are gathered, the better result which is achieved. In many cases, the text authorship identification is treated as text categorization as the researchers can accomplish the work according the text categorization way. In this way, the frequency of glossary, punctuation, n-Gram string, syntax feature, average sentence length, the length of paragraph, and so on, are be used as the features to identify the author of a text  * The paper is supported by the National Fundamental Research Project (973 Project) (Grant No. 2004CB318104) and The Knowledge Innovation Engineering Project of The Institute of Acoustics, CAS (Grant No. 0654091431).  Copyright 2007 by Quan Zhang, Yun-liang Zhang and Yi Yuan 515 [Burrows J. F. 1987, Baayen R. H. 1996, David I Holmes 1997, Yuta Tsuboi 2002]. The texts are often literature, and sometimes they are internet text, such as E-mail [Olivier de Vel 2001]. Presently, there are a few research works in the Chinese text authorship identification, and many of them orient to the linguistic research for the concrete literature. Sun and Jin [Yi-jian Jin, Xiao-ming Sun, and Shao-ping Ma, 2003] use the vector space model (VSM) which takes the syntax structural words as feature to identify the text authorship, they achieved good result in novel author identification. The best precision of pattern matching, KNN algorithm and SVM algorithm are 89.51%, 91.54%, and 93.58% separately. Ma and Chang study the E-mail authorship identification successively [Jian-bin Ma 2004, Shu-hui Chang 2005]. In addition, Wu introduces the HowNet knowledge base; he performs the text authorship identification according to the evaluation method of glossary semantic similarity. His best marco-average Fmeasure is 86.23% that is achieved in 202 People Daily texts written by 5 reporters [Xiao-chun Wu 2006]. In text categorization, one important aspect is text expression. The text is mainly expressed as discrete glossary. As to Chinese, it is also expressed as Chinese character, phrase, term, n-gram string, etc. When the discrete unites are obtained, they can be used in feature vector constructing. These features that come from natural language directly can represent the topic of the text and the writing style of the author in some aspects. However, these features also arouse the spare data and too large feature space in the computing, because there are more than ten thousand basic words in natural language, and the total of words even come to million, the dimension of the corresponding vector space is huge. In order to perform the computing, it is necessary to reduce the dimension. Huang put forwards the linguistic conceptual space according his Hierarchical Network of Concepts (HNC, in short) theory [Zengyang Huang 1998, 2004]. The HNC conceptual primitives of the linguistic conceptual space and its word knowledge expression can be used to reduce the dimension. In fact, the structure of HNC conceptual primitives is a tree list, which the nodes are semantic primitives. The word meaning is expressed with the primitives, and it can accomplish the computing of correlation in the glossary, finding the thesaurus, and reducing the dimension. Therefore, we explore the Chinese text authorship identification with the KNN classifier that adopts the HNC conceptual primitives as the features carrier. We explain the HNC conceptual primitives and the semantic expression in the following firstly. "]},{"title":"2. The HNC conceptual primitives and the semantic expression","paragraphs":["The network of primitives provides a necessary semantic description system in HNC, which expresses the semantic with formalization and conceptualization. The basic unite of the primitives network is conceptual tree, the node in the tree is the element for semantic expression, the relation between trees and the nodes in one tree provides the relevancy of the primitives. There are 456 trees, which are defined in HNC. Fig. 1 is an example for the conceptual tree. This branch provides the definition and reference for its dominative category. It defines part concepts of the professional activities in detail. The letter and the string, such as a, a1, a119, are the concept identifier for the node, and the content in the brackets is the comment for the conceptual node. All these are merely abstract definition, not for the concrete instance. When expressing the concrete instance, we need to combine more concepts according its meaning. For example, the “U.S.A. Government” can be expressed in “a119+fpj2*304”, the meaning of the “a119” can be found in the Fig. 1, and the “fpj2*304” refers in particular to the United Stats. The goal of the HNC conceptual primitives is to take out and generalize the commonness of the things, and identify them with a well-defined string. The network just describes the meaning of the words. As to the denotative function of a word, the HNC introduces five elements for the abstract concepts: v (verb), g (noun), u (attribute), z 516 (value), and r (effect); two elements for the concrete concepts: w (matter) and p (people); and one element between the abstract and concrete concept: x (quality). These elements are called “classification of concept”. They are also primitives, and need to combine to express a word denotative function.   Figure 1: A branch of the conceptual tree.

Discussion","paragraphs":["We adopt the simple KNN algorithm as the computing tool, and the HNC conceptual primitives as the features carrier that can express the word meaning, then we contracture a mode to identify the text authorship. The experiment result indicates that this mode can work well, and achieves high correct rate. It means that the HNC conceptual primitives are suitable to express the text feature in text authorship identification. Meanwhile, comparing with the natural language words as text feature, there are also some advantages when take the HNC conceptual primitives to express the text feature:","1. As the HNC conceptual primitives give the words meaning in concept, so some words","with different form can be expressed in same symbol when they have the same","meaning, such as the “distress” and “sad” they have the same symbol in HNC","conceptual primitives. Then, they can be treated as same one. 520","2. The conceptual primitives are hierarchical symbols; they are suitable to compute the correlation. It is easy to reduce the dimension by merging the low frequency concept into a high frequency concept, according the correlation among concepts.","3. The HNC conceptual primitives are a kind of artificial semantic symbol, their meaning is well defined, and the natural language words always have ambiguous meaning. It is hard to get the clear meaning, and the HNC conceptual primitives provide the convenience: we can obtain the word meaning in the HNC conceptual primitives form after sentence analysis according the HNC processing.
