This paper investigates the nature of Japanese argument cluster (Steedman 2000b). Based on Combinatory Categorial Grammar, a type-raising analysis of case particles which captures some aspects of the information structure in Japanese is discussed, including contrastive interpretation of coordination, wh-constructions, and some theme and rheme-related grammatical phenomena. These observations offer further support for the study of syntax, semantics, and phonology interface and the earlier analysis of English information structure.

A CCG Analysis of Gapping 2.1.Gapping Revisited","paragraphs":["One motivation for the non-standard structure in (2b) is the tendency of argument clusters to act like constituents under coordination, and the relation of this phenomenon to the base order of constituents across SOV, VSO and SVO language and/or construction (Ross 1970). Ross's generalization follows as a theorem from the axioms of CCG, as illustrated by Japanese gapping construction like (3a) and the possibility of the non-standard constituent illustrated in (1c) as its part, as in derivation (3b):  (3)         The possibility of semantically surface-compositional syntactic derivations like this is one of the main theoretical attractions of CCG. The availability of two different derivations in (1b) and (1c) for sentences like (1a) allows us to consider the possibility that they are semantically and pragmatically distinct in some way. There are some specific properties of gapping that are interesting in this respect. See below:  (4)  In English, the second occurrence of the verb visited in (4) can be gapped. The arguments left in the gapped conjunct are in a contrastive relation to the correspondents in the full conjunct.2","  Note that the same intuition is hold for Japanese gapping sentence in (3a), repeated as (5):  1 Steedman (2000b) deals exclusively with Japanese data. We also use Japanese data mainly by assuming that Japanese and Korean pattern together in grammatical phenomena discussed in this paper. 2 This is reflected in the intonation aspect of gapping, which requires that both remnants and the correspondents they are contrasted with carry pitch-accents (Sag 1976). 366  (5)    Apart from the direction of gapping, two pairs of subject and object NPs in (5) are mutually in a contrastive relation. The involvement of contrast in the argument clusters in (5) suggests a deeper link between such clusters and the concept of information structure. In particular, it is natural to assume that derivation (1c), rather than (1b), applies in the case where the NPs are an information unit such as the “theme” or “rheme” in the sense of Steedman (2000a, 2000b). We will return to this question in section 3. "]},{"title":"2.2.Clustering with Case Particles","paragraphs":["Before going into further discussion of information structure, we will review the combinatory mechanism of argument cluster formation. The full derivation of (1c) using the case-particle categories in (7)\\ is as follows:  (6)      (7)   The categories in (7) are schematized using the “$-convention” (Steedman 2000b: p.42, (32)). For example, the category S\\$NPnom denotes the set of leftward-looking function categories whose domain is $NPnom and whose range is a set S\\$ defined as the recursive transitive closure over S and all leftward functions onto S\\$. Thus, -ga has the following lexical categories:  (8)  (The first category applies to standard SV intransitive and SOV transitive verbs. The second category is that of the nominative first argument of an OSV verb.) The categories in (7) allow case-marked NPs to compose to form clusters in many orders. Thus we have the following examples:3  (9)        (10) "," 3 In (11), to avoid entering into the “focus” or “rheme” relation, we mark the subject with wa, which is interpreted as “topic” or “theme” in the sense of Bolinger (1965) and Steedman (2000a, 2000b). 367   (11)    (12)   The arguments of ditransitive verb syoukai-suru ‘introduce’ can be treated in essentially the same way, the only difference being that the arguments are in a contrastive focus relation between a subject and on indirect object NP in (9), a subject and on direct object NP in (10), an indirect and a direct object NP in (11), and among three NPs in (12). We can also give the derivation of cluster, for example, (11a) and (12) are derived as the following (13a) and (13b), respectively.  (13)        The awkwardness of sentences (9b) and (10a) remains unexplained. We assume that this is an information-based “heaviness” effect. These sentences induce the whole of arguments contrast reading as (12), supporting our claim that the cluster can be composed with a serial NPs type-raises by case particles. This claim is supported by parallel heaviness-sensitive constraints on the remnants of gapping and right node raising in English (cf. Abbott (1976)):  (14)   (15)   We leave the question of the precise semantic and/or pragmatic origin of such “heaviness” effects for further research. The next section links the syntactic argument cluster with the concept of information structure. "]},{"title":"3. Wh-constructions 3.1.Wh-question","paragraphs":["Utterance meaning consists of information structure and propositional content. Information structure characterizes the relation of components of propositional content to the context of utterance (Halliday 1967, Hajičová, Skoumalová and Sgall 1995), notably with respect to what already is common ground (Clark 1996), and what the utterance itself causes to become common ground (Steedman 2007) content of utterance. Much work has been done on the determination of information structure: here we only mention the test using question-answer pairs to identify the “rheme”, as the answer to a wh-question. Thus, to the question in (16a) below, we can obtain the answer (16b) in which only nezumi ‘mouse’ is rhematic, either in the 368 context of a discussion of a small set of animals, e.g. in discussing a pet shop, as in (17), or by (in the sense of Lewis (1979) and much subsequent literature) “accommodating” such a set..  (16)       (17)  We can also obtain the following answer in (18) to the same question (16a), when a larger set of animals is either available, as in (19), or accommodated:  (18)    (19)  The derivation without forward composition is as follows:4  (20)      Japanese nouns have no distinction on number morphology, and singular and plural are expressed with the same form. Thus, dono doubutsu ‘which animal(s)’ in the question in (16a) is ambiguous and it is not clear whether it requires a unique individual or a plurality of individuals. The answers in (16b) and (18) giving an exhaustive listing reading are often distinguished as “restrictive focus”, presupposing a set specified in discourse of which the constituent is a member (Erteschik-Shir 1997). In contrast, the present theory follows Steedman (2000a, 2000b) in assuming that restrictive and nonrestrictive rhemes are semantically and grammatically indistinguishable, and only differ in the nature of the context in which they are uttered. We draw the following distinctions:  (21)     Thus, the theme is a predication over the existing context or common ground, and the rheme seeks to effect an update on the context or common ground. "]},{"title":"3.2.Multiple Wh-question","paragraphs":["In section 2.1, we adopted Steedman's claim that Japanese gapping sentence (3a), repeated in (22) below, is argument cluster coordination (Steedman 2000b: p.172), and claimed on the basis  4 The semantics of to ‘and’, conj, is tentative. 369 of an analogy with gapping in English that the coordinated clusters admit a contrastive interpretation:  (22)    In support of this analysis, consider the multiple wh-question (23), with the common ground in (24) and the corresponding list-pair answer (22).  (23)    (24)  (22) can be the answer to the wh-question, and hence the relevant part of the sentence is considered to admit rheme interpretation from the view point of information structure. Steedman and Baldridge (2007) point out that the following alternatives to (22) are also possible:  (25)      Sentence (25) is most natrual as an answer to the following order-variant multiple wh-question:  (26)    (23) and (26) differ only in the order of wh-words. Most speakers consider (25a) a natural answer to (26), whereas (25b) sounds awkward as an answer for both (23) and (26). Moreover, (25a), in turn sounds awkward for the question in (23). The clusters in (25b) have different types as follows, according to the present theory:  (27)   It follows that they cannot under the present theory conjoin at all. We conjecture that the marginal acceptability of (25b) depends on some process distinct from simple constituent coordination, perhaps the same process as that involved in English medial verb-gapping. The nature of that process remains a topic for further research. With regard to marked and unmarked answers of multiple wh-questions, Kuno (1982: p.141, (9)) argues that the fronted wh-word represents the key for sorting relevant pieces of information in the answer. While not going into an in-depth survey of his analysis, we suggest that it is the differing types of the wh-questions in (23) and (26) and of the clusters in their respective expected answers in (22) and (25a) that determine their implications for (sorting), and that the reason why (25b) sounds awkward is that it is consistent with no sorting key of the kind that Kuno postulates. 370 "]},{"title":"3.3.Clefting","paragraphs":["The bracketed clusters in the following several instances of cleft sentences in (29) from (28) are rhemes, while the -no-wa-marked constituents are themes:  (28)    (29)           From the point of view of X-bar theory, these constituents are hard to account for. Takano (2002) calls these elements “surprising constructions” and claims that they are formed by otherwise anomalous movement of an element to another element that does not dominate it. We note the great interest of Takano’s (2002) data including clefts, merely noting that the participation of such non-standard constituents in the grammar of information structure is a prediction from the assumptions of CCG, rather than a surprising anomaly at odds with the theory of grammar. Since we have assumed that there are several ditransitive verbs in Japanese, with different “scrambled” argument orders, there is in fact more than one possible derivation for the above sentences, with different verb categories for syoukai-shi-ta. We assume that these variants differ in the sorting presuppositions identified by Kuno, but have not yet investigated this question in detail. The following example discussed by in Takano (2002) is interesting in this connection:  (30)     Tanako claims that the ungrammaticality of (30) is due to a clausemate condition on movement. The implication of Takano's observation in present terms is either that Bill-ga Mary-ni ageta to omutteiro no wa cannot form a constituent of type (NP\\NPnom)\\NPacc, or that the copula does not have a category that can apply to the cluster John-ga hon-wo. We note that in English, multiple wh-questions like the following, which would violate such a clausemate condition seem grammatical, if strained.  (31) We therefore assume that it is the category of the copula that imposes this limitation, as it does in English:  (32)  371  "]},{"title":"4. Other Rhematic Constructions 4.1.Multiple-ga","paragraphs":["In section 3.1, we discussed the pragmatics of exhaustive list readings, using example (16b), repeated as (33) below:  (33)    Japanese and Korean has a construction that generates more than one nominative/subject. The following is the instances of such a construction:  (34)    (35)    The bracketed sentence-initial NP-ga is obligatorily marked with focus or “rheme” if the predicate of a sentence presents a state or a habitual/generic action (Kuno 1973). The following NPs cannot be marked with rheme although the NPs are in serial and they can be if in the sentence-initial. The reason why these NPs cannot compose a cluster is reduced to their categorial status. They are adjunct, not arguments led by type-raiser particles. The derivation, for example, of (34) is as follows:  (36)     In (36), in addition to the type-raiser as in (37a), we introduce the other type of ga in (37b):  (37)   Successive layers of ga-marked NPs shown in (34) and (35) are derived recursively with predication function given by (37). With regard to multiple subjects, a number of linguists, e.g. Kuno (1973)(S), Fukui (1986)(V') and Kuroda (1988)(VP), have proposed adjunction analysis, which we broadly follow. "]},{"title":"4.2.A Lexicalized Subjectivization","paragraphs":["To capture syntactic, semantic and pragmatic characters of multiple-subject construction, we propose two types of ga. This brings a right prediction on the so called subjectivization (Kuno:1973). 372 Kuno (1973) claim that in most multiple subject, there is a genitive-head relation between two adjacent just as inside a single noun phrase. Without going into the detail of Kuno's transformation-based mechanism, which deriving a nominative phrase from the genitive phrase by adjoining to S-node, let us see the application of subjectivization to (35):  (38)     In (38), the innermost NP cannot be replaced with genitive case marker no, and this distinction between outer and innermost ga obviously coincide with classification of ga in (37). We propose the lexicalized subjectivization under the framework of CCG by assuming the following no category:  (39)  The following is, for instance, the derivation for the sentence in (38d) (Semantics is omitted).  (40)        Note that ga in (37b) and no in (39) differ in their combinatorics of syntactic categories but combinatory process and semantics is substantially the same. On this point, it may be thought that both (37b) and (39) are only recasting under the CCG framework the mechanism of multiple nominative against V’ and multiple genitive against N’ case licensing proposed by Fukui (1986). However, our motivation for some parallels between adjoining ga and genitive no is based on the semantics that is exactly the heart of this phenomenon. The semantics that we described for these categories are the same as Latin de as in the book title De Magnete. "]},{"title":"5. Concluding Remarks","paragraphs":["The basic intuition that we pursue in this paper comes from Dowty’s (1988) and Steedman’s (2000b) analysis of the argument cluster coordination. At first we suggest that the coordinated parts admit a contrastive interpretation based on the analogy of English gapping interpretation. Next we show that unlike English, Japanese allows more than one argument to appear in the focus position with composing a cluster. Then we explore some focus-related grammatical phenomena with discussing evidences linking the CCG analysis of argument cluster with the theory of information structure. We believe that these observations will be helpful to the study of syntax, semantics, phonology interface and the theory of information structure in universal grammar."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Abbott, B. 1976.
