This paper addresses a task of opinion extraction from given documents and its positive/negative classification. We propose a sentence classification method using a notion of syntactic piece. Syntactic piece is a minimum unit of structure, and is used as an alternative processing unit of n-gram and whole tree structure. We compute its semantic orientation, and classify opinion sentences into positive or negative. We have conducted an experiment on more than 5000 opinion sentences of multiple domains, and have proven that our approach attains high performance at 91% precision.  Keywords: syntactic piece, opinion extraction, sentence classification  "]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["One can easily disseminate information through the Internet, that include their personal opinions, such as reputation and dissatisfaction with products, complaints about services, and so on. Weblogs and message boards in particular have attracted a great deal of attention as a new information source, since they enable us to obtain subjective opinions easily. In order to automatically extract useful information from these sources, various approaches have been proposed. (Inui and Okumura, 2006)","Researchers have been exploring techniques for classifying documents according to sentiment orientation, or positive/negative (p/n) in particular. Turney (2002) extracts phrases containing adjectives or adverbs, and determines their semantic orientation. Further, p/n of a document is judged by computing the average of the semantic orientations. The NEAR operator in the Alta Vista search engine is used in the method. If you search a query like A NEAR B in Alta Vista, the search engine shows pages containing within near words of each other. However, this operator is not provided in Japanese version.","Wang and Araki (2007) extend Turney's method into Japanese by collecting and using a set of words that contribute significantly to p/n orientation. Fujimura et al. (2004) use corpora divided into p/n words, and statistically classify a document by extracting opinions. These methods provide the semantic orientation only with bag-of-words. A word, however, contains little and partial information. Therefore, we assert that the scope of the process needs to be expanded. Moreover, these methods do not identify reasons for p/n judgment, that is, expressions that cause semantic orientation. For a commercial application, this function is essential in marketing research.","Besides these, other document classification approaches have also been proposed, which prepare a semantic orientation dictionary in advance. Tateishi et al. (2004) construct this  * Copyright 2007 by Natural Language Processing Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Nagaoka University of Technology. 76 dictionary in advance by extracting opinion triplets that consist of òbject name, attribute expression, evaluative expression’, and classify documents by using the triplets. The method extracts only expressions that appear in a definite pattern, and it is thus difficult to obtain satisfactory coverage and accuracy. Kobayashi et al. (2005) first extract a few opinion pairs of attribute and value with an anaphora resolution technique, and construct a semantic orientation dictionary of the pairs for a target domain. They then gradually expand the entries of the dictionary from the pair seed. However, if the accuracy of the primary pairs is not adequate, the quality of the dictionary becomes gradually poorer due to gradually involving noises. In addition, making the dictionary domain by domain is very expensive.","In this paper we do not use a word as an unit of tagging information to extract opinions. As other work does, we also think that a document can be classified when we only extract partial sentiment expressions. However, we do not think that bag-of-words approach is not suitable for this task, and we need something else instead. One can see this fact that, for example, the semantic orientation of a word can vary according to a given domain. Let us consider this example; a word b̀ig’ is positive when used in sentence such as t̀his LCD monitor is big.’, while the word should be judged negative in a sentence such as t̀hat portable audio player is too big to me.’","Consequently, we assert that it is necessary to use a longer unit as a sentiment expression instead of using an unit of word in which conventional works do so. In this paper, we propose an opinion-mining method that utilize a new notion of syntactic piece. Syntactic piece is a unit of sentiment expression that is suitable for keeping semantic orientation. More explanation of syntactic piece is described later. "]},{"title":"2. Syntactic Piece","paragraphs":["Syntactic piece and other units are illustrated in Figure 1.                      Figure 1: Idea of syntactic piece compared with other units ","Syntactic piece is a minimum unit of syntactic structure of an expression. It is defined as a pair consisting of a modifier and a modifiee (modified entity) from dependency analysis result. This pair is expressed as follows. 77  syntactic piece : modifier ⇒ modifiee  Syntactic piece has several characteristics: ","・it is very simple; it is easy, just like n-gram statistics, to extract pieces from any given expression since it requires only (partial) parsing result. In contrast, using the whole syntactic structure for opinion extraction is computationally very expensive. Consequently, we think the notion of syntactic piece is considered to have advantages of both n-gram and (whole) tree structure.","・it contains far more information than n-gram. N-gram is a consecutive sequence that keeps information of local context. It is observed that agglutinative languages such as Japanese and Korean has enormous combination of word sequence, since the word order is relatively free. In such languages n-gram-based model is expected not to work well, and some kinds of syntax should be dealt with.","・it can deal with a chunk of meaning, such as a phrasal idiom; e.g. a Japanese phrase 気̀-に ⇒ なる’ that means f̀eel uneasy.’ Conventional methods have avoided this problem by (1)ignoring them, or (2) importing an idiom dictionary from outside. In contrast, our method gives them the same treatment, hence we do not need such idiom dictionary or we do not need to recognize idioms as they are.  Here we present Japanese patterns of the syntactic piece below: "]},{"title":"continuous modification","paragraphs":["・case frame : noun(-particle) ⇒ predicate e.g. 画面-が ⇒ きれい (clear screen) ・adverbial modification : adverb ⇒ predicate","e.g. とても ⇒ おいしい (delicious)"]},{"title":"adnominal modification","paragraphs":["・noun modification : noun-no ⇒ noun e.g. キャノン-の ⇒ カメラ (Canon’s camera) ・verbal modification : verb ⇒ noun","e.g. くつろげる ⇒ 店 (comfortable shop) ・adjectival modification : adjective ⇒ noun","e.g. おいしい ⇒ ケーキ (delicious cake) ・compound noun : noun-noun e.g. 携帯-電話 (cellular phone) ・prefix : adverb ⇒ prefix-noun","e.g. 高-画質 (high picture quality) "]},{"title":"3. Method","paragraphs":["Our opinion extraction model is illustrated in Figure 2.","To begin with, our system extracts syntactic pieces1","from a training corpus. We then compute a semantic orientation score for each piece, and construct a seed dictionary of the pieces. We then generalize the dictionary by increasing the entries of the pieces that are labeled according to information of the existing pieces. We extend the dictionary employing large texts  1 We may just call piece for short hereafter. 78 of general domains. Finally, we classify a sentence with the dictionary into three types: positive, negative or other.","In this paper we assume that we have a training corpus in which semantic orientation of positive or negative tags are labeled for all sentences. There are no chance that both positive and negative tags are labeled to the same sentence. We also assume that the large amount of texts of general domains, such as newspaper corpus, is available.                              Figure 2: Opinion extraction model "]},{"title":"3.1. Syntactic Piece Extraction","paragraphs":["First of all, a sentence in the training corpus is analyzed by a dependency parser that creates the dependency structure. We then pick up pairs of modified item and a modifier, for all modifications in the dependency structure. Each pair constitutes a syntactic piece. Sometimes two modifiers, say A and B, modify the same expression, say C. In this case two syntactic pieces, i.e. (A ⇒ C) and (B ⇒ C), are created.","When a given sentence has a positive tag, all syntactic pieces extracted from a given sentence are tagged positive. The same is done for negative case.","As mentioned, we do not need sentences which have no semantic orientation since we use syntactic pieces to classify the sentence into p/n. Moreover, although compound noun is regarded as noun modification of noun, that is the target of syntactic piece extraction, they are not extracted since compound noun seems to have no semantic orientation.  79"]},{"title":"3.2. Semantic Orientation Score","paragraphs":["We then compute the semantic orientation score for each syntactic piece extracted from the corpus using a formula seen in Fujimura et al. (2004).","According to Fujimura, a word that has positive semantic orientation should appear in a positive opinion. The same can be said to syntactic piece. Based on this hypothesis, we compute the differences of frequency between positive opinions and negative opinions. If the syntactic piece does not have semantic orientation, the frequency of positive opinions should be the same as the frequency of negative opinions. A positive piece is expected to have a positive value.  Semantic orientation scores for all syntactic pieces are given in the following procedure.  1. prepare text collection each of which has either p or n, 2. extract all syntactic pieces from all texts, 3. count the frequency of p/n opinion for each piece, and 4. calculate the semantic orientation score with the following equation:"]},{"title":")()( )()( )(","paragraphs":["ii ii i"]},{"title":"pieceNpieceP pieceNpieceP piecescore + − =","paragraphs":["(1)"]},{"title":"() 1)(1 ≤≤−","paragraphs":["i"]},{"title":"piecescore ","paragraphs":["where piecei is a syntactic piece, score(piecei) is sentiment orientation score of piecei, P(piecei) is frequency of piecei appeared in positive opinions, and N(piecei) is frequency of appeared piecei in negative opinions. By conducting this process we can automatically construct a syntactic-piece dictionary that has semantic orientation score. ","In the conventional methods such as Turney (2002) and Fujimura et al. (2004), document classification is based on statistically extracted keywords, as well as tagged semantic orientation for each word n-gram. Hence, the method depends on the domain of the learning corpus, that is, semantic orientation of a word may change with the domain. For example, a word 高̀い’ in 値̀ 段-が ⇒ 高い’ (expensive in terms of money) is considered to be negative in general, while the same word in 画̀素数-が ⇒ 高い’ (high picture quality) is considered to be positive.","In contrast, the semantic orientation of syntactic piece is expected to be independent of the domain of learning corpus. This is because, semantic orientation of a syntactic piece lengthens the context than using an unit of word, that enables us clearer semantic orientation. This feature is important since it is not required for our proposed method to consider (i.e. classify and/or identify) domain; it is enough that we prepare pieces with semantic orientation in any domain as many as possible. "]},{"title":"3.3. Dictionary Generalization","paragraphs":["We first provide syntactic pieces that are extracted from a training corpus. Next we use this seed to label other pieces. Compared with labeling p/n information to words, we need to tag more since the number of syntactic pieces are far more than number of words in general. Therefore it is necessary to extend given information to other unlabeled pieces. Here we will explain how we do that.","As we have mentioned before, semantic orientation of a word may change with a domain in many cases. However, we all know that some words always show only p or n. For example, we see that sentiment orientation of a word 良̀い(good)’ is always positive, even if we do not know what is good. Hence, we generalize the dictionary by identifying such syntactic pieces as 良̀い’. 80 We automatically label p/n as follows. When we collect pieces that constitute the same first","element (i.e. modifier), and only positive tags are observed in the set, we tag all pieces that has","the same first element positive. The similar procedure is conducted for negative tags, and also","for the same second element (i.e. modified item) set. We show how to do this process. Suppose that there are six syntactic pieces that has semantic","orientation in the dictionary.  画̀質-が⇒良い’ 味̀-が⇒良い’ 画̀面-が⇒大きい’ : tagged positive (picture quality is good) (taste good) (big screen) ","騒̀音-が⇒大きい’ デ̀ザイン-が⇒悪い’ 印̀象-が⇒悪い’ : tagged negative (very noisy) (poor design) (bad impression)  positive negative àny phrase ⇒ 良い’ 2 0 ⇒ tagged positive àny phrase ⇒ 大きい’ 1 1 ⇒ not extracted àny phrase ⇒ 悪い’ 0 2 ⇒ tagged negative "]},{"title":"3.4.

Dictionary Extension","paragraphs":["We have two types of dictionaries: the seed dictionary and the generalized seed dictionary. Although the size of the seed dictionary is small, it is not easy in general to increase learning corpus, when we want to extend the amount of the seed dictionary. Hence, what we do here is to classify other large corpus using the dictionaries to make learning data.","First, we provide a large corpus. This corpus is a collection of raw texts and do not require any tags such as positive or negative. We classify sentences in the corpus using the seed dictionary and the the generalized seed dictionary into either positive, negative or other. We use the classes of positive and negative as tagged data, and the other class is not used. We extract syntactic pieces out of the tagged data, and calculate semantic orientation score from the method explained in section 3.1 and 3.2 using this positive and negative tagged corpus.

Results and Discussions","paragraphs":["Table 2 illustrates the effect of the dictionary extension and generalization. We see from the table that precision is very high, even if we generalize the dictionary. Although we expect before the experiment that the precision sharply or gradually declines with the dictionary generalization, but it has unexpectedly increased. This may imply the robustness of our method against the noise given by the dictionary generalization. One possibility for this surprising result is that there may be low possibility that the syntactic pieces are wrongly tagged thanks to the longer unit.","Other issue is that high precision is attained without domain specification in our method. This should also thank longer processing unit, since it decreases possibility of interference that enables coexistence and no need to switch domains.","On the other hand, the recall is not satisfactory at this time.
