Looking back the history of formal treatment of linguistics, we cannot disregard the contribution of possible world semantics. Intensional logic of Montague semantics, DRT (Discourse Representation Theory), mental space, and situation theory are closely related to or compared with the notion of possible world. All these theories have commonly clarified the structure of belief context or uncertain knowledge, employing hypothesized worlds. In this talk, I firstly brief the pedigree of these theories. Next, I will introduce the recent development of modal logic for the representation of (i) knowledge and belief and (ii) time, in which belief modality is precisely discussed together with the accessibility among possible worlds. I will refer to BDI (belief-desire-intention) logic, CTL (computational tree logic), and sphere-based model in belief revision. Finally, I will discuss how these theories could be applied to the further development of analyses of natural language."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["Let me introduce two examples how modality is used in natural language semantics.","Firstly, when non-native English learners first learn two meanings of each of ‘must’ and ‘may’, that is epistemic/deontic readings, they are baffled: what the two meanings have in common?","must may epistemic have firm knowledge have vague knowledge deontic force obligation permit tolerantly The possible world semantics may (or must?) convince some of them, that is, must for all possible worlds, denoted by □ may some possible worlds exist, denoted by ♦ Remember in First-Order Logic, ∀ (for all) and ∃ (some · · · exist) are interchangeable each other; i. e., ∀x p(x) is equal to ¬∃¬p(x) (there exists no x such that ¬p(x)). In the similar way, ‘□’ can be replaced by ‘¬♦¬’ in modal logic. In Japanese, the deontic reading of ‘must’ is translated as –nakere–ba–naranai. Here, the first ‘–nakere–’ is the negation, and the second ‘–ba–’ suggests a case, and the third ‘–naranai’ is again the negation. Thus, Japanese represent deontic ‘□’ by ‘¬♦¬’.","Secondly, we can introduce a hypothetical belief situation either in the past tense or in the conjunctive mood in Indo-European languages, and also we may mention an imaginary current situation in the conditionalmood,1","as ,,Wenn ich mehr Zeit hütte, so würde ich Ihnen einen längeren Brief schreiben.“ ⟨⟨S’il venait demain, tu le verrais.⟩⟩ “Se facesse bel tempo domani, che faresti?” In English both the conjunctive and the conditional moods have been reduced to the subjunctive mood.","“If I were a bird, I would fly to you.” ∗ Copyright 2007 by Satoshi Tojo 1 Konjunctive in German. 42 Why do we employ the past tense when we introduce a counterfactual situation? One explanation is that we consider retreating once to a past (by the conjunctive mood) to annihilate the current situation, and restarting from the past to the different ‘now’ (by the conditional mood) as in the following figure.","◦ ↗ new now −→ ◦ −→ ◦ ↘","◦ −→ ◦ −→ now Actually, in English and German which do not possess the conditional mood, ‘would’ and ‘würden’ are called past-future (future seen from the past). Later, we will explain such a branching time in terms of modal logic."]},{"title":"2. Looking back · · · 2.1.

A subset of possible worlds partitioned by κ is called a sphere (Hansson, 1999). Given a proposition φ, we can define the credibility of the proposition by κ(φ) ≡ min{κ(w)|w ⊩ φ}.

Branching Time and CTL As we have mentioned in Introduction, we need not to stick to the linear time. The branching time is far versatile to represent various linguistic information. We employ the following principles. • Time is discrete. • Time steps are called states; among which, there is a state called ‘now’. • The past is a straight chaining of states. • There is the beginning state in the past. • Time branches to the future. • The future persists forever. A sequence of states from the beginning state to a future, following a branch, is called a path. Together with temporal operators, we can define Computational Tree Logic (CTL) (Rao and Georgeff, 1991). A For any path, E For some path, Xφ In the next state, φ. φU ψ φ until ψ.

Toward Communicative Agent","paragraphs":["Departing from intra-sentence analysis of belief situation, we can develop a theory of communication, discussing what an agent comes to believe after an informing act of the other agent. First, we introduce the communication channel between agents to implement the notion of uncertainty. In actual mobile agents, the communication eventually might fail by unexpected causes.","The definition of the original inform of FIPA (FIPA, 2002) is as follows.","feasibility pre-condition : Biφ ∧ ¬Bi(Bif jφ ∨ Uif jφ) rational effect : Bjφ A formula Bjφ means that agent j believes φ. Also, Bif jφ and Uif jφ are the abbreviations of Bjφ ∨ ¬Bjφ and Ujφ ∨ ¬Ujφ, respectively, where Ujφ means that agent j is uncertain about φ but the agent supposes that φ is more likely than ¬φ. However, is the rational effect enough to represent our linguistic communication? There had been two questions: • The recipient truly comes to know the information if only the sender informs it? • The recipient should know more besides the information.","We have introduced channel variables (Hagiwara, Kobayashi, and Tojo, 2006; de Saeger, Kobayashi, and Tojo, 2007) and added an extra-condition to FIPA’s communicability, as follows. feasibility pre-condition (revised) : Biφ ∧ ¬Bi(Bif jφ ∨ Uif jφ) ∧ cij where cij is the channel variable between agent i and j. There had been many ways to embed the notion of channel to the logic, e. g., modality, Cartesian product, proposition, and so on. We adopted to employ proposition since we could inform the channel itself as a payload of channel. According to this, in the rational result, agent j should know that i already had known φ, and i would know that j came to know φ. That is, rational effect (revised) : (BiBjφ) ∨ (BiBjφ ∧ Bjφ ∧ BjBiφ).","This formalization implies that the future states bifurcates into future dependent on whether the communication has been successful or not. This inevitably requires us to incorporate CTL (Section 4.3.) in each possible world. In addition, we need to employ dynamic logic (Wooldridge, 2000) that formalize the state change by inform actions. The knowledge state of each agent in each possible world changes by the inform action, and thus, the accessibility of belief modality also changes, that is the model updating.","Still, there are other possible ways to include the notion of channel. Suppose that the situation s supports the information φ, and φ implies φ′","if some extra-condition s′","is supplied. Namely,","s ◦ s′","|= φ′ ⇐⇒ s |= φ & ∀s′","∼ s, s′","|= φ ▷ φ′ where ◦ is the connection of situation.

Then, all the prefixes (initial finite number of sequences) of each history are also regarded as reliable source of knowledge.

Furthermore, we can define Biφ, restricting the accessible worlds by spheres (Section 3.2.). Then, we can avoid the reflectivity T (Section 4.1.) to meet the condition of Bi (Section 4.2.).","How can we formalize the inform action of ‘witch’ sentences of Geach and Ioup (Section 2.3.), that is, if an agent tells his community that “a witch killed a horse” each member of the community comes to have a different belief state from person to person? The further objective of our study is belief propagation and group revision, where each belief state is elucidated by DRT/mental space.","Finally, notice that we could have rich byproduct in other linguistic phenomena. In the analysis of tense/aspect and event structure, multi-modal logic of precedence and inclusion would reformulate the preceding theory in a more sophisticated way (Tojo, 2006; Koga and Tojo, 2007). Also, if we assume a long history of communication, the protocol may emerge, evolve, and change. Thus, the study may contribute to the study of language evolution (Nakamura, Hashimoto, and Tojo, 2006; Matoba, Nakamura, and Tojo, 2006)."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Bratman, M. E. 1987.
