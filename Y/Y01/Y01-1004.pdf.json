In this approach, floated quantifiers are accounted for semantically as a kind of adverbial phrase so that we do not need any special syntactic operations, such as quantifier raising, in order to interpret their meanings. The approach also explains 'pragmatic implication' introduced by floated quantifiers on the basis of the whole-part relationship between sets."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["As a relatively free word order language, Japanese often exhibits quantifier floating phenomena. The most common analyses of these are syntactic ones; for example, that by Miyagawa (1989) has been widely accepted within GB theory. In this paper, however, we point out that the transformational analysis is on the wrong track, and propose a way to interpret the meanings of floated quantifiers and to account for their syntactic behaviour. Our assumption is that quantifier floating should be accounted for not just by syntactic operations but rather by the interaction of syntactic and semantic conditions. Our theory also intends to interpret 'pragmatic implication' and semantic differences caused by quantifier floating."]},{"title":"2 Numeral Expressions and Problems","paragraphs":["In Japanese a numeral quantifier is always followed by a classifier which indicates the semantic category the quantified nominal belongs to. For example, san-nin means \"three people\", sanbon \"three long and cylindrical objects\", san-mai \"three thin and flat objects\", san-satu \"three bound objects\", and san-biki \"three animals (dogs, cats, etc.)\". Numeral quantifiers can be used as modifiers that are suffixed by the genetive case marker no and immediately placed before the NP they modify, as seen in (la). Quantifier floating is a phenomenon in which the numeral quantifiers are separated rightwards from the NP they modify, as seen in (1b).","(1) a.

On the other hand (3b) is a scrambled version of (3a) and the object NP comes first and the subject NP is inserted between floated quantifier go-satu and the object NP it modifies.

Shibatani (1977) proposes a generalization that numeral quantifiers can be floated from ga-marked NPs, which are typically subject NPs, and wo-marked NPs, which are object NPs. According to Shibatani, the ungrammaticality of (2) derives from the case marking by de in the NP from which the quantifier floats. Such an explanation, however, leaves other cases of floating unexplained by neglecting the existence of floated ni-marked object NPs.

For the latter type, on the other hand, functions which output the quantity are defined: for example, the function f l which returns the length of an NP and the function 4, returns the weight of an NP.","(11) John-ga hon-wo san-satsu yonda.

In order to show a unified treatment of floated quantifiers and adverbials by this model, I show the lexical items of (12) in Figures 6 and the derivation of (12b) in Figure 7. In Figure 6 and 7, the function fim is a sort of the function f and outputs how many meters the length is. The truth-conditional meaning of the last step of Figure 7 is such that there is a set Z and the length denoted by the set Z is 100m, and there are elements z, of which Central street can be predicated, of the set Z; furthermore, there is the event e which is Running, and John is the Agent of the event and z is the Patient. The implied meaning says that there is a set X whose subset is the set Z, and X is bound by the context in which the sentence is used. Note that this implicature can be canceled depending on the context. Assume that Central street is only 50m long and John went up and down the street; even in such a situation (12b) holds.","In our proposal, the floated quantifier semantically combines with the predicate only if the NP that the quantifier 'quantifies' bears a 0-role within the verb's lexical definition. Thus floating is limited to Agent, Patient, Theme, and Path. The de-marked NP in (2), bearing Instrument, is an adjunct and cannot be combined with the quantifier into a well-formed formula.","Indefiniteness observed in the objects of the actions in (11) and (12) is explained straightforwardly. The wo-marked accusative NPs may be prefixed by the iota operator for indicating definiteness or may be left as in Figures 5 and 7 in the case of being indefinite; the set introduced by the floated quantifier or the adverbial, Z, is a subset of the set denoted by the accusative NP, X, and as such remains indefinite. 51 4.3 Some Consequences of the Proposed Analysis In this section let us consider some consequences of our approach to the quantifier floating phenomena and discuss how the problems mentioned in §2 are solved.","Firstly, according to the approach proposed here a floated quantifier modifies the NP whose position is immediately precedent to it, so sentences like (3a) can be ruled out. While as seen in (3b), the object NP occurs in the position preceding to the subject NP by scrambling and the floated quantifier and the object NP is separated, we can put a hypothetical variable x instead of the object NP and semantically bind it by a slash introduction rule, so our proposal predicts (3b) as grammatical.","Secondly, unlike Shibatani (1977), our proposal is able to cope with one part of ni-marked NPs, which can be both an argument of the verb and adjunct, because our formalization is based on not the classification of case of the NP but the 9-role, i.e., we can say that the quantifiers can float from only the NPs which have 0-roles, especially Agent, Patient, Theme and Patient, which are the arguments of a verb, irrespective of the morphological case information. The framework, therefore, proposed in this paper is a semantically oriented framework, and the problems caused by syntactic approaches such as c-command in Miyagawa (1989) can be avoided. 5"]},{"title":"Conclusion","paragraphs":["In this paper we have proposed a method to compositionally interpret the meaning and conventional implicature of floated quantifiers on the basis of Categorial Grammar and Davidsonian semantics. This model also shows that adverbials and quantifiers can be uniformly treated by the whole-part relation, a relation between a set Z expressed by the accusative NP and a set X which is restricted by the context in which the sentence is used."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["We would like to thank Hiroyuki Nishina for useful comments on earlier versions of this paper and the three anonymous reviewers of PACLIC15."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Carpenter, B. 1997.
