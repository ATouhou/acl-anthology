Each of this subtype has its own construction-specific constraint as well as those inherited from its supertypes. The paper ]. shows that if we accept this view of the English auxiliary system in terms of construction types and declarative type constraints on them, we can offer a more straightforward and explicit explanation for English negation, VP ellipsis, and VP fronting phenomena. This paper starts with an analysis for English negation. Following Kim and Sag (1995), Kim (2000), and Warner (2000), this paper assume that the English negative marker not leads two lives — one as an adverbial modifier (as constituent negation) and the other as the complement of a finite auxiliary verb (as sentential negation):","'The theory this paper assumes is Construction-HPSG, roughly Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar, augmented with a theory of constructions as in Ginzburg and Sag to appear. 271"]},{"title":"[adv","paragraphs":["[HEAD","MOD VP[nonfin]: CONT NOT (n)","(3) a. John [[will] [not] [leave Seoul]].\\t(Sentential negation) b. John wants [not [to leave Seouln.\\t(Constituent negation) Clear support for this position lies in VP deletion (VPE) phenomena, as we will see in due course. Such a system also provides a simple analysis for Verb Phrase Fronting (VPF) phenomenon. The analysis provided here for these two constructions is built upon grammatical constructions with declarative constraints and a rich network of inheritance relations among them. 2 Negation 2.1 VP constituent Negation The English negator not, like an adverb never, can function as a modifier of a phrasal element like a nonfinite VP as in (4).","(4) a. Kim regrets [never/not [having seen the movie]). b. We asked him [never/not [to try to call us again]]. c. Duty made them [never/not [miss the weekly meeting].","This modifier property can be represented by a partial lexical description represented in the feature structure system of HPSG: (5) not This simple lexical information in (5) specifies that not modifies only a nonfinite VP and takes the modified VP's meaning as its semantic argument. This will be enough to capture the positional possibilities of the modifier not in nonfinite clauses:","(6) a. [Not [speaking English]] is a disadvantage. b.*[Speaking not English] is a disadvantage. c.*Lee likes not Kim.","(7) a. Lee is believed [not vp [inf] [to like Kina]]. b.*Lee is believed to vp [infi [like not Kim]. Independent principles guarantee that modifiers of this kind precede the elements they modify, thus ensuring the grammaticality of (6)a and (7)a, where not is used as a VP[nonfin] modifier. But the examples (6)b, (6)c and (7)b are ungrammatical since the modifier not fails to appear in the required position—i.e. before all elements of the nonfinite VP.","In addition to these distributional properties, there is further evidence that not modifies a nonfinite VP. Given the general assumption that modification is recursive, our treatment predicts the possibility of double occurrences of negation in infinitival phrases. This prediction appears to be correct:","(8) (Everyone's turning the offer down, but I'm wavering...) ?I can't believe you would consider [not [not [taking advantage of the offer]]].","It is an important semantic fact that a VP modifier never outscopes a higher verb. Thus in examples like (9) and (10), the finite verb always outscopes the adverb. 272","(9) a. Kim seems [never [to be alone]]. b. Kim seems [not [to like anchovies]]. c. Pat considered [always [doing the homework assignmentjj. d. Pat considered [not [doing the homework assignment]]. The lexical entry for not must therefore include the information that the modified element (which corresponds to the element that the negation adjoins to) be within the scope of the negation.","This lexical property of not also explains the interaction of coordination and negation:","(10) a. Dana will [[not [walk]] and [talk]]. b. Dana will [not [[walk] and [talk]]]. c. Dana will [[walk] and [not [talk]]]. d. You can [[walk for miles] and [not [see anyone])]. In each of the examples in (10), the negation modifies a base-form VP, satisfying the nonfinite specification given above. Because not is a VP modifier, it may modify either the coordinate VP or one of its conjuncts, thus allowing for the various scopings sketched in (10)a and (10)b.2"]},{"title":"2.2 Sentential Negation","paragraphs":["As we have observed so far, when considering the distributional possibilities of not as VP constituent negation in nonfinite clauses, not behaves much like negative adverbs never. However, not distinguishes itself from adverbs like never in finite clauses. Unlike the negative adverb never, not cannot precede a finite verb as in (11). When it serves as sentential negation, it should appear right after a finite auxiliary verb as in (12).","(11) a. Lee never/*not left. b. Lee never/*not would leave. c. Lee never/*not has left.","(12) a. Lee did not leave. b. Lee may not leave. c. Lee will not leave.","Various phenomena illustrate that the negator modifying a nonfinite VP is constituent negation whereas the one right after a finite auxiliary is sentential negation. For example, (13.) could have two interpretations: When not is a VP modifier as in (14)b, it has a narrow scope but it has a wide scope reading when serving as sententional negation as in (14)a. (13) The president could not approve the bill.","(14) a. It would not be possible for the president to approve the bill. b. It would be possible for the president to approve the bill.","Such a scope difference could also be found in wh-cleft sentences. In (15)a, the sentential negation has only a wide scope whereas in (15)b the modifier not takes a narrow scope.","2Notice, by contrast, that if we accept the general assumption that only categorially identical constituents can be coordinated, then these same facts pose a dilemma for the NegP hypothesis: the examples in (10) would be coordinations of NegP and VP or VP and NegP. And even if these nonidentical constituents are somehow allowed, we still lack an explanation for the impossibility of other cross-categorial coordinations, e.g. CP and IP. One solution to this dilemma might be to posit an additional functional projection such as PolP (Polarity Phrase, Culicover 1991) or E Phrase (cf. Laka 1990). This would of course entail generating a phonetically unexpressed element as the head of such a phrase in every nonnegative sentence, a consequence that lacks independent justification. 273"]},{"title":"0","paragraphs":["1:1VP[bse})"]},{"title":"(15) a.

As noticed in (22), the negation following the stressed auxiliary does not function as sentential negation:","(22) a. He CAN not go to school tomorrow, (can't he/*can he)? b. He MAY not go to school tomorrow, (mayn't he/*may he)? This àntifocus' property of sentential negation is presumably also lexically registered, as a constraint either on the lexical type, or else a condition on relevant constructions (see Kim 2000 for some discussion). 3 VP Deletion More clear support for this construction-based analysis comes from the explanation of VPE. The standard generalization that VPE is possible only after an auxiliary verb as represented in the following contrast:","(23) a. Kim can dance, and Sandy can \\t, too. b. Kim has danced, and Sandy has\\t, too. c. Kim was dancing, and Sandy was \\t, too.","4 Following Zwicky and Pullum (1983), we take n't to be an inflectional suffix. Under this inflectional analysis, partial formal regularities can be accomodated, exceptional forms (e.g. won't, don't) can be listed, and anomalies like *amn't and *mayn't can be treated as paradigmatic gaps. In addition, dialectal variants (e.g. %usen't, %ain't) are treated as simple lexical differences.","5There are cases with no ambiguity:","(i) a. Kim must not drink the wine on the table. b. Kim may not drink the wine on the table. The deontic must and the epistemic may here do not induce scope ambiguity with the sentential negation. One solution to this lies in positing a lexical restriction: when they take the negator as a complement, they must take wider scope over the negator. See Warner 200 for detail. 275 Sandy","(24) a. *Kim considered joining the navy, but I never considered \\t. b. *Kim got arrested by the CIA, and Sandy got \\t, also. c. *Kim wanted to go and Sandy wanted , too. These illustrate that VPE is also sensitive to the presence of an auxiliary verb.

Thus, the VP complement of all these verbs can be elided but not that of the main verbs in (24).","This analysis will easily generate examples like (28) in the same manner. {(28) Kim must have been dancing and a.

One simple fact we can observe from (30) is that adverbs cannot modify an empty VP. In the framework of HPSG, VP modifying adverbs carry at least the lexical information given in (31). The lexical entry in (31) simply states that the adverb with this lexical information modifies a VP. The head feature MOD guarantees the fact that the adverb selects the head VP it modifies. This then entails that when the VP that an adverb modifies is not syntactically realized, as in (30)b, there is no VP for the adverb to modify. This explains the unacceptability of VPE after an adverb. Given Sag and Fodor's (1994) traceless theory, an ungrammatical example like (30)a would then have to have the structure given in (32).8 (32) VP VH-AUX]\\t*VP have\\tA dvjM OD VP] always HPSG has a small set of schemata, analogous to X' schemata, which specify partial information about universally available types of phrases. The adjunct schema is one of the universally available options for well-formed phrases. This adjunct schema roughly says that an adjunct and the head it selects through its modifier feature (MOD) forms a well-formed phrase. Now look at the structure in (32). In the present lexical theory where a VP modifier (e.g. always and never in (30)a,b) selects its head VP through the head feature MOD(IFIED), the absence of this VP then means that there is no VP the adverb can modify. And this results in an ill-formed structure: no universal schema in HPSG renders such a structure acceptable, thus explaining the ungrammaticality of (30)a,b.","This analysis then provides a clean anlaysis to the striking property of not with respect to VPE we have discussed: not can be stranded only after a finite auxiliary.","(33) a. Kim said he could have heard the news, but Lee said that he could not \\t. b.*Kim said he could have heard the news, but Lee said that he could have not \\t. If the negator not in (33)a and (33)b were identically taken to be a modifier, we would predict both of these examples to be unacceptable since in both cases there is no VP for the negative marker to modify. Given the constructional constraint on negation-ph, the negator not in (33)a (but not the one in (33)b) is the complement of a finite auxiliary verb as represented in (34).","8 Sag and Fodor (1994) reexamine empirical motivations for phonetically empty categories which have been important theoretical foundations in modern GB analyses. They show that all independent arguments for the existence of traces such as auxiliary contraction, wanna contraction, and position of floated quantifiers are neither satisfactory nor well-grounded. They also present positive arguments for terminating filler-gap dependencies by lexical heads, not by traces. See Sag and Fodor (1994) for details. 277 (34) [COMPS (ADV[NEG +], VP[bse])] Once this auxiliary head is realized in an ellipsis-ph, then the rightmost element (VP[bse]) can be unrealized in syntax, yielding the following structure.","VP [negation-ph &","V\\tDAdv AUX +\\t[NEG + COMPS (H, VP[bse]) \\tMOD VP[nonfin]] could","\\t not Notice that the phrase [could not] in (35) forms a well-formed head-complement structure where not is the complement of the head could. Nothing blocks this structure. One may ask whether it is acceptable not to satisfy the MOD feature of the adverb not in such a case. But note here that the structure (35) is not an adjunct structure, but a head-complement structure because the negator is now converted to a complement. The HPSG theory says nothing about what happens when a complement has a MOD value. Thus its presence in a complement does not affect the well-formedness of the given phrase. Under this analysis, the ungrammaticality of (34)b and (34)c also falls out naturally. The negators in (34)b and (34)c are just modifiers. They cannot be complements. We have seen that an adverb requires the VP it modifies to be present in order to form a well-formed structure. But the VPs that the adverbs modify are absent here.","The present construction and constraint-based analysis thus gives us a simple and explicit explanation for these VPE facts. The puzzle of the VPE with negation directly follows from our treatment of negation and ellipsis. 4 VP Fronting Now, let us consider the phenomenon often referred to as VP fronting (henceforth, VPF).","(36) They swore that Lee might have been using heroin, and a. using heroin he might have been b. *been using heroin he might have \\t! c. *have been using heroin he might\\t!\\t","(Akamajian et al. 1979) The first thing we can notice is that VPF cannot be identified with VPE because of the ungrammatical cases such as those given in (36)b and (36)c. If any constituent that can undergo VPE can also be VP-fronted, we would expect that VP's headed by been or have could not be elided. A simple generalization we can obtain from such data is that a fronted VP cannot be headed by an auxiliary element. This will block examples like (36)b and (36)c.","However, this simple approximation is counterevidenced by examples like the following (data from Gazdar et al. 1982):","(37) a.*... and [to go] he is b.*... and [be going] he will. c.*... and [have gone] he will. d. ... and [being evasive] he was.

VPF is relevant only to the phrase whose head is an auxiliary. This restriction similarly holds in VPE too. But the restriction on the aspectual value of the gapped VP complement makes them different: the head of the VP that undergoes fronting should be nonaspectual. This accounts for the difference between VPF and VPE (relevant data repeated here).","(43) They swore that Lee might have been taking heroin, and a. taking heroin he might have been ! b. *been taking heroin he might have\\t! c. *have been taking heroin he might \\t!","(44) Lee might have been taking heroin, and a.

Recall that our treatment allows not to be either a VP modifier or a syntactic complement of a finite auxiliary, and that we permit the negator not to be stranded only if it becomes a complement of a finite auxiliary, i.e., only when it occurs immediately after a finite auxiliary. This prediction is borne out:","(45) a. They all said that John was not being followed, and [being followed] he was not\\t. b. They all said that John was not being followed, and [not being followed] he was\\t. The negative marker not in (45)a is the complement of the auxiliary be, and its VP complement being followed is fronted. In (45)b, the same VP is fronted and not is modifying the fronted VP.","But notice a different behavior of the modifier not.","(46) Kim said she would be not eating spinach, and a. *[eating spinach] she will be not\\t. b. [not eating spinach] she will be \\t. The negator not (46)a can be only a modifier. As noted in the previous section, the modifier not cannot be stranded, since the modifier not does not satisfy its MOD requirement. Meanwhile, nothing blocks (46)b in which not is a modifier.","Within the present analysis, examples like (47) will be predicted to be unacceptable in the present analysis:","(47) Kim said she would not be eating spinach, and a. *[be eating spinach] she will not\\t. b. *[not be eating spinach] she will\\t. The fronted VP is headed by the aspectual head, the progressive be. This violates the condition on the assumed vp-filler-ph. 5 Conclusion The overall organization of the phrasal types we have posited and reviewed is sketched in (48). (48) [ aux-head-phi AUX + negation-ph ellipsis-ph vp-filler-ph 280 Since each subtype inherits the constraints of its supertypes, we could minimize the constraints declared upon each subtype. This type inheritance mechansim allows us to avoid stating redundant information and to capture cross-classifying generalizations among constructions while at the same time accommodating the idiosyncratic properties of individual constructions.","This theory of grammar which uses grammatical constructions and posits a rich network of inheritance relations among them gives us a clean analysis for some of the puzzling phenomena in English such as negation, VP ellipsis, and VP fronting. It has been a common practice that the English negation phenomena is idiosyncratic in terms of its distributional properties. This has lead to adopt a English particular rule like do-support or introduce functional projections such as NegP (cf. Pollock 1989) together with empty categories. The construction, constraint-based analysis presented in this paper makes it unnecessary to resort to such abstract machinery and eventually enables us to find new levels of generalizations within the English auxiliary system that has often been regarded as a storehouse of peculiarities.
