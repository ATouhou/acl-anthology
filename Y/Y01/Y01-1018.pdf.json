I will argue that the Japanese shortenings take place when a metrically unstable binary foot (extrametrical foot) becomes a stray mora so as to be accommodated into one of the two proposed surface ternary foot structures whereas Fijian Trochaic Shortening occurs when a metrically unstable mora (extrametrical mora) is obligatorily accommodated into the other proposed surface ternary foot structure. I will conclude that the distinct shortening phenomena observed in the two languages can be accounted for simply on the ground of parametrical differences."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Vowel shortening occurs generally in moraic trochee languages.

But for both cases, the word-final long vowel in an unaccented syllable tends to become short. On the other hand, Trochaic Shortening in Fijian is very different from the shortenings in Japanese since the long vowel in a stressed syllable shortens in Fijian.","In this paper, I will focus on the shortenings observed in recent loanwords in Japanese, as in (3) and (4) and on the trochaic shortening in Fijian. First, I will analyze accent patters of Japanese loanwords in (3) and (4) under Metrical Phonology and show that the right peripheral bimoraic foot is extrametrical. While the analysis predicts the correct accent position, the strictly binary foot parsing creates a stray mora between two bimoraic feet. In order to confirm how stray moras are organized to achieve surface exhaustivity, I have conducted a phonetic experiment. Based on the result of the experiment, I will propose two parametrically distinct cognitive surface ternary foot structures for the two languages and argue that Fijian and Japanese shortenings are triggered by two distinctive types of extrametricality\\tmora and foot extrametricality respectively."]},{"title":"2 Accent Patterns of Japanese Loanwords","paragraphs":["I will analyze accent patterns of Japanese loanwords in (3) and (4) and show that under a metrical approach, accent patterns will be accounted for in a principled way. I will begin with Halle and Vergnaud's (1987) exhaustivity condition. Halle and Vergnaud (1987) state that rules constructing constituents apply exhaustively over the entire string (Exhaustivity Condition). Exhaustivity may be satisfied by different types of operation. Kager (1993) argues that initial parsing feet and surface feet must be discussed at different levels. In other words, exhaustivity may be satisfied by parsing units into surface units and may be relaxed at the initial parsing level. When the strictly binary moraic feet are constructed at the initial parsing level, stray moras may occur. Therefore, I assume that while stray moras are allowed in Initial Foot Parsing (IFP), stray moras are adjoined in some way to achieve surface exhaustivity in Surface Foot Parsing (SFP). But one important question remains as to how exhaustivity should be achieved in SFP when there are stray moras. I will come back to this question later.","First, I will discuss Initial Foot Parsing (IFP), Strictly Binary Foot Parsing. Assuming that moras are organized into the strictly bimoraic trochee at the initial level, I will propose the following rules and constraints, as in (5).","(5) Rules and Constraints for Initial Foot Parsing (IFP)","a.

On the other hand, if there are stray moras, as in (6b) and (6d), they should be adjoined in some way to achieve surface exhaustivity in Surface Foot Parsing (SFP). Let us consider how stray moras are organized to 197","achieve surface exhaustivity in Japanese.

In order to determine how surface exhaustivity is achieved in the language, I have conducted a phonetic experiment."]},{"title":"3 Phonetic Experiment","paragraphs":["The nonsense words in (8) are used for this experiment. I designed these words for the following reasons. First, fricative consonants have a relatively long acoustic realization compared to short onset consonants, such as stops. Acoustically long onset segments such as fricatives cause large deviations from isochrony. Thus, I avoided using fricative consonants. Second, all the stray strings consist of a stop and a low vowel [a] (a stray mora, which is bold-faced). [a] is inherently longest among the vowels in Japanese (Han 1962). A relatively long stray mora may show more salient durational compensation for isochrony (if there is a tendency for isochrony) than a short stray mora, such as the high vowels [i] and [u]. The durations of two underlined strings (Fl & F2) in (8i) will be compared with their counterparts (F3 & F4) in (8ii) in the same position.","(8) Words for Experiment","Fl F2\\tF3 F4 a.

Furthermore, the words are designed to consist of the same CV in each foot. In addition, the high vowel [i], which is underlined as in (9), in each pair is in a devoicing environment. I assume that high vowels are prosodically very weak so that they are not allowed to be the head of a foot (Constraint).

The focus of this phonetic experiment is on the middle stray mora, which may possibly attach either to the preceding foot (F3), or the following foot (F4). My basic assumption is that the stray mora shortens whichever foot it attaches to. If F3 is shorter than F4 in duration, this would suggest that the stray mora attaches to F3. If F4 is shorter than F3 in duration, this would suggest that the stray mora attaches to F4. More specifically, if the ratio of F3 to Fl is smaller than that of F4 to F2, then this would suggest that the stray element l̀ca' is attached to the string F3 rather than the string F4 for the compensation for foot isochrony.","Six native speakers (A-F) of standard Tokyo Japanese were asked to utter 6 test pairs in (8) inserted in the phrase frame 'Icon° kanada to kara yonde kudasai' (Please read from this C̀anada' and \" .) at a natural tempo without unnatural pauses between words.

Based on the above result of the phonetic experiment, I conclude that in Japanese stray moras are incorporated under the preceding bimoraic foot at the surface level. Interestingly, in Fijian Schutz (1985) shows that stray moras are incorporated under the following bimoraic foot at the surface level. In 1985 Schutz uses neither the term stray mora nor the distinction between the initial foot and surface foot, but I interpret his representations as follows. A stray mora is incorporated under a following bimoraic foot at the surface foot level, as in (10-ii). The output forms of initial parsing are represented in (10-i).

Interestingly, they are very similar to syllable structures represented based on the x-bar theory (Inaba 1999), expanding the syllable internal structure proposed by Levin (1985). In Inaba's (1999) approach, the Japanese syllable is viewed as the maximal projection (N\") of the nucleus (N), and thus it becomes very clear that nucleus and coda as the complement are tied up together in a single unit (N') in English, and onset and nucleus as the complement in Japanese.
