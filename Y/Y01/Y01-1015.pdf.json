A restricted number of words frequently and regularly found within utterances structure the dialogues by marking certain significant locations. Furthermore, a variety of signals of monitoring and repairing in conversation are also analysed and discussed. This includes discourse particles, speech disfluency as well as their prosodic representation. In this paper, they are considered a kind of \"highlighting-means\" in spoken language, because their function is to strengthen the structuring of discourse as well as to emphasise important functions and positions within utterances in order to support the coordination and the communication between interlocutors in conversation. 1\\tIntroduction In the field of discourse analysis, many researchers such as Sacks, Schegloff and Jefferson (Sacks et al. 1974; Schegloff et al. 1977), Taylor and Cameron (Taylor & Cameron 1987), Hovy and Scott (Hovy & Scott 1991) and the others have extensively explored how conversation is organised. Various topics have been investigated, ranging from turn taking, self-corrections, functionality of discourse components, intention and information delivery to coherence and segmentation of spoken utterances. The methodology has also accordingly changed from commenting on fragments of conversations, to theoretical considerations based on more materials, then to statistical and computational modelling of conversation. Apparently, we have experienced the emerging interests and importance on the structure of spoken discourse.","Recently, Clark and Brennan (Clark & Brennan 1991) proposed that production-related as well as perception-related activities have to be coordinated in conversation. They should serve the purpose of a speaker to get an addressee's attention, to plan and produce utterances, to recognise when the addressee does not understand, to initiate and manage repairs and to display or acknowledge understanding. Since interlocutors in conversation usually communicate freely and spontaneously, utterances may be interrupted without being completed and turn taking may take place unpredictably. Besides, there can be erroneous or unknown words and phrases, when speakers are not able to express their thoughts properly or when they spontaneously create new words or compound words for their thoughts. While monitoring and correcting their speech, speakers make repairs and they may need time for re-planning and editing their speech. Discourse particles and pauses (silent or filled) are often used for this purpose. Especially discourse particles are usually located in related positions in a given 163 discourse. They may possibly signal turn-initial positions or they may express special pragmatic functions such as surprise or hesitation.","With regard to the internal structure of utterances, speech disfluency no doubt results in serious problems for natural language processing systems. But, not for humans! Why? One of the reasons could be that speakers of a common language share similar knowledge and competence on how to express emotion pragmatically and how to perform monitoring and repairing in a reasonable way, whenever there is a need. Therefore, the communication partners can easily decode the meaning and the function of speech disfluency in conversation, because they would encode it by using similar sequence combinations. Moreover, speech disfluency also contributes to the segmentation of discourse by pointing out problematic speech sequences.","In the production of speech, all of the phenomena mentioned above are at the same time accompanied by prosody. No doubt, prosody is the most powerful highlighting means in spoken language. A grammatically ill-formed sentence may just sound like a perfectly correct sentence, when it is produced with a professional and fluent intonation. However, it is not the intention of interlocutors in conversation to impress each other in this way. In contrast, the speaker would rather let the addressee know that he/she made a mistake previously and what he/she is now saying is correct. Thus, it is very likely that discourse particles and speech disfluency are highlighted by prosodic means to emphasise the semantic and syntactic inadequacy.","This paper mainly deals with means emphasising particular speech sequences and four possibilities of observing these activities are 1) frequently used words, 2) discourse particles and markers, 3) speech disfluency and 4) prosodic marking. In the coming sections, they will be investigated on the basis of results of a corpus analysis. Before the results are presented, speech data used for the analyses are introduced first. 2\\tChinese Spoken Dialogues Three dialogues from Taiwan Putonghua Corpus (TWPTH) have been analysed. Putonghua refers to Mandarin. All subjects were born in Taiwan and their first language is Taiwanese. In other words, this set of data is on Taiwanese accented Mandarin. The subjects were given the instruction to talk on any topic they wanted to. The data obtained are therefore to a great extent spontaneous and natural. Each dialogue is about 20 minutes long. Major topics in the dialogues are family, work and study, although the communication partners in dialogues did not stick to a specific topic all the time. Detailed information about the dialogues is summarised in Table 1 including the gender of the subjects and the number of turns, words and characters found in the dialogues. We used the transcripts of the speech data with syntactic annotations specifically defined for this analysis.

The reason is that utterance boundaries in spoken discourse are difficult to determine. In most of the cases, the initial and the final locations of utterances are not clearly indicated as those of sentences in written texts. Gross et al. and Traum and Heeman have recently suggested various principles of determining utterance boundaries (Gross et al. 1993, Traum & Heeman 1997). Nevertheless, they need further elaborations. Utterances are ambiguous. But turns are relatively simple to recognise. Besides, segmenting the dialogues into turns completely serve the purpose of this study.","Next, the dialogues have been tagged using the tagging system designed for the Academia Sinica Balanced Corpus (hereafter Sinica Corpus) (tag set cf. Chen et al. 1996, OUP 1995). It should be noted that the majority of the Sinica Corpus data are written texts and the tags have been developed restrictively for well-formed written sentences. Hence we added extra-tags for ill-formed sequences and spontaneous speech phenomena. They are for instance pauses (pause), unidentifiable sounds (NSS), speech errors (POS-se), partial or full speech repetitions (POS-pr and POS-fr, respectively) and discourse particles (DP), where POS stands for the part of speech tags defined for the Sinica Corpus. For instance, the utterance segment CI- A. Ti k\\tif3t 44 IX At L 4 11 ft l has been tagged as in Example 1.","Example 1:\\tM (Cbb)\\t 67(D-pr)\\tTwi","\\t/I, -T--(Na)\\t(DE) 41 4(Na) su6 yi \\t","XI dr\\tjiu er jiii zhi\\txiao hal zi\\tde\\tmó shi","V.(D) f(D) L(P) 4 4 (Nh)\\t— (VH)","jiu\\thui\\t","gen\\tNW> men\\tyi yang (dialogue-01) 3\\tDiscourse Particles: Type and Position Discourse markers usually include particles such as \"oh\", \"well\", \"now\" and \"then\" and connectives such as \"so\", \"because\", \"and\", \"but\" and \"or\" in English (Schiffrin 1987). These can also be called cue phrases, cue words, or discourse particles in general (Hirschberg & Litman 1993). Since there is no consistent definition for distinguishing discourse particles and discourse markers in the literature, a primitive distinction is proposed in this paper. Discourse particles express particular pragmatic indications such as doubt or anger. They verbalise emotion, give listeners time to process problematic utterances, but they do not have lexicalised meaning in lexicon. As typically accepted in the literature, discourse particles are only used in a pragmatic way without having any syntactic or lexical participation in the discourse. On the other hand, discourse markers can be lexical items listed in a lexicon such as verbs, nouns and connectives. But when used in spoken language, they may have similar functions as discourse particles. They mark special locations in utterances and they stress particular speaker intentions in discourse as discourse particles usually do.

Two groups of words are under consideration. They are the typical discourse particles and determiners/adverbials having similar pragmatic function as discourse particles. As illustrated in Table 2, 23 typical and different discourse particles were found in the dialogues. On average, every turn contains at least one discourse particle. More than ten discourse particles were produced in all three dialogues with high frequency. This result clearly supports the notion that speakers of a common language tend to use similar particles for similar purposes and they all use them very frequently. Across all three dialogues, given a specific discourse particle, the sentential position where it is located is usually the same. In other words, there is a regular mapping between the types of discourse particles and the positions where they are to be found. The following examples should illustrate the phenomenon. (ma) is normally utterance-final, whereas PS (en) is more likely to be found in the utterance-initial position.","Example 2: IgF na\\twO (dialogue-0 1 )","*Pt *","dr qie\\tshi\\tbi jiao xin","(dialogue-02)","4.41A","\\t","#.!3.","you\\tzhe ge yi si\\tshi","(dialogue-03)","—xt 1,• xinxian yi clan ni\\tzai 1;1 a\\tni\\tke yi\\tzi ji"]},{"title":"Or","paragraphs":["s"]},{"title":"T","paragraphs":["xiangxia\\tma lit 4 xue","\\t ma,"]},{"title":"it*","paragraphs":[",g^ \\t"]},{"title":"t","paragraphs":["xiang\\tzhe ge dio\\t yin wei to\\tba sui du shii ma Example 3:\\tTS 'J'\\t"]},{"title":"k\\t4\\tif","paragraphs":["1*. en en\\txito han jib zi ji\\tde\\tou\\txing wei T"]},{"title":"Z","paragraphs":["\\t"]},{"title":"ft","paragraphs":["en en\\tdui\\ten\\tni\\t","ni 7\\t–I-4'F","he\\tchi' le\\tgong zue\\t jiu shi Rit\\tIS+ Wi-","en\\tna\\tb6 shi\\tb6 shi\\t","na ̂ff,k\\tAst hai shi gen\\tyi ban ren\\tyi yang (dialogue-03) a5 \\tit"]},{"title":"*4","paragraphs":["mei bin fa\\tkong zhi","ou\\tna yi xie\\t de (dialogue-01) 1 \\t RP","'ding\\two\\t lai dio zhe bian\\tna, s_fg \\tsit 6 gong zu6","\\t la (dialogue-02) jin qu\\tdeng ji jiu\\tbi jiao gao\\tma ou\\thao xiang 4? .•","Determiners/adverbials\\t(na), EE 11(na ge), RPM- (na me), Nis* (na yang), it (zhe), (zhe ge),"]},{"title":"(zhe","paragraphs":["me) and"]},{"title":"OA","paragraphs":["(zhe yang) 8 , serving similar pragmatic purposes as discourse particles, have been investigated, too.

In this section, we look at frequently used words in discourse to identify words highlighting important positions within utterances.

We have listed all turn-initial words with word frequency ranking. The ten most frequently used turn-initial words are given in Table 3, in terms of our six subjects respectively. It shows a clear group pattern of word types. Astonishingly, among the most frequently used turn-initial words, all six speakers have preferred It (en), !I (ai), If (dui) and * (ou). gis (na) and (NO) were also preferably used by five speakers. It seems that the syntactic positions of these words are related to particular pragmatic purposes. Chui (Chui 2000) interestingly discussed the case of 1,1 (dui) in conversation with regard to the ritualization of its pragmatic functions.

In other words, these 12 words highlight the beginning of more than 40% of turns in our data. This is an amazing result. However, this does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the detection of these words means the detection of turn beginning, because in addition to turn-initial positions, these words are also quite frequently used in other sentential positions. We need to carry out further normalisation analyses to see if the occurrences of these words are in fact more frequent in the turn-initial positions than elsewhere in discourse. Besides, it would be interesting to see if turn-initial markers are also to be frequently found in utterance-initial positions. This is not dealt with in this paper. If this turns out to be true, it would help us execute the segmentation of spoken discourse to a great extent."]},{"title":"5\\tChinese Speech Disfluency","paragraphs":["More and more researchers have started to work on Chinese repairs regarding the organization of conversation and the natural language processing (Chuff 1996, Lee & Chen 1997).

These are ,St (ai), .14T (a), or (he), (e), (ou), (ne), val (hei) and teit (la). It makes up 7.2 % of the overall speech repairs. Both Labov (Labov 1966) and Hindle (Hindle 1983) approve the edit signal hypothesis: speech disfluency, \"non-fluency\" as called by them, is usually accompanied by editing terms. Editing terms functionally signal the location of speech repairs. But this empirical result on Mandarin Chinese data does not seem to support the edit signal hypothesis.","It is also to be noted that some discourse particles are specifically used under certain circumstances, i.e. they appear only in particular positions within utterances.

They make up 37.7% and 41.2% of the total speech repairs, respectively. The most likely position for the Chinese speech repairs to be initiated is the phrasal boundary, where the second most likely position is the morpheme with the central semantic content of the problem word involved.","This clearly shows an important relationship between spoken utterances and syntax. To be more specific, syntactic features play a role for the speakers to process the organization of their speech. When they have to interrupt their utterances or to resume their speech, they prefer certain syntactic locations.

A limited number of discourse particles and words were found in regular utterance positions (utterance-initial, mid-utterance and utterance-final; turn-initial) to highlight the particularity of the internal structure of utterances and dialogues. The interaction between syntax and pragmatics with respect to these phenomena needs to be further examined. Currently, statistical analyses on the prosodic representation of discourse particles and speech repairs are in progress.
