Evidence supporting their functional status includes properties of classifiers in forming their own word class distinct from the category of nouns, their non-modificational property by adjectives, and multiple occurrences. The underlying structure of Thai nominals is constructed in terms of the DP analysis. To derive a Thai nominal word order, it is argued that classifiers features are strong and there exist a combination of raising operations regulated by asymmetrical c-command relation (Kayne 1994) as well as feature checking (Chomsky 1995).

Distribution of Classifiers in Thai","paragraphs":["I will briefly describe the positions which classifiers appear in simple and complex Thai nominals. It is noteworthy that the nominals being investigated here are restricted to non-abstract nouns (animate and inanimate alike). Nominals of this type were selected since they are commonly extended with numerals, adjectives, and demonstratives.' 2.1 Simple Nominals The use of classifiers is obligatory when a noun is accompanied by a numeral as shown in 2a) and its ungrammatical counterpart in 2b). 2","2a) n6k slam tua bird three clf \"three birds\"","2b) *nizik scam","bird three","The use of classifiers is optional when a noun is accompanied by an adjective or a demonstrative. However, if the noun refers to a specific object, a classifier must be present. By specificity, I refer to singularity and contrast in the presence of adjectives and emphasis in the presence of demonstratives.3 Thus when 'bird' is extended by 'little', [Ws] is obligatory if specificity is involved as in 3b), and omissible if it is not involved, as in 3a).","3a) nOlc lek bird little \"little birds\"","3b) n6k tua bird clf little \"a little bird\"","3a) refers to unspecified little birds while 3b) implies singularity and conveys a contrastive value of the adjective 'little', meaning a 'typical little bird' (distinct from a 'typical big bird').4 1 Classifiers do occur with abstract nouns (termed \"immaterial concepts\" by Hundius and KOlver 1983), e.g. [kham] for words and [khraqj for events. Although I do not discuss the structure of abstract nouns, I assume that the analysis ensued for non-abstract nouns will carry over to them as well. 2 Obligatory presence of classifiers in quantified nominals is common across Southeast Asian and South Chinese languages. According to Jones (1970), these languages fall into two large groups with respect to surface word order of quantified nominals: numeral-classifier-noun and noun-numeral-classifier. The former, which has the widest geographical distribution, includes Chinese and Vietnamese, and the latter Thai and Burmese. 3 Specificity here may be considered along the same line with \"preciseness of Speech\" in Haas (1942), \"emphasis\" in Hundius and KOlver (1983), and \"particularized speech\" in Hudak (1990). 4 It is important to note that Thai has no lexical determiners to express definite! indefiniteness. Presumably Thai has at least two strategies to convey definiteness: by using a restrictive relative clause or a demonstrative. Without extending the noun by such strategies, I prefer 3b) as having the indefinite reading. 260","When only the demonstrative is present as in 4a) and 4b), the reading with the classifier differs slightly from the one without the classifier, the difference being in the degree of specificity.","4a) nOk nii bird this \"this bird\"","4b) nok tua nil bird clf this \"this very bird\"","In 4b) the presence of the classifier creates a higher degree of emphasis by singling out a bird from among the group.","From 2) to 4), the position of a classifier in relation to a numeral differs from the position of a classifier in relation to an adjective and a demonstrative, i.e. it follows the numeral but precedes the adjective and the demonstrative. 2.2 Complex Nominals A number of complex nominal constructions can be made in which numerals, adjectives, and demonstratives are combined as in 5) to 7) below. Notice that the demonstrative is always in the final","5","5) nedc tua lek tua nan (noun-clf-adj-clf-dem) bird clf little clf that \"that little bird\"","6) n6k tua lek scam tua (noun-clf-adj-num-clf) bird elf little three clf \"three little birds\"","7) nOlc tua lek slam tua nan (noun-clf-adj-num-clf-dem) bird clf little three clf that \"those three little birds\" In 5) and 7), the classifier [tua] occurs twice; it precedes the adjective and the demonstrative. In 6) where no demonstrative occurs, it precedes the adjective and follows the numeral. This pattern illustrates a unique characteristic of Thai classifiers, i.e. multiple occurences. This phenomenon seems to be peculiar to Thai, compared to other classifier languages in Southeast Asia and South China.6 5 According to Hundius and Kälver (1983), a demonstrative necessarily marks the end of an NP so that no further modification can follow to interfere with the numerical interpretation of the classifier. 6 In Amoy Chinese (Hokkean) multiple occurrences of classifiers (as observed in Jones 1970) appear only when nouns are extended by two adjectives--b̀ig' and 'little', e.g. [hit sa nui Ufa nui pè? hue], literally \"those-three-clf-big-clf-white-flower\". Jones suggests that the multiple classifier pattern of Amoy Chinese, which is restricted to only two adjectives, was adopted and generalized in Thai. position. 261"]},{"title":"3.

From a historical perspective, classifiers broke up nouns into categories by certain criteria, e.g. shape, function, and the making of objects. Presently, however, with incessantly innovated objects, classifiers seem to be chosen arbitrarily rather than to classify nouns into categories as originally presumed.","In addition to the early classifying status, they belong to a closed-class category in which the number is fixed. Thai classifiers total approximately eighty (McFarland 1942; Haas 1964), and around forty of them are in everyday use (Carpenter 1991). Thus, when new nouns are created, no new classifiers can be created for them. The alternatives are either to extend the use of available classifiers to which the new objects can be assigned or to use repeaters which are nouns that function as their own classifiers."]},{"title":"3.2 Syntactic Accounts","paragraphs":["I will now discuss two main characteristics which qualify classifiers as functional distinct from nouns, i.e. non-modificational property with adjectives, and multiple occurrences. 262"]},{"title":"3.2.1 Non-modificational Property with Adjectives","paragraphs":["To distinguish classifiers from nouns, I will assume Hundius and KOlver's (1983) diagnostic test in which measure words and classifiers are differentiated According to them, the difference between classifiers and measure words (assumed as nouns due to their independent occurences) is that the former cannot be modified by adjectives while the latter can as shown in 3b) repeated as 8a), and 8b) below.","8a) mik tua lek bird clf little \"a little bird\"","8b) nOlc Mug lek bird swarm little \"a little swarm of birds\"","In 8a) the adjective [lek] modifies [nOlc], the head noun, not the classifier [tua] while in 8b) it modifies [MR], the measure word.

Therefore, the 7 This example was suggested by Carme Picallo, p.c. 263 Thai facts regarding multiple occurrences of classifiers and restrictions on the use of them suggest that they regulate agreement relationships on a par with gender in Romance nominals.","So far I have discussed the functional category status of Thai classifiers from two perspectives. Conceptually, they form a separate word class, have a lexical relationship with count nouns by classifying nouns into categories, and are closed-class items.

I propose that a Classifier Phrase (ClassP) projects in the structure of Thai nominals. Next, I will show the underlying structure of complex Thai nominals and offer my analysis."]},{"title":"4. Analysis","paragraphs":["This section begins with a previous analysis of Chinese DP proposed by Tang (1990), in which classifiers and numerals are claimed to coexist as dual heads in the same phrasal category, Klassifier Phrase. Then I propose my own analysis which consists of two subparts: an underlying structure of Thai nominals, and movement operations to derive the surface word order. 4.1 Tang's Analysis on the Chinese DP Tang (1990) proposes Klassifier Phrase, KP, as a functional category to account for the occurrence of classifiers in Chinese noun phrases. According to Tang, the Chinese noun phrase consists of two functional projections dominating one lexical projection, namely, DP, KP, and NP. Tang's proposed underlying structure is shown in 13) with a Chinese example. 13)\\tDP D' \\t D\\tKP na \\t \"those\"\\tK' K\\tNP Num\\tCL\\tN' son\\tben ,v","\"three\"\\t\"clf' N","shu","\"book\"","The head of KP in 13) contains numeral and classifier features. Tang claims that these two features are entered into the head parallel to the way Tense and Agr are contained in the head INFL, according to Chomsky (1986). Further, under K, both Num and CL must be lexically realized. The word order [na san-ben shu] meaning \"those three books\" and the underlying representation correspond to each other. She points out that the head noun must agree with the classifier in a manner analogous to the agreement relationship between the Infl and the V in sentences. 264","Apparently, the linear order of Thai nominals containing a numeral may be derived if it is to be worked out with the structure in 13), assuming that there is some motivation for the raising of the NP to the specifier of KP (and perhaps subsequent movement of KP to the specifier of DP). However, such an analysis is immediately problematic in two respects. Firstly, considering the characteristics of quantifiers and classifiers, they are by no means related to each other. Classifiers are dependent on the lexical content of nouns because certain classifiers are used consistently with certain categories of nouns while quantifiers are not; they occur freely with any nouns. Putting them together in the same head implies that quantifiers and classifiers are dependent features, which is contrary to the facts.","Secondly, Tang's schematic tree provides only one position for classifiers, a consequence of dual headedness. The possibility of classifiers occurring more than once as found in Thai cannot be accommodated under this structure. Therefore, Tang's analysis cannot be extended to the Thai case. In my analysis I will propose an underlying structure which allows for multiple occurrences of classifiers by separating classifiers and numerals into two independent functional categories, namely ClassP and QP. I will also attempt to extend my analysis to account for the word order of simple Chinese nominals such as 13) above with the underlying structure proposed for Thai nominals. 4.2 The Underlying Structure of Thai Nominals The underlying structure of nominal phrases is constructed in terms of the DP analysis. The Thai DP structure consists of three functional categories and one lexical category, namely, Determiner, Classifier, Quantifier, and Noun Phrases. This structure is represented schematically as [DP [ClassP3 [QP[ClassP2[ClassPl[NP]]]M","I follow Szabolcsi (1983), Hellan (1986) and Abney (1987) in positing DP as a functional category required in nominal phrase structures. Although Case is not phonetically realized in Thai, I follow the standard assumption that nominal arguments universally have Case. Therefore, D in Thai nominal structures contains abstract case. For referentiality in DP, I follow Longobardi (1994) in positing D as having referential interpretation. 8 I assume that demonstratives in Thai, by virtue of containing a referential feature, are located in D. For QP, I adopt Lobel's (1989) analysis for QP being inside DP and follow the standard assumption that quantifiers extend the set denoted by nouns. ClassP is claimed to project due to the functional status of classifiers as previously argued. For AP, I locate adjectives in the specifier of ClassP2 above NP (see 15b below). I adopt Cinque's (1994) proposal that APs are base-generated in specifier positions of a number of functional projections due to a restricted hierarchical structure of adjectives, to which Thai corresponds. 4.3 Derivation of the Thai Surface Word Order As an overall theoretical background of the analysis, in 4.3.1 I will briefly explain Kayne's restrictive theory of word order, the theoretical framework I am adopting. Additionally, in 4.3.2, I will provide motivation from minimalist perspectives which I incorporate in the analysis to derive the desired word order. In 4.3.3, I will show an underlying structure of complex Thai nominals. It accounts for nominals containing one attributive adjective, one quantifier and one demonstrative. This underlying structure is posited to derive the order where classifiers occur in certain positions of a DP. Then I will present the derivation from the underlying structure to the linear order. 4.3.1 Kayne's (1994) Hypothesis In Kayne's restrictive theory of word order, asymmetrical c-command relations play a key role in the 8 Case and referentiality have different statuses under the Minimalist framework (Chomsky 1995). Case is a formal, noninterpretable feature whereas referentiality is an interpretable feature. As an interpretable feature, it does not trigger movement. 265 sequence of linear word order. A terminal element a precedes a terminal element b iff a asymmetrically c-commands b. Kayne raises a time-slot metaphor to illustrate how asymmetric c-command relations derive the linear word order. He associates a string of terminals with a string of time slots and claims that what is paired with each time slot is not simply the corresponding terminal but the substring of terminals. Thus, a string of terminals \"abcdz\" is mapped to a set of substrings \"a, ab, abc, abcd, abcdz.\" In this way, a precedes every terminal in every substring since a figures in every substring. Like b follows a since b follows a in every substring and b precedes c in every substring that e shows up. The remaining elements proceed in the same pattern.","To work out this hypothesis, take a string of a simple English declarative in 14) as an example.","14) I saw John.","Let's assume that 'I' occupies the specifier of LP; therefore, the string of terminals in 14) corresponds to the substrings, [I], [I saw], and [I saw John]. Thus, 'I' precedes every terminal in every substring. 'Saw' follows 'I' since it follows 'I' in every substring, and 'saw' precedes 'John' in the substring that 'John' shows up. In this regard, the linear word order in 14) derives from a hierarchical structure of a number of substrings which are regulated by asymmetrical c-command relation. This concept plays a crucial role in the derivation of the Thai surface word order.","Another technical requirement utilized in my analysis is Kayne's idea to restrict c-command to categories, and not segments. In this framework, a category XP can be extended to a two segment XP. Thus when a category raises past a segment (assumed as a bar level in X' theory) into the specifier of a higher segment (of the same category), the raising is licensed. The resulting trace is antecedent governed by the moved element; the intervening segment is not a category, hence not a barrier for the c-commanding relation. 4.3.2 Feature Checking I adopt Chomsky's (1995) hypotheses of feature checking and overt movement. According to these hypotheses, strong features must be checked overtly at PF and weak features are preferably checked at LF. All features of functional categories are typically uninterpretable. Uninterpretable features can be strong or weak. Strong features attract overt movement whereas weak features attract covert movement. I propose that classifier features are strong in Thai. It is crucial that they are strong so that they can attract movement of lexical items which contain corresponding features to be checked off overtly. Strictly speaking, classifier features attract NP and massive pied-piping of elements from below to check features against them. The raising operations take place before phonological Spell-Out and account for the word order. 266 4.3.3 Derivation of the Word Order In the derivation of the surface word order of Thai nominals such as 7) repeated as 15a), I assume 15b) as the underlying structure. For ease of exposition, the bar levels in X' notations are used instead of XPs as segments of categories in Kayne's (1994) system. I propose the layered projections of ClassP (ClassP1 and ClassP2) above NP to regulate movement operations and to accommodate adjunction to specifiers of adjectives. 15a) nOk tua lek saam tua nan bird clf little three clf that/those \"those three little birds\" 15b) DP D' D\\tClassP3 n6n Class' \\t","1 Class \\tQP tua"]},{"title":"Q'","paragraphs":["Q \\tClassP2 s'iam AP\\tClass' A' Class\\tC1assP1","/\\\\t(null)","Class'A Class\\tNP tua N' N 7Nn nOk The following steps will derive the surface word order. Step 1. NP raises into the specifier of ClassP l. . In the spec/head relation configuration, NP checks its classifier feature with the classifier head. The trace of NP is asymmetrically c-commanded by its antecedent. ClassP1 and Class' are segments, not categories, so they are not barriers for a c-commanding relation. The order derived from this step is \"nOk tua\". 267 Step 2. ClassP 1 , as a category, raises to left-adjoin to the specifier of ClassP2 where AP is base generated. Here the layered ClassP2 is needed for generating AP. The resulting order is \"nek tua lek\". At this step, the movement is driven by the need of a category to establish a semantically meaningful syntactic configuration (parallel to Barbiers' (1995) proposal regarding the syntactic and semantic relationship between adverbial modifiers of VP and the modified VP). 9 The trace of ClassPl is asymmetrically c-commanded by its antecedent. Since AP is an adjunction and ClassP2 and Class' are segments of the same category, they do not create barriers for the c-commanding relation. Step 3. Class P2 raises into the specifier of QP. At this step, the raising of ClassP2 including its pied-piping elements is constrained by the shortest move condition and forced by the need of the massive phrases to get finally to the specifier of DP. The order is \"nOlc tua lek Step 4. QP raises into the specifier of ClassP3; here QP checks its classifier feature with the head of ClassP3 in a Spec/head configuration. The order is \"n6k tua lek scam tua\". Step 5. ClassP3 raises into the specifier of DP. At this step ClassP3 checks its Case and referential features with the determiner head. The order is \"nOlc tua lek scam tua nan\". 4.3.4 Notes on Chinese Nominals I will attempt to extend my analysis to account for the surface word order of simple nominals in Mandarin Chinese such as 13) ǹa san-ben shu', literally 'those three clf books\", in Tang's (1990) example. For ease of exposition, I will utilize a relatively more simplified structure than the Thai counterpart. Setting aside ClassP2 and ClassP3 (which can be assumed not to project in the sense of Minimalist structure-building approach), the underlying structure of 13) consists of NP, ClassP, QP and DP in hierarchical order. From bottom-up, shu' is base-generated in N, 'ben' in Class, 'sari' in Q, and ǹa' in D. Given the word order fact (in which elements are readily configured in asymmetrical c-command relation), presumably classifier features in Chinese are weak. As a consequence, no overt movement occurs before Spell-Out (Chomsky 1995: chapter 3). After Spell-Out, since classifier features are morphological, they need to be checked for convergence at the interface of PF and LF. Therefore, NP raises into the specifier of ClassP to have its classifier feature checked against that in the classifier head. Subsequent movement to higher functional projections can be argued to occur (covertly) parallel to the Thai case. By holding constant a uniformed underlying structure, perhaps word order differences between Thai and Chinese nominals could be reduced to movement and non-movement due to strength and weakness of classifier features. 9 Barbiers (1995) proposes that such adverbial modifiers are left-adjoined to VP, and that the lower segment of the VP raises into the specifier position of the adverbial modifier in the course of derivation. By adopting Barbiers (1995) proposal, I assume that not all movement is driven by the need to check morphosyntactic features (i.e. classifier features). In this particular case, AP is a lexical category; as a result, no feature checking can take place in its domain under minimalism.","Alternatively, there is a possibility suggested by Cinque (p.c.) to derive the order of \"noun-cif-adjective\". There is a non-descript category XP on top of ClassP2 (which hosts the AP in its specifier). ClassP1 raises across ClassP2 into SpecXP. The rest of the derivation takes this XP, and not ClassP2, to undergo raising to SpecQP in step 3. Under minimalism, this approach is legitimate assuming that there will be some feature in X which attracts ClassP 1. However, from the perspective of the 'attract' theory of movement, this alternative raises a question as to why ClassP1 raises to SpecXP instead of the closer ClassP2. 268"]},{"title":"5. Conclusion","paragraphs":["In this paper, I claimed that Thai classifiers have a functional status and project ClassP. Conceptually, classifiers are fixed in number, form their own word class, and have a categorical relationship with count nouns. Syntactically, they are not modified by adjectives and behave like agreement constructs such as gender in Romance nominals.","I investigated the word order of complex Thai nominals and hypothesized that the linear word order of Thai nominals is dependent on a hierarchical underlying structure following Kayne's restrictive theory of word order (1994). This phrasal underlying representation was constructed in terms of the DP analysis. It consists of a number of functional and lexical categories, namely, Determiner, Quantifier, Classifier, Adjective, and Noun Phrases.","In my analysis, I employed massive pied-piping of elements to specifiers enabled by asymmetrical c-command relation (Kayne 1994), and incorporated overt feature checking (Chomsky 1995). I also attempted to extend my analysis to account for simple Chinese nominals. I suggested that by assuming a common underlying structure, differences in word order of Thai and Chinese nominals may actually involve strength and weakness of classifier features.","I argue for a head initial structure such as 15b) and massive leftward movement inside DP as shown in the five raising operational steps instead of a head-final structure where elements are base-generated exactly as they are in the surface form. Assuming uniformity in phrase structure whereby superficial differences are attributed to movement, the DP analysis presented here is conceptually and empirically superior to the head final analysis."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["I wish to thank Elena Rudnitskaya, Carme Picallo, Richard Kayne, Guglielmo Cinque, and Marcel den Dikken.
