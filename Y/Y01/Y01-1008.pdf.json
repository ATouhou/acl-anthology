Examples of the expressions traditionally counted as Japanese negative polarity items are: kessite ('ever'), nannimo ('anything'), daremo (ànyone'), dokomo (ànywhere'), tittomo (ǹot at all'), and sika ('only') (Ikeya and Kawamori (1998))1.","These items have conventionally been treated as belonging to one category, namely that of NPI, and explained in terms of same conceptual apparatuses. We will show, however, that these items do not constitute a monolithic, single category, but rather are to be grouped into two distinct categories – one comprising sika, the other composed of other NPIs.","We specifically show that Japanese NPIs other than sika is like negative phrases in negative concord sentences in such languages as non-standard English and Romance languages. We also show that sika is unlike other NPI items in several important respects. A feature-based account for syntax-semantics interface sika is presented that attempts to account for these points. 1.1 Properties of sika In this subsecion, we focus on sika and review the properties that make it linguistically interesting, thus presenting what motivates this kind of study in the first place. There are several properties that make sika especially interesting.","Association with Negative Sika is always to be associated with overtly negative particles like -nai or -nu, -zu, -mai, and a negative-like adjective dame. We call this property of sika, in particular, and NPI in general, as association with negative, or AWN, for short. We think of AWN as a syntactic property. We will leave open exactly how this àssociation' is to be defined, since it is not immediately quite relevant to our present purpose. We only suggest, however, that it is most likely that this association is to be realized as a certain kind of 'command' relation on syntactic representation. This property, in fact, is the reason why these items are called 'negative polarity' in the first place, but we use AWN to make this particular property more salient and unambiguous. There can be two types of items with AWN; one is the type that weakly requires negation to occur with it, or weak AWN, while the other type is that which strictly requires a negative element, or strict AWN. A weak AWN can omit the negative particle when the context allows it; a strict AWN must always have an associated negative particle. sika always comes before the negative particle and the negative particle cannot be ommitted; it has to be always overt. This is striking when one compares sika with other NPIs in Japanese. In the following example dialogues, the first three show that such NPIs as tittomo, dokomo, and daremo can occur without a negative particle and still have their NPI senses. The last example shows that it is not the case with sika. In the following the notation HY. indicates that the sentence is realized with a rising intonation.","(1) A:Paateii omosirok-atta (H%) B:Tittomo A: party fun-PAST\\tB: At-all A: 'Was the party fun?' B: 'Not at all.'","1 Note that we use the phonemic romanization of Japanese scripts, so-called Kunrei-siki, according to which those sounds typically represented in English as shi and chi are written si and ti, respectively. 85 (2) A:Dokoka\\titta"]},{"title":"(n)","paragraphs":["B:Dokomo A: Somewhere go-PAST B: (Not) Anywhere A: Did go anywhere? B: Nowhere.","(3) A:Dareka kita (H%)\\tB:Daremo A:Someone corn-PAST B: (Not) anyone A: Has someone come? B: No one.","(4) A:Dareka\\tkita (11%)\\tB:*Taro-sika A:Someone come-PAST B: Taro-SIKA A: Has someone come? B: 'Only Taro'","Negation Cancelling Interpretation The interpretation of a sika sentence always implies the logical contrary of its sika-less counterpart. The sika-sentence (5) logically implies sentence (7), which is the logical contrary of (6), the sika-less form of (5).","(5) taroo-sika gohan-o tabe-nai Taroo-SIKA rice-OBJ eat-NEG Ǹobody but Taroo eats rice.'","(6) taroo-wa gohan-o tabe-nai Taroo-TOP rice-OBJ eat-NEG T̀aro° does not eat rice.'","(7) taroo-wa\\tgohan-o tabe-ru Taroo-TOP rice-OBJ eat-ASSERT T̀aro° eats rice.' This is in sharp contrast to other negative polarity items, such as kessite (èver') and nanimo (ànything'); sentence (8) and sentence (9) each imply (6).","(8) taroo-wa kessite gohan-o tabe-nai Taroo-TOP never rice-OBJ eat-NEG T̀aro° never eats rice.'","(9) taroo-wa nanimo tabe-nai Taroo-TOP anything eat-NEG T̀aro° eats nothing' We shall refer to this feature of as its negation cancelation property (NCP). Thus sika is similar to other NPIs in that it has AWN. Sika is different from other NPIs in that it has NCP. Notice that AWN is a syntactic property, whereas NCP is a semantic one.","Polymorphism sika can be used with any NP or PP. Thus in the following sentence sika is attached to sanzen ('three bowls'), a noun phrase representing quantity:","(10) taroo-wa san-zen-sika gohan-o tabe-nai Taroo-TOP one-bowl-SIKA rice-OBJ eat-NEG T̀aro° eats only three bowls of rice.' while in the following it is attached to iru-toki-ni (ẁhen she is around\"), a postpositional phrase:","(11) Hanako-ga iru-toki-ni-sika Taroo-wa utaw-anai Hanako-SUBJ be-when-AT-SIKA Taroo-TOP sing-NEG T̀aroo sings only when Hanako is around' Let us call this property polymorphism. 86"]},{"title":"Case-absorption","paragraphs":["sika, like wa can 'absorb' some case particles, like ga and o. Compare the following (12) with (6) above.","(12) taroo-wa gohan-sika tabe-nai Taroo-TOPIC rice-SIKA eat-NEG 'Taroo eats nothing but rice.' In both sentences, gohan (r̀ice') is the object of the verb Labe- (èat'). This fact is shown clearly in (6) above by the accusative case marker o, as in gohan-o. In (12), in which sika is attached, however, the accusative case marker is not explicitly expressed, but rather, so to speak, 'absorbed' by sika.We call this property case-absorption."]},{"title":"Unbounded association","paragraphs":["sika and the negative particle can be separated from each other by any number of constituents, as are demonstrated by the following examples; the sika constituent Taro-sika is separated from its corresponding negative constituent Labe-nai by no constituent (13), a noun phrase (14), and a complex noun phrase with a modifying clause (15).","(13) Taro-sika ringo-o tabe-nai Taro-SIKA apple-OBJ eat-NEG Ònly Taro eats an apple.'","(14) Taro-sika\\tookina-kemusi-no iru ringo-o\\ttabe-nai Taro-SIKA big-worm-be\\tapple-OBJ eat-NEG Ònly Taro eats an apple which a big worm is in'","(15) Taro-sika\\tkasikoi-tori-kara kakureta ookina-kemusi-no iru ringo-o \\ttabe-nai Taro-SIKA wise-bird-from hiding\\tbig-worm-be\\tapple-OBJ eat-NEG Ònly Taro eats an apple which a big worm that is hiding from a wise bird is in' In particular, sika construction can embed another sika construction, as can be seen in the following:","(16) Taro-sikal Ken-ga\\teigo-sika2\\tie-de\\thanas-anai2 koto-o\\tsir-anail Taro-SIKA Ken-SUBJ English-SIKA house-at speak-NEG fact-OBJ know-NEG Ònly Taro knows that Ken speaks only English at home' Taro-sika is interpreted as associated with sir-anai, hence the same superscript, while the internally embedded eigo-sika is interpreted as associated with hanas-anai.","These properties we have cited constitute a reasonable justification for the study on sika, for these properties are clearly nonn-trivial and possibly challenging, if not problematic, for theoretical linguistics, from conceptual as well as computational point of view. A theory of sika must at least account for some of these properties. We will in this paper focus on the first two properties, namely AWN and NCP."]},{"title":"2 Previous Studies In","paragraphs":["this section, we review the two most influential studies on sika hitherto presented, and show that they are not totally satisfactory.","Muraki (1978), one of the first serious attempts to tackle the problem of Japanese NPI in the framework of transformational-generative grammar, treated sika nai as a unit one-place predicate taking a complement sentence. To distribute sika and nai to appropriate positions Muraki must have recourse to such transformational operations as Predicate Raising, sika-nai Lowering, and Predicate Restructuring.","For example, sentence (17)","(17) John sika biiru o noma nai. John only beer Obj drink not Only John drinks beer. has the following derivational process. 87 a. [ John ga biiru o numu sika-nai b. John ga sika}biiru o [nomu nail c. John sika, biiru o nomanai.","Since Muraki treats sika sentence as invariably derived from a base form with sika-nai taking the whole sentence as a complement, in order to differentiate the sentence like (18) from (17),","(18) John ga biiru sika noma nai. John Nom beer SIKA drink not John drinks nothing but beer.","one has to have a means to associate the predicate sika-nai with the constituent where the sika will eventually land after the sika-nai lowering. This seems like a reverse problem of AWN, but it is essentially a semantic problem — the association would determine the interpretation of the whole sentence.","This shows that Muraki's account confuses two different issues — one semantic and the other syntactic — and seems to be a rather ad-hoc solution.","Another of the problems in Muraki's treatment is that in his framework such a simple sentence as","(19) John ni wa tairyoku sika nai. John\\tLOC\\tTOP physical strength SIKA not 'John has nothing but physical strength' cannot be generated since, again, Muraki treats sika-nai as a one-place predicate taking a sentence as an argument. Whatever the nature of such operations as sika-nai lowering and predicate-lowering, Muraki's theory has to account for some of the facts cited in the introduction, and it does not seem to be so successful in doing so. The theory of NPI presented in Kato (1985) can be roughly summarized as follows: 1. An NPI is licensed in a S-structure iff it is in a negative domain 2. A negative domain is c-commanded by NEG 3. It is closest to NEG and a is closest to f3 if is in the first potential licensing position. 4. An unlicensed NPI is illegitimate at LF.","5. At S-structure Japanese subjects are within a V's projection, while English subjects are Infl's projection.","The notion of c-command has two kinds of difficulties: one is that the configurational notion is so coarse that it must be restricted somehow; the other is that it is too restrictive to cover a relevant domain for an NPI. Thus in (20), NEG can c-command not only hon 'a book' but also kareno (his), otootono (brother's) and kareno otooto no (his brother's).","(20) [John wa [[kare-no otooto-no hon-o]\\t[ yom-anai.1] John Nom his\\tbrother's book-Obj read-not John does not read his brother's book.","Unless some restriction is imposed, we would have the following two ungrammatical sentences (21) and (22).","(21) *[John wa ] [[kare-no sika otooto-no hon-o]\\t[ yom-anai.]] John Nom his\\tonly brother's book-Obj read-not John does not read his brother's book.","(22) *[John wa [[kare-no otooto-no sika, hon-o]\\t[ yom-anai.1] John Nom his\\tbrother's only book-Obj read-not John does not read his brother's book.","As it is pointed out in Kato (1985), c-command will predict that a NEG in siranai can c-command both of the sika phrases in a sentence. Hence a wrong association of a sika phrase and NEG will result."]},{"title":"88","paragraphs":["(23) Taroo wa [Jiroo ga uisukii sika nom-anai kotoi sika sir-anai. Taroo-Top Jiroo-Nom whisky only drink-not fact only know-not Taroo knows nothing other than that Jiroo drinks nothing other than whisky.","As has been shown above, the previous studies on sika, though they are succesful to some extent in capturing the intuition regarding sika, are not entirely satisfactory. The most problematic aspects in those studies are the lack of clear conecptual demarcation of the two different categories — sika and other NPIs — and the lack of syntax-semantics interface, one of the consequences of the neglect of syntax-semnatics distinction."]},{"title":"3 Negative Concord","paragraphs":["Negative concord is a set of phenomena, found not only in non-standard English but also in such Romance languages as Italian and Catalan, in which negative expressions are used more than once to emphasize the negative interpretation. The following are examples from non-standard English, (24) and (25), and from Italian, (26).","(24) Nobody said nothing. Ǹobody said anything.'","(25) Maria didn't say nothing to nobody. M̀aria didn't say anything to anybody.'","(26) Mario non ha parlato di niente con nessuno Mario not has spoken about nothing with nobody 'Mario hasn't spoken with anyone about anything'","An important thing to note about negative concord is that, as can be seen from (24), the logical double negation reading does not exist. In order to state this fact more precisely, let us define the notation for polarity. 1. An atomic proposition A has the positive polarity; we show this as pol(A) = +, or A+.","2. Given a proposition co that has the positive polarity, namely co+ , its negation := has the negative polarity; we represent this as 1)01() = -, or","Using this notation, we can state the principle of double negation: Given a proposition with the negative polarity (p-, its negation //) := ---,co has the positive polarity, namely"]},{"title":"0+.","paragraphs":["This principle of double negation implies that\\tand co have the same polarity, and so do\\tand\\tIn other words, the polarity \"flip-flops\" depending on whether the number of negations is even or odd.","In a sentence with negative concord, this principle does not apply. This fact can be restated more formally in the following manner: Suppose a negative concord sentence a has the form (27) [,...\\tvm\\t.1, where each v2 , 1 < i < m, is a negatively marked NP. Suppose al , , am are some non-negatively marked NPs. The interpretation of the result of substituting a l ,\\t, am for vi in o will be represented as: (28)\\t• , Then a sentence with negative concord has the following property: (29) polUal) polela] %ad, • • • , Vern1)), regardless of m; it never flip-flops. 89 Notice that only one of the negatively-marked elements is the semantically potent negation, real negation, while the other negatively-marked NPs are interpreted as existentially quantified, NPI elements.","The properties of negative concord can be summarized thus:","NC1 negative concord is correlation between a negation expression and one or more negatively marked NPs. i.e. No affective context other than negation is involved.","NC2 only one of the more than two negatively marked elements is the 'real' negation; no logical double negation interpretation exists (or negation cancellation, in our terminology).","NC3 the non-p̀otent' elements in negative concord are interepreted as existentially quantified; in other words they are given NPI readings. 3.1 NPI and negative concord Since Japanese lacks negative determiners, negative concord, by definition, never occurs; Japanese has no lexical counterparts of negative NPs like 'nobody', 'nothing', etc. But Japanese NPIs show some similarity to negative concord.","Parallel to what has been observed about negative concord above, Japanese NPIs have the following properties:","JNPI1 Many Japanese NPIs are correlated with a negation expression. i. e. No affective context other than negation is involved. JNPI2 one negation can license more than two NPIs and there is no negation cancellation. JNPI3 the NPIs are interepreted as existentially quantified Observe that in (30), in which NPI daremo occurs, has a negative polariy.","(30) daremo tiketto-o\\tkaw-anak-atta anybody ticket-OBJ buy-NEG-PAST Ǹobody bought a ticket' In our polarity notation, this means (daremo(S))- where S stands for (the meaning of) tiketto-o kaw-anak-atta.","(31) daremo kessite tiketto-o\\tkaw-anak-atta anybody ever\\tticket-OBJ buy-NEG-PAST Ǹobody ever bought a ticket' In our polarity notation, this means (kessite(daremo(S)))-","(32) daremo kessite nanimo iw-anak-atta anybody ever\\tanything say-NEG-PAST Ǹobody ever said anything' Again, in our polarity notation, this means (nanimo(kessite(daremo(S))))- , whose logical interpretation can be rendered as --,(3x)(3y)(3z)[4)(x, y, z)], where (I)(a, b, c) stands for 'a says b at time c'. Notice that there is only one logical negation, whereas there are three existential quantifiers corresponding to the three NPIs daremo,kessite, and nanimo. These sentences together demonstrate that the properties JNPI2, JNPI3 are indeed possessed by Japanese NPIs.","In this respect, sika is quite different from other NPIs. sika cannot occur with another NPI noun phrase; for example, the following, where sika and NPI daremo occur, is ungrammatical:","(33) * daremo tiketto-sika kaw-anak-atta anybody ticket-SIK A buy-NEG-PAST Ǹobody bought only a ticket' Similarly for: 90","(34) *daremo kessite tiketto-sika kaw-anak-atta anybody ever\\tticket-SIKA buy-NEG-PAST Ǹobody ever bought only a ticket'","That the coocurrence of sika and an NPI is responsible for the ungrammaticality is made more salient by the following (34), whos only difference from the grammatical (32) is thatit has sika in place of o.","The following, on the other hand, in which positive polarity item daremo-ga occurs with sika, is grammatical.","(35) daremo-ga\\ttiketto-sika kaw-anak-atta anybody-SUBJ ticket-SIKA buy-NEG-PAST Èverybody bought only a ticket'","These examples show that sika cannot 'share' a negation; while other NPIs can, as can be seen from (30) through (32), share one negation. It should also be noted that sika construction can never be regarded as a case of negative concord because of NCP, namely the logical double negation.","The following emerge as tentative ovservation:","1. sika is 'greedy' with respect to negation; once sika is licensed by a negation, other NPIs cannot use the negation as the source of NPI licensing.","2. NPIs other than sika are like 'holes' with respect to negation; even when one NPI is licensed by a negation, the negation can go on to license other NPIs in its domain.","3. Negative expressions relevant to NPIs are lexically determined; items that are semantically downward entailing are not necessarily negative expressions relevant to NPIs unless lexically so marked.","It is natural to assume that 1 and 2 above are based on semantically motivated properties. The fact that sika cancells negation and a sika sentence has a logical double negation interpretation sika adds something to semantic interpretation, interpretation even related to logical inference. This suggests that sika needs a negation to 'complete' its meaning.","Other NPIs, on the other hand, adds nothing logical, as far as polarity is concerned, to the sentence they are in. They may indicate the point or context of emphasis, but they never change the polarity of the sentence."]},{"title":"4 Syntax-Semantic Interface of NPI and","paragraphs":["Sika"]},{"title":"4.1 Monotonicity Marking and Negative Polarity","paragraphs":["The context of NPIs is often explained in terms of the following"]},{"title":"Licensing Hypothesis (Ladusaw)","paragraphs":["The sentence *pi} is grammatical if and only if S[X] is downward monotone (or downward entailing) in X.","In this definition, downward entailment can be redefined as monotone decreasing.

We specifically looked at sika and claimed that it is different from other Japanese NPIs. We have shown that Japanese NPIs other than sika is very like negative phrases in negative concord sentences in such languages as non-standard English and Romance languages. We have also shown that sika is unlike these NPIs in that it has NCP, and that it is 'greedy' with respect to negation. We touched on Dowty's account of NPIs and suggest that Japanese NPIs are not amenable to his treatment. His account is shown to be problematic in that it assumes proliferation of categories. We developed a feature-based account for syntax-semantics interface sika, in which these facts are taken into account."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Dowty, D. 1994.
