GJW define a set of forward-looking centers (CO, which are assigned to each utterance in a discourse segment, and a single Cb, which is assigned to each utterance other than the segment initial utterance. The members in the set of Cf are ranked according to discourse salience, and the highest-ranked member is referred to as the Preferred Center, Cp. GJW use the following definition to define the centers of utterance in a sequence:","(1) The Definition of Centers (GJW 1995) For Un : Cb(Un) = a, Cf(Un) = (el, e2,... ep), a = ek, for some k. For U, 1 : Cb(11, 1 ) realizes em and, for all j, j < m, ej is not realized in Un+ 1 ; i.e., em is realized in U,1, and no higher ranked ei is realized in Un+1. Centering Theory also specifies a set of constraints and rules.","(2) Constraints (WJP 1998) For each utterance U i in a discourse segment D consisting of utterances U 1 , ..., Um: a. There is precisely one backward-looking center Cb(U 1, D). b. Every element of the forward centers list, Cf(U1, D), must be realized in Ui. 139 c.

The CONTINUE transition is preferred to the RETAIN transition,","which is preferred to the SMOOTH-SHIFT transition, which is preferred to the ROUGH-SHIFT","transition. The typology of transitions from one utterance, to the next utterance, U 1, is based on two factors: (a) whether the backward-looking center, Cb, is the same from Ui_1 to U1, and (b) whether this discourse entity is the same as the preferred center, Cp, of U i . The definition of transition states from Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard (1987) is summarized in Figure 1. The notation Cb(U1..1)=[?] is used for cases where there is no Cb(Ui-i)•","Figure 1.

If the current Cb is not only the same as the previous one, but also the same as the current Cp, we have a CONTINUE transition state. If the current Cb is the same as the previous one, but different from the current Cp, we have a RETAIN transition state. If the current Cb is different from the previous one, but the same as the current Cp, we have a SMOOTH-SHIFT transition state. If the current Cb is neither the same as the previous one, nor the same as the current Cp, we have a ROUGH-SHIFT transition state. These transition states describe the possible ways utterances may be linked. Of these, the most preferred way to make a local segment of discourse coherent is CONTINUE, which means that all the propositions in a local segment of discourse are organized around one particular entity. RETAIN is a way to signal the speaker's intention to shift onto a new entity in the next utterance, and in this case, the current Cb is realized in a lower ranked position on the Cf. SHIFT means that the current Cb is different from the previous Cb. There are two different SHIFT states, which depend on whether the current Cb is the same as the current Cp.","According to GJW and WJP, the interaction between these constraints, rules, and transition states can predict the preferences of the hearers in processing a local segment of discourse. In general, the preferred interpretation is the one that requires the hearer to keep track of one center since a segment of discourse constructed around one center is maximally coherent and is thus much easier to process. Although we accept GJW's and WJP's basic assumptions about centering in discourse, we think that there are problems underlying their centering theory since it would make wrong predictions regarding the preferred transition states. In section 2, we will discuss these problems, and in section 3, we will propose a revised centering theory, which, we believe, can adequately solve the problems found in 140 GJW's and WJP's analysis."]},{"title":"2 Problems with the Centering Theory in GJW and WJP","paragraphs":["The centering theory proposed by GJW and WJP would make wrong predictions regarding the preferred transition states.

But if we apply GJW's and WJP's centering theory to it, we find that their theory would wrongly predict that there is no coherent relation between (6b) and (6c) since there is no Cb in (6c). Of course, we can analyze box in (6c) as the Cb, though it is rather awkward and strange to say that box in (6c) is a realization of it in (6b) since it goes against GJW's and WJP's definition of realization. Nevertheless, if we do analyze box in (6c) as the Cb, a ROUGH-SHIFT would occur, which is the least preferred transition state since it is not so coherent. Moreover, if box in (6c) is regarded as the Cb, it will violate Constraint (2c), and should thus be ruled out since it is not the highest-ranked element of Cf in (6b). 1 Obviously, this prediction does not conform to our intuition since the transition from (6b) to (6c) is not that worse in coherence."]},{"title":"3 A Revised Centering Theory","paragraphs":["GJW and WJP make wrong predictions in center computation because their theory does not distinguish Cb from the discourse segment topic (DST). Although Cb and DST share many properties, we think that they are conceptually different, and should thus be differentiated from each other. Cb is used to process the local coherence of discourse between utterances, while DST is used to process the more global coherence of discourse between discourse segments. We propose that Cb should be distinguished from DST, as defined below:","(7) The Definition of Cb Cb(U1) is the element in Cf(U i_i ) that is realized as the matrix subject pronoun or the pronoun contained in the matrix subject in Ui.","(8) The Definitions of DST and DST shift a. The first DST is chosen by pronouns or related elements in the second sentence U2. If there is","more than one pronoun or related element in U2, then the antecedent of the higher ranked one is","chosen as the DST. If there is no pronoun or related element in U 2 or the antecedent is not in U1,","then choose the subject of U i as the DST. When the first DST is chosen, go to (b). 1 Note that (6d), (6e), and (6j) also violate Constraint (2c). 143","b. If nothing in Ui is related to DST(Ui_i ), then DST shift occurs. Push the current DST in (U1.1) into the stack, and go to (a). If some NP in U 1 is related to DST(U i..1 ), then no DST shift occurs. Note that the establishment of DST is different from that of Cb. DST belongs to the discourse segment, whereas Cb belongs to the sentence. When DST is identified in a discourse segment, it will not change within the same discourse segment. However, Cb needs to be identified in every sentence and it may change from sentence to sentence. That is why we determine the Cb for each sentence, and do not determine the DST for each sentence. Once the DST is chosen, we will only check if there is DST shift in our analysis.","As for relatedness, it is defined below: (9) X is related to Y iff there is an inferential link 2 between them.

Note that our typology of center transition states predicts that the SMOOTH-SHIFT defined by WJP does not exist. Although we distinguish SMOOTH-SHIFT from ROUGH-SHIFT, our SMOOTH-SHIFT, different from theirs, is a new type of transition state which is not predicted by their theory of centering. Another new type of transition state that does not exist in GJW's and WJP's typology is NULL-TRANSITION. If this type of transition state occurs, DST will replace center transition states 2","Inferential links cover cases such as bridging reference, inheritance relations, and other indirect anaphoric relations. 144","in making the discourse coherent.

DST: [Betsy] Under our analysis, the object pronoun in (10b) is not a Cb, thus avoiding the problem existing in GJW's and WJP's analysis discussed in section 2, which takes Betsy as the Cb in (4b=10b), and thus wrongly predicts that the subject pronoun in (4c=10c) prefers to refer to this Cb. According to our analysis, there is no Cb in (10a) or (10b). Hence, there is no center transition between these two sentences. Nevertheless, these two sentences are not so worse in coherence because they are connected by DST. In the first reading of (10c), the subject pronoun refers to the subject of the previous sentence, and the Cb of (10c) is Susan. This reading will result in a CONTINUE transition state as predicted by Figure 2. In the second reading of (10c), the subject pronoun refers to the object of the previous sentence, and the Cb of (10c) is Betsy. This reading will produce a RETAIN transition state as predicted by Figure 2. That is why the second reading is less preferred than the first reading. If the first reading is chosen in (10c), then the relation between (10c) and (10d) is CONTINUE. Note that the transition state in (10d) is determined by the one chosen in (10c). If the first reading in (10c) is chosen, the transition state in (10d) is CONTINUE, and if the second reading is chosen, it is ROUGH-SHIFT. Hence, our new theory fares better than GJW's and WJP's since it correctly predicts that Susan is the Cb in both (10c) and (10d). Notice that the first two sentences show that DST can make a discourse coherent.","Under our analysis, (5) can be represented as in (11). 145","(11) a. Susan gave Betsy a pet hamster.

Note that WJP would predict that there is a sharp contrast in interpretation preference between the first reading and the second reading in (11c). Under their typology of center transition states, the first reading in (11c) involves ROUGH-SHIFT, and the second reading involves RETAIN. However, this sharp contrast in interpretation preference does not exist. Our theory would predict that both readings in (11 c) have an equal status since both of them involve SMOOTH-SHIFT.","Another advantage of our centering theory is that under our analysis, Rule (3a) becomes redundant and can thus be abandoned, which will make our theory simpler. Consider the following discourse taken from GJW (1995: 215):","(12) a. He has been acting quite odd. Cb: [He=John] Cf: [John]\\tCONTINUE","b. He called up Mike yesterday. Cb: [He=John] Cf: [John, Mike] CONTINUE","c. John wanted to meet him urgently. Cb: [John] Cf: [John, Mike] CONTINUE Under GJW's analysis, (12c) is a violation of Rule (3a) since the Cb of (12c) is not realized as a pronoun, but some other entity is realized as a pronoun. Under our analysis, the subject of (12c) is not 146 a Cb since it is not pronominalized. Hence, the incoherence of the above sequence does not result from the violation of Rule (3a), but from the SMOOTH-SHIFT of the Cb.","GJW's Rule (3a) cannot be applied to explain the incoherence between (13b) and (13c) since there is no Cb in (13c). If we use the center transition state defined by GJW and WJP to account for the following sequence, the second reading of (13c) (RETAIN) would be considered to be preferred to the first one of (13a) (ROUGH-SHIFT), again a wrong prediction.","(13) a. He has been acting quite odd. Cb: [He=John] Cf: [He=John]","b. He called up Mike yesterday. Cb: [John=he] Cf: [John, Mike]","c. Bill wanted to meet him urgently. 1 Cbl: [?]","Cf1: [Bill, him=Mike] ROUGH-SHIFT","2 Cb2: [John] Cf2:[Bill, him=John] RETAIN Under our analysis, both readings in (13c) would result in a SMOOTH-SHIFT of Cb.","Since we distinguish Cb from DST and adopt a more restrictive definition of Cb, we need not assume that there is an implicit Cb in (14b-c) (taken from GJW 1995: 217):","(14) a. The house appeared to have been burgled. b. The door was ajar. c. The furniture was in disarray. In order to account for the coherence of the above discourse, GJW have to assume that the house is the implicit Cb in (14b-c). Under our analysis, there is no Cb in the above discourse segment since there is no subject pronoun in it. The discourse is coherent because the utterances are connected by DST. According to our definition of DST given in (7), the DST in (14) is the subject of (14a), i.e., house. The DST of (14a) is maintained in (14b-c) since there is an NP in (14b-c) that is related to the DST of the previous utterance. House, door and furniture in (14) are thus related via DST because there is an inferential link or functional relation between them. Hence, according to our definition of center transition • given in Figure 2, the transition states between (14a), (14b), and (14c) are null, but these utterances are coherent because they are connected via DST. Note that, when NULL-TRANISTION occurs, DST will play a major role in making a discourse segment coherent, and this has been demonstrated in (10) and (14), and will be further demonstrated in (15).","Finally, our revised centering theory can make better predictions about the preferences of hearers in processing local discourse segments like (6), repeated here as (15):","(15) a.

Note that NULL-TRANSITION does not mean incoherence. Instead, it means that DST will play a major role in making the discourse coherent. Obviously, our analysis makes better predictions than GJW's and WJP's theory since the relations between these utterances are not in any sense less coherent. Note that our revised entering theory also makes different predictions regarding some less coherent transition states between utterances. According to GJW and WJP, the transition state between (150 and (15g) is RETAIN, and the one between (15i) and (15j) is CONTINUE, but under our analysis, these transition states are both ROUGH-SHIFT since in each case, a center shift occurs."]},{"title":"4 Conclusion","paragraphs":["In this paper we have argued that the centering theory proposed by GJW (1995) and revised in WJP (1998) needs to be further extended and revised. We have proposed to distinguish the backward-looking center (Cb) from the discourse segment topic (DST), and provided a more restrictive definition of Cb. We argue that Cb(U i) is the element in Cf(U i_i ) that is realized by the matrix subject pronoun or the pronoun contained in the subject in U i . The analysis of the relevant data has shown that our revised centering theory consisting of the restrictive definition of Cb, the revised definition of Center Transition States and the adoption of DST can adequately avoid the center transition problems found in GJW and WJP and provide a more satisfactory algorithm for processing the local coherence of discourse. 149 References Brennan, Susan E (1995) \"Centering attention in discourse\".
