Baker International Computer Science Institute 1947 Center Street Berkeley, CA 94704, USA {fillmore,wooters,collinb}Oicsi.berkeley.edu Abstract","paragraphs":["This paper reports on the design of a lexical database for English which is currently under construction (\"FrameNet-2\" ), and describes the kinds of linguistic facts that the database is intended to make available, for both human and computer consumers. Building on a recently completed pilot study (\"FrameNet-1\" ), it is centered on the nature of the relation between lexical meanings and the conceptual structures which underlie them (semantic frames). The database will show the semantic and syntactic combinatorial possibilities (based on frame membership) of the lexical items it includes, as these are documented through grammatical and semantic annotations of sentences extracted from a large corpus of contemporary written English. The notions of profiling within a frame, frame inheritance including multiple inheritance, frame blending, and frame composition will be explained and illustrated, and the manner of storing information about them in the database will be outlined. The building of the database, with its necessary labor-intensive manual component, will be explained."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["It is generally assumed that the goals of computational linguistics and those of ordinary linguistic analysis are unlikely to coincide in the area of lexicon building. The full range of the knowledge speakers have about the words in their language appears to be out of reach of practical efforts to acquire and organize such knowledge for efficient use in NLP applications.","FrameNet, as a computational linguistics project, aims at a compromise between two extremes. At the one end it is clearly possible to do careful and subtle conceptual analysis of the items in a small lexicon designed for restricted purposes in a narrow domain, where the goal of achieving reliable language understanding and accurate inference generation seems attainable. At the other end, one can aim at fairly superficial information retrieval or other NLP applications by using statistical methods for acquiring very large lexicons or or by creating clever programs for making maximal use of the information available in machine-tractable dictionaries. The latter contain large amounts of data but are limited by what their compilers believed would be relevant to human users (Wilks et al., 1996).","The FrameNet team are convinced that at a certain level, the depth and subtlety of careful linguistic analysis can be attained using the wisely exploited judgments of linguistically trained","* The authors are Principal Investigator, System Designer, and Project Manager, respectively, of the National Science Foundation sponsored project, \"FrameNet++: An online lexical semantic resource and its application to speech and language technology\", funded under Grant No. ITR/HCI 0086132.

The other Principal Investigators of FrameNet++ are Dan Jurafsky (University of Colorado at Boulder), Srini Narayanan (SRI International), and Mark Gawron (San Diego State University). researchers who annotate syntactically sorted sentences 1 taken from a large natural language corpus. Some of the information made available by such research will be recorded directly by the annotators, and some will be derivable—partly manually, partly automatically—from the results of such annotations. The labor-intensive nature of such research will be eased in several ways: by computational facilitation of the annotation process itself; by computing maximal likelihood estimates for certain levels of analysis, so that researchers can simply accept or reject these judgments; and by allowing the annotation to proceed automatically in some cases, at least for patterns that appear to be clear. All such automatically created data will be vetted by human reviewers."]},{"title":"2 Frame Semantics Background","paragraphs":["The basic assumption of Frame Semantics as it applies to the description of lexical meanings is that each word (in a given meaning) evokes a particular frame and possibly profiles some element or aspect of that frame. 2 An \"evoked\" frame is the structure of knowledge required for the understanding of a given lexical or phrasal item; a \"profiled\" entity is the component of a frame that integrates directly into the semantic structure of the surrounding text or sentence. The frames in question can be simple—small static scenes or states of affairs, simple patterns of contrast, relations between entities and the roles they serve, or possibly quite complex event types—which we can call scenarios—that provide the background for words that profile one or more of their phases or participants.","For example, the word bartender evokes a scene of service in a setting where alcoholic beverages are consumed, and profiles the person whose role is to prepare and serve these beverages. In a sentence like The bartender asked for my ID, it is the individual who occupies that role that we understand as making the request, and the request for identification is to be understood against the background of that frame.","The background frame can be a \"history\" and the profiled entity can be some person or object that figures at some point in that history. Thus the word widow evokes a complex historical frame in which a woman is seen as having a particular social status because the man to whom she was (most recently) married has died. The frame requires an understanding of marriage, family, death, and social status. A sentence like She was a widow for three years permits the interpretation that there was an interval of three years between the death of her husband and some other salient status change, such as a remarriage or perhaps her own death. The complementation syntax of the word widow allows mention of the deceased husband, either with a possessive determiner (John's widow) or with a post-nominal of-phrase (the young widow of a famous general).","The kinds of semantic frames that have interested FrameNet the most are those that support the meanings of large numbers of words. One of these is what can be called the REPLACEMENT frame. An abstract description of this frame requires the positing of a Place (this can stand for a role, a function, a location, a job, a status, etc.), and two distinct entities (X1 and X2 ) that both have histories with this Place. We can then line up the separate pieces of the REPLACEMENT Scenario as follows:","l it may be misleading to refer to this as simply \"annotating sentences\": each of the sentences is seen as a concordance line illustrating a context for a single word, and the annotations are limited to recording the relevant features of the context of that word.","2 The term profile (used here as a verb) is borrowed from (Langacker, 1987), esp. pp. 183ff. 4 Scenario 1 Scene 1.\\tXi is at Place. Scene 2.\\tX2 is not at Place. Transition 1. X1 moves away from Place. Transition 2. X2 moves to Place. Scene 3.\\tX1 is not at Place. Scene 4.\\tX2 is at Place. Ordering Constraints Constraint:\\tScene 1 precedes Transition 1. Constraint:\\tScene 2 precedes Transition 2. Constraint:\\tTransition 1 precedes Transition 2. Constraint:\\tTransition 1 precedes Scene 3. Constraint:\\tTransition 2 precedes Scene 4. This Scenario 1 is common to (and is \"inherited by\") two other scenarios which add certain elaborations. The temporal precedence relation holding between Transition 1 and Transition 2 is general enough to allow anything from immediate replacement of X1 by X2, as in the game \"King-of-the-Hill\" (where X2 pushes X 1 off the hill) to a temporal gap of considerable length, as when the role occupied by a retired or deceased company officer remains unoccupied for many years.","In terms of their separate historical association with the Place in Scenario 1, we can refer to the entities X1 and X2 as the Old Theme and the New Theme respectively, or, simply, Old and New. We refer to such names as OLD, NEW, and PLACE as frame elements or FEs.3","Now we can look at some of the vocabulary that fits the description of this frame.","Limiting ourselves to the scenario just sketched out (which contains no suggestion of agency or causation), we can see that the noun replacement has two uses: in one of its senses it can profile the whole event, as with the complex subject NP in the sentence [Sylvia's replacement by Adam on the committee] was a surprise to everyone; or it can refer to (i.e., \"profile\") only the NEW entity in the final scene, as identified in the subject of the sentence [Sylvia's replacement] turned out to be completely unprepared for the job. The verb replace temporally profiles Transition 2, as in Adam replaced Sylvia on the committee. This means that if there is a temporal qualification added to this clause, it identifies the time when Adam showed up in the PLACE, and that does not necessarily include the time when Sylvia left it.","So far we've seen only a scene with the NEW and the OLD. The somewhat unnatural first sentence for illustrating our frame is intended to have only the interpretation that Adam came to have the position on the committee which Sylvia used to have. But the verb replace actually has two more possible profilings, fitting two slightly different elaborations of our initial scenario, both involving an agency that brings about one or both of these transitions, i.e. two types of causative.","In the first (and more restricted) of these elaborations, there is an entity X3 that brings about Transition 2 but not Transition 1. Thus:","3The FEs are in many ways analogous to the case roles or thematic roles of various frameworks. For a small number of frames, the FEs could be labeled by familiar terms from such traditions, like Agent, Theme, Instrument, etc., but we do not require ourselves to accommodate our FE labels to such lists in cases where there is no obvious fit. The FE names are understood in terms of roles in specific frames and do not need to be thought of as selected from a restricted universal set. These labels are reusable, to be sure—which is why we seek to include as many words as possible within individual frames—but our work can proceed without deciding on an initial complete inventory a priori. 5 Scenario 2 Scene 1.\\tX1 is at Place. Scene 2.\\tX2 is not at Place. Transition 1. X 1 moves away from Place. Transition 2. X2 moves to Place. Cause:\\tX3 causes Transition 2. Scene 3.\\tX1 is not at Place. Scene 4.\\tX2 is at Place.","In an interpretation supported by this second scenario, the entity X3 (which we will refer to as AGENT) can participate in a profiling of the \"Cause\" clause, as in Lydia replaced Sylvia (with Adam) on the committee. In this use of replace it is possible that the AGENT, Lydia, had nothing to do with Sylvia's move in Transition 1. That may have happened years ago. Given this second scenario, even though a NP mentioning the OLD is grammatically required, Sylvia might not be a participant in the profiled event at all. A temporal qualifier would only identify the time of Transition 2.","In Scenario 3, the second elaboration on the simple REPLACEMENT frame, we have a situation in which the AGENT is responsible for both of the transitions. Thus:","Scenario 3","Scene 1.\\tX1 is at Place.","Scene 2.\\tX2 is not at Place.","Transition 1. X 1 moves away from Place.","Transition 2. X2 moves to Place.","Cause:\\tX3 causes Transition 1 & Transition 2.","Scene 3.\\tX1 is not at Place.","Scene 4.\\tX2 is at Place.","On the interpretation of causative replace in this third scenario, we see Lydia as performing the two-part act of (1) removing Sylvia from the position and (2) placing Adam in it instead. As noted, the interpretation of temporal modifiers goes along with profiling: in Scenario 3, the sentence Lydia replaced Sylvia with Adam last week places both transitions within the same period.","Whether the existence of two interpretations corresponding to the two causative scenarios requires the positing of two senses for replace may be a problem for theories of polysemy, but there is no doubt of the difference in the implications. If you are told that you can be replaced, you have been warned that you might lose your job: you could become an unwilling participant in Transition 1. But if you are told that you can never be replaced, or equivalently that you are irreplaceable, then you will be pleased: they will never find anyone who can fill your shoes.","There are many other words that evoke one or more of these scenarios. The verbs succeed and supersede are for the most part limited to Scenario 1. The verb supplant has more or less the same possibilities, syntactic and semantic, as replace in all three scenarios. The verb substitute fits all three scenarios, but has a different syntax. In Scenario 1, where the verb is used intransitively, the NEW substitutes for the OLD, differing from replace in requiring the oblique rendering of the NEW with the preposition for. In the causative scenarios, the two verbs exhibit an alternation between direct and oblique objects, and a difference in prepositions for the oblique: the AGENT substitutes the NEW for the OLD, but the AGENT replaces the OLD with the NEW.","The noun successor profiles the NEW in respect to the OLD, whereas the noun predecessor profiles the OLD in respect to the NEW, at a time period at the end of the transitions. The phrasal preposition instead of also fits this frame: You can use raw sugar instead of refined sugar is a paraphrase of You can substitute raw sugar for refined sugar. The adjective existing 6 marks something as destined for replacement: if you see a campus map with one of the buildings identified as the existing stadium, you know that this structure is destined to be replaced. The time adjective previous belongs to this frame. If you tell me about your former wife or your ex-wife, I will know that she is someone who was once married to you; but if you speak of your previous wife, I will also know that she has in the meantime been replaced.","Numerous nouns are understood with reference to a specialization of the replacement frame: crown prince, heir apparent, standby, understudy, and so on. Thus, by defining the REPLACEMENT frame, we are able to concisely represent the semantics of at least twenty lexical items, including nouns, verbs, adjectives and a preposition. 3 The FrameNet Task The job of FrameNet is to document from attested instances of contemporary English the manner in which frame elements (for given words in given meanings) are grammatically instantiated in English sentences and to organize and exhibit the results of such findings in a systematic way. We have seen, for example, that in causative uses of the words, an expression about replacing NP with NP takes the direct object as the OLD and the oblique object as the NEW, whereas substituting NP for NP does it the other way around. A commitment to basing such generalizations on attestations from a large corpus, however, has revealed that in both UK and US English, the word substitute also participates in the valence pattern found with replace, i.e. we find examples of substituting the OLD with the NEW.","More specifically, the actual work of the FrameNet lexicographers is to record the variety of combinatorial patterns found in the corpus for each word in the FrameNet lexicon, to present the results as the"]},{"title":"valences","paragraphs":["of the words, to create software capable of deriving as much other information about the words as possible, from the annotations, and to add only that information manually which cannot—or cannot easily—be derived automatically from the corpus or from the set of annotated examples."]},{"title":"3.1 The Corpus","paragraphs":["The corpus used for the work in FrameNet-1 is the British National Corpus, more than 100,000,000 running words of contemporary British English. 4 In the current phase we have added the North American newswire corpora from the Linguistic Data Consortium (http://www.ldc.upenn.edu), and eventually we hope to be able to add the full resources of the American National Corpus (http://www.cs.vassar.eduride/anc/).","The reason for using a corpus should be obvious. Anyone working with large masses of linguistic data learns quickly that native-speaker intuition is unreliable and that there is no principled way of resolving differences between native speakers. The observations about the alternative valences of causative substitute were not known to us in advance, but became obvious from the corpus. It is for these reasons that the central data of FrameNet are the collection of attested sentences."]},{"title":"3.2 Lexicographic Relevance","paragraphs":["The part of FrameNet descriptions concerned with the combined semantic and syntactic valence of lexical items requires consideration of both frame structure and syntactic structure. Our objective is to record exactly how the language relates frame elements to those syntactic constituents that are syntactically dependent on the lexical items that evoke the frame.","Clear instances of lexicographically relevant positions are those accepted in narrow conceptions"]},{"title":"of","paragraphs":["subcategorization frames.

Since the act of demonstration requires an audience, most analysts would include the to-phrase (to the students). In other words, a lexical description of the verb must say that the subject and these two syntactic positions function in identifying frame elements that are necessary parts of the concept of the frame evoked by it. For the deverbal noun demonstration, clearly relevant positions for annotation would be a preceding possessive determiner or following prepositional complements, as in the NP [the instructor's] demonstration jof the process] [to the class] .","An example of a context providing information that could be relevant to completing information about the frame evoked by a particular lexical item but which is out of reach of lexically determined contexts is to be seen in the reference to the students and the process in the following sentence, The students complained that they couldn't really understand the process without a demonstration. It is clear from the meaning of the sentence as a whole that the audience of the demonstration is supposed to be the students, and that the process is what needs to be demonstrated, but such information does not come from the combinatorial requirements of the noun demonstration itself. The process of understanding the sentence as a whole needs to call on some means of recognizing such information in the surrounding discourse. But here the task of lexicography is more restricted: to characterize the combinatorial requirements and possibilities that are specifically associated with individual words rather than with the possibilities provided by the whole grammar of the language. On lexicographic relevance, see (Fillmore and Atkins, 1998).","Briefly, we regard the following constituents as worthy of annotation for lexicographic purposes.","• For verbs, nouns, adjectives and prepositions: their post-head complements, i.e., constituents of the phrase headed by the target (within the VP, NP, AP or PP) which amplify our understanding of the frame evoked by the head. (Complements which are \"extracted\" are similarly tagged.)","• For verbs, constituents external to the VP which instantiate an FE of the verb, either directly (as the verb's subject) or indirectly (by being a direct argument of a predicate which governs the VP through any of various \"control\" relations).","• For nouns, we annotate frame-relevant possessive determiners ([Roger's] decision to join the party), relational adjectives ( [environmental] protection) and modifier nouns in compounds ( [environment] protection).","• For nouns which occur with support verbs, we annotate constituents capable of being seen either as complements of the noun or as complements of the verb. That is, unlike a parser, we don't have to decide the correct constituent structure of a sentence like She registered a complaint to the committee about her treatment by your colleagues. If complaint is the target word, and register is the support verb, it does not matter for our purposes whether to the committee and about her treatment by your colleagues belong to a nominal phrase headed by complaint or to a verbal phrase headed by registered."]},{"title":"4 Performance of FrameNet-1","paragraphs":["The pilot on which the current project is founded was officially titled \"Tools for lexicon building\" and was funded under NSF grant No."]},{"title":"IRI","paragraphs":["9618838.

The original task was defined as associating a word with a frame, choosing a list of frame elements for the frame, looking at sentences which showed a use of the word in the appropriate sense, and selecting and labeling those constituents in those sentences which (within the constraints of lexicographic relevance) instantiated concepts from the frame. The constituents identified as frame elements were then to be classified (automatically if possible) as to their phrase type (PP, etc.) and in respect to their grammatical function (Object, etc.). A lexical entry was to be constructed automatically from the set of annotations selected for illustrating its use in a given sense, involving only minimal manual manipulation, such as the provision of a standard dictionary definition. The product of FrameNet-1 was to be full descriptions of the frame-semantic and syntactic combinatorial properties of the words in the lexicon(Lowe et al., 1997; Baker et al., 1998)."]},{"title":"4.1 Software","paragraphs":["The FrameNet-1 project used a combination of publicly-available and in-house software. The British National Corpus (BNC) was exploited using the Corpus Workbench (CWB), a suite of tools developed at Stuttgart by Oliver Christ and Bruno Schulze and made available to us through Ulrich Heid of IMS. (Information about IMS can be found at http://www.ims.unstuttgart.de.) The exploratory searching of the BNC was carried out using xkwic, an interactive keyword-in-context program, which allows easy searching and sorting on user-defined patterns. In-house software allowed users to set parameters (via a web form) for the production of subcorriora for annotation, this information was then passed to the batch-processing CWB tool, called cqp (\"corpus query processor\") which did the actual searching, using a set of complex pattern searches over part-of-speech strings.","The annotation was done with the Alembic Workbench software, a product of the Mitre Corporation; information is available at http://www.mitre.org/technology/alembic-workbench.

The selection \"lemma\" in the sort8thisp menu means that the display should be ordered alphabetically by the verbs. The search will produce a list of verbs in the STATEMENT frame that can express the ADDRESSEE as a NP-Object. (Other contexts for STATEMENT verbs. have ADDRESSEE expressed obliquely, as the object of the preposition to.) Figure 5 shows the results.

There will be two main sorts of sub-entries: lexical units will be described both in their roles as governors and in their roles as (the heads of) governed constituents. In general, verbs will be described only as governors, i.e., as the carriers of frame structure, and their analyses will be expressed in terms of the frame elements generated by their frame and the manner of the syntactic instantiation of these. Nouns will in general be annotated as governors, by analyzing their frame elements (as post-head complements, possessive modifiers, or modifying nouns or adjectives in noun compounds); but many will also be described in respect to their use as dependent elements, by finding definitionally relevant governors and by marking the phrase within which they serve as slot fillers of the frames they evoke.","For example, in the case of nouns that are the names of tools and other artifacts, in sentences which illustrate canonical uses of these artifacts, we will record the governing word (usually a verb) which evokes the frame which welcomes the noun and identify this frame. Then we will find the constituent containing the target noun which marks the frame element in which the noun is serving, and identify that frame element. Thus, given the target knife, for a sentence like I tried to slice the ham with a dull knife we would mark slice as the governor, indicate CUTTING as the name of the frame, select the phrase with a dull knife as the phrase containing the target which identifies a frame element of slice in that sentence, and give its name as INSTRUMENT. In another example for the same noun, He was stabbed three times with a knife, we would tag stab as the evoker of an ATTACK frame and select with a knife and tag it as WEAPON. Thus, for certain classes of dependent nouns, the entries would provide information in such a form as","Dependent Governor Frame Frame Element Name Phrase","knife slice CUTTING INSTRUMENT with a dull knife","knife stab ATTACK WEAPON with a knife A very large number of nouns will be treated in respect to their function as FE-slot fillers, including names of tools, dwellings, geographic locations, diseases, kinship relations, body parts, species and varieties of plants and animals, etc.","To improve the performance of software written to discover typical nouns filling FE slots (see Section 8), we have also committed ourselves to the tagging of selectionally transparent nouns, e.g., nouns designating types, parts, portions, aggregates, borders, classifiers, quantifiers, etc., which are \"transparent\" to the selectional preferences of their governors (e.g. It's hard to cut paper with that kind of knife). We also hope to expand the typology of what we have been calling \"support verbs\" to the full set of lexical functions of the Merdukian kind (possibly by incorporating into the FrameNet database work such as (Fontenelle, 1997)). We also plan to provide information regarding the fit of particular lexical items in selected grammatical constructions, such as appearance in various expressions of time (dates and other calendric phrases), place (addresses), titles, institution names (governmental, corporate, religious, etc.).6","In addition to information that is directly shown in the annotations, there will be information of various sorts derivable from them. Thus, it will be possible to derive information about functions of prepositions (the FEs they mark in given frames), support verbs (the kinds of nouns they serve and the FEs their subjects instantiate within the frames of those nouns), etc. Further information about nouns will be provided through links with taxonomies provided by other services, such as WordNet.","6To facilitate such collections, we will use the FSAs of the SRI FASTUS system, through a subcontract with SRI International. More information can be found at http://www.ai.sri.com/natural-language/projects/fastus.html. 15 6.1 Multi-Word Units FrameNet-1, because of some difficulties in the subcorporation and annotation software, was not capable of dealing with multi-word expressions. FrameNet-2 will cover compounds, phrasal verbs, and idioms. (Idioms will be included only as they are encountered, in connection with words we are studying, rather than as a result of searches dedicated to finding them, but at least we now have the means of representing them.) Among the multi-word expressions we need to recognize are phrasal verbs of the following types:","verb plus preposition\\tthink about","verb plus particle\\ttake off","verb plus particle plus preposition put up with","verb plus NP plus preposition\\tprevent NP from","verb plus NP plus particle\\ttake NP away","The FrameNet-2 annotation software allows us to recognize multiply represented constituents,","including phrasal and compound target words, by annotating on multiple \"layers\". This allows","us to correctly annotate the occasional sentences in which constituent structure and frame","element boundaries do not coincide. (Thus we should be able to take advantage of some of the","insights, regarding the lexicon/grammar interface, of autolexical syntax (Sadock, 1991).) 6.2 Profiling Profiling, it has been noted, is the representation of the foregrounded part of a frame, the participant, prop, phase or moment which figures centrally in the semantic interpretation of the sentence within which the frame is evoked. Some examples were given in sections 2 and 4.2. 6.3 Inheritance Inheritance is a relation between two frames such that one of them has all of the properties of the other, plus something else. Perhaps the simplest kind of inheritance-plus-elaboration can be seen between abstract frames and frames with specific kinds of profiling.","For example, there is a general MOTION frame involving little more than location changes whose components are a starting point (souRcE), a trajectory (PATH), and a destination (GOAL). Verbs like move or travel are instances of this general frame. There are elaborations in which the SOURCE is profiled (and hence the moment of departure), as with depart, exit, leave, vacate, etc.; there are some in which the GOAL is profiled (and hence the moment of arrival), as with arrive, enter, reach, attain, etc.; and some in which the PATH is profiled, as with pass, cross, traverse, etc. (Many of these verbs have their own further elaborations, involving figural properties of the landmark with respect to which the motion is conceived, requiring further levels of inheritance; e.g. enter elaborates arrive, adding the requirement that the GOAL be a CON-TAINER.) Caused-motion frames can be similarly organized, with insert being GOAL-profiled, remove being SOURCE-profiled, etc. 6.4 Multiple Inheritance and Blending Multiple inheritance is used to show the simultaneous operation of two or more frames which do not have inheritance links between them, where mappings are specified between their FEs. For example, there is a large class of English verbs involving someone's passing judgment on the character or behavior of someone else, which we call the JUDGMENT frame. The evaluation can be positive (as in admire, cherish, appreciate) or negative (as in blame, disapprove of , disesteem, etc.). FEs for this frame will include the JUDGE, the EVALUEE, and the BEHAVIOR being judged, as in [She] scorned [him] [for saying that]. 16","Some verbs add to this abstract characterization the idea that the person making a judgment is also communicating such judgment; i.e., we see a blend of the frames JUDGMENT and COMMU-NICATION, in which the JUDGE in the one frame is identified with (or \"bound to\") the SPEAKER in the other frame. This is the case for verbs like praise and acclaim for positive judgments, and criticize and denounce for negative judgments, e.g. She criticized him for saying that. But there is a third class of verbs, in which the JUDGE is equated with the SPEAKER and the EVALUEE is also equated with the ADDRESSEE of the COMMUNICATION. This is what we find in flatter and compliment, and in scold and upbraid (She scolded him for saying that).","Multiple inheritance is also found in verbs that incorporate both the idea of CONVERSATION and the idea of FIGHTING. Simple CONVERSATION verbs include converse, chat, etc., and simple FIGHTING verbs include fight, battle, clash, etc. Verbs that include both of the ideas (i.e., that designate fighting with words) include quarrel and argue. Syntactic traces of this blend include the fact that the preposition over, which marks the \"issue\" in a dispute, occurs with the talkfight verbs but not with the neutral conversation verbs. (Thus, we find We fought over the inheritance or We quarreled over the inheritance but not *We conversed over the inheritance or *I spoke with my brother over the inheritance(Johnson, 1999).) 6.5 Frame Composition By frame composition is meant the situation in which a complex frame is made up of parts which are also frames, as with the scenarios mentioned earlier in connection with the REPLACEMENT frame. This is true of a large family of EXCHANGE frames, in which ownership relations in one stage are reversed in a transition of transferring ownership. Verbs incorporating caused events also have frame embeddings and are thus further instances of frame composition. 7 The FrameNet-2 Database In this section we show some of the ways in which information created through FrameNet research is to be stored in a MySQL database. We will do this by briefly examining some of the tables linked in the database, leading up to a diagram which shows the entire database.","Many of the tables have ID numbers, prefixed by \"PK\" (primary key) in a hexagon; these are the unique numbers by which information is cross-indexed in other tables. Such ID numbers are repeated in the cross-referring tables, prefixed by \"FK\" (foreign key). As can be seen in Fig. 7, every lexical unit is linked to an appropriate MultiWord (explanation below) and also to an appropriate Frame. Those tables representing information entered into the database by a FrameNet researcher have, for record-keeping purposes, information about the date of their creation and an identifier of the researcher. 7.1 Lexical Units The concept of lexical unit is central to the FrameNet lexicon. It is the entity that needs a definition and whose combinatorial properties we wish to understand. In the simplest case, a lexical unit is defined as a triple consisting of a lemma, a part of speech, and a frame: a lemma in turn is a set of word form alternatives, and is named by one of its variants (the so-called \"citation form\"). Thus the lemma ring as a noun has word-forms ring and rings (singular and plural); the lemma ring as a verb has word-forms ring, rings, ringing, rang, rung; the noun lemma ring when paired with a SOCIAL COMMUNITY frame (as in ring of smugglers) is one lexical unit; when paired with a JEWELRY frame (as in wedding ring) is a different lexical unit.","Fig. 7 is to show how lexical units are connected in the FrameNet-2 database to their formal properties (lemma, word-forms, and part of speech) and to their frames. The information that we want to connect with each lexical unit includes: its definition (sense description), the lemma of which it is an instance, its part of speech, the word forms that are tokens of the lemma, and 17 Part0Spch •ID Name Definition Frame","4111D Name Definition CreatedDate CreatedBy LexUnit","OID S enseD esc CreatedDate CreatedBy","eMulbWord_Ref","OFrameRef >I-Figure 7: Tables associated with Lexical Units the frame which it evokes. The figure shows an intervening table with the misleading name \"MultiWord\" which includes both simple lemmas and lemmas that are made up of two or more lemmas.","The definition (sense description) of a lexical unit is stored in the LexUnit table. This table also stores information about the frame to which the lexical unit is linked.","One of the features of the FrameNet-2 database is the ability to represent the relationships between multi-word lemmas such as take off and closely related single-word lemmas such as take. For example, the lemma take has word forms take, took and takes (etc.), and the multi-word lemma take off has the forms take of, took off and takes of. If we were to store multi-word lemmas as separate entries in the database, information about this relationship would be lost. So, to represent this relationship between multi-word lemmas and their single-word relatives, each lemma, whether single-word or multi-word, is linked to an entry in the MultiWord table. The relationship between the Lemma table and the MultiWord table allows an entry in the MultiWord table to be linked to one or more entries in the Lemma table, one of which will be labeled the head of the multi-word. It is the .head which bears the part of speech of the whole and whose word-forms vary in the word-forms of the multi-word unit, e.g., the take of take of, the house of bird house, and the attorney of attorney general.7 7.2 Frames, Frame Elements, and Scenes Fig. 8 shows how information about scenes is stored in the FrameNet-2 database. Scenes are subordinate states-of-affairs or events that make up a frame, or, put differently, are frames that are parts of other frames.","The structures shown here can be used to represent complex scenarios like those discussed in Section 2. Information about scenes includes: the name of the scene, a description, a flag to indicate whether or not a particular scene is profiled in respect to the frame in which it occurs and a reference to the frame to which the scene belongs. The ordering constraints on pairs of scenes within a frame are stored as entries in the SceneOrder table.","Another example of such a complex scenario is the COMMERCIAL TRANSACTION frame, where the transitions represent changes of ownership of GOODS and MONEY between a BUYER and a","7The relationship between multi-lemma words and their components has a number of complexities not touched on here. 18 Frame","01D","s Name Definition CreatedDate CreatedBy","FrameElement","OID Name Abbrev Definition S emR oleR ank Profiled CreatedDate CreatedBy","(\"Frame Ref Scene \\t„p Name S ceneD esc Profiled\\t1-1— Image\\t1 SymbolicR ep - CreatedDate CreatedBy","OFrameRef SceneOrder E arlierS cene_R ef eLaterSceneRef Simultaneous Figure 8: Tables linking Scenes, Frames, and Frame Elements SELLER.

This would apply to lexical relations between, say, stare and gawk, where the latter has an 'open mouth' component; between say and whisper, where the latter has a manner and loudness component; and so on. 7.4 Layers Sentence","•ID Sentence ParagraphOrder AbsolutePos CreatedDate CreatedBy Paragraph Ref LabelSet OID CreatedDate CreatedBy GOSentence_Ref eLayerName_Ref LabelSetDepend elndepLabelSet_Ref 0DepLabelSet_Ref LayerName","Name ODBTable Ref Figure 10: Representing Annotations with \"Layers\" of Labels","Fig. 10 shows that the annotation of a sentence consists of zero or more label sets, which can be thought of as \"layers\" of annotation. In the simplest case, we would have a label set for the FEs, another for the phrase types (PTs), and third for the grammatical functions (GFs), and the boundaries of the FEs would coincide with the boundaries of the syntactic constituents, each of which would be labeled with a PT and a GF. The entire sentence would also have a label in the Frame label set, giving the name of the frame, and the target itself would have a layer of its own. We would thus have a minimum of 5 label sets for annotated sentences. The FrameNet-2 software will enable annotators to view and edit any combination of these label sets.","We also need the ability to represent a dependency relationship between label sets. For example, in annotating a sentence in the COMMERCIAL TRANSACTION frame, the frame label set would contain only one label—\"Commercial Transaction\"; the FE label set will contain the labels SELLER, BUYER, etc. We want to be able to represent the fact that the FE label set is dependent on the frame label set, by storing the information in the LabelSetDepend table.","The number of label sets (layers of annotation) will be higher in cases of blended frames. E.g., the collection of verbs that evoke the COMMERCIAL TRANSACTION frame are all instances of other blended frames as well: buy is an instance of an ACQUISITION frame, and sell is an instance of a GIVING frame. Constituents which represent FEs in more than one frame would bear labels from correspondingly more label sets. (This sort of information is presented formally in terms of multiple inheritance, discussed in Section 6.4.) In such cases, the annotation software will allow users to view and annotate FEs in any frames that might be needed. It also will allow automatic presentation of the relations between the layers, such as the mapping of FEs between frames in cases of multiple inheritance, the mapping of FEs to phrase types or grammatical functions, and so on. 20 7.5 Labels Label ID","!ODBTable Ref ID Ref CreatedDate CreatedBy","•LabelSet Ref","eLabelAtt_Ref LabelPos S tartChar E ndChar Label Ref","MiscLabelName D Name Definition","eMiscLabefType_Ref LabelSet •ID CreatedDate CreatedBy 0 S entence_Ref eLayerName_Ref Pr NZ DBTable OID","Name Color •ID","Name LabelAtt"]},{"title":"•ID","paragraphs":["eFgColorS_Ref eBgeolorS_Ref 41)FgColorP_Ref OBgColorP_Ref MiscLabelType (DID","Name Figure 11: Labels used in Annotation","Fig. 11 shows how the database stores information about the labels used in PrameNet-2 annotation. We have chosen to store the annotation information inside the database, rather than as separate files. This allows us to link the names of frames, frame elements, and other items in the database directly to the annotation tags. Thus if we change the name of a particular FE, then all annotations that use that FE will automatically be updated to show the revised name.","The primary table used for annotation is the Label table. This table holds the information needed for a single label in an annotated sentence. The primary pieces of information that we need to store for a label are: the label name, the label position, the label attributes, and a pointer to the set of labels to which this label belongs. Here we will discuss only label position, since that is the feature which allows an improved treatment of compound lexical units and discontinuous FEs.","In order to place a label in the correct position in a sentence, we need to decide its starting and ending points, and store these in the LabelPos table. The units we will use for defining label positions will be characters rather than words. The one-to-many relationship between the Label table and the LabelPos table means that a label may have one or more label positions. This allows us to create a single label that is discontinuous. For example, in the sentence They put me up for a month, if the target is put (NP) up, we would want a single label \"target\" to refer to characters 6-8 and 13-14 of the sentence (covering the words put and up respectively); rather than annotating this with two separate labels, we can use a single label with multiple label positions. (The two words would, of course, have different labels on the part-of-speech layer.)","Because the FrameNet-2 database delimits labels in terms of characters, we can overcome some difficulties inherent in the \"word-based\" approach of the FrameNet-1 system. For example, in our treatment of compounds in FrameNet-1 8 we were limited to units separated by spaces in the written text.

To all of this we should add","• the value that linguistic analysis can offer when the data are examined for generalizations nobody connected with FrameNet had in mind.9 Acknowledgments The authors are indebted to the contributions of John Lowe (Technical Director of FN-1), Sue Atkins (lexicography consultant), Christopher Johnson and Josef Ruppenhofer (senior linguists in FN-1 and FN-2 respectively), Susanne Gahl (designer of local corpus searching tools), and Hiroaki Sato (creator of the FrameSQL search interface).","9This seems like a place where corpus-based linguistics and introspection-based linguistics can meet. At present there is speculation among us that certain resultative expressions with into require or impose an iterative and/or cumulative interpretation on the associated verb. Examples that support this—including grammaticality judgements—are the contrast between beat me into submission, pummeled me into submission, etc., and the unacceptable *hit me into submission. The former two imply repeated impact, but hit does not. Other examples: nagged me into taking them to the circus, badgered me into taking them to the circus, as opposed to *begged me into taking them to the circus. One instance of begging does not constitute nagging; one annoying appeal does not constitute badgering. 23 SceneDesc Profiled Image SyrnboicRep CreatedDate CreatedBy 0Frame Ref FremeElement (SID Name Abbrev Definition SernRoleRank Profiled CreatedDate CreatedBy •Frame_Ref LexUnit 01D SenseDesc CreatedDate CreatedBy 014 titWord Ref 0 Frame_R ef STInherit •ParentST_Ref 0ChildST_Ref Ànnotation Schema Paragraph 01D DocumentOrder ocument_Ref LabelSetDepend •1ndepLabelSet_Ref OD epLabelS et_Ref Label 01D 0DBTable_Ref ID Ref CreatedDate LabelSet_Ref LabelAtt Ref Created13y LabelAtt 010 0FgColorS_Ref 0BgColotS_Ref 0FgColorP_Ref •BgColorP_Ref"]},{"title":"/","paragraphs":["MiscLabelName 0ID Name Definition 0MiscLabelType_Ref MiscLabelType 01D Name Document •ID Author SourceDesc Corpus_Ref Sentence 010 Sentence ParagraphOrder AbsokiePos CreatedDate CreatedBy OParagraph_Ref LabelSet 01D CreatedDate CreatedBy Sentence_Ref LayerName_R ef !Frame Schema I ',WordForm Form 0Lernma_Ref","IFrameNet II Entit y Relationship Diagram Figure 13: Overall database, showing all Tables and Relations 24 References","Atkins, B.T.S., J.
