Since they are clearly concerned with connecting discourse presuppositions with the assertive content of the current utterance, their nature has to be pragmatic as well as semantic. Their syntactic, or rather morphological, behaviour also seems highly unmanageable since they interact not only with themselves but also with other types of particles, especially case particles. In this paper, we try to present a basic scheme for treating emphatic particles based on four features: type, self, edge and polarity. We also try to place emphatic particles in their proper place within overall grammar of the Japanese language."]},{"title":"1 Directly Comparable Propositions","paragraphs":["Japanese \"zyosi\" particles wa and mo are known to imply the existence of entities comparable to those denoted by the phrases marked by them.","(1) a. Taro ga ki-ta Taro Nom come-PAST T̀aro came.'","b. Taro wa ki-ta Taro WA come-PAST (̀At least) Taro came.'","c. Taro mo ki-ta Taro MO come-PAST T̀aro came, too.'","Besides having the same truth conditions of (la), (lb) also invokes in the mind of the hearer the existence of comparable people who might also have come. 1 Similarly, ( 1c) implies the existence of such comparable people. The contributions of the two particles can be captured by employing pseudo-logical formulas as follows. (2) a. Taro wa kita. b. 03X(Comparable(X,Taro) A Came(X) (3) a. Taro mo kita. 'That is, the intended reading for wa here is that of contrast. 73 b. 3X(Comparable(X,Taro) A Came(X)","The difference between (2b) and (3b) is the presence or absence of the possibility operator. That is, (2) commits the speaker only to the possibility of somebody other than Taro also having come, whereas (3) to its truth. Since the difference clearly comes from the respective semantic contributions of the two particles, by abstracting away from the difference, we obtain the common proposition equally implicated by the two sentences, i.e., that there exists at least one individual comparable to Taro who came. It is also well known that other particles such as dake'only', made'even', etc. invoke similar propositions involving comparable individuals (Martin, 1975, pp. 52-94, pp. 316-30), (Ishikawa, 1985, pp. 220-41), and (Teramura, 1991, pp. 3-190","(4) a. Taro made ki-ta Taro even come-PAST Èven Taro came.'","b. Taro dake ki-ta Taro only come-PAST Ònly Taro came.'","Let us call such propositions invoked by these and similar particles directly comparable propositions (henceforth, DCPs). Not only DCPs are necessary to describe the meaning of such particles as wa and mo as we saw above, but also to explain the interaction of multiple occurrences of such particles in a sentence, as we will see below.","Discussing understatements and hedges in English, Huebler (1983, p. 155) characterizes the projective nature of a sentence uttered in a dialogue as follows. One of the most important points of departure for our study has been the idea mentioned in the first chapter that the (assertory) sentence represents a hypothesis about a propositional state of affairs, and it is this projective character of the sentence which produces its negatability. Linked to this has been the acknowledgement of the necessity for ratification of the propositional content, ratification being considered to have been effected when the propositional content has not been rejected by the hearer or hearers. This necessity for ratification of sentences, brought about by their inherent negatability, has been found to be the reason why the many linguistic modifying devices are used, since it is their function to reduce the risk of negation.","Though the function of DCP-inducing particles has more to do with assuring the mutual understanding of the discourse context between the spearker and the hearer than with reducing the negatability of an utterance as a possible face-threatening act by attenuating its possible aggressive character as in the case of understatements and hedges, they serve the same purpose of enhancing the ratifiability of a sentence. As pointed out by Saussure, relations between linguistic terms fall into syntagmatic and associative ones. The capacity of choosing more euphemistic terms in conversation rests upon the presence of a set of alternative terms readily employable for their weighing for apporpriatenes at every step in composing the utterance. In this regard, DCPs are similar, for they too readily come to the minds of the speaker and the hearer and weigh in by providing part of the background information the utterance has to square with. Thus, DCP-inducing particles can be considered as devices for positively utilizing such background information to enhance the ratifiability of an utterance by acknowledging mutual understanding of the utterance situation. 74 1.1 DCPs and Information Structure In traditional educational grammars of Japanese, DCP-inducing particles are divided into kakari zyosi such as wa, mo, koso, sae, demo, sika, etc. and huku zyosi such as sera, made, bakari, lake, nado, etc., the former being thought of as endowed with the capacity of \"being connected (to a predicative element)(Hasimoto, 1948, p. 65)\" and the latter without it. But there have been different classifications based on different criteria such as Sakuma's classification making wa and mo into a separate group from the rest of kakari zyosi, as discussed in (Teramura, 1991, pp. 10-12). More modern linguists and grammarians treat the particles as toritare zyosip̀articles for taking up (i.e., marking different modes of conceptualization of the entity taken up for predication)(Miyazima and Nitta, 1995, p. 278). In this paper, we will follow this modern approach, and concenterate on the DCP-inducing aspect of the particles.","Martin (1975, p. 70) points out the difference between \"foregrounding\" and \"backgrounding\" functions of the DCP-inducing particles (henceforth, EP for ease of reference). Notice that usually what occurs after wa. is NEW information (kore wa enpitu desu-sore WA pen desu 'This is a pencil-that is a pen') and what occurs after m6 is OLD information (kore wa enpitu desu-sore MO enpitu desu 'This is a pencil-that is a pencil,"]},{"title":"too'","paragraphs":["In\"sore WA pen desu\" , pen desu'is a pen' introduces new information, whereas enpitu desu'is a pencil' in \"sore MO enpitu desu\" does not. It should be noted that in both sentences the referent of sore'that' is accessible to the speaker and the hearer, and so is most likely not discourse-new. The articulation of a sentence into what is focus and what is not is the major characteristic of the theories of information packaging and information structure as proposed by (Vallduvi, 1992) and (Lambrecht, 1994).","The theory of information packaging as proposed by (Vallduvi, 1992) regards a sentence as embodying information-decoding instructions to be used by the hearer so that the hearer can update his knowledge database in the way intended by the speaker. A sentence is composed of two parts:"]},{"title":"ground,","paragraphs":["which is already part of the herarer's knowledge, and"]},{"title":"focus,","paragraphs":["which is the new information conveyed by the sentence. 2 In the case of (Lambrecht, 1994), the dichotomy is between topic and assertion, which roughly corresponds to Vallduvi's link and focus. For our present purposes of explaining the distribution of Japanese EPs as well as their interactions, we will adopt Lambrecht's opposition of topic and assertion(or, focus), for his notion of ratified topic is closely connected with the meaning of topical wa.","The relevance of informational articulation of the sentence for languages like Japanese was noticed by (Choi, 1996) and (Kim, 2000). Choi (1996) deals with scrambling of obligatory arguments of predicates in Korean and German. Kim (2000) discusses the deletion and movement operations in Korean which generate sentences with the optimal information structure. The mechanisms proposed in these two works have a direct bearing on the mechanism which will account, for the distribution of case particles and EPs in Japanese, for the two languages have a lot of grammatical makeup in common. However, we will take a different tack and view the whole phenomenon in light of modal operators as discussed by Foley & van Valin (1984)."]},{"title":"1.2 DCPs and modal operators","paragraphs":["Foley & van Valin (1984, p. 224) proposes the following universal hierarchy of operators. (5) (ILLOC FORCE (EVID (TENSE (STATUS [peri (MOD [core (DIR (ASPECT [nucleus])... )","2 Ground is further divided into link and tail, the former corresponding to (Lambrecht, 1994)'s topic for ratification. 75","In view of the fact that Japanese is dependent marking with regard to the relationship between a predicate and its arguments (Nichols, 1992), where the dependent arguments rather than the head predicate are marked for the dependence relationship, it should not be unwarranted to seek the elements acting as the head for the phrases marked by EPs. We claim that they are the modal operators STATUS and MOD in (5), for they are responsible for setting the mood of the utterance, and DCPs are induced by EPs relative to the mood. Status is defined as \"the variable of actuality of the event, whether it has been realized or not (Foley and van Valin, 1984, p. 213)\", whereas modality as \"the speaker's estimate of the relationship of the actor of the event to its accomplishment, whether he has the obligation, the intention, or the ability to perform it (Foley and van Valin, 1984, p. 214). (6) a. It is obligatory for Asa to hoe the field. b. Asa is able (knows how) to hoe the field.","In these sentences, the described situations are removed from the utterance situation in that the action of hoeing the field is not (necessarily) taking place at the utterance time. In this sense, status and modality introduce the multiplicity of situations associated with single sentences. However, these operators determine the pivotal situation in relation to which the situations corresponding to DCPs are located.","(7) Taro wa bongo sae hanas-er-u Taro WA Sanskrit ADD speak-CAN-PRES T̀aro can even speak Sanskrit.'","In (7), the pivotal situation is a potential one where Taro speaks Sanskrit. In the sense that the sentence is about Taro's ability, and not an ongoing event involving Taro, the situation is removed from actuality. The EP sae indicates an additional element to be included in the set of comparable elements. Let us call the element marked by an EP"]},{"title":"self, and","paragraphs":["the comparable elements minus self"]},{"title":"colleagues. Since","paragraphs":["sae presents self as an additional element, the colleagues are taken to represent more usual members of the set of comparable elements. Thus, the DCPs calculable from (7) include potential situations where Taro speaks English, French, Spanish, etc.","(8) eigo\\tsae hanas-er-eba\\tsono syoku ni tuk-er-u\\tnoni English ADD speak-CAN-COND the job TO get-CAN-PRES IRREALIS Ìf only I could speak English, I would get the job.'","In (8), the speaker has all the qualifications but one for the job. The pivotal situation is a hypothetical one where he is able to speak English. The DCPs describe those situations where he has additional but unnessary abilities to secure the job. Unlike the previous example, both the pivotal situation and those corresponding to the DCPs are counterfactual, because the modal operators set the mood of the sentence to counterfactual. Thus, it is modal operators setting the level of actuality of the pivotal situation which dictate the working out of the DCPs associated with the sentence according to the conditions specified by the EP."]},{"title":"2 DCPs as F-structures In this section,","paragraphs":["we introduce a new notation for DCPs using F-structures of Lexical Functional Grammar. This is because logical formulas are not particularly suited to the analysis of semantic and morphological composition of linguistic expressions. For one thing, a translation in predicate logic of a natural language sentence does not usually retain syntactic information of the sentence, let alone morphological information. For our purposes, it is vital to have a 76 notation which can be manipulated like logical formulas and preserve relevant syntactic information as well. The F-structure of LFG belongs to a class of linguistic representations known as attribute-value structures or feature structures, which allow us to integrate various kinds of information in the same format, thus well-suited as a linguistic representation which requires the coexistence and interactions of diverse information. Ishikawa (1985), for example, shows that F-structures combined with C(onstitutent)-structures can explain conflict between syntactic and morphological heads in Japanese.","In this paper, we use F-structures to represent DCPs associated with a sentence. A sentence containing an EP is given a pair of F-structures, one representing the content of the sentence, and the other DCPs induced by the particle. More precisely, we provide a schema for the set of DCPs by introducing a variable standing for colleagues into the second type of F-structure. We also introduce an index to indicate the scope of the EP.","We illustrate how to produce a DCP schema by using the following sentence.","(9) Taro mo ki-ta Taro MO come-PAST T̀aro came, too.' (10) SUBJ SCOPE [PRED T̀ARO' EP\\tMO PRED c̀ome(SUB# PRED\\tC̀OMP(X,TARO)' TYPE\\tfulcral SUBJ SELF\\tadditive POLARITY preserving PRED c̀omeSUB#","(11) is the DCP schema induced from (10). The value of the SUBJ SCOPE PRED is replaced by a variable comP(x,TAR0). The scope of the EP mo is expanded into a representation characterizing the nature of the colleague, which is also marked with the same index as that of the EP. The three features are taken from the set of four features jointly characterize EPs: type, self, edge and polarity.","The type feature is of three kinds: set-theoretic, presentational and fulcral. Set-theoretic EPs are concerned with delimiting the range of colleagues essentially by including them in or excluding them from the set of elements sharing the same property which is currently predicated of self. Presentational EPs are more concerned with drawing the hearer's attention to the extremity of self as an example from its associated set, thereby providing him/her with an instruction on the proper inferences to draw. They indicate, as it were, how the self should fit in with the whole picture of the event, not just the relationship with their colleagues.","Fulcral EPs consist of wa, mo and para. Wa is usually a topic marker: it signals an element for topic-ratification. Such elements must be discourse-accessible but retain a degree of unexpectedness as the topic of the sentence. Ratified topics are never marked by wa, but deleted from the sentence (Horiguti, 1995, p. 28).","(12) a. Taro wa\\teiga\\tni it-to-no? Taro TOPIC cinema TO go-PAST-QUEST D̀id Taro go to the cinema?'","b. (*Taro wa)\\teiga\\tni it-ta-yo Taro TOPIC cinema TO go-PAST-ASSERT (̀Yes,) (*Taro/he) went to the cinema.' 77","In (12b), the ratified topic Taro wa should be deleted unless the intended reading is a contrastive one such as 'Taro indeed went to the cinema, but I don't know about the others.' In other words, wa as the marker for topic ratification turns into an EP with a contrastive meaning when it occurs in a context where the self is already a ratified topic (Lambrecht and Michaelis, 1998).","Fulchral EPs seem to form a separate class from presentational EPs in that they tend to take the widest scope in the sentence. They can take more than one modal operator in their scope.","(13) a. Taro walmo/nara\\teigo\\tga hanas-er-u\\tga\\tsono syoku ni Taro WA/MO/NARA English GA speak-CAN-PRES CONTRAST the job TO oobosu-beki-denai apply-SHOULD-NEG Às to Taro, indeed he (too) can speak English, but he should not apply for the job.'","b. #Taro sura/sae/demo eigo\\tga hanas-er-u\\tga Taro even\\tEnglish GA speak-CAN-PRES CONTRAST sono syoku ni oobosu-beki-denai the job TO apply-SHOULD-NEG Even Taro can speak English, but he should not apply for the job.'","Their primary function seems to indicate the main dichotomy of the sentence into topic/comment or focus/ground.","The self feature is used to indicate whether the self is a unique, additional or approximate instance of its associated set, the first two values corresponding to the including and excluding functions mentioned in connection with set-theoretic EPs. The last value, i.e. approximate, also represents an including function, but indicates that self might be only a delegate and not a true representative. In this regard, the feature might be taken to represent the opposite of the emphasizing function, but given the human limitations in their command of precise locutions, there should be no wonder that language should provide such means of equivocation.","The edge feature carries a kind of topological information concerning the relationship between self and colleague. A self can be characterized as maximum relative to its colleagues when it is ranked heighest according to a certain measure. In contrast, the value negative is given to a self when it occupies the highest point of a measure whose points are negatively ordered in the sense that the least usual or desirable are ranked the higher. The value brink means an abrupt edge, so to speak, beyond which you are not on the same foothold. In a sense, this is the prototypical value of the edge feature. It is not concerned with whether the self is a maximal point or not, but only with it being an extreme instance.","The last feature, polarity, captures whether the colleague shares the same polarity with the self with regard to the property predicated of the self in the sentence. There is a certain correlation between the self feature and this feature. A unique self always implies the reverse polarity value, and never the preserving polarity value. For additive selves, the value is either preserving or non-applicable. Approximate selves can take any of the three values.","A table of representative EPs as analysed by the above scheme is given in Figure 1. 3 DCP operations In this section, we discuss how DCPs can account for various grammatical behaviours of EPs. 3.1 Conflicting foci A sentence can have more than two occurrences of EPs, but it becomes unacceptable when the scopes of the EPs overlap. 78 item dakeònly' madeas far as' nadoòr the like' bakarièxclusively' kosop̀recisely' suraèven' saeèven' demoèven' sikaèxcept' type set-theoretic set-theoretic set-theoretic set-theoretic presentational presentational presentational presentational presentational self\\tedge unique\\tna additive\\tmaximum approximate na approximate na unique\\tna additive\\tnegative additive\\tbrink approximate brink unique\\tna"]},{"title":"polarity","paragraphs":["reverse preserving preserving reverse reverse preserving na preserving reverse waT̀OPIC' mot̀oo' nara'as for' fulcral fulcral fulcral unique additive unique na na na na preserving na Figure 1: EPs and their features","(14) a. kono zyoseikin mo tor-er-eba\\tTaro mo syoogakuin ga mora-er-u this grant\\tMO obtain-CAN-COND Taro MO scholarship GA get-CAN-PRES Ìf we also succeed in getting this grant, Taro will also get a scholarship."]},{"title":"b.","paragraphs":["ADJ OBJ SCOPE EP ADJ\\t'this' PRED 'grant' MO PRED obtai MOOD COND SUBJ,OBJ)' SUBJ OBJ PRED SCOPE EP\\t [FRED 'Taro] MO [FRED s̀cholarship' PART tet(SUBJ,OB#","As (14b) shows, there is no conflict of scope between the two mo.

The reason seems to be that set-theoretic EPs allow the calculation of DCPs independently of that of the rest of the processes in the sentence, whereas presentational and fulcral EPs require that the calculation of the rest of the processes of the sentence to be included in that of their DCPs. A corroborating fact for this surmise is that set-theoretic EPs cannot contain the other types of EPs. For the calculation of the DCP for a containing set-theoretic EP must be preceded by that of the DCP for the contained EP of a presentational or fulcral EP, which makes it impossible to execute the former calculation independently of the latter, thus resulting in a loop-like situation.

Apparently, this situation is also explainable by employing the above generalization: set-theoretic EPs allow independent calculation of DCPs while the other two types of EPs do not.","(17) a. *Taro dake kono mondai made tok-er-u Taro only this problem as far as solve-CAN-PRES Ònly Taro can solve even this problem.'","b. ??Taro koso\\tkono mondai sae tok-er-u Taro precisely this problem even solve-CAN-PRES Ìt is none other than who Taro can solve even this problem.'","c. *Taro mo kono mondai mo tok-er-u Taro MO this problem MO solve-CAN-PRES"]},{"title":"T̀aro too can solve this problem as well.'

Again, we can resort to the same generalization to explain this ordering effect: Set-theoretic EPs allow independent calculation of DCPs, whereas the other types of EPs do not; and fulcral EPs induce the major dichotomy of the sentence while the other types of EPs do not.","(19) a.
