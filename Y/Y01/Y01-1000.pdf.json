Moreover, even though PACLIC 15 is held less than six months after the 38th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL-2000), held in Hong Kong for the first time, it has nonetheless managed to draw a healthy slate of worthy submissions, thereby demonstrating that Hong Kong has matured as a major base for the field.","The call for extended abstracts for PACLIC 15 drew some 60 enthusiastic responses from Australia, Canada, Denmark, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Mainland China, Taiwan, Thailand, and U.S.A. Some authors in fact were able to submit full papers. We took on a double blind review process, and sent out each submission to be reviewed by three assessors. For some papers we were able to invite additional reviewers from outside the program and organizing committees of PACLIC 15. The comments from the assessors were returned to the relevant authors along with the committee's recommendations. This process yielded 24 full papers.","Since both PACLIC 15 and PACLIC 10 came under the same organizers, the occasion invites comparison, especially in terms of the thrusts of papers in both volumes. It is clear that the convergence of numerical methods and discrete approaches as well as parallel developments in the field have yielded fruitful results. This is perhaps best exemplified by the keynote presentation of Professor Charles Fillmore on FrameNet-2, included in this volume. The organizers are particularly gratified that, fresh from getting his honorary doctorate from the University of Chicago, he is all prepared to travel across the Pacific, inspite of discomfort in walking, to personally make the presentation and to support PACLIC."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["PACLIC 15 has benefited from the contributions of numerous individuals, without whose help the conference would not have been possible. I wish to record my gratitude towards Jae-Woong Choe, Chu-Ren Huang, Akira Ikeya and Kim Teng Lua, co-chairpersons of PACLIC 15, as well as Masahito Kawamori and Jong-Bok Kim, for their advice and support. We are just as grateful to members of the program committee and the invited reviewers. I wish to also thank Prof. C.C. Cheng and the Department of Chinese, Translation and Linguistics, City University of Hong Kong, for becoming a generous sponsor of the conference, and to the Linguistic Society of Hong Kong, the Logico-Linguistic Society of Japan, as well as the Chinese Language Computer Society for co-sponsorship. Additional support for the conference has come by way of CityU Enterprises. Vice-president P.S. Chung and the staff at the Research Office have always given direct and implicit support for our research activities, as has been staff at the Language Information Sciences Research Centre and its subsidiary Corpus Linguistics Laboratory. Our special thanks for support go to Helena Tsang, Eunice Ma, Grace Ko, Francis Chik, Lawrence Cheung, W.F. Tsoi, and Morris Sung. I am no less grateful to Tom Lai who, despite his attachment to Microsoft's China Research Laboratory in Beijing for one semester, has been generous with his time when needed. I should also register my heartfelt gratitude to Olivia Kwong who has provided yeoman service in attending to details of the conference and deserves much of the credit for the excellent turnout at the conference as exemplified by this volume.
