Based on Engdahl and Vallduvı́’s (1996) Information Structure, we propose an analysis with the following characteristics: (i) information structure is an integral part of Japanese grammar and interacts in principled ways with both syntax and phonology, (ii) the representations of topic/focus in the information structure and its interactions with the particles wa/ga show one-to-many relation, and (iii) the ordering of grammatical functions and its interactions with other grammatical parts play an important role in determining the focus domain."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Japanese is a language in which topic and focus are identifiedby the use of the particles. In the case of subjects, they are either marked by wa or ga. The two particles are illustrated in the following examples:","(1) a. Ken-wa Ken-TOP kaet-ta. leave-PAST","b. Ken-ga Ken-NOM kaet-ta. leave-PAST ‘Ken left.’ ‘Ken left.’ The fact that (1a) and (1b) are given the same semantic interpretation, does not tell us what wa and ga really mean. These particles are said to have two uses respectively. Kuno (1973),1","for instance, distinguishes the use of wa by referring to (2a) as a thematic, and (2b) as a contrastive:","(2) a. ‘As for Ken, he left.’ b. ‘As opposed to other people, Ken left.’ Much syntax-based work has been done on the use of these particles but the basic distinction between them is the same. Whatever the correct characterization of the uses of wa shown in (2) may be, the meaning of (1a) that is common to both uses is that the proposition that somebody left is true if that somebody is Ken. Whether a subject marked by wa is uttered in one use of wa or the other cannot be determined without knowledge of the context.","In this paper, we demonstrate that the relation between syntactic constituency and contextual information is not a tight one-to-one mapping as purely syntax-based analysis assumes. Based on Vallduvı́ and Endahl’s Information Structure (Vallduvı́,1992; Engdahl and Vallduvı́, 1996; Vallduvı́and Engdahl, 1996), we propose a constraint-based one-to-many mapping mechanism which captures some aspects of topic/focus interpretation. The study of information structure, we argue, is essential in addressing fundamental questions regarding the multi-dimensional grammar for Japanese. 1 Kuroda (1965; 1972; 1990) recognizes the same distinction but characterizes it differently.

To distinguish topic from focus, Erteshik-Shir adopts a topic test originally proposed in Reinhart (1981). (3) Speaker A: Tell me about X Speaker B: . . . X. . . . X = TOPIC (Erteshik-Shir 1997:14, ex.11)","Erteshik-Shir also defines the topic as the subject of the predication. Thus, in (4) The children is the topic, and the predicate represents the assertion made about the topic.","(4) Speaker A: Tell me about the children. Speaker B: [","The children] were eating the candy. Topic is old information in the sense that it has been introduced in discourse.","Focus is determined by using question-answer pairs to identify the constituent which answers a Whquestion. Thus, in (5a), for example, only The children is the focus and the rest of the sentence is old information.","(5) a. Speaker A: Who ate the candy? Speaker B: [  The children] ate the candy.","b. Speaker A: What did the children eat? Speaker B: The children ate [","","the candy].","c. Speaker A: What did the children do? Speaker B: The children [","","ate the candy].","(Erteshik-Shir 1997:14, ex.13, slightly modified.) Based on the definitions and test shown above, we examine the interpretation of wa/ga-marked subject. 2.2 Topic/Focus Particles and Interpretations of Subject As seen in (6), the subject marked by wa has a topic interpretation.","(6) Speaker A: Tell me about the children.","Speaker B: [","Kodomotati-wa]","children-TOP amedama-o candy-ACC tabe-tei-ru. eat-PROG -PRES","‘The children are eating the candy.’ When kodomotati ‘children’ is already a topic of context, (6) is pronounced without any contrastive pitch on kodomotati-wa and is interpreted as thematic (Kuno, 1973).","When kodomotati is being contrasted with other parties, the phrase receives a high pitch (either on kodomotati or on wa) and is interpreted as contrastive (7).","(7) Speaker A: Who is eating the candy?","Speaker B: [ ","Kodomotati-wa]","children-TOP amedama-o candy-ACC tabe-tei-ru (-kedo...) eat-PROG -PRES -BUT","‘It is (at least) the children who are eating the candy. . . ’ Wa marked elements can also be interpreted as focus if they bear new information, as in (7). Thus, there is no direct correspondence between wa/ga and topic/focus, respectively.","The particle wa shows that the constituent marked with it carries a focus interpretation. In (8) the object amedama ‘candy’ is marked with wa and it is also interpreted as focus.","(8) Speaker A: What are the children eating?","Speaker B: [","Kodomotati-wa]","children-TOP","[  amedama-wa] candy-TOP tabe-tei-ru (-kedo...) eat-PROG -PRES -BUT","‘It is (at least) the candy which the children are eating. . . ’","(8) implies that the children are eating the candy, but they were eating nothing else, e.g., chewing gum. The domain of focus can be extended beyond the constituent marked with wa. See (9) below:","(9) Speaker A: What are the children doing?","Speaker B: [","Kodomotati-wa]","children-TOP","[  amedama-wa candy-TOP tabe-tei-ru] (-kedo...) eat-PROG -PRES -BUT","‘It is (at least) eating the candy that the children is doing. . . ’ In (9) the constituent amedama-wa tabe-tei-ru ‘eating the candy’, not just amedama-wa carries a focus interpretation, and the sentence implies that the children are eating the candy, but they aren’t doing anything else, such as reading a book. Thus, there is no direct correspondence between the sentence form and its focus interpretation.","Ga differs from wa in some respects. See the example in (10) below:","(10) Speaker A: Who is eating the candy?","Speaker B: [","Kodomotati-ga]","children-NOM amedama-o candy-ACC tabe-tei-ru. eat-PROG -PAST ‘It is (only) the children who are eating the candy.’ (10) shows that the subject, marked by ga, is also interpreted as focus.","Note that there is a difference between wa marked and ga-marked focus. In (7) and (10), kodomotati ‘children’ belongs to a set specified in discourse. Kodomotati-ga has to be the only members who are eating the candy in the context. Erteschik-Shir (1997) calls both wa-marked focus in (7) and ga-marked focus in (10) restrictive focus which presupposes a set specifiedin discourse of which the focus constituent is a subject.2","On the contrary, wa-marked focus, as shown in (8)-(9) does not require the focused element to be the only member of that set. To distinguish such a focus from restrictive focus, I will call the wa-marked focus non-nestrictive focus.","When a sentence with the ga-marked subject is uttered out-of-the-blue, the whole sentence bears new information. Consider (11) below:","(11) Speaker A: What is happening?","Speaker B: [ ","Kodomotati-ga","children-NOM amedama-o candy-ACC tabe-tei-ru]. eat-PROG -PRES ‘The children are eating the candy.’ In (11), no set from which kodomotati is picked out is presupposed. Hence, it is not restrictive. I call the focus in (11) all focus, and distinguish from restrictive focus.3 2.3 Summary In (12), we summarize the possible interpretation of ga/wa-marked NPs. (12) a. Wa marked NPs are interpreted as topic, restrictive focus or non-restrictive focus.","b. Ga marked NPs are interpreted as either restrictive focus or all/non-restrictive focus. 2 In (10), all members which satisfy the condition have to be listed exhaustively (non-exhaustively in (7)). Kuno (1973)","distinguishes the two usage of ga by referring to (10) as an exhaustive listing, and (11) as a neutral description which simply","describes an event. Diesing (1988) and Heycock (1994) determine exhaustive listing reading narrow focus. See fn.3 3 This is what Selkirk (1984) and Diesing (1988) call wide focus.

Second ground is further subdivided into link (topic, in our terms) and tail. Under the assumption that every utterance contains new information,5","this leads to a four-way classificationof utterances: all-focus, focus-tail, link-focus-tail and link-focus shown in (13:B).","Engdahl and Vallduvı́(1996) propose that Information Structure is represented within signs’ value of CON(TE)X(T) feature as following way:6 (14)           ","PHON . . .

(Engdahl and Vallduvı́1996:12, ex.16) One advantage of the present analysis concerns the contextual ambiguity in (18). This sentence, with an A-accent on the object, can be interpreted either with focus on the object NP or with focus on the whole VP, depending on the context. The former interpretation is licensed by (16i) (focus inheritance), while the latter interpretation is licensed by (16ii) (focus projection).7","Another advantage of using the multi-dimensional representation concerns mismatches between informational partitioning and syntactic constituency. In (19) we could have cases where informational partitioning does not correspond to syntactic constituency:","(19) Speaker A: What happened to the China set?","Speaker B: [","","The BUTLER BROKE] the set. (Engdahl and Vallduvı́1996:16, ex.24) Constituency-based analysis (Selkirk, 1984, 1995) and other pure-syntax theories would have difficulties in predicting that the focus is constituted by the subject and the verb. Within the present analysis, even if the subject and the verb do not form a syntactic constituent, the instantiation of a FOC value on both DAUGHTERS will be inherited to their respective mother. 3.2 Instantiation of the Information Structure in Japanese It has been observed that languages adopt different means to encode their information structure: English employs intonation while Catalan relies on word order (Engdahl and Vallduvı́, 1996). In addition to prosody and constituent order changes from the underlying SOV, Japanese also uses morphology directly in realizing information structure.","7","Fuller discussion will be presented in the Section 3.2 and since the focus projection is basically the same mechanism as an domain extension of restrictive focus in (9). PACLIC 18, December 8th-10th, 2004, Waseda University, Tokyo","3.2.1 WA A number of properties distinguish the three uses of wa, topic and (non-)restrictive focus ((N)RF): (20) a. The topic is restricted so as to be old information, while (N)RF can mark new information. b. The topic phrase goes unstressed, while NRF phrase receives a high pitch.","c. A sentence is restricted to at most one topic phrase, which if present appears in sentence-initial position; however, multiple elements within the sentence can be marked in situ with NRF. Though pitch accent assignment described in (20b) and (15) for English are different, the properties of topic and (N)RF in (20a) correspond with Vallduvı́’s (1992) characterization of link and focus. (20c) also match the characterization, since under Vallduvı́’s system the Information Structure of a sentence is restricted to at most one link but any number of focus and tail elements, and moreover the property of topic in (20c) is consistent with his original conception of links as exclusively sentence-initial. Therefore we conclude that topic wa and (N)RF wa function as link and focus marker, respectively.8","Let us consider how information structure, which is a crucial factor for topic/focus articulation, is formally represented in Japanese grammar under the framework of HPSG.","(20a) and (20b) can be captured by means of the following constraint from Engdahl and Vallduvı́(1996): (21) a.","   MORPHON MORPH","X, wa PHON","ACCENT U","","INFO-ST LINK      b.","   MORPHON MORPH","X, wa PHON","ACCENT A","","INFO-ST FOC      Notice that (21) characterizes phonological constraints for Japanese rather different from the constraints for English, as exemplifiedin (15).","Information structure in Japanese, as in Catalan, depends crucially on morphosyntactic devices such as wa marking. Furthermore, as in English, the prosodic phenomenon of sentence accent is also important. However, the formalization in (21) does not describe such phonological aspects and a certain morphological process that removes the case particles -ga and -o obligatorily and -ni optionally, and keeps any other case particles and postpositions intact. Whatever the correct characterization of the morphological and phonological feature of Japanese may be, it is irrelevant to the main subject of this paper.9","It is noteworthy that the skeletal signs in (21) show that the value of ACCENT and the value of INFO-ST constrain each other. This is expressed by means of structure-sharing between INFO-ST and the sign itself. The presence of an unmarked or A-accent is sufficient to identify the informational contribution of a lexical sign as link or focal. And vice versa, the link or focal status of a lexical sign is sufficient to determine the value of its ACCENT. This means that the constraints in (21) express a mutual constraint between ACCENT (phonology) and INFO-ST (discourse).","Now we need a mechanism to encode (20c). Following what is commonly accepted in the literature (Hoji, 1985; Saito, 1985), we assume that topicalization lexical rule is divided into two types: the topic addition type in (22a) and the topic substitution type in (22b):10 (22) a.

In (22), we introduce the feature TOPIC, with which we can state the co-occurrence restrictions for the heads that they select.11","We make the value of TOPIC a list which is restricted to single item.

Since the LINK value of a given 1 NP is instantiated, it propagates to the INFO-ST value of its mother. This propagation is ensured by (16i) which is an option of a disjunctive principle for information structure for not only English but also for Japanese.","11","Topic wa phrase requires modality at the sentential ending (Yamada, 1936). It is also prohibited from appearing in a relative clause and a conditional clause, (whereas NRF phrase is not). These characteristics can be straightforwardly explained by assuming that the specificheads have different valence specificationfor the feature TOPIC. PACLIC 18, December 8th-10th, 2004, Waseda University, Tokyo","The topicalization lexical rule in (22b) also operates on a verb like taberu ‘eat’ in (28), and gives rise to corresponding topicalized verbs in (29a, b) which are responsible for (25a, and b), respectively.

Consequently two options are available within the principle in (16): (i) accounts for instructions with narrow focus in (25a): it requires a mother to inherit the INFO-ST value of its daughters, as represented by the structure-sharing using 2 in (30a). (ii) accounts for instructions with wide focus in (25a): it allows a given phrase to be interpreted as focused, if its the most oblique daughter is focused (and, therefore, has its FOCUS value instantiated as specifiedby 5 in (30a).","12","As shown in (30b), SUBCAT list is unsaturated since additional topic phrase does not cancel off the (logical) subject. We think this is a right prediction because topic sentences allow a resumptive pronoun which may cause cancellation, whereas NRF sentences do not. See Hoji (1985). The relation between topic element and unrealized element is the matter of pragmatics. 3.2.2 GA","The nominative case particle ga is often associated with new information and focus. We determine focus by utilizing question-answer pairs following Erteshik-Shir’s (1997) work, and then show that there are at least two usages of particle ga i.e., restrictive focus (RF) and all focus.","However this ambiguity of ga is not always present. If the predicate is individual-level predicate (Kuroda, 1965) or stative predicate (Kuno, 1973), ga-marked subject can only be interpreted as RF:","(31) Speaker A: Who is smart?","Speaker B: [ ","Ken-ga]","Ken-NOM kasikoi. smart (Of all the people salient at this point in the discourse,) ‘It is (only) Ken who is smart.’","Extensive past study also reveals that sentence-initial ga-marked phrase is the realization of focus. The so-called multiple nominative construction exemplifiedby (32) is one of these phenomena:13","(32) Speaker A: Who is it whose father is a teacher?","Speaker B: [ ","Ken-ga]","Ken-NOM titioya-ga father-NOM sensee-da. father-COP ‘It is (only) Ken whose father is a teacher.’ The evidence that the sentence-initial ga-marked phrase is solely a focus comes from several phenomena. One obvious point we can observe here is that only the firstga-marked phrase can be wh–questioned as in (33a) while the second one cannot as in (33b).","(33) a. Dare-ga WH-NOM titioya-ga father-NOM sensee-desu-ka? teacher-COP -Q","b. * Ken-ga Ken-NOM dare-ga WH-NOM sensee-desu-ka? teacher-COP -Q","‘(lit.) Who is it whose father is a teacher? (lit.) Ken’s ‘who’ is a teacher?’ As shown in (34), the second ga-marked phrase cannot be a focus.","(34) Speaker A: What did the children eat?","Speaker B: [ ","Amedama-o]","candy-ACC kodomotati-ga children-NOM tabe-ta. eat-PAST","‘It is (only) the candy which the children ate’ (34) also suggests that the sentence-initial o-marked phrase receives focus interpretation.","Given the examinations and observations here, it seems that the particle ga has two functions; in addition to its nominative case marker function, it serves as a focus marker. We thus suggest that there are at least three realizations of ga as following: (35) a.   ACCENT U HEAD nom INFO-ST","   b.    ACCENT A","U MARKING ga SPEC","[TOPIC  ] FOC     ","c.   ACCENT A FOC    (35a) only specifiesthe nominative value of the head. The second unmarked ga-marked phrase in (32), (33) and (34) are constrained by (35a). The sentence-initial ga-marked phrase in (31) and (32) has obligatory RF interpretation whether it is A-accented or not. It is noteworthy that the subject Ken without the particle ga as shown in (36a) and (36b) is surely worse that the case of unaccusative in (36c):","(36) a. *Ken-","kasikoi. b. *Ken-","titioya-ga sensee-da. c.

These characteristics are described with the value of FOC, the disjunctive specification of the accent value, the value of MARKING, and value of SPEC ","which is not the type nil(","","",")14","in (35b). Like English, accented constituents in Japanese are also interpreted as foci. (35c) is the constraint for","RF, as in (10). 13 There are several type of multiple nominative construction that we do not discuss in this paper. 14 This does not mean the unificationfailure to the type, but the inequality to the type. PACLIC 18, December 8th-10th, 2004, Waseda University, Tokyo","Now, we consider how the constraints in (35) interact with the other constraints in HPSG.","To begin with (35a). There is no need to go into details about it. It is a constraint for an ordinary nominative marked NP, which is not positively related to the instantiation of information structure, and is only subcategorized by the head, like a verb.","Next, (35b) is for the sentence-initial ga-marked phrase which is often analyzed as the subject even if it appears multiply. In Section 3.2.1, we have formalized the constraint on topic which if present appears in sentence-initial position. Let us see the ordering of RF and topic exemplifiedby (37):","(37) a. [ JR-wa] JR-TOP","[  tokkyuu-ga] superexpress-NOM untin-ga fare-NOM","yasu-i.","low-PRES","‘As for JR, it is the superexpress whose fare is low. ’","b. * ["," JR-ga] JR-NOM tokkyuu-wa superexpress-TOP untin-ga fare-NOM yasu-i. low-PRES","*‘It is JR, as for the superexpress, whose fare is low. ’","(37) show that RF follows topic. Individual-level predicate subcategorizes for the RF phrases. To account these phenomena, we assume the following rules to construct well-formed phrases. (38) a.  HEAD verb  ","HEAD verb","SPR","NP-ga,. . ."," b.   TOPIC FOCUS  SPR   ","  SPEC   FOCUS   ,   TOPIC SPR","    ","Lexical rule (38a) introduces multiple ga-marked phrases. Note that in (38b), the focus of the mother is identical not to the head daughter’s one, but to the specifierdaughter’s one. This ensures that only the last adjunction becomes the focus of the whole sentence. (39) shows the structure of (37).

However it is not sufficient to constrain the projection.","It is well known that an A-accent on the external argument in English cannot project the focus value up to the mother. Japanese also shows such a sensitivity as shown in below:","(40) Speaker A : What happened?","Speaker B",": #[","","KODOMOTATI-GA]","children-NOM utat-ta. sing-PAST ‘The children sang.’","Speaker B",": #[ ","KODOMOTATI-GA]","children-NOM amedama-o candy-ACC tabe-ta. eat-PAST ‘The children ate the candy.’","Speaker B",": ["," [ ","KODOMOTATI-GA]","children-NOM kaette-ki-ta]. return-come-PAST ‘The children returned.’ The A-accent on the subject kodomotati on unergative verb in (40B",") and transitive verb in (40B",") cannot include a wide focus reading. This is confirmedby the unsuitability of the answer to an all-focus question in (40A). However focus on the subject of an unaccusative predicate like kaettekuru ‘return’ as in (40B",") can be projected up to the mother. This is not predicted by (16ii), repeated in (41a) below, so we revise it as (41b):","(41) a. if the most oblique DAUGHTER’S FOCUS is instantiated, then the FOCUS of the mother is the sign itself.","b. the internal argument’s FOCUS is instantiated, then the FOCUS of the mother is the sign itself. Though (41) captures the external/internal argument sensitivity, we will see a problem below: (42) Speaker A : What did Ken do?","Speaker B : # Ken-wa","Ken-TOP","[   KODOMOTATI-NI] children-DAT amedama-o candy-ACC age-ta. give-PAST ‘Ken gave a candy to the CHILDREN.’","Speaker B : Ken-wa","Ken-TOP","[   kodomotati-ni children-DAT","[   AMEDAMA-O candy-ACC age-ta]. give-PAST ‘Ken gave a CANDY to the children.’ The position of an o-marked phrase and its interaction with possible domains of focus pose a problem. If we adopt the principle of (41b), these sentences should have the same possible focus domains: the o-marked phrase and its mother, VP. However, (42B",") does not have an VP focus interpretation while (42B",") does. (42B",") cannot be a faithful representation of a VP-focus question like (42A) whereas (42B",") can. Focus can only project wide from the object amedama as in (42B","). Even in scrambled examples like those in (43), this condition holds: it is only when the object amedama is focused that the VP can receive the wide focus reading.","(43) Speaker B : # Ken-wa","Ken-TOP","[   amedama-o candy-ACC KODOMOTATI-NI children-DAT age-ta. give-PAST","Speaker B : Ken-wa","Ken-TOP","[   AMEDAMA-O candy-ACC kodomotati-ni children-DAT age-ta. give-PAST","This is rather unexpected, considering the generally free constituent order properties of the language. However, (41b) requires only a minor revision:","(44) the most oblique internal argument’s FOCUS is instantiated, then the FOCUS of the mother is the sign itself. Note that (44) is definedfor Japanese. ageta ‘gave’ will look like the following: PACLIC 18, December 8th-10th, 2004, Waseda University, Tokyo","(45)","SUBCAT","NP","EXT",", NP","INT1",", PP","INT2",""," Though the firstNP is the most oblique argument, it cannot allow focus projection since it is an external argument. The most oblique internal argument is the Theme NP, thus allowing wide focus. However the Goal PP cannot induce wide focus since it is not the most oblique argument regardless of its syntactic positions.","The only difference form English is that it is the most oblique but not the least oblique."]},{"title":"4 Conclusion","paragraphs":["This study has shown constraint-based analysis on so-called information structures in Japanese. Based on the examination of the distribution of topic/focus particles, we demonstrated how the focus-ground articulation for the mother may be computed from the articulation provided by the daughter constituents by means of the various constraint on syntax and phonology."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["We would like to thank Robert D.
