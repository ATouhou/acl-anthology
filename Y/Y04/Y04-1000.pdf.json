{"sections":[{"title":"Foreword ","paragraphs":["On behalf of the Logico-Linguistic Society of Japan, let me express our pleasure to have this opportunity to host PACLIC 18, the 18th Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation, at Waseda University in Tokyo. PACLIC 18 is the nineth conference to convene under the present name \"Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation,\" which was inaugurated in Kyoto in 1994, replacing its predecessors \"Korean-Japan Joint Conference on Formal Linguistics\" and \"Pacific Asia Conference on Formal and Computational Linguistics.\" In the foreword written on the occasion of PACLIC 14 held in 2000 at Waseda University, I wrote as follows: \"The past ten years was the time in which we have witnessed so many wars and so much strife among nations and races. One of the main causes of these tragedies was and still is language differences we employ.\" Regrettably, this is still true nowadays. Not a single day passes without the news of murder and killing among nations and races. Therefore, we cannot overemphasize the importance of language study since it is through language that we can help to create and achieve peace in the world. The PACLIC conferences, as is well known, have a long tradition of putting strong focus on the intersection of linguistics and computer science. This focus has a vital importance in the days when we experience a tremendous gap between several branches of language study and the research on computer science. While the PACLIC conferences have provided a sense of family-like community for the people who attend the conference, we have employed anonymous review process since PACLIC 10, sending out each paper to reviewers for evaluation. With the review results at hand, the Program Committee of this conference selected 18 Oral Presentations and 11 Interactive Presentations out of 53 submissions. In this conference, we are fortunate to be able to invite the following speakers, Dr. Chu-Ren Huang at Academia Sinica, Dr. Kiyong Lee at Korea University and Dr. Yuji Matsumoto at Nara Institute of Science and Technology. PACLIC 18, December 8th-10th, 2004, Waseda University, Tokyo Our next PACLIC conference is going to be held in Taiwan at Academia Sinica in December 2005. We have also received an important piece of news that China and Thailand have proposed to host the following conferences. With the two additional countries hosting future installments of PACLIC conferences, this series will become \"Pacific Asia Conference\" in the true sense of the word. Our appreciation is extended to our committee members. Just to name a few, we would like to thank Dr. Chu-Ren Huang and Dr. Beom-mo Kang for serving as Program Co-Chairs, Dr. Kei Yoshimoto for serving as Acting Program Chair, Prof. Yasunari Harada for serving as Organizing Chair, Dr. Kiyoshi Ishikawa for serving as Organizing Co-Chair and Dr. Hiroshi Masuichi and Ms. Tomoko Ohkuma for serving as key members of PACLIC 18 secretariat. Last but not least, I want to take this opportunity to thank Waseda University for offering financial support in planning and hosting this conference, Institute for Digital Enhancement of Cognitive Development and Language and Speech Science Research Laboratories of Waseda University and Corporate Research Group of Fuji Xerox Co., Ltd. for providing human and network resources to assist organization and operation of PACLIC 18th.
