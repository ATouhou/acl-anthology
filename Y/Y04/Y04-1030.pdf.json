"]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Corpora are no doubt key resources for language information processing, language research and teaching and lexicography. Many large-scale monolingual corpora have been available in the world, especially with English corpora. Efforts to build Chinese corpora started around 1990s in Mainland China. Substantial progress has been made so far. There are several large-scale Chinese corpora available now, such as the People's Daily corpus developed by Peking University. However, Compared with the big progress in building monolingual corpus, there are not so many practical parallel corpora available, especially parallel corpora with Chinese involved, which hinders their use in cross-language information processing, language teaching and research and bilingual dictionary compilation. In order to give substantial support to research in related fields, we started compiling a Chinese-English parallel corpus in 2001. So far over 10 million character of Chinese texts of different types and corresponding English texts has been collected and included into the corpus. The corpus has been automatically aligned and verified manually at sentence level and the Chinese part also has been automatically segmented and POS tagged. Tentative researches using this corpus in Machine Aided Translation, bilingual dictionary compilation and other related field has been also conducted. We will present our work towards building and using the Chinese-English corpora in this paper."]},{"title":"2 The construction of the Chinese-English corpus 2.1 The collection of the parallel texts","paragraphs":["There is a wide literature on corpus design principles; one of them is that a general corpus should be made balanced. Which means a corpus shall contain texts of different domain and different genres in reasonable proportions; the corpus thus can be a reasonable reflection of the language use. However, when we decided to construct the Chinese-English corpus, we found it's not easy to construct a perfectly balanced Chinese-English corpus. That's because there are not so many electronic Chinese-English bilingual texts available. So we decide to collect Chinese-English bilingual texts as many as we can, as PACLIC 18, December 8th-10th, 2004, Waseda University, Tokyo long as the texts are of good quality. For the same reason, we decided not to use any sampling techniques; the full texts are included in the corpus.","So far, over 10 million character of Chinese texts and their corresponding English texts has been collected and included into the corpus. Most of the texts are collected from Internet and cover a variety of domains, such as newspaper news, technical articles, literature, movie transcription and so on. Text noises, i.e. irrelevant HTML tags, figures, tables etc., are removed from the texts before the texts entered into the corpus.  2.2 Annotation of the parallel corpus The corpus could only be useful after they are annotated. For example, parallel corpus could be used as a Translation Memory only after they are aligned at different level. For a parallel corpus, the most important annotation will be alignment, especially sentence alignment, which will be a minimal requirement for a parallel corpus. In addition, other annotations applicable to monolingual corpus are also applicable to parallel corpus, such as POS tagging and parsing. But annotation of large-scale corpus is labour intensive, which could be done only with the help of automatic tools. Considering of the reliability of the corpus tools and possible use of the corpus, we decided to carry out the following three types of annotation: 1) Global textual attributes. Global textual attributes are attributes applied to every full text in the corpus. They are features to specify the domain of the texts, whether a text is written or spoken, the author of a text, the translator of a text, the time period when a text was authored, the title of a text and so on. The global textual attributes will facilitate special research based on the corpus, for example, language researchers might be interested only with texts belonging to a particular domain, and they can easily extract all texts belonging to that domain. 2) Monolingual textual structural annotation. Monolingual textual structural annotation deals with text unit of different levels. At present, boundaries of paragraph, sentence, and word have been annotated in the corpus. Annotation of word boundaries of Chinese texts is also known as word segmentation. In addition, basic linguistic information such as part of speech types is also tagged for texts of both languages. 3) Parallel alignment annotation. Parallel alignment annotation establishes the correspondence between the language units of the original texts and their translations. So far, the corpus is aligned only at the sentence level. Word alignment of the corpus seems still unpractical for the massive labour required and lacking of reliable tools.  2.3 The mark-up of the parallel corpus To make the corpus application-independent and easier to exchange via the Internet, all the texts in the corpus shall be encoded uniformly. For this reason, an XML-based framework has been designed and applied to the corpus. According to this framework, all the Chinese texts and English texts are encoded separately, each text, no matter what language it is, is composed of a text head and a text body. All the global textual attributes are put into the text head; the monolingual structural tags, linguistic information tags and the text itself are put within the text body. Alignments are established via the id number recorded in the text body of the both languages. Figure-1 shows a fragment of the corpus.  ","Figure-1 Fragment of the Chinese-English parallel corpus  2.4 The parallel corpus tool set Corpus construction is very labour intensive; it cannot be done without automatic tools. To facilitate the construction of the Chinese-English parallel corpus, we have developed a set of corpus tools. So far we have the following tools in use: (1) the Chinese-English paragraph and sentence alignment program; (2) XML-based corpus encoding tool; (3) the Chinese segmentation and POS tagging program. The three tools have been heavily used in the construction of the Chinese-English parallel corpus as a pre-processing step before human verification. Figure-2 is a segmented and POS tagged fragment of the Chinese text. <p id=\"3\"> <a id=\"3\" no=\"1\"> <s id=\"1\"> 中国是联合国安全理事会的 常任理事国,中国理解自己的 责任。</s></a> <a id=\"4\" no=\"1\"> <s id=\"2\"> 有两条大家是信得过的,一条 是坚持原则,一条是讲话算 数。</s></a> <a id=\"5\" no=\"1\"> <s id=\"3\"> 我们不搞政治游戏,不搞语言 游戏。</s></a> <a id=\"6\" no=\"1\"> <s id=\"4\"> 我个人爱好打桥牌,但中国在 政治上不爱好打牌。 </s></a> <a id=\"7\" no=\"1\"> <s id=\"5\"> 不仅今天如此,建国以后,在 毛泽东主席、周恩来总理领导 我们国家的时候就是如此。 </s></a> ... </p> <p id=\"3\"> <a id=\"3\" no=\"1\"> <s id=\"1\"> China is aware of its responsibilities as a permanent member of the Security Council of the United Nations. </s></a> <a id=\"4\" no=\"3\"> <s id=\"2\"> Everyone can trust China in two respects. </s> <s id=\"3\"> First, China adheres to principles. </s> <s id=\"4\"> Second, China means what it says. </s></a> <a id=\"5\" no=\"1\"> <s id=\"5\"> We do not play political games, nor do we engage in the play of words. </s></a> <a id=\"6\" no=\"1\"> <s id=\"6\"> I personally love to play bridge, but China does not like to play political cards. </s></a> <a id=\"7\" no=\"1\"> <s id=\"7\"> This is not only the case today, but was also the case during the period since the founding of the People's Republic in 1949 when Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai were leading the country. </s></a> ... </p> PACLIC 18, December 8th-10th, 2004, Waseda University, Tokyo Figure-2. A segmented and POS tagged fragment of the Chinese text  Apart from the above-mentioned tools, we also developed a simple English tokenization and lemmatization tool. A word level Chinese-English alignment is also under developing. But so far these tools have not been widely used in the corpus processing.  2.5 The workflow of the parallel corpus construction To facilitate the construction of the parallel corpus, we also developed a systematic workflow based on our examination of the whole process of the corpus construction. According to the workflow, any text must be firstly processed in the following steps after they are collected and before they entered into the corpus. 1) Noise removing. Most of our texts come from Internet and therefore most of them are HTML files, there are many tags and irrelevant links in the text. These are irrelevant to the text contents and shall be removed from the texts in this step. After the first step, all texts are pure texts.\\ 2) Textual attribute tagging. In this step, global textual attributes are tagged in the text. For example, the domain of the text is tagged in this step. This step is done with a special simple bilingual editor, which assists human to insert tags in the beginning of the text. 3) Parallel Alignment. Parallel alignment at paragraph and sentence level is done in this step with the alignment tools. For most of the texts, the alignment accuracy can be more than 98%. 4) Human verification of the alignment result. All the alignment results are verified and errors are corrected by human in this step. For the high accuracy of the alignment tools, human work is dramatically reduced. 5) Bilingual texts mark-up. With this step, the verified texts are encoded into XML format according to our mark-up guidelines. The XML mark-up is done automatically with XML encoding tools. 6) Segmentation and POS tagging of the Chinese texts. The Chinese part of the texts are automatically segmented and POS tagged with automatic tools. Due to the huge work required, the segmentation and POS tagged result is not verified by human, which might be done in later time. But we also believe that unverified segmentation and POS tagging are also helpful for many purposes. 7) Indexing the texts. The final processed texts are indexed and compiled for late use.  <TEXT> <TEXT_HEAD>","<MODE>书面语</MODE><FIELD>工商</FIELD><STYLE>新闻</STYLE>","<PERIOD>当代</PERIOD><CH_TITLE>今年中国经济和社会发展八项任务</CH_TITLE> </TEXT_HEAD> <TEXT_BODY>","<p id=\"1\"> <a id=\"1\" no=\"1\"> <s id=\"1\"> <CH_TITLE><w pos=\"t\">今年</w> <w pos=\"ns\">中国</w> <w pos=\"n\">经济</w> <w pos=\"c\">和</w> <w pos=\"n\">社会</w> <w pos=\"v\">发展</w> <w pos=\"m\">八</w> <w pos=\"q\">项</w> <w pos=\"n\">任务</w></CH_TITLE></s></a></p>","<p id=\"2\">"]},{"title":"3 Concordancing the corpus: building tool for using the corpus","paragraphs":["To facilitate research using parallel corpus in the field of bilingual dictionary compilation, language teaching and contrastive language study between Chinese and English, a parallel concordancer has been developed. It has a GUI interface and is compatible with the XML markup scheme.  3.1 Corpus indexing Corpus search can be time consuming, especially when searching of frequently used words. To make the search faster, the corpus texts need to be indexed. Inverted index is used in the concordance tool. For the corpus is always growing in size and language researcher or lexicographers might be only interested with part of the corpus, so the index is designed to be incremental. New texts can be easily put into without reindexing the entire corpus as long as the new texts are proper\\ly encoded in XML.  3.2 Search for words or patterns in both languages Searching can be either monolingual or bilingual, exact match or fuzzy match and either single word or a word pattern. User's searching intent could be specified using a mini-query language. Figure-3 shows the result of searching for Chinese word \"民主\" and English word \"democracy\", which lists all sentence pairs containing \"民主\" in the Chinese part and \"democracy\" in the English part, language researchers or translators could examine how many times the Chinese word \"民主\" is translated into English word \"democracy\". Figure-3. Result of searching for Chinese word \"民主\" and English word \"democracy\"  Language researchers or translators might not care the translation of a word, say \"民主\", or they want to investigate all possible translations, they can just query the corpus only with that word, then all sentence pairs with that word will be listed. In this way, they will find other possible translations of that word by checking the sentence translations, for example, \" 民主\" could be translated as \"democracy\" and \"democratic\" as well. It's also possible for a bilingual lexicographer to find a translation word that is not recorded in the existing bilingual dictionaries, so he might decide to include it in his dictionary project. For all the Chinese texts are POS tagged, so the concordance tool enable searches for words with particular word class, for example, they could query the corpus for the occurrences of \"翻译\"1 as noun or as verb. They can just type the word with the POS tag interested in the query box as \"翻译/n\". Fuzzy search enables searching against all inflectional forms of English words; for example, one might be interested with all inflectional forms of word \"take\". He could search the corpus with fuzzy search.  1 \"翻译\" , as a noun, means \"translator\" or \"interpretor\", means \"translate\" as a verb,.  ...党派阶级的民主政治的斗争... ...the struggle for democracy is bound to mani... ...基本的是从民主政治斗争中... ...the struggle for democracy .

PACLIC 18, December 8th-10th, 2004, Waseda University, Tokyo Chinese is not a morphological language. Most of Chinese words do not have morphological variants. However, but different Chinese linguists might have different opinions when talking about whether a certain character string constitute a word. Thus in a segmented corpus, both \"民主\" and \"民主集中制2\" are segmented as word. Fuzzy search for \"民主\" could also list occurrences of \"民主集中制\" in the corpus. Apart from the above-mentioned simple query on corpus, the mini-query language could be used to form complex query intention. Users can search patterns against corpus. For example, an English teacher might be interested in listing occurrences of pattern \"take...into...account\", which he could use them as class examples. Such search requirement could be accomplished with an expression like \"*take+10into+10account\" in the concordance tool, the number after \"+\" stands for the maximum distance between words in the expression. As an example for Chinese, the following query expression \"* 一+8就-\" will list sentence pairs containing pattern \"一...就...\", with at most 8 words between \"一\"and \"就\", but without comma in between.  3.3 Sorting the search result Language researchers maybe want to reorder the search result. They maybe want to group the resulted sentence pairs with similar context words. The parallel concordancer enables users to reorder the searching results against the context words of the search words. Figures-4 shows a sorting result against the pervious word of the search word \"民主\"."," ...没有无产阶级的民主和无产阶级的... ...工作和一系列的民主改革的任务...","...发展这样的民主政治斗争,因为它对于我们是有利无害的... ...这是一个重大的民主运动...","...发扬民主不会妨碍统一领导...","...集中制,发扬民主,加强集中...","...,在充分发扬民主的基础上,...","...怎么样,这对于发扬民主有好处...","...,这对于发扬民主,贯彻执行...","...真正地发展民主,民主政治斗... ...有意识地去发展民主政治的斗争,...","","Figure-4.

It could be used as measurement of the commonness of a word. For now, the parallel concordance tool could produce frequency list for both Chinese and English based on the texts loaded in the memory.

Frequency lists  3.6 Guessing translation word for a search word Given the searching results are bilingual, a guessing mechanism based on hypothesis and test is implemented in the tool, which can list possible candidate translation words for a Chinese word or English word. Certainly, such guessing is not always 100% accurate, but it's helpful for the user to know the most frequently used translation of the search word. A translator might be interested with such information. In addition, the parallel concordancing tool also provides operations to select, copy, paste or saving the search results, so that they could be used by the user in other situation.

Among them are: (1) As the translation memory of a Monograph oriented Machine Aided Translation System. Actually, the original goal of building such corpus was providing translation examples for MT systems. Sentence and their translation could be easily extracted from the corpus and put into the translation memory. So far, 400,000 Chinese-English sentence pairs have been used in the above mentioned Monograph oriented MAT System. (2) Contrastive study on Chinese and English passive form. BAI Xiaojing and ZHAN Weidong (2003) explored how English passive form could be translated into Chinese, either with Chinese preposition \" 被\" or not. The conclusion is draw from observing the corpus. (3) Using the corpus in the bilingual dictionary compilation. With the help of the concordancing tool, a joint effort to compile a medium-sized Chinese-English learner dictionary has been started. Also a workbench for lexicographers is also under development to help them in their work to build dictionary based on parallel corpus."]},{"title":"5 Conclusion","paragraphs":["Chinese-English parallel corpus is certainly important resources for cross-language information processing, and also important resources for Chinese-English bilingual lexicography, language research and teaching.
