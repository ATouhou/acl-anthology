It is interesting to note that the English counterpart to kiru, i.e. cut can participate in so-called Light Verb Construction when it co-occurs with event nominals, similarly to other well-established light verbs like take and have. For instance, parallel to (2a), we can say (2b) as well as (2c).  (1) Taroo-ga biiru-o nomi-ki-tta.","Taroo-NOM beer-ACC drink-cut-PAST","‘Taroo drank the beer to the last drop.’ (2) a. John looked at the clock quickly.","b. John cut a quick look at the clock.","c. John {had/took} a quick look at the clock. [Light Verb Construction]  From observation of (3), however, it seems that these two verbs differ in selection restrictions on their complements. While kiru co-occurs with a constituent that denotes an activity of drinking, cut does not. Conversely, while cut takes a look as its complement, kiru does not combine with mi- ‘to look’.  (3) a.

PACLIC 18, December 8th-10th, 2004, Waseda University, Tokyo Based on the Generative Lexicon Theory, this paper analyzes the event structures of these two forms ‘cut+an event nominal’ and V-kiru, and accounts for the difference in selection restriction between the two. "]},{"title":"2 What Cut and Kiru Have in Common 2.1 The main verbs cut and kiru – division and creation","paragraphs":["Cut and kiru, as main verbs, both express not only division sense but also creation sense as in (4).  (4) a. John cut {a pattern out of paper/a key/a slice of cake}.","b. Taroo-ga {katagami/mado/irori}-o ki-tta.","Taroo-NOM {pattern/window/fireplace}-ACC cut-PAST ‘Taroo {cut a pattern/installed a window frame/built in a fireplace}.’  When a nominal is incompatible with the type of complement that a verb calls for, it could be that the interaction between these constituents gives rise to a new sense. This semantic operation is called co-composition (see Pustejovsky 1995). This generative device explains the mechanism by which the creation sense is derived from the division sense of cut. For example, the composition of cut and a key produces a sense of creation. Since a key in cut a key is not a cut material but a product, it would appear that this nominal conflicts with the meaning of cut. However, considering that keys are artifacts produced by cutting metal, it would be appropriate to assume that this information is unified with the sense of cut in a certain way. Figure 1 is a semantic representation of cut a key. This figure shows that cut a key embeds within it division sense, or the inherent sense of cut. This compositional operation is done by unification of qualia values for the agentive role in cut and its argument nominal a key, or ‘divide (e)’, as represented by the Generative Lexicon notation. In this way the creation sense arises compositionally and therefore it should not be enumerated in its name in the lexicon. Although details of creation sense of kiru must be omitted due to limitations of space, it has the same compositional process as that of cut. The sense is thus not an inherent but a derived one for the same reason.

For instance, sentences in (5) are approximately equal to ‘John looked at the clock quickly’ or ‘Taroo drank the beer to the last drop’, not to ‘John stopped looking at the clock quickly’ or ‘Taroo stopped drinking the beer’.

As seen from Table 1, they explicitly differentiate basic (non-causative) event types from their causative counterparts. The former correspond to Vendler’s (1967) four aspectual classes (states, activities, achievements, and accomplishments). Furthermore, Van Valin & LaPolla add another type to these; active accomplishments, which are the accomplishment use of activity predicates. Carl ran to the store is a basic version of this type. They argue that active accomplishments are not causative, since ‘Carl’s running caused him to arrive at the store’ does not paraphrase the original sentence appropriately.  Basic Causative States John knew the story. John frightened the dog. Activities John ran. John ran the dog. Achievements The balloon popped. John popped the balloon.

Event types (Van Valin & LaPolla 1997)  Run is a lexical activity predicate. This verb can be modified by a durative adverbial as in (8a), not by a frame adverbial. In contrast, when it combines with a prepositional phrase to the store, modification by a frame adverbial is well formed, while that by a durative adverbial is ill formed. Therefore, what (8b) expresses is an accomplishment. According to Pustejovsky (1991), the prepositional phrase in this example plays the role of a function shifting an argument walk from activity to accomplishment. To return to the main topic of this paper, we can also regard cut or kiru as aspectual function2",", since these verbs shift delimitedness, as we have already seen in Section 2. In the following sections, the properties of the verbs as aspectual functions are discussed in more detail.  (8) a. Carl ran {for an hour/*in an hour}. [Activity]","b.

PACLIC 18, December 8th-10th, 2004, Waseda University, Tokyo It can be said that not only ‘cut+a concrete nominal’ but also ‘cut+an event nominal’ generates creation sense, since performing an event is, in other words, creating an event. Compositional operation of the latter construction is parallel to that of the former. As observed in Figure 2, a scream is brought about by measuring out an unbounded activity of screaming, ‘scream_act (e)’ (in the sense of Tenny 1994). Since the agentive role of a scream, ‘measure_out (e)’, do not contradict that of cut, ‘divide (e)’, they unify and yield a creation reading, where the entire cut a scream expresses a temporally bounded activity of screaming.

Representation of cut a scream in the framework of Generative Lexicon  That is, the sense of cut in a ‘cut+a concrete nominal’ corresponds to that of cut in ‘cut+an event nominal’, and both of the constructions share the same compositional process and underlying principles. It is clear that there is no need to enumerate these two words as different lexical items, so to speak, cut1 (heavy verb) and cut2 (function or light verb) in the lexicon. The only difference is that whether a complement of cut is a concrete artifact or an event. It is not widely known that event nominals collocating with cut show a specific distribution. It is predictable, however, what type of nominal cut takes. The physical products created by ‘cutting’ consist of one homogeneous material. In cut a diamond and cut a key, for example, these products are made from diamond and metal, respectively. These materials are uniform in nature. This is one of the distinctive features of cut creation, since other means of creation require multiple ingredients, such as assembling a car from parts, and composing a poem from words. This uniformity of materials is metaphorically conceptualized as atelicity of events, since atelic events do not contain multiple subevents. As shown in Figure 3, states and activities consist of one uniform event and lack an inherent end point. In contrast, the other two types consist of more than one subevent and contain a logical culmination. It is the notion of atelicity that distinguishes the former from the latter. The two latter, atelic events, differ from each other is that whereas the initial event (e1) of an accomplishment is an activity, that of an achievement is underspecified (Alsina 1999).

Basic event types and their internal structures  Consequently, as shown in Table 2, cut co-occurs with a basic state or activity nominal, but not with other event nominals.Causative events are heterogeneous in that they consist of a causing event and a caused event.

Distribution of nominal complements of cut  Another feature of ‘cut+a concrete nominal’ is reduction in size of products. Resulting products are inevitably smaller than their materials. This follows naturally from the means of creation involved in cutting, being done by removal, not by addition. This feature is metaphorically conceptualized as temporality of events. The ‘cut+a(n)’ frame delimits a logically unbounded event. On the one hand, the verbs look or smile depict an activity with indefinite length. On the other hand, these activities, when nominalized and incorporated into the ‘cut+a(n)’ frame, result in temporally bounded activities, as in (6) above. In summary, the function cut takes an unbounded basic state or activity as its argument, and converts it into a temporally bounded event.

Scheme of cut a smile"]},{"title":"5 The Semantics of V-Kiru","paragraphs":["In order to find out properties of the function kiru, let us first see what kind of constituents precedes this verb. Although V-kiru denotes a delimited event as well as ‘cut+an event nominal’, we have seen in (3) above that the two verbs differ in selection restrictions on their complements. In examples of (10), kiru follows predicates denoting a state, activity, achievement, and accomplishment respectively. As far as these examples are concerned, only an accomplishment co-occurs with kiru. The change Taroo experiences in (10d) is gradual. Whereas tsukareru ‘to get tired’ does not specify the degree of fatigue, an adverbial sukoshi in (11), which refers to an intermediate point of the scale, cannot co-occur with kiru. It is thus clear that kiru denotes that an event gets to the end point of a scale (see Figures 5).  (10) a. *Tsukue-ni hana-ga ari-ki-tta. table-on flower-NOM be-cut-PAST","‘There were flowers on the table thoroughly.","b. *Taroo-ga subayaku tokei-o mi-ki-tta.

But this is not true. Example (12) shows that it is not predictable which predicate combines with kiru PACLIC 18, December 8th-10th, 2004, Waseda University, Tokyo only from event types of verbs. The difference in grammaticality of (12a) and (12b) depends on whether or not the theme in an event can undergo an incremental change. Whereas umbrellas can be used semipermanently, bus cards cannot be used any more once they run out of value. Namely,bus cards are incrementally affected. Although basukaado-o tsukau in (12a) is ambiguous between an activity and an accomplishment reading, kiru resolves the ambiguity to mean an accomplishment exclusively. On the other hand, kasa-o tsukau cannot precede kiru because using an umbrella lacks a culmination point. The same is said for (13). While (13a) is ambiguous between an activity and an accomplishment reading, (13b) expresses the second reading exclusively where the theme biiru is regarded as a certain amount.  (12) a. Taroo-ga {kasa/basukaado}-o tsuka-tta. [Activity/Accomplishment]","Taroo-NOM {umbrella/bus card}-ACC use-PAST","‘Taroo used {an umbrella/a bus card}.’ b.

[Accomplishment] Taroo-NOM {one-day-for/one-hour-in} beer-ACC drink-cut-PAST ‘Taroo drank the beer to the last drop {all day/in an hour}.’  In sum, kiru is a function that coerces its argument into the accomplishment type. Such a semantic operation is called type coercion where, when an argument conflicts with the type that a function calls for, the function shifts it to the appropriate type (Pustejovsky 1995). It is not to say that kiru takes any type as its argument. Arguments should have the potential to shift from its original event type to an accomplishment. In composition with kiru, a bus card in (12) and beer in (13) can be taken as an incremental theme (Dowty 1991). This property enables an original event, or an activity to obtain a state as the final event (e2) to compose an accomplishment (see Figure 7). (10a,b) above are ungrammatical since neither of the themes can be regarded as incrementally affected.  Activity Accomplishment "]},{"title":"e","paragraphs":["1......"]},{"title":"e","paragraphs":["n"]},{"title":"e","paragraphs":["1:Activity"]},{"title":"e","paragraphs":["2:State ","Figure 7. Type coercion from activity to accomplishment  In (14), unlike reading ten books, for example, reading numerous books seems to lack a culmination point, since the number of books is not limited. Nevertheless, hon-o nansatsu-mo yomu ‘to read numerous books’ goes along with kiru. This is made possible by kiru’s assigning the role of incremental theme not to the books as a whole, but to each and every book. The resulting sentence has an iterative reading. This is another example of type coercion by kiru. (14) Taroo-ga hon-o nansatsu-mo yomi-ki-tta. Taroo-NOM book-ACC numerous read-cut-PAST ‘Taroo read numerous books thoroughly.’  The concept of incremental theme also accounts for why some telic predicates as in (10c) do not co-occur with kiru. A balloon in (10c) cannot be thought of as an incremental theme since change to the balloon is not gradual, but instantaneous, in contrast to that of Taroo in (10d). By pluralizing the theme as in (15), however, it becomes an incremental theme and the sentence involving kiru expresses an accomplishment. In this case, the initial event (e1), whose type is underspecified, shifts to an activity, which has duration (see Figure 8).
