Focus particle can follow nouns, quantifiers, verbs, other particles (postpositions) and auxiliary verbs. Thus, it is necessary for a large-scale grammar to treat focus particles properly. Furthermore, there are syntactic and semantic ambiguities caused by the particles. We propose phrase structure rules and lexical entry constraints which cover focus particles in various positions and account for the ambiguities. 1 Introduction As has been observed in many studies, various functional relations are expressed by particles in Japanese. In particular, particles such as k̀urar , b̀akarr , 'clake', ǹomr, h̀odo' and 'made' specify focus in sentences. It has been observed that these particles mark contrastive focus within sentences (Numata et al., 2000). It is important for a Japanese parsing system to be able to treat these focus particles properly, because focus particles bear different syntactic functions depending on where they appear in a given Japanese construction. In this paper, we propose phrase structure rules and lexical entry constraints to treat Japanese focus particles on the basis of the Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) formalism (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982; Dalrymple, 2001). The proposed rules and constraints for treating focus particles have been incorporated into a Japanese LFG system we are currently developing and have been used extensively for parsing real-world Japanese text. 2 Japanese LFG system Our Japanese LFG parsing system development aims at broad coverage and deep analysis (Masuichi and Ohkuma, 2003; Masuichi et al., 2003).","The lexical entries for the words in the input are created by the output of the Chasen morphological analyzer (Matsumoto et al., 1999). In addition to these lexical entries, we have other lexicon files for verbs, adjectives, adjectival nouns and function words.","Lexical entries for verbs, adjectives and adjectival nouns were written based on the case frame information in the Japanese IPAL dictionary (IPA, 1987) and have been manually enhanced. 448 Lexical entries for verbs consist of 10,387 entries and 41,115 functional annotations for 2,366 verbs. Lexical entries for adjectives and for adjectival nouns consist of 947 entries and 2,197 functional annotations for 369 words in total.","Lexical entries of focus particles are included in our 'core lexical entries'. Core lexical entries include those for basic words such as auxiliary verbs, postpositional particles and so forth, plus syntactically important nouns such as t̀oki' (time) and àida' (interval) and consist of 1,252 entries and 1,913 functional annotations for 675 words.","Phrase structure rules and constraints for focus particles are described in the grammar rules. The grammar rules include 2,468 terms in their disjunctive normal forms and 1,223 functional annotations. The Japanese grammar rules have been designed in such a waty that we could capture cross-linguistic parallelisms (Ohkuma and Masuichi, 2002; Kim et al., 2003), which is one of the major objectives of the Parallel Grammar Project (parGram) (Butt et al., 2002). ParGram uses the parser and grammar development platform XLE for six languages: English, French, German, Norwegian, Japanese, and Urdu .","XLE outputs all possible analyses of the input as c(onstituent)-structures and f(unctional)- structures. C-structure encodes phrasal dominance and precedence relations and is represented as a phrase structure tree. F-structure encodes syntactic predicate argument structure and is represented as an attribute-value matrix (Maxwell and Kaplan, 1993)."]},{"title":"3 Japanese focus particles","paragraphs":["Japanese focus particles can follow nouns, quantifiers, verbs, auxiliary verbs and other particles (Numata et al., 2000).
