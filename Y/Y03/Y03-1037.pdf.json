Introduction)","Verb order is an important issue in complex multi-verbal predicate constructions, for example, serial verb constructions (SVCs). With more than one verb in the construction, how are the verbs sequenced? What constraints are at play to govern their order? In this paper, we attempt to investigate several constraints that are related to the issue. We also propose a different ranking of these constraints for Cantonese, a Yue dialect spoken in the southeastern parts of China, and Dagaare, a Gur language spoken in the northwestern areas of Ghana, to account for the different verb orderings found in these two languages for SVCs.","We adopt an optimality-theoretic approach in our analysis. One of the advantages of doing so is that languages can be compared quite easily and effectively. This is because in Optimality Theory (OT), constraints are ranked. Each language has a different ranking of constraints and it is the rankings of the same set of constraints that are compared. This is the focus of the paper. A number of constraints are ranked and the rankings are used to account for and to compare the verb order phenomena of Cantonese and Dagaare SVCs.","The outline of our paper is as follows. We first undertake a brief survey of the phenomenon of SVCs in section 2. We then investigate each constraint that will be employed in our analysis of verb order in SVCs in section 3. In section 4 we attempt to model the verb order of Cantonese SVCs. Section 5 provides an account of the verb order of Dagaare SVCs. Section 6 concludes the paper. 2. The Phenomenon — Serial Verb Constructions (SVCs)","Cantonese and Dagaare both allow verb serialization. A serial verb construction is, very broadly speaking, a construction that has two or more lexical verbs within a single clause. None of the verbs can be considered as contributing 'less' to the semantics of the whole construction, unlike the constructions which involve 'light' verbs in the Romance languages. Also unlike these constructions, the choice of verbs in SVCs is rather flexible. Verb serialization is not confined to any particular verbs. Consider the Cantonese SVC example in (1): (1) \\t"]},{"title":"iffi","paragraphs":["ngo5","\\t zaal_gan2 cel lai4\\t","zips","\\t leis","\\t","aa32","1.SG drive.PROG car come pick-up 2.SG PART'.","Ì am on my way to pick you up.","1 We thank Mary Dalrymple for giving us useful comments on this paper.","2 The romanization scheme adopted in this paper is based on the one developed by The Linguistic Society of Hong Kong (2002). There are altogether six tones in this scheme: 1 = high level; 2 = high rising; 3 = mid level; 4 = low falling; 5 = low rising; 6 = low level. The tone is marked at the end of each character.","3 Symbols and abbreviations used in this paper: * = Ungrammaticality/ Violation of Constraint; ! = Fatal Violation; = Optimal Output; 1= First Person; 2 = Second Person; COMP = Complementizer; FOC = Focus Marker; NOM = Nominalizing Particle; PART = Particle; PROG = Progressive Aspect; SG = Singular. 328","The SV construction in (1) has three verbs. They are, namely, zaal 'to drive', lai4 'to come' and zip5 'to pick (somebody) up'. With more than one verb, a reasonable question to ask is why the verbs are ordered the way they are ordered.

The only difference lies in the order of the verbs. 3. The Constraints 3.1 PTP","One of the many constraints that governs the ordering of verbs in an SVC is the Principle of Temporal Precedence (Bodomo 1997:38), as shown in (4):","(4) The Principle of Temporal Precedence (PTP) Let S=SVC and E=Event, Let vl and v2 = Verbs in S and el and e2 = parts of E Suppose S is a grammatical encoding of E and vl and v2 encode el and e2 respectively, If el temporally precedes e2 Then vl must structurally precede v2. This constraint is reformulated as:","(5) PTP (Following Kager (1999:251)) T̀he precedence structure of the VPs in an SVC is consistent with that of the actions in its corresponding event structure.' Let a,13 e VPs in SVC and a', 13' a actions in event structure If a R a' and 13 R 13', then","a < iff -(13' < a')","PTP aims at capturing the iconicity between syntax and semantics. If a part of an event el is conceptualized as occurring before another part of the event e2, then the ideal case would be to have the structure encoding this event reflect this linear relationship. The cases, however, are not always ideal. In Cantonese, for instance, examples where PTP is violated can be easily found, as (6) shows:"]},{"title":"(6) 40\\tfiTc\\tq:\\tft\\tM\\t*","paragraphs":["zip5\\tlei5\\taa3\\tngo5\\tzaal_gan2\\tcel\\tlai4 pick-up 2.SG PART. 1.SG drive.PROG car \\tcome Ì am picking you up and I am coming on my car.' 329","PTP is violated in (6). The default order of actions in the event should be 'drive, come and pick (you) up'. This order is iconically realized in the SVC in (1), which is the canonical, or most unmarked, structure. The fact that the violation of PI? in (6) does not result in the ungrammaticality of the sentence indicates that there must be, in this language at least, a constraint that outranks PTP. This ranking would give an output that does not observe PTP, as in the case of (6). 3.2 NEw","One constraint that appears to militate against PTP is NEw. NEW is a pair of correspondence constraints between c(onstituent)-structure and i(nformation)-structure (Choi 2001). NEW includes:","(7) NEw (Choi 2001:34)4 NEW-R : [+New] aligns right in the clause. NEW-L: [+New] aligns left in the clause. For NEW-L and NEW-R, one violation is incurred for every unit that stands between the target unit and the relevant edge.","[±New] is an information feature. Each constituent in a clause is assigned a value for this feature based on its discourse status. A constituent is assigned [+New] if it is the focus or new information, and conversely. NEW-R requires that the constituent that has the feature [+New] align right in the clause, while NEW-L requires it to align left. Whether a [+New] constituent aligns left or right is a language-specific option, but since there are languages that select either option, both constraints are required in the universal set of constraints. Some languages even allow both options (Samek-Lodovici 2001, cited in Choi 2001). If a language aligns the focused constituent leftwards, then NEW-L is ranked higher than NEw-R in that language, and vice versa. Data show that, as both Cantonese and Dagaare align the focused constituents leftwards, they have the same ranking with regard to this pair of constraints: (8) NEW-L » NEW-R 3.3 *RED","Not all languages allow PTP to be violated, not even when one of the VPs in the SVC is focused. Dagaare is a case in point. In Dagaare, the effect of PTP is so strong that no other factor seems to be able to disrupt the order of VPs. This indicates that PTP is ranked very high in this language. How is focus marked in this language then? Consider (9):","(9) a.\\to3\\t4-o3 yo3or3 virk= Ace,.

COMP 3.SG run \\tgo\\tchink D̀rinking water, s/he gets water to drink.' 4 L̀eft' here refers to the left edge of the sentence, while 'right' refers to the right edge of the sentence. The assumption seems to be that sentences in languages are written from left to right. This may cause problems to cultures which are known to record their language on paper from right to left, for instance, Chinese and Arabic. Perhaps less-confusing names for this pair of constraints would be NEw-BEGIN and NEW-END. This would solve the problem quite easily as each sentence, no matter how it is written and whether it is written or spoken, must have a beginning and an end. 330","If a VP is focused, in other words, assigned [+New], in this language, it will be realized by its nominalized form. It is the nominalized form that aligns with the left edge of the sentence, as (9b) shows. The VP stays in its ordinary position to maintain the default verb order.","As this process is not universal, for example, this process is not found in Cantonese, there must be constraints that prevent this from happening. A constraint that would serve this function is *RED, defined below in (10):","( 1 0) *RED(UNDANT) Any redundant c-structure constituent is not allowed. A redundant c-structure constituent is one which does not contribute unique information to any of its parallel structures (e.g. f(unctional)-structure). For *RED, one violation is incurred for every redundant c-structure constituent.","This constraint is ranked higher than PTP in Cantonese, but is ranked lower than PTP in Dagaare. In Cantonese, PTP can be violated, provided that the VP that is responsible for the violation is focused. As the discourse status of the VP is the motivation for the violation of PTP, NEw-L must be higher-ranked than PTP. In Dagaare, however, PTP cannot be violated, regardless of the discourse status of the VPs in the SVC. Focus is marked by repeating and nominalizing the focused VP at the beginning of the clause. NEw-L is still observed in this case, as the focused constituent still aligns left. The rankings of all the constraints discussed in this section for Cantonese and Dagaare are given in (11 ):","(11) a.\\tRanking for Cantonese: *RED, New-L >> PTP >> NEW-R","b.

Modelling Verb Order in Cantonese SVCs","In this section, Cantonese SVCs will be analyzed and their verb order will be accounted for using the ranking in (11 a).

We shall account for all these with the ranking given in (11a) for Cantonese. First, assume that none of the VPs is assigned the feature [+New], or focused.

All the other candidates have different degrees of violation of PTP. The constraint NEw-R in this case does not affect the selection of the optimal candidate. This is because any violation of PTP, a higher-ranked constraint than NEW-R, is enough to eliminate the chance of that candidate being the optimal output. Tableau (15) shows that, if none of the VPs in the SVC is focused, the order of verbs in (15a) will emerge as the most unmarked, or the canonical, order. This is because one of the highest-ranked constraints, NEwL, is vacuously satisfied as there is no [+New] constituent in this case.","Now, suppose that one of the VPs is focused, or bears the [+New] feature, which verb order will survive as the optimal candidate? We shall first consider the case in which the VP zaal_gan2 cel bears the [+New] feature: 5 The examples given in (13) are by no means an exhaustive list of all the possible word orders. We must emphasize that, for the time being, we are only concerned with the verb order of SVCs. The word order in Cantonese, in general, also involves issues such as pro-drop, the position of the pronoun if not dropped and the position of the particle aa3. All these make the whole picture of word order involving SVCs in Cantonese far too complicated for the scope of this paper. 6 We will assume for now that the particle must occur after the VP that appears last in the canonical order of verbs, i.e. the VP [zip5 leis] in this case. 332 Input: Order of actions = [zaal_gan2 cell i+Newi + [lai4][-New]+","zi• 5 lei5 -New NEw-L *RED PTP NEw-R b. zi,5 lei5 vp aa3\\tvpzaal :an2 cel *1** *f* *f**","[zaal_gan2 ce1]vp[zaal_gan2 ce1]vp[lai4]vp[zip5 lei5]vp aa3 *f** zaal :an2 cel vp lai4 vp zi,5 lei5 vp aa3a.","lai4\\tzaal • an2 cel vp zi,5 lei5 aa3c.","d. laid vp zi,5 lei5 vp aa3 zaal ,:an2 cel vp","zi,5 lei vp aa3 zaal ,:an2 cel vp laid vpe.","f. lei5 vp aa3 lai4 vp zaal :an2 cel vp","Input:","Order of actions = [zaal_gan2 cel] [_New] + [lai4]E+Newl+","zi,5 lei5 -New","zaal :an2 eel vp lai4 vp zi,5 lei5 vp aa3 lai4 vp zi,5 lei5 vp aa3 zaal :an2 eel vp","Input:","Order of actions = [zaal_gan2 cel] [_New] + [lai4][-New]+","zi,5 lei5 +New zaal :an2 cel vp lai4 vp zi,5 lei5 vp aa3 zaal :an2 cel vp zi,5 lei5 vp aa3 lai' vp zi,5 lei5 vp aa3 zaal :an2 cel vp laid VP [zips\\t[zaal_gan2 cel ]vp [lai4]vp[zip5 lei5]vp aa3 16","Tableau (16) shows that the optimal candidate is still the (a) candidate. With the VP zaal_gan2 cel bearing the [+New] feature, not only do candidates (16c) to (160 incur different degrees of violation of PTP, they also violate NEw-L to different extents. Candidate (16g) is designed to imitate the Dagaare way of marking focus. This candidate is also out because it violates *RED, which, according to the ranking in Cantonese, is not allowed. The only two candidates that remain after the 'first round of competition' are (16a) and (16b). However, in this r̀ound', (16b) loses because it violates PTP while (16a) has no violation of PTP. (16a) survives as the optimal output.","This result is indeed quite logical.

Among them, the candidate that has fewer violations of PTP, candidate (d) in (17) and candidate (e) in (18) respectively, becomes the optimal candidate. 5. Modelling Verb Order in Dagaare SVCs","The same set of constraints that has been used to model verb order in Cantonese SVCs can also be used to account for the verb order in Dagaare SVCs. In fact, unlike Cantonese, only one verb order is allowed in Dagaare. This is because PTP is ranked high in this language. Consider tableau (19):","There are seven candidates in tableau (19). The candidates that are first eliminated from being the optimal output are (19e), (190 and (19g). These three candidates all incur violations of PTP, one of the two highest ranked constraints. Of the four candidates that remain, candidates (19b), (19c) and (19d) are also out because they violate *RED. Candidate (19a) becomes the optimal output by having no violations for all of the relevant constraints.","The constraints NEw-L and NEw-R are vacuously satisfied for all seven candidates. With none of the VPs bearing the [+New] feature, none of them has to align either direction. Even with one of the VPs bearing the [+New] feature, the order of the VPs is still the same within the SVC. This, again, is due to the high ranking of PTP.

It is only in this structure that the constituent that bears the [+New] feature aligns left. An interesting point about this structure is that NEw-L is not satisfied by a VP, but by an NP. By aligning the NP that bears the focus with the left edge of the sentence, NEw-L can be satisfied even with the order of the verbs in the SVC retained, thus satisfying PTP simultaneously. This may be regarded as the Dagaare solution for the competition between PTP, which strives to keep the order of verbs the same as the order of actions they encode, and NEw-L, which tend to disrupt the verb order (as shown for the Cantonese examples above). The solution, of course, is brought about at the expense of violating *RED. Assigning the [+New] feature to the VPs roax3and v \\tKo3 will give similar results. Consider the tableau in (21):","If ya3a3 is assigned [+New], the optimal output will be (21c), which is the only candidate that completely satisfies NEw-I, as shown in (21).

Separating the word that denotes direction from the word that denotes action may pose interpretation problems for the speaker/hearer. This may have caused the unacceptability of (21c). A relevant question is, of course, whether there is communicative motivation to focus on yoa x3, i.e. whether there is motivation to assign [+New] to ya3a3 in the input. 7 There is a total of six violations for NEW-R because there are six constituents between the right edge of the sentence and Zo3 cannot be the constituent that bears the focus here as this discourse function is already realized by Co.?..vss-v-. a An additional piece of evidence showing that 4\"o3 is not the focused constituent comes from the fact that 4-o3 cannot bear any emphatic stress.

Conclusion","paragraphs":["We have demonstrated in this paper that verb order in serial verb constructions can be successfully accounted for by the interaction of four constraints. These constraints are PTP, NEw-L, NEw-R and *RED. PTP requires that the order of actions in a complex event be reflected iconically by the order of verbs that denote these actions. NEw-L and NEw-R are constraints that seem to be militating against PTP by demanding that the focused constituent align with the left or the right edge of the sentence. In both Cantonese and Dagaare, the alignment is oriented to the left edge of the sentence. *RED is one version of the general Economy Principle. C-structure constituents that do not contribute unique information to any of the parallel structures should be eliminated. In other words, useless or redundant c-structure constituents should not be allowed. 9 See footnote 4 for (similar) explanation. 336","These four constraints have different patterns of interaction in the two languages under consideration. More specifically, they are ranked differently in the two languages. The different rankings give rise to very different verb order phenomena in the SVCs of the two languages. In Cantonese, NEw-L and *RED are ranked higher than PTP and NEw-R such that focus is realized by the left-alignment of the focused VP at the expense of PTP. The case is very different in Dagaare. In this language, PTP plays a much more important role. PTP and NEw-L outrank *RED and NEw-R. The iconic order of verbs must be preserved in Dagaare. Focus is marked by the left-alignment of the NP, which is a morphological derivative of the corresponding verb, and the occurrence of the emphatic focus marker after the NP. PTP is satisfied at the cost of NEw-L and *RED.","One of the major advantages for adopting an optimality-theoretic approach in the analysis is that in such an analysis, failure to satisfy certain (lower-ranked) constraints is allowed. This makes it possible to account for data from different languages, as we have done for Cantonese and Dagaare, or even apparently 'contradicting' data within the same language, as the approach we have taken with respect to the seemingly 'opposing' forces of NEw-L and PTP in Cantonese, with only a small set of constraints. An approach that does not recognize the possibility of constraint violation will likely create a much larger set of constraints to account for the same data, with the need to include many èxceptions', which, in the authors' opinion, will make weaker a case for the generalizations that can be made across languages. 337 References Bodomo, A.
