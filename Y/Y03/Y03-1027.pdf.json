The Institute of Computational Linguistics (ICL) of Peking University has been engaged in research and development of the Semantic Knowledge-base of Contemporary Chinese (SKCC) in the last eight years. This lexicon-building project was collaboration with the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences during 1994-1998, and resulted in a machine-readable bilingual lexicon suitable for use with Machine Translation applications, which contained a fairly complete characterization of the semantic classification, valence specifications and collocation properties for 49 thousands Chinese words and their English counterparts [13. Since 2001, the further development of SKCC has been co-conducted by ICL and Chinese Department of Peking University. At present, SKCC has made great progress. Not only is the scale extended to 66,539 entries, but also the quality has been immensely improved. The semantic classification in the updated edition of SKCC is the embodiment of the very latest progress in Chinese linguistics and language engineering, while the semantic descriptions are comprehensive and thorough. It can provide rich lexical semantic information for various NLP applications. * Supported by China National Fundamental Research Program (973) (PN: G1998030507-4 & G1998030507-1). 243 2 Outline of SKCC 2.1 Scale and Structure SKCC consists of one general database and six sub-databases. The general database contains shared attributes of all the 66,539 entries, while the sub-databases provide detailed descriptions of the distinctive semantic attributes associated with the parts of speech (POS). For example, the verb database has 16 attribute fields, noun database and adjective database has 15 attribute fields respectively (see table 1).","Database Name Entries Attribute fields Attribute value nouns 38,478 15 576,555 verbs 21,142 16 338,272 adjective 5,577 15 ,\\t83,655 pronouns 236 15 3,540 adverbs 997 11 10,967 numerals 109 11 1,199 General 66,539 8 532,312 Total 133,078 91 1,546,500","Table 1 Scale of SKCC","All of the six sub-databases can be linked to the general database through four key fields, namely ENTRY, POS, HOMOMORPHISM and SENSE. As a result, the son knots can inherit all information from their father knots (Figure 1). Figure 1 Main structure of SKCC 2.2 Semantic Hierarchy One of the most outstanding characteristics of SKCC is that its semantic hierarchy is based on grammatical analysis, rather than merely on general knowledge (as illustrated in Figure 2). This classification system represents the latest progress in Chinese semantics. It is very useful for NLP applications [21 , as well as compatible with various semantic resources, such as Wordnet [31 , Chinese concept dictionary (CCD) E41 , HowNet[51 etc. Currently, the classification of all of the 66,539 entries has already been completed. 244 organism — animal \\t —plant \\t — microbe \\t — object — artifact \\t individua\\t group \\t beast \\t \\t bird ... tree \\t flower ... building works food clothes bill instrument • • • profession identity relation name organization society tool vehicle sports- instrument furniture ... person celestial body weather geography T land ••• water —natural object\\t 1\\t —abstractio process time spacespace — excrement — shape"]},{"title":"--E","paragraphs":["body-part object-part attribute rmeasurable I—immeasurable information field physiological state motivation rule psycho feature event111••••• —part — property of human — description of event — property of object r- cognition \\tfeelings natural phenomenon— visible phenomenon specific time\\t\\t audible phenomenon relative time location direction (1) Nouns entity 245","(2 ) Verbs\\t (3) Adjectives \\t state\\t description of event \\t emotion/cognition\\tproperty of object","\\t event — change\\t—measurable valu\\tconcentration \\t weather\\t — speed — body functions\\t — temperature \\t perception\\t — speed \\tconsumption\\t — length — motion\\t — height \\t creation\\t — width \\t contact\\t — depth \\t possession\\t rigidity \\tcommunication\\t — humidity \\t competition\\t — thickness \\t social behavior\\t — tightness \\t other event\\t — size value","immeasurable value— vision","(4) adverbs\\t — tactility \\t degree\\t — tone \\t range\\t — taste \\t time\\t — shape \\t location\\t — quality \\t frequency\\t — content \\t manner\\t —color \\t negation\\t property of human\\tage \\t modality\\t — character — relation","— condition","(5 ) numerals\\t \\t property of space \\tone dimension \\t cardinal number\\t —two dimension \\t ordinal number\\t —three dimension \\t amount\\t \\t property of time \\t auxiliary Figure 2 Semantic hierarchies in SKCC 2.3 Comprehensive Semantic Descriptions There is close correlation between lexical meaning and its distribution. Oriented to MT and Natural Language Understanding applications, SKCC can provide detailed semantic description and collocation behavior that in many cases is likely to be uniquely associated with a single sense. For .11.11.111.1 246 example, following attribute fields have already been filled with values in the verb database (see table 2).

Table 2 Semantic attributes in the verb database of SKCC To sum up, the above attributes fall into five kinds of information below:","(1) Basic information of entry, such as vocabulary item, part of speech, sub-category, homograph and pronunciation;","(2) Descriptions of word meaning, including sense number, definition, and semantic categories;","(3) Semantic valence, thematic roles and combinatorial properties for per words; this is the most important part of SKCC and especially useful for WSD and lexical semantics research;","(4) English translation and its POS tagging. If a Chinese word has two or more English counterparts, it will be regarded as different entries respectively, and the collocation information will also be given in relevant fields. This can significantly improve the quality of Chinese-English MT system.","(5) Corpus-derived authentic examples of a word in context, showing how it is used, how phrases are formed around it, and so on. 247 3 Application in WSD As a large-scale lexical knowledge base, SKCC combines the features of many of the other resources commonly exploited in NLP work: it includes definitions and English translations for individual senses of words within it, as in a bilingual dictionary; it organizes lexical concepts into a conceptual hierarchy, like a thesaurus; and it includes other links among words according to several semantic relations, including semantic role, collocation information etc. As such it currently provides the broadest set of lexical information in a single resource. The kind of information recorded and made available through SKCC is of a type usable for various NLP applications, including machine translation, automatic abstraction, information retrieval, hypertext navigation, thematic analysis, and","text processing. In this section, we shall focus on the automatic disambiguation of Chinese word senses involving SKCC since it is most troublesome, and essential for all the above NLP applications [61. 3.1 Determination of the polysemous words and homographs In general terms, word sense disambiguation (WSD) task necessarily involves two steps: (1) the determination of all the polysemous words and homographs in the text or discourse; and (2) a means to assign each occurrence of a word to the appropriate sense. Step (1) can be easily accomplished by reliance on SKCC. Firstly, each entry denotes one single sense of per word in SKCC. Thus, if a word has two or more senses, it will be regard as different entries, and the \"SENSE\" field will be filled with different number (as \"M\"in table 3).","ENTRY POS SENSE DEFINITION TRANSLATION ILLUSTRATIONS n 1 vegetable vegetable fril ----- (grow vegetables) I","\"' --(potherb)","X n 2 cooked vegetable, egg, fish, meat...etc. dish V — (meat or fish) I IN -------(four dishes and a bowl of soup) Table 3 Two senses of Chinese noun \"1\" Secondly, SKCC marked all of the homographs in \"HOMOMORPHISM\" field, such as two verbs \"A-\"with different pronunciation in table 4.

SKCC gives detailed description of such information in \"AGENT\" and/or \"OBJECT\" fields as illustrated in table 5 below.","ENTRY POS DEFINITION SENSE SEMANTIC AGENT TRANSLATI1 CLASS\\tN","?VA a (of food, drink, smell) light; weak 1 taste food I drink'\\tlight","plant","irlA\\ta\\tof business slack 2\\tcondition\\t\"business\"\\tslack Table 5 Polysemous adjectives in SKCC","Based on the above description, the target word \"ii-VA\" in following POS-tagged text can be accurately disambiguated: [1] /m 47q SIVa 1)<J/u"]},{"title":"t #*/n","paragraphs":["(A cup of light Longjing tea)","[2] tit lit/t it /v 3/u A/n Thi /a , tAtin E M/d iMac, (When the season is busy, few farmers go to town and the business is rather slack)","In sentence[1], the word modified by \"WA\" is the noun\" 4\" (tea) , which is a kind of \"drink\"; while the word \"MirA\" in sentence [2] is a predicate of \"business\". According to the different values in \"AGENT\" field, it is easy to judge that these two \"A\" belong to two semantic categories, viz. the former is \"light\", and the latter is \"slack\". 3.3 WSD based on collocation information As for the polysemous words or homographs belonging to the same semantic category, the difference between them usually manifests at the collocation level. According to a study in cognitive science, people often disambiguate word sense using only a few other words in a given context (frequently only one additional word) [8] . Thus, the relationships between one word and others can be effectively used to resolve ambiguity. For example, Chinese verb \"lir has two senses: one is \"4-1r (look for) and the other is \"WI\"","(give change). Only when the verb co-occurs with the noun \"a\" (money), it can be interpreted as \"give change\"; Otherwise, it means \"look for\" (see table 6).","ENTRY HOMOMORPHISM DEFINITION AGENT OBJECT DATIVE Translation R look for; seek","try to find; person entity look for II A B give change person \"money\" person give change Table 6 Different senses of verb \"Ir","According to table 6, the verb \"1r in sentence [1] below must be \"look for\", because its object is \"A\" (person), a kind of \"entity\"; while \"Irin sentence [2] has two objects, namely, indirect object \"a\" (me) and direct object \"a\"(money). Thus, its meaning is \"give change\". 249"]},{"title":"[1]/Itinr 44/c1 ffi t/v\\t/v Lin. (They will go out to look for sb.) [2]'WR5-34/n i/d tt4/d /v 1/r gn 19E.
