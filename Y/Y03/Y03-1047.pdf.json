Zero anaphors are generally noun phrases that are understood from the context and do not need to be specified. Anaphors in Chinese can be classified as zero, pronominal and nominal forms, as exemplified in (1) by \\tfl̀and #13 respectively'. Zero anaphors are generally noun phrases that are understood from the context and do not need to be specified.","( 1 ) a.

The former integrates different knowledge sources or factors (e.g. gender and number agreement, c-command constraints, semantic information) that discount unlikely candidates until a minimal set of plausible candidates is obtained (Grosz et al., 1995; Lappin and Leass, 1994; Okumura and Tamura, 1996; Walker et al., 1998; Yeh and Chen, 2001). Anaphoric relations between anaphors and their antecedents are identified based on the integration of linguistic and domain knowledge. However, it is very labor-intensive and time-consuming to construct a domain knowledge base. The latter employs statistical models or AI techniques, such as machine learning, to compute the most likely candidate","This research was supported by the Taiwan National Science Council under Contract No. NSC92-2422-H-036-322 2 We use a coa to denote a zero anaphor, where the superscript a is the index of the antecedent. Also note that superscripts attached to NPs and pronouns are used to represent the indices of their antecedents."]},{"title":"423","paragraphs":["(Aone and Bennett, 1995; Connoly et al., 1994; Ge et al., 1998; Seki et al., 2002). This approach can sort out the above problems. However, it heavily relies upon the availability of sufficiently large text corpora that are tagged, in particular, with referential information (Stuckardt, 2002).","A recent trend is in search of inexpensive, fast and reliable procedures for anaphora resolution (Baldwin, 1997; Ferrândez et al., 1998; Kennedy and Boguraev, 1996; Mitkov, 1998). The approach relies on cheaper and more reliable NLP tools such as part-of-speech (PUS) tagger and shallow parsers. Without complex syntactic, semantic and discourse analysis, we work on the output of a part-of-speech tagger, AUTOTAG (CKIP, 1999), which is developed by CKIP, Academia Sinica and use a partial parsing instead of a complex parsing to resolve zero anaphors in Chinese text.","Text categorization is the task of classifying documents into a certain number of predefined categories. A list of keywords is used to represent a document or a class, so that a free document can be categorized by comparing its keyword list and those of document classes. A wide range of supervised learning algorithms has been applied to this issue, using a training data set of pre-classified documents. The naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors and Rocchio are well-known algorithms (Joachims, 1997; Schapire et al., 1998; Tsay and Wang, 2000, Yang et al., 2002). Without training data set, the unsupervised training methods use techniques of clustering which group similar documents into one cluster that no longer distinguishes between constituent documents (Ko and Seo, 2000). The main difference between these two training methods is that supervised training method needs the pre-classified documents for the training data set. In general, the accuracy of text categorization based on supervised learning is better than based on unsupervised learning.","In this paper, we employ a ZA resolution method to recover the omissions of anaphors in text in order to improve the accuracy of text categorization. The text with ZA resolved is used as the input of a text categorization system. The new text categorization system works as below: First an input document with ZA resolved is taken as a ZA-resolved input document which each zero anaphor in the text is replaced by its antecedent. Second the ZA-resolved input document is categorized by the k-NN classifier. The result shows the new text categorization system increases the accuracy from 79% to 84%. In the following sections we first describe our ZA resolution method that works on the output of a POS tagger, and use a partial parsing instead of a complex parsing to resolve zero anaphors in Chinese text. In section 3 we describe the detail of the text categorization system and how to apply the resulting text of ZA resolution to it. In section 4 we illustrate the result of applying our method of ZA resolution to the sample text for categorization. In the last section the conclusions and future works are made. 2\\tZA resolution The ZA resolution method we develop is divided into three parts. First we use a PUS tagger to produce the tagged result of an input document. Second is ZA detection that identifies occurrences of ZA within utterances by employing detection rules based on the result of partial parsing. Third is antecedent identification that identifies the antecedent of each detected ZA using rules based on the centering theory. 2.1\\tPartial parsing Partial (or shallow) parsing does not deliver full syntactic analysis but is limited to parsing smaller constituents such as noun phrases or prepositional phrases (Abney, 1996; Mitkov, 2002). For example, the sentence (2) can be divided as follows: (2 )"]},{"title":"r-Ea","paragraphs":["h-,,.:\\t"]},{"title":"rn","paragraphs":["JAL 1 ° Hualien became the popular tourist attraction. [NP\\t[VP hQ \\t[NP\\t"]},{"title":"rn EL: tttim","paragraphs":["[NP Hualien ] [VP became [NP the popular tourist attraction ] 424","In our work, we use a number of simple noun phrase rules to identify the noun phrases in the output produced by AUTOTAG which is a POS tagger developed by CKIP, Academia Sinica (CKIP, 1999). For example, the result of (2) produced by AUTOTAG is as below. (3 ) :-t-Lit\\tpt.ri rs]\\tto.i a --> [ Itt(Nc) WWVG) M(VH) r1',J(DE) n (VA) ttM(Na) I","There are about 47 POS tags used in AUTOTAG in which 13 POS tags belong to the noun tag set and 17 POS tags belong to the verb tag set, as shown in Table 1.

Psychological research and cross-linguistic research have validated that the Cb is preferentially realized by a pronoun in English and by equivalent forms (i.e. zero anaphora) in other languages (Groze et al, 1995).","Rule II reflect the intuition that continuation of the center and the use of retentions when possible to produce smooth transitions to a new center provide a basis for local coherence. 2.3 Zero Anaphora Resolution The process of analyzing Chinese zero anaphora is different from general pronoun resolution in English because zero anaphors are not expressed in discourse. The task of ZA resolutions is divided into two phases: first ZA detection and then antecedent identification. In this paper, we focus on the cases of ZA occurring in the topic or subject position.","In the ZA detection phase, we use simple syntactic relations to detect omitted cases as ZA candidates: ZA detection rules:","1. For each utterance Ui in a discourse segment U1 , , U„,: If a verb, coordinating conjunction, or preposition appears in the initial position of U1 then an omitted case is detected as a ZA candidate.","2. For each ZA candidate detected in an utterance: If an intransitive verb appears in the initial position of an utterance and the leftmost elements of the utterance are an intransitive verb and a noun in order then ZA does not occur.","Note that in ZA detection rules, we employ the rule 1 to detect omitted cases as ZA candidates, and the rule 2 is an exceptional case which a verb appears in the initial position of an utterance but the verb is an intransitive verb tagged as VA or VH.","In the antecedent identification phase, we employ the concept, 'backward-looking center' of centering theory to identify the antecedent of each ZA. First we use noun phrase rules to obtain noun phrases in each utterance, and then the antecedent is identified as the most prominent noun phrase of the preceding utterance (Yeh and Chen, 2001): Antecedent identification rule:","1. For each utterance U1 in a discourse segment U1 ,\\t, Um : If a ZA occurs in U, then choose the noun phrase in the initial position of\\tas the antecedent.","Due to topic-prominence in Chinese (Li and Thompson, 1981), topic is the most salient grammatical role. In general, if the topic is omitted, the subject will be in the initial position of an utterance. If the topic and subject are omitted concurrently, the ZA occurs. Since the antecedent identification rule is corresponding to the concept of centering theory.","We do not intend to resolve all kinds of zero anaphor in our preliminary experiment but focus on the most important cases of ZA that occur in either the topic or subject positions of utterances. For example, (5) is the result of applying ZA resolution to (4)."]},{"title":"(4) a. *WOVE '5\\tilia","paragraphs":["Kee-lung General Hospital aims to increase service coverage. b. go'"]},{"title":"fi4 Irg-f- N4 g ra\\ttV1-4-ft","paragraphs":["(It) actively improves the service quality of medical treatment and standardization."]},{"title":"c. \\t 2.TG VgfT Milt* wgiV","paragraphs":["(It) is certified by Department of Health as a hospital which can handle physical examinations of foreign laborers."]},{"title":"(5 ) a. glINPLE\\tEft CE 426","paragraphs":["Kee-lung General Hospital aims to increase service coverage."]},{"title":"b.

By applying the ZA detection rules and antecedent identification rule to half the test corpus, which is a collection of 150 news articles contained 998 paragraphs, 4631 utterances, and 77537 Chinese characters, the recall rates and precision rates of ZA resolution of these three cases are shown in Table 2. The main errors of ZA resolution occur in the experiment when parsing inverted sentences and non-anaphoric cases (e.g. exophora 3 , cataphora4) (Hu, 1995; Mitkov, 2002). Cataphora is similar to anaphora, the difference being the direction of the reference. That is, we cannot detect the referent of a ZA in the following utterances, and we do not treat cataphora in this paper.
