This article discusses negative factors, the floating of negative factors and recognition of different patterns of huaiyi sentences. It has also bee argued that there is an operational mark of syntactic-semantic generalization which functions to identify the semantic patterns of sentences, and demonstrated the nature and use of this kind of mark. We argue that more reliable connection can be established between human beings and computers. Some related theoretical and methodological issues are also addressed in this article. 1 Introduction 1.1 The usual method of natural language understanding is from form to meaning or meaning to meaning. In some language with developed-forms, different semantic patterns can be distinguished by different forms (inflections). Form is the natural formal mark of semantic understanding of sentences. However, semantic patterns are various, it's impossible for any language to have enough forms to mark all its semantic patterns. Thus it's important to explore the combined-marks of forms and form-meaning synthesis marks in our study. 1.2 In the viewpoint of philosophy, generality is the abstraction of individual on one hand, individual reflects generality on the other hand. So, from generality to individual or from individual to individual are two feasible ways of exploring combined-marks of forms and form-meaning synthetic- marks. This article adopts the latter. Based on the exploration of form-meaning synthetic- marks and recognition program of semantic patterns of huaiyi sentences, this paper tries to build a bridge, which is friendly to people as well as to computer in the process of semantic understanding. 1.3 Semantic recognition includes sentence meaning recognition and semantic patterns recognition. The semantic understanding of a sentences lies on the accomplishment of these two sides. However, in the our viewpoint, we can only solve one problem. This paper discusses the semantic patterns recognition of huaiyi 362 sentence and the relative theoretical issues. 2 Huaiyi Sentence and Its Negative Factors 2.1 Huaiyi sentence is the sentence whose predicate or object is huaiyi. e.g."]},{"title":"(1) Ith---AMI/M.K.\\t","paragraphs":["(2)"]},{"title":"A&*:_=_I&14, RA-LbOtl.

Different meanings of huaiyi reflect different semantic patterns of huaiyi sentences. For example, the meaning of huaiyi in e.g. (1) and (2) is huaiyi 1, the corresponding sentences meaning are He distrusts Xiao zhang all the time and I don't believe they can win three gold medal this time. the meaning of huaiyi in e.g. (3)and(4) is huaiyi2, the corresponding sentences meaning are I suspect that he is a thief and I suspect that this guy is unreliable. the meaning of huaiyi in e.g. (5) is huaiyi3, the corresponding sentence meaning is I was puzzled that how can I voice without speaking 2.2 In this paper, huaiyi 123 represents the signification of huaiyi which is corresponding to the semantic patterns of huaiyi sentences, and these semantic patterns can be marked by Shuaiyii 2 3 accordingly.

The forms and floating of negative factors are influenced by the sentences with different semantic patterns and functions. Negative factors of judgmental sentence drift into the meaning of verb, which contains negative semantic element bu. the sentence meaning indicates negativity of judgment. Such as, e.g. (1),(2) ,(6),(7),(8) and their verb huaiyi.","In typical suspicion sentences, negative factors drift into the conclusion Y whose content is generally derogatory, such as thief in e.g. (3), unreliable in e.g. (4), cheat in e.g. (9), the Y of non-typical suspicion sentences indicates that the result of thinking is opposite to the beginning. For example, the conclusion Y of e.g. (9) it will rain tomorrow is the conclusion of thinking, this conclusion is generally contrary to the opposite beginning of thinking, such as it will be a sunny day tomorrow or it will not rain tomorrow. The beginning of thinking sometimes can be found in the context. E.g. (9) can be analogized by this way.","Negative factors of inquiry sentence drift into the morpheme yi of verb, huaiyi means uncertainty, Y is the concrete content of question. The question of e.g. (5) is that how can I voice without speaking? The question of e.g. (12) is that how can you drive the car back? Y of inquiry sentence and the morpheme yi have the relationship of mutual explanation: Y is the question of subject of thinking and vice versa. 2.4 The research findings of semantic patterns, word meaning of verb and negative factors of huaiyi can be summarized as follows. sentences verb \"huaiyi\" negative factors patterns function word meaning patterns landing sites of floating","Shuaiyi i judgment 1. distrust negativity of viewpoint holistic word meaning of huaiyi","Shuaiyi2 suspicion 2. suspect opposition between conclusion and beginning of thinking Conclusion of thinking ( Y) Shuaiyi3 inquiry 3. uncertain Uncertainty of conclusion Meaning of a morpheme yi of verb huaiyi 3 Semantic Recognition of Huaiyi Sentences 3.1 There are three semantic patterns of huaiyi sentence. Theoreticallyy, the distinctive feature is the sufficient condition of semantic patterns' recognition. Each item of function (a), word meaning (b), patterns of negative factors(c), and position of negative factors (d), as indicated above, can act as the sufficient condition and distinctive feature of semantic patterns recognition of huaiyi sentences. In other words, so long as we can find each one of four items, the semantic patterns of huaiyi sentences can be recognized. There are e. 364 different levels of semantic recognition of sentence. The recognition capacity and sequence of distinctive feature (a, b, c, d) is different at different levels, however, the distinctive feature of recognition should be examined by speech and demonstrated by theory. 3.2 In the field of sentence pattern analysis of linguistic theory study, the capacity of four features (a, b, c, d) are equal, disordered and optional for recognizing the sentence pattern of huaiyi sentence, however, that does not mean that the function of each feature for explaining system is different.","For instance, huaiyi is a thinking verb, which belongs to the same word family as the words renwei, guji, caice, juede. i In the family of thinking verbs, \"huaiyi\" which has negative factors is opposite to other thinking verbs without negative factors at meaning. Thus as the distinctive feature of huaiyi sentence pattern, an important function of negative factors (c, d) is to distinguish huaiyi sentences from non-huaiyi sentences. In comparison with negative factors, other features (a, b) don't possess the function of distinguish upper-patterns. In this paper, the classification and explanation of meaning of huaiyi is differ from any dictionary in hand. By demonstrating the correspondence of negative factors patterns (c) and its drift (d), and examining the fact of language, we divide the meanings of huaiyi into three items and describe it so. From the research of recognizing wording meaning, we conclude that don't take it for granted that the word meaning of a authoritative dictionary can be used directly for natural language processing. In fact, lexical items in most of these dictionaries are neither exhaustive nor objective. They are provided quite randomly. 3.3 In speech communication, function (a) is the fundamental basis for recognizing the semantic category of sentences. In oral speaking, people's understanding of sentences is generally from the language's function, and this is subconscious. When we use sentence huaiyi, we will not understand the word meaning of huaiyi first, but recognize the semantic patterns through the contradiction and difference between the three functions of huaiyi sentence, and then we could understand the meaning of whole sentence, although the recognition of semantic pattern is greatly assisted by context. For instance, hearing the sentence iftRAX-1/iN","fila-nOalthAW.Alt, firstly the listener senses that he has the negative viewpoint or attitude on Xiao wang, so the sentence can be determined as judgment sentence. Secondly, by concretizing the negative viewpoint into distrust or disbelieve, the listener enters the stage of determining the verb meaning. Another instance, hearing the sentence affRFAX*T -W, the listener senses that the speaker expresses a judgment firstly, which is a suspicion marked by huaiyi, then enters the stage of determining the verb meaning huaiyi=suspicion. In the same way, the listener senses that the object of huaiyi is the content of inquiry when hearing the sentence RAORA /TAM The word meaning of huaiyi can be recognized subsequently. In a word, speech understanding and semantic recognition in people's language communication is from the determination of sentence function to the recognition of meaning of verb. In other words, we recognize the semantic pattern of huaiyi sentences by its function, not by the meaning of huaiyi, which is not the fundamental basis of semantic recognition in speech communication.\" 3.4 In the automatic recognition, the meaning of huaiyi (b distinctive feature) is the foundation and has the central function. But the use of this feature can work with help of linguistic forms. The recognition of sentence's semantic pattern is generally called artificial intelligence. But now the machine does not have the ability like people to recognize sentence directly by function (a), machine must be transitioned to function (a) recognition by form, and then realize the recognition of sentence's semantic pattern. Artificial intelligence can not totally imitate the human beings' process and ways. The most 365 important principle of artificial intelligence should get the same result as human work by the most feasible methods. According to this, as to the semantic recognition of sentence huaiyi , the most realistic and feasible method is not the transition from form to the recognition of sentence pattern of a, or c, d, but the transition from form to the recognition of b. In another word, through language form as the media to the recognition of b: the recognition of words' meaning, then we can reach this recognition way of \"language form as media first, then word meaning feature orientation\", which is the most convenient and feasible way. And this way is friendly both for machine and people ( the second language learners and the language researchers) (Please see Section 4) . 4\\tMark Categories for Automatic Recognition and Procedure Manifestation of Huaiyi Sentence 4.1 Logically speaking, some sufficient conditions or distinguishing features are provided in a single form. For instance, \"words that can be adverbial are adverbs\" in English; and some sufficient conditions or distinguishing features are complex, such as, the sufficient condition of judging the Chinese adverb is formed by two conditions: (I ) can be adverbial, (II ) can only be adverbial. It is not optional of whether it is to use a single or complex condition for the judgment of an object, and it is decided by the feature and nature of the object. Besides adverb, adjective and noun in Chinese can also be adverbial, so its sufficient condition must be the synthesis of several conditions."]},{"title":"iii","paragraphs":["The conditions used by machine to recognize the pattern of sentence huaiyi in this article is complex conditions.","Single sufficient condition is more economical and terse than the complex conditions. And it may be the human nature to like and pursue the economy. In the long river of the human recognition, the recognition of single sufficient condition is far earlier than the recognition of the complex condition, and it is also to the study of a specific single sufficient condition and distinguishing feature. For example, Li Xingya in his The meanings of huaiyi and object pattern (1987) argues that when there is nominal object or not object after huaiyi, the meaning of word huaiyi is distrust, for example,"]},{"title":"aiKkilith I ax-1-10-A- -aft*-2-31:-KR;","paragraphs":["when there is predicative object, the meaning of huaiyi is suspect, for example,"]},{"title":"RiKataki dAT.","paragraphs":["It is not difficult to find from it that f Mr. Li's foundation of the judgment and recognition of the word meaning of huaiyi is a kind of single sufficient condition. However, this kind of single sufficient condition can not explain all the meanings of huaiyi in the sentence huaiyi, so in his paper remark on meanings of huaiyi (1988 ) , Li Yunxi makes some addition to Li Xingya and points out: when there is predicative object and there is no negative word before huaiyi, the meaning of huaiyi is suspect; when there is negative words before huaiyi , that is to say it has predicative object, the meaning of huaiyi is distrust. For example,"]},{"title":"RTO Wd.a. 3c*Alth:t711<j.From","paragraphs":["the judgmental condition or distinguishing feature, the addition of Li Yunxi is putting the single sufficient condition of the recognition and judgment of huaiyi to the complex sufficient condition. The promotion from single condition to complex condition is the process by using synchronous elements '(object or other parts) the grammar form or nature to recognize the meaning of huaiyi. It makes another step toward the full understanding of language facts. The complex condition for recognition of huaiyi 's meaning used in this article makes a further step based on them (Please see Section 4.2 for more details).","The using of complex condition or distinguishing feature should have extensive future. In order for indication and appellation , we name the condition formed by form and form \"language form combination condition\", and name the condition formed by semantics (including function) \"semantic combination condition\", and name the condition formed by and semantics \"synthesis condition\" or \"form-semantic 366 synthesis condition\". The language form media in broad sense includes negative words and the grammar nature of words. The pattern media used in the pattern recognition of sentence huaiyi in this article is he combination condition formed by language form in broad sense. There are two steps: one is using language form to determine the word meaning; the other one is using word meaning to determine sentence pattern, and if we combine these two steps, that is \"form-meaning synthesis condition\" used in this article. In theory, whether the single sufficient condition or complex sufficient condition, only this condition becomes a distinguishing tool, it is a mark. Conversely, mark is a kind of sufficient condition, no matter it is single or complex. So, the \"form-meaning synthesis condition\" we used to recognize the pattern of sentence huaiyi is \"form-meaning synthesis mark\". we used to recognize the category of sentence huaiyi is \"form-meaning synthesis mark\". And its language form composed by many forms condition is called \"language form combination mark\". In this meaning, the machine recognition of a natural language, there are two parts before its machine research: (1) the construction of recognition marks, (2) the design and manifestation of recognition marks' programming. 4.2 The sentence pattern recognition of sentence huaiyi by machine is using the \"synthesis marks of form-semantic\", and its recognition process is formed by two parts: (1) guarantee the work meaning of huaiyi by language form mark to recognize the process; (2) determine the sentence pattern by the word meaning of huaiyi. By now, this can be the end of the recognition of sentence pattern. But, the scientific and ideal language recognition should be like the mathematical calculation, there should be a verification after the recognition. Based on this, the recognition of sentence pattern of the sentence huaiyi should have the third step: (3) the recognition verifying of sentence pattern.","During the three steps we have in the machine recognition of sentence huaiyi., the first step is the crux to realize the machine recognition and verify the feasibility of its recognition. In order to show its feasibility, we make the following process structure tree. Every end of the branch of the tree marks the meaning of word huaiyi. On the structure tree, the thinking part (the person who suspect) is still marked as X, object is marked as Y, and Y is also can be divided as object P and content Q. Besides, NP represents substantival structure, and VP represents predictive structure (including subject- predicative structure); \"I\" means \"or\".

For example: the sentence \"ft—A'414111 4) -ticatt\", the huaiyi is in the middle of XY, so up the branch of the structure tree to 1 ; v because Y is NP, up the branch to [1.1]; because there is no negative word, so up the branch to [1.1.1]; because its Y is formed by the suspect object P(him) and the suspect content Q(reliability),so once more up the branch to [1.1.1.1], and to the end.

Some handling procedure is the extensive procedure based by other procedures, and this procedure is just a process of many ones of the whole language handling. The procedure of this article belongs to the latter, and it is the extensive procedure of the existing (supposing it is existing) basic procedure. Therefore, when we recognize the semantic pattern of sentence huaiyi , only the meaning of word huaiyi is certain, the semantic pattern of this sentence is clear. Because from the word meaning we give, any semantic pattern (Shuaiyi 1 )of a huaiyi sentence can be expressed as a function based by the meaning of word huaiyi. Sh.iyi. =X huaiyi x Y More specifically, When the meaning of huaiyi is \"distrust\", the sentence is S huaiyi (judgment ) When the meaning of huaiyi is \"suspect\", the sentence is Shuao 2 (suspicion) When the meaning of huaiyi is \"uncertain\", the sentence is Shuaiyi 3 (inquiry ) 4.4 Recognition verifying is the ideal state we are pursuing. In mathematical calculation, addition is generally verified by subtraction, and multiplication by division. But these two ways are contrary calculation to each other at the same level: addition and subtraction are of the same level, and so are the multiplication and division. But in fact the more reliable calculation may be the calculation of different levels: addition is verified by multiplication, and multiplication is verified by addition. From this perspetive, we can verify the 369 huaiyi sentence by using the negative factors. Due to the nature and scope of this article, the techinical details are not included here.","The exclusion of the technical details, however, does not affect the important issue that we have brought up and discussed in this article. Our point is that the exploration and use of combination marks and synthesis marks may be a worth-studying approach to recognize the meaning of sentences. The verifying of the semantic factors, which has the function of distinguishing upper-down patterns, is perhaps another important method to ensure that sentence recognition can be done scientifically. i The word meaning of huai yi can be described: \"ren wei\"+X, X is different, and the word meaning of huai yi is different. ii In oral language , the focus of sentence usually has some certain stress marksman . and this marks sometimes have the function of suggestion and extraction for the recognition of sentence pattern . some sentence huai yi are ambiguous, but the focus marks can distinguish this ambiguity . (refer to 4.2 ).","sometimes the single condition and comprehensive condition look like a expression problem , for example , the judgment condition of Chinese adverb can be expressed as (II ) \"can only be adverbial \". in fact , the expression on (II )is presupposed (I ) \"can be adverbial \". we have adopted Mr. Xing Fuyi's viewpoint: express this feature of Chinese adverb as \"pure adverbial\", but it's just a different expression and can not change the comprehensive feature of condition construction. iv [2.2] is inversion of [1].
