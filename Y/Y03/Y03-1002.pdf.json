In this mode of formulation, a comparative study of Focus and Focus-Marking in Chinese and Malay has been conducted. These two languages are similar and different.

Following Culicover and Rochemont (1983, 1990) and Horvath (1986), we in this paper assume that this essentially semantic conception of 'Focus' can be characterized as a purely formal syntactic feature [+Focus] or [+F], which gets assigned to constituents at a certain appropriate level of syntactic representation, triggering such syntactic operations such as 'Movement' and 'Adjoining' under the general syntactic principles and constraints.","This paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we will first review some basic assumptions about the formal characterization of [+FOCUS], then moving quickly onto the question of how [-I-FOCUS] is reflected in the formal syntax, especially how it is marked syntactically. Section 3 is devoted to a discussion of the nature of Focus Mark shi"]},{"title":"A","paragraphs":["in Chinese. Comparable phenomena in Malay are viewed from a comparative perspecitve in Section 4. We will demonstrate that question words are inherently assigned the focus feature in Section 5. Section 6 is a short one on some remarkable and relevant phenomena from historical and dialectal grammars of Chinese. Our major conclusions are summarized briefly in Section 7. 2 [FFOCUS]: From a Pragmatic Conception to a Purely Syntactic Feature","It is noted in some early generative literature that one aspect of semantic interpretation of a sentence is a","division of its reading into FOCUS and PRESUPPOSITION. As a working definition, we follow","Jackendoff (1972) to assume (1) below.","(1) FOCUS: The information in the sentence that is assumed by the speaker not to be shared by him","and the hearer.","PRESUPPOSITION: The information in the sentence that is assumed by the speaker to be 2 shared by him and the hearer.","According to (1), for a normal sentence, the matter is whether the FOCUS or FOCI is reflected syntactically or not, rather than whether it has a FOCUS at all. Sentence (2) below, for example, may be analyzed as (3) in terms of FOCUS and PRESUPPOSITION, although it only has phonological but no syntactic FOCUS marking (The capitalized word represents the main stress and the highest pitch of the sentence). (2) Mary hit JOHN. (3) PRESUPPOSITION: Mar hit someone","FOCUS:\\tJohn The unshared information is assumed by the speaker to be known to the speaker himself in declarative sentences, whereas it is known to the hearer but not to the speaker in interrogative sentences. e.g. (4) Who did Mary hit? (5) PRESUPPOSITION: Mary hit someone","FOCUS:\\twho Note that Jackendoff's definition of Focus as in (1), although being quite consistent with the intuition, is given more semantically or pragmatically than formal-syntactically. Given the line of pursuit adopted in this study, we here would follow Culicover and Rochemont (1983, 1990) and Horvath (1986) to postulate that Focus can also be characterized as a purely formal syntactic feature [+FOCUS] or [+F], which gets assigned to constituents at an appropriate level of syntactic representation. We will refer to the process of associating the feature [+FOCUS] with particular constituents as 'Focus-Assignment'. We assume, leaving arguments and motivations to be offered later, that Focus-Assignment takes place at the level of D-Structure, and not until then does the issue of 'Focus' turn into a syntactic one. If so, (6) below can be taken as the DS representation of sentence (2) above if the information about 'Focus' is to be included. (6) Mary hit JohnE+9 .","Although every sentence by definition has at least one focused constituent, degree of focalization (i.e., the degree of emphasis) on constituents may vary from one sentence to another. For expository convenience, we assume that there are two types of Focus which are formal-linguistically relevant: S̀trong Focus' and 'Weak Focus' (henceforth, \"Fs\" and \"Fw\" respectively when necessary). We assume that this information is also available at D-Structure to trigger certain syntactic processes. Also, given the existence of multiple wh questions, a single sentence may have more than one constituent assigned the feature [+FOCUS]. 3 The Chinese Copular Verb Shi k as a Focus Mark The [+F] marking, resulting from Focus-Assignment may trigger phonological or/and syntactic operations. The phonological operations of [+F] such as primary stress and higher pitch have been well noted in the literature (e.g., Jackendoff (1972), Culicover and Rochemont (1983) among others). As for syntactic operations, the most conceivable one is simply to insert an overt Focus mark in the sentence whatever the marker is in a particular language. This possibility is attested in Chinese. e.g.","(7) AR Fif4 *As-A-r-4)1,1 Shi wo mingtian cheng huoche qu Guangzhou. 3 SHI I tomorrow ride train go Guangzhou Ì will go to Guangzhou by train tomorrow / It is I who will go to Guangzhou by train tomorrow."]},{"title":"(8)RA H)","paragraphs":["x*As-tr-)ii Wo shi mingtian cheng huoche qu Guangzhou.

For example, it may enter the so-called 'V-neg-V' questions as in (11) below; it can be negated by a negative adverb such as bu 7 'not' as in (12). More importantly, argues Huang, the distribution of emphatic shi is very much restricted. It can be placed only before the subject NP or somewhere between the subject and the main verb, but never between a verb and its object as in (13) nor between a preposition and its object as in (14)."]},{"title":"(11)LAA- kr lthri\"FXS MUTTS ?","paragraphs":["Shi bu shi ta zuotian jie-le ni de shu?

All they suggest to us, however, is only that shi Asyntactically behaves as a verb while functioning as a Focus Marker, but don't contradict the claim that shi A is a Focus Marker. The initial purpose of inserting shi A may well be just to mark the focused constituent. But after being inserted into the sentence, shi A takes up its own way of life, so exhibiting a set of properties of regular copular verbs. This is expected. Putting it in different words, we can say that the ungrammaticality of sentences like (13) and (14) has nothing to do with the insertion of shi A as a Focus Marker. Rather, that they are ungrammatical is because such verbs as pengjian tritJ 'meet' may only have an NP but not a VP as its complement. In short, seen from different perspectives, shi could be different things. In terms of grammatical operations of [FF], shi A is a Focus Marker. In terms of parts of speech, it is simply a verb. In employing this lexical item shi A as a Focus Marker, the grammar automatically places it under the constraint of the conditions which govern verbs in general.","Theoretically, every and each sentence has at least one focused constituent. Superficially, some sentences don't appear to have focused constituents. But in fact it may be the case that they don't have presuppositions. The whole sentences, at least their predicates, are focused. But we all know that not all Chinese sentences employ the Focus Marker shi to mark the constituents. Here the division between Strong and Weak Focus proposed earlier in this paper plays crucial role in determining whether a focused constituent is syntactically processed through the insertion of Focus Marker shi in Chinese. Suppose that all focused constituents are all somehow phonologically reflected in the component of PF. The formal syntax is sensitive only to the marking of [+Fs] (Strong Focus). Assuming that zai bangongshi A.aìn the office' is the focused constituent in both (15) and (16) below, and that it is strong (15), but weak in (16), we can analyze them as followings at different levels of representation.","(15) ttiiF̀XV-J,14ffl.1;.F.

I yesterday SHI in office\\twait-for you Ì waited for you IN THE OFFICE yesterday.'","We propose that the insertion of Focus Marker shi is triggered by the [+Fs] marking from the DS representation. The process of Focus Mark insertion, we assume, is an instance of Adjoin-a in the sense of Lebeaux (1991), which, along with Move- a and Project- a, takes place in the course of derivation of SS from DS. i. e.

Very much like Chinese, Malay is also a Focus-Marking language in which focused constituents are marked with lah in declarative sentences as in (24-29) below or kah in interrogative sentences as in (30-34).","(24) Saya-lah yang akan pergi ke Kuala Lumpur.

That girl teacher Ali-FM Ìs that girl ALI'S TEACHER?'","The Unique Strong Focus Condition (as given in (22) above) also applies in Malay just as in Chinese. A simplex Malay sentence can only have one constituent assigned a Strong Focus Mark [+Fs], and thus can only have one consifituent marked overtly with the Focus Mark. The contrast in well-formedness between (37) and (38) exemplifies this point.","(37) Amin sakit-kah kelmarin? \\t(Kader (1981)) Amin sick-FM yesterday Ẁas Amin SICK yesterday?'","(38) *Amin sakit-kah kelmarin-kah? Amin sick-FM yesterday-FM","There are some interesting contrasts between Chinese and Malay in Focus Marking.","1. The two language differ in the nature of Focus Mark. As noted above, the Chinese Focus Mark shi","is a copular verb, but the Malay Focus Mark lah/kah is a suffix-like particle. Since it is a","cross-linguistic phenomenon that copular verbs often function as Focus Mark, the Chinese choice is quite","natural and understandable. The reason why the same choice is not made in Malay is simple too. Malay,","just like Archaic Chinese, does not have a typical copular verb.","(39) Azmin pelajar. Azmin student Àzminis a-student.'","(40) Siapa-kah guru itu? Who-FM teach that Ẁho is that teacher?'","(41) Kuala Lumpur ibunegara Malasia.","Capital Malaysia K̀uala Lumpur is the capital of Malaysia.'","2. In linear placement, the Chinese Focus Mark is placed before the focused constituent and as close as possible to the focused constituent, whereas the Malay Focus Mark comes right after the constituent. This is because Chinese is by and large a head-final language, whereas Malay is largely a head-initial language. In Malay, not only the Focus Mark, any modifying syntactic elements are placed after the head words. E.g.","(42) Azmin berjumpa gadis cantik. Azmin met\\tgirl beautiful 8 Àzmin met a beautiful girl.","(43) Bangunan bara lebih mahal. Building new more expensive Ǹew buildings are more expensive.'","(44) Abu belajarlah di bilik itu tadi. Abu study-FM at room that just-now Ìt was studying that Abu did in that room just now.'","3. As a result of 1 and 2 above, the insertion of Malay Focus Mark is subject to different condition from Chinese. For instance, the distribution of the Chinese shi"]},{"title":"A","paragraphs":["is very much restricted. It can be placed only before the subject NP or somewhere between the subject and the main verb, but never between a verb or a preposition and its object. Contrastively, since the Malay Focus Mark is just a particle, it is used much more freely than its Chinese counterpart. It can well be inserted right after an object.","(45) Die-lah yang saya berjumpa di kampus kelmarin. He-FM who I\\tmet\\tat campus yesterday Ìt was him whom I met on the campus yesterday.'","(46) Kamu mahu copi-kah atau teh-kah? You want coffee-FM or tea-FM D̀o you want coffee or tea?'","(47) Abu minum air itu-kah tadi? Abu drink water that-FM just-now D̀id Abu drink THAT WATER just now?'","(48) Anak itu sudah pergi ke sekolah-kah?\\t(Kader 1981) Child the already go to school-FM Ẁas it to school where the child already went?","(49) Awak beli kereta yang besar itu-kah kelmarin? You buy car which big that-FM yesterday Ẁhich car did you buy yesterday?'","4. Lastly, but most interestingly, Focus-Marking as a Focus device may be used in conjunction with Focus-Fronting in Malay but not in Chinese. As is generalized in Xu and Li (1993), cross-linguistically, there are two devices for grammar to process the Focus Feature [+Focus]: (i) moving the [+FOCUS]-marked constituents to a more prominent position which may vary from one language to another (as instantiated in Hungarian and Archaic Chinese in examples (50-53)), and (ii) inserting a Focus Mark either before or after the focused constituents (as in Modem Mandarin Chinese and Malay illustrated above in this paper). And English is a unique language in which (i) and (ii) are used jointly. In this sense, we find that Malay patterns with English in the joint usage of the two Focus devices, but differs from English in that Focus-Fronting is obligatory in English but optional in Malay while Focus-Marking is obligatory in both languages. Also, English Focus Mark, like its Chinese counterpart, is the copular verb be, but Malay Focus Mark is a suffix-like particle as discussed above (see examples (54-59) below). 1 1 There seems to be another difference between Malay and English in that pronoun it has to be used in addition to the copular verb be as a Focus Mark in English, whereas what is inserted there is simply the Focus Mark kah/lah. But we take this as one of the side effects of their difference in the nature of Focus Mark rather than as an independent difference. In English, the initial purpose of the be insertion could well be just to mark the focused constituents, but it automatically creates a predicate which, by a condition completely independent of the issue concerning us here, demands an insertion of 'dummy subject' it (just as the it inserted in it is raining and in it is said that he won't make it). 9 Hungarian (Horvath (1986))","(50) Attila A FOLDRAIGESTOLi felt Attila the earthquake-from feared Àttila was afraid of THE EARTHQUAKE / It was the earthquake that Attila was afraid of .'"]},{"title":"+","paragraphs":["(51) Mari mit telt az asztalra t 1 ?

You buy car which big that-FM yesterday Ẁhich car did you buy yesterday?' 5 Wh-Phrases as Inherently Focus-Marked Phrases It is perhaps a cross-linguistic phenomenon that question words pattern with focused constituents systematically in Focus-Marking and Focus-Fronting. Wh-questions and cleft sentences exhibit a whole 10 set of similarities which clearly demand a unified account. It should be noted also that in wh-questions, only the wh-phrases but not any others could be the strongly focused constituents. We propose that this is because those wh-phrases have been assigned the Strong Focus mark [+Fs] already in the lexicon and carry the mark into syntax when they themselves are composed into the phrase marker. Such a lexical marking interacts with the syntactic marking in an interesting way. e.g.","(60) ifiE+Fs'TA1321K ShuiE+Fsl mai-le neiben zidian? who\\tbuy-Asp that dictionary Ẁho bought that dictionary?'","(61) fi/J-1-[-.11-IfRE-EFsl,ttfi<Jt*? Ni shenme shihoen] nian-de daxue? you what time\\tattend-Asp college Ẁhen did you attend college?'","If necessary, the Focus Marker shi A may also be inserted to intensify the focus marking, giving rise to sentences like the following.","(60') Ait{+Fs]3kTAii*4-- Shi shuif+Fsi mai-le neiben zidian? SHI who buy-Asp that dictionary ẀHO bought that dictionary?'","(61') Aif-t-HIRE+Fsltin*? Ni shi shenme shihou[+Fs] nian-de daxue? you SHI what time\\tattend-Asp college ẀHEN did you attend college?' In case the wh-phrase is in an object position, the Focus Mark will have to be placed before the main verb rather than before the wh object.","(62) 3..KEjet Zhangsan shi mai-le shenme[+Fs] ? Zhangsan SHI buy-Asp what ẀHAT did Zhangsan buy?'","The constituents with [+Fs] mark in sentences (60') (61') have double focus marking, one is brought in along with the wh-phrases from the lexicon, and another obtained through a syntactic process ---- the insertion of Focus Mark shi A.","The Unique Strong Focus Condition as stated in (22) above which disallows a single clause to have more than one strongly focused constituent and the assumption that wh-phrases are assigned [+Fs] in the lexicon so that they carry the mark inherently jointly makes an interesting prediction: the Focus Mark shi A can be inserted only to mark the wh-phrases in wh questions. This prediction is borne out in Chinese as seen from the ungrammaticality of the following sentences.","(63) * A3t= p-Fsi4 ift[+Fs] *Shi Zhangsan[+Fs] plan-le shui[+Fs] ? SHI Zhangsan cheat-Asp who Ìntended: *Is it Zhangsan who has cheated who? /","Who has ZHANGSAN cheated?' 11","(64) *,/m44.4. litiv-FsilElk [+Fs]i lig ? *Ni shenme shihouPfsi shi zai Meiguof+Fq gongzuo? you what time\\tSHI in America work","Ìntended: When did you work IN AMERICA?'","(65) 49iff[1-Fsi\\tjig./4\\t? *ShuiNfq shi mai-le nenme duo shu[+Fq? who SHI buy-Asp so many book Ìntended: Who bought SO MANY BOOKS.'","The ungrammaticality of the above sentences may represent a puzzle for an alternative analysis of the Focus Assignment, since the Focus Mark shi in general may be inserted to mark any constituent which is strongly focused in a sentence. Given that the Unique Strong Focus Condition is independently motivated, the phenomenon can be taken as a strong argument for our assumption that wh-phrases are marked [-I-Fs] in the lexicon and carry the mark along into the syntax.","As will be demonstrated later in this paper, some language facts from historical and dialectal grammars of Chinese even suggest that those question words have a Focus Mark directly incorporated lexically. 6 Some Remarkable Phenomena from the Historical and Dialect Grammars of Chinese","6.1 Further weakening of shi A to become a particle-like pure Focus Mark in Middle Chinese and in the Minnan Dialect We have argued that the Chinese Focus Mark shi EA is not merely a Focus Mark. Shi syntactically behaves as a verb while functioning as a Focus Mark. In employing this lexical item shi ki as a Focus Mark, the grammar automatically places it under the constraint of the conditions which govern verbs in general. This explains naturally the observed phenomenon in Mandarin Chinese that shi A can be placed only before the subject NP or somewhere between the subject and the main verb, but never between a verb or a preposition and its object.","However, this generalization holds true only in Mandarin and perhaps in some other varieties of the Chinese language but certainly not in all varieties of the language. The logical possibility cannot be excluded, it is not realized in one, but it may be realized in another language. As reported in Shi and Xu (2000), shi Aonce weakened by a step further and developed to be an almost pure particle-like Focus Mark, loosing its original properties as a copular verb in Middle Chinese and it is not subject to the conditions on verbs and can be placed between a verb and its object as in examples (66) and (67) below.","(60 WHO],\\t(RIM) ) Wo ji yang wen, ru wei shi shui.

As suffix-like particles, the Malay Focus Mark kah/lah is used much more freely than the Chinese copular verb shi"]},{"title":"A,","paragraphs":["whereby the latter cannot come in between a verb or a preposition and its object but the former can.","We also have argued that question words (i.e., wh-phrases) must be inherently assigned the focus feature [+FOCUS] in the lexicon and carry the feature into syntax when those question words themselves are composed into the phrase markers otherwise certain language facts cannot be properly accounted for.
