C 251 sinyotw@yahoo. com.tw Abstract To what degree do different languages share similar conceptual metaphors? Charteris-Black and Ennis (2001) examined this question by running a comparative, corpus-based study of metaphors in Spanish and English financial reporting. They argue that both languages show considerable similarity in the choice of conceptual metaphors with the same linguistic expressions but that there is a differing degree of frequency. They attribute this similarity to the common cultural identity of the two languages such as the similar economic system and their Latinate origins. In this paper, we use a corpus-based approach in comparing the choice of conceptual metaphors in Mandarin Chinese with those of Spanish and English. We focus our discussion on the conceptual metaphor STOCK MARKET IS OCEAN WATER in Mandarin Chinese and compare it with the Spanish and English data. We carry out our analysis within the framework of the Conceptual Mapping (CM) Model (Ahrens 2002). With this model, we are able to demonstrate that although different languages share similar conceptual metaphors, they differ in what is mapped linguistically. These differences can be shown in their specific Mapping Principles. 1\\tIntroduction The language of economy frequently involves conceptual metaphors. Charteris-Black (2000), for instance, suggested that the metaphoric lexis in the Economist were higher in frequency than in a general magazine. In describing the movement of the economy, in particular, there are expressions relating to the directions of the economic situation (up and down) and the speed of the economic development (Chung, Ahrens and Huang, 2003b).","In this paper, two Mandarin Chinese newspaper corpora will be examined in terms of occurrences of conceptual metaphors related to the target domain of gushi 'ti r-fy 'STOCK MARICET.' Among the recurring metaphors found, the metaphor STOCK MARKET IS OCEAN WATER constitutes the majority of the linguistic expressions. This paper focuses on this conceptual metaphor and compares it with the English and Spanish data analyzed by Charteris-Black and Ennis (2001).","In Charteris-Black and Ennis (2001), the metaphor MARKET MOVEMENTS ARE NAUTICAL OR ARE WAYS OF MOVING IN THE WATER is suggested for expressions relating to the domain of OCEAN WATER. This paper looks at their examples in detail and compares the Chinese data with their analysis. Working within the Conceptual Mapping (CM) Model (Ahrens, 2002), this paper proposes while the source and target domains may be similar across different languages, the linguistic expressions that are mapped in each language can differ within each language. These differences in mappings can be captured using the CM Model by postulating a Mapping Principle for the source-target domain mapping. 124 2\\tThe Conceptual Mapping (CM) Model The CM Model is a model based within the Contemporary Theory of Metaphor (Lakoff and Johnson 1980, Lakoff 1993), and shares with it the idea that metaphors have systematic source to target domain pairing. However, it goes beyond the CTM to postulate that the systematic pairings are principled and that these principles can be formulated from a linguistic analysis of the conventional metaphorical expressions (Ahrens 2002). For instance, using the CM Model, Ahrens (2002) analyzed IDEA AS BUILDING via five main stages. First, within the target domain of IDEA, native speakers generated all items related to IDEA. Then, these items were categorized into similar source domains such as BUILDING and FOOD. Third, for each source domain, three questions were asked in order to generate the conceptual real world knowledge regarding this source domain. These questions are as follows (with sample answers taken from Ahrens' analysis for IDEA AS BUILDING in Mandarin Chinese):","1. What entities does the SD have? -- (for BULDINGS: foundation, structure, model, base, etc.)","2. What quality does the SD or the entity in the SD have? -- (shaky, high, short, strong, etc.)","3a. What does the SD do? -- (to protect, to\\tetc.) b. What can somebody do to the SD? -- (to live in, to build, etc.)","The fourth stage involved filtering out non-conventional expressions obtained in stage one. At the fifth stage, the actual mappings between IDEA and BUILDING were compared with what could possibly be mapped in the real world. By comparing the linguistic data (obtained at stage one) with the expressions from the real world knowledge, one can postulate why a target domain uses a particular source domain. For IDEA AS BUILDING in Mandarin Chinese, the following examples were given (Ahrens, 2002: 277-278):"]},{"title":"(1) acig\\tVfX","paragraphs":["zhege lilun jia you hen song san this theory frame very loose T̀he framework of this theory is loose.'"]},{"title":"(2) ft-in \\tffla\\t?","paragraphs":["nide lundian genji shi sheme your argument base BE what Ẁhat is the foundation of your argument?'"]},{"title":"(3)a tl \\tr(A E\\t'ff)-3","paragraphs":["zhe qun wenren zheng\\tnuli\\tjiangou yi tao\\tlilun this group scholar at the present work hard build one CLASS theory T̀his group of scholars is working hard at constructing a theory.'

These linguistic expressions comprise Entities (nouns), Functions (verbs) and Qualities (adjectives).","Based on the examples such as (1) to (3), Ahrens (2002:279) postulated that \"the target domain of IDEA uses the source domain of BUILDING in order to emphasize that concept of structure.\" To put this correspondence in formal wordings, a 'Mapping Principle' was proposed. This mapping principle 125 provides the reason underlying the mapping of source to target domains. For IDEA AS BUILDING, the mapping principle is as follow (Ahrens 2002: 279): Idea (originally capitalized) is understood as building because buildings involve a (physical) structure and ideas involve an (abstract) structure.","Chung, Ahrens and Huang (2003a, 2003b) have looked at economy metaphors occurring within the source domains of PERSON and TRANSPORTATION DEVICE (such as MOVING VEHICLES and AEROPLANE) respectively. They suggested that the most prototypical mappings in the corpora for these conceptual metaphors are used in formulating the Mapping Principle. This paper also adopts an empirical analysis of corpora by formulating Mapping Principle from the most frequent mappings in the Mandarin Chinese corpora. 3\\tMethodology Using the CM Model in our analysis, we analyze the metaphor of STOCK MARKET IS OCEAN WATER in Mandarin Chinese. We compare our findings with Charteris-Black and Ennis's (2001) analysis of the English and Spanish data. Our sources are from the Internet postings of business news including:","(a) huashishingwen front page TV news ( ̂VA) taken from the webpage of http://www.cts.com.tw between 24 October 1997 and 7 November 1997; and","(b) business news in gungshangshibao\\ttaken from the webpage of http://www.chinatimes.com between 24 October 1997 and 7 November 1997.","Both of these sources provide news reported in Taiwan over roughly the same period of time as Charteris-Black and Ennis's (2001) corpora. The search for huashishingwen (WEVIIMM) was limited to the front page news but the search for gungshangshibao (Inli4C) covered all the sections of the newspaper. A total of 120 financial reports were collected from these two sources. Among the 120 financial reports collected, 22 articles were taken from the huashishingwen spoken data (accompanied by written reports and the analysis was based on the written reports) and 98 were taken from gungshangshibao. These two corpora contain 97,156 characters (with MSW word count). This amount of characters was divided by 1.4 to make the Chinese characters comparable to words citation. This produced 69, 397 words in total.","For the analysis, we first searched for the key term gushi 'stock market' ()R\") using the search engine in Microsoft Word. All the instances of gushi were extracted. A metaphor is identified when there is a mapping from a mapping of gushi to a concrete domain such as (OCEAN) WATER in the following example.","(4) ELT AM\\trfi\\t-tC\\ttit lading meizou gushi\\tyedou genie dazhang Latih America stock market also \\tfollow big-rise Literal: 'The Latin American stock market also followed suit in the rising.'","The underlined word belongs to the domain of OCEAN WATER and the bracketed words belong to the domain of the STOCK MARKET. These identified metaphors were then categorized according to the different of metaphors (STOCK MARKET IS OCEAN, STOCK MARKET IS DISASTER, etc.). The instances of expressions within each type of metaphor were counted. We then calculated the frequency of each instance of metaphor by finding out the percentage these metaphors constitute in the two corpora. 126","Our analysis yielded 135 tokens of economy metaphors, with 4 recurring patterns of economy metaphors. These 4 metaphors are shown in Table 1. Table 1: All 'Stock Market' Met hors found in the Mandarin Chinese Corpora Metaphors Tokens '\\t,.*:\\tI 7 - \" ' \\t:\" , ' :',ta.. _, \\t' - T.

The domain of DISASTER comprises two sub-domains, i.e., the source domains of STORM and EARTHQUAKE. The fourth recurring pattern occurs within the domain of PERSON. These recurring metaphors are defined by their frequency of tokens found in the two news corpora. Other metaphors with lower frequency of occurrences are THE FALL OF THE STOCK MARKET IS CHAIN (1 token) and STOCK MARKET IS GAMBLING (3 tokens).","The following examples (5) to (9) provide instances of occurrences for each of the metaphors in Table 1.

Therefore, we can see from Table 3 that this source domain of \"nautical or are ways of moving in the water\" is not a coherent conceptual domain. The CM Model, contrastingly, requires coherent conceptual domain, i.e., one where speakers can consistently list members of that domain (cf. Rosch and Mervis, 1975).","Using the CM Model, the re-categorization of the list of words in Table 3 (under the source domains of BOAT and OCEAN WATER) is shown in Table 4.","The metaphor STOCK MARKET IS A BOAT relates the stock market with the movement of boats (f̀lagship') in the ocean which 'plunge' and 'dive' (as of submarine), f̀loats,' ànchor' and create 'ripples' when moving in the ocean. From Table 4, the most prototypical mapping occurs with the word 'plunge,' with a total of 9 tokens. The following mapping principle for STOCK MARKET IS A BOAT is proposed for the English data: Stock market is a boat on open water because a boat moves in a direction on the water and the stock market moves in a direction in the economy.","For STOCK MARKET IS OCEAN WATER in Table 4, there are only 7 tokens found. These instances are too few to form a mapping principle for this metaphor. By simply analyzing these terms (h̀aven,' t̀urn tide' and c̀alm'), the English data do not seen to map onto the rising of the tides when referring to OCEAN WATER. To further examine this view, section 5 of this paper will look at another English corpus, i.e., the Wall Street Journal 1994 for comparing our analysis 130 English Translation FrequencyLexis *Tocar fondo Ancla Pin\":16-Wave of selling/panic Turbulence Bottom out Anchor Sea of opportunities 2 2 1 1 1 with the data of Charteris-Black and Ennis.

Table 5: Expressions for Spanish Metaphors","These expressions are also claimed to reflect the metaphor MARKET MOVEMENTS ARE NAUTICAL OR ARE WAYS OF MOVING IN THE WATER. Similar with the English data, there are terms which do not seem to fall within the source domain suggested. For instance, the term tocar fondo 'bottom out' is neither 'nautical' nor 'ways of moving in the water.' The word ancla 'anchor' is also found in the English data which has been re-categorized under the source domain of BOAT. The shaded expressions in Table 5 may relate to OCEAN WATER. However, since we are not provided with the full sentence, we assume that these terms are referring to the stock market. From the limited expressions provided in Table 4, we can only deduce that the Spanish may emphasize on the unpredictability of OCEAN (except for ancla 'anchor,' which belongs to BOAT).

Based on the data of Mandarin Chinese data and the Wall Street Journal 1994, English shares similar mapping with Mandarin Chinese when the source domain of OCEAN WATER is used. The Spanish data are too few to make comparisons in terms of Mapping Principles.

These specific linguistic aspects can be captured using the CM Model by specifying the source domain clearly and by extracting the relevant mapping principles across different languages. This is what sets the CM Model apart from the CTM. For future research, we will look into more instances of STOCK MARKET and its mappings with the source domains of BOAT and OCEAN in different languages. Our first step is to collect more English data from sources such as the ICAME and the Lancaster-Oslo/ Bergen (LOB) Corpora. Then we will proceed to look at other source domains such as NATURAL DISASTER. In order to make the selection of the source domains more automatized, our future work also comprise delimiting the knowledge (source) domains of these STOCK MARKET metaphors using an upper ontology such as SUMO (Suggested Upper Merged Ontology. The use of SUMO will help to reducing the manual analysis that we have carried out in this paper. For instance, in Chung, Ahrens and Huang (2003b) the 'speed' and 'direction' of the economic movements are related to TransportationDevice. Hence, the language of economy and stock market is a resourceful corpus for metaphor analysis.","paragraphs":["References","Ahrens, Kathleen. 2001. \"When Love is Not Digested: Underlying Reasons for Source to Target Domain Pairings in the Contemporary Theory of Metaphor.\" In Yuchau E.
