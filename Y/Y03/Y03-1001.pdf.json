{"sections":[{"title":"Virtual Linked Lexical Knowledge Base for Causality Reasoning","paragraphs":["Choi Key-Sun KA I ST, Lorterm Abstract The A virtually linked knowledge base is designed to utilize a pre-constructed knowledge base in a dynamic mode when it is in actual use. An algorithm is proposed for causality reasoning based on a set of lexical knowledge bases that contain information about such items as event role, is-a hierarchy, relevant relation, antonym, and other features. These lexical knowledge bases have mainly made use of lexical features and symbols in HowNet. Several types of questions are experimented to test the effectiveness of the algorithm here proposed. In particular, questions of the form why are treated to show how causality reasoning works."]}]}
