Tsou","Language Information Sciences Research Centre","City University of Hong Kong Tat Chee Avenue, Kowloon, Hong Kong","{rlolivia, rlbtsou}@cityu.edu.hk Abstract The problem of verb-noun categorial ambiguity is critical and relatively unique for non-inflectional languages, especially Chinese. We consider the verb-noun categorial fluidity a continuum and any categorial shift a transitional process. A synchronous corpus-based study was conducted to compare the phenomenon with respect to news texts collected from Hong Kong, Beijing, and Taiwan. It was found that about 15% of the verbs in the Hong Kong and Taiwan texts were undergoing the verb-noun categorial shift; whereas Beijing texts had more than 18% of the verbs undergoing this shift. The results also have important implications on various natural language applications, including lexicography, part-of-speech tagging of Chinese, as well as other natural language processing tasks. 1\\tIntroduction The problem of part-of-speech (POS) or categorial ambiguity, especially between nouns and verbs, as well as adjectives and verbs, has been widely discussed in the literature. Most contemporary Chinese grammarians would suggest that Chinese words have predefined lexical categories mainly based on their syntactic properties, which should not be contingent upon the grammatical function the words take in particular sentences (e.g. Zhu, 2001). For example, the word' MI huai2yi2, with a verb sense (\"to suspect\") to start with, should only appear as a verb in a dictionary, despite its variable usages found in real contexts, as in (1)1.","(1) a. RigititAv (I suspect he is a thief) -- verbal, predicate","wo3 huai2yi2 tal shi4 zei2","b. ft 1 74. ,;.-t Piri (He wears a suspicious look) -- adjectival, modifier","tal man3lian3 huai2yi2 biao3qing2","c. aRAftni\\t(This is only my suspicion) -- nominal, head of object noun phrase","zhe4 zhi3shi4 wo3 des huai2yi2","We call this relative flexibility of a word being used for different grammatical functions and possibly different POSs \"categorial fluidity\". This phenomenon thus poses a dilemma on tagging Chinese corpora. On the one hand, the theoretical and lexicographic concern is to keep the whole classification of Chinese syntactic categories straightforward, so that all words can be prescribed a category and all categories can be adequately described. On the other hand, the practical concern is to obtain authentic data on the distribution of word uses as this is the ultimate purpose of corpus tagging. Chinese POS tagging in the past had handled this problem in different ways (e.g. CKIP, 1993; Yu et al., 1998; Xia, 2000). For instance, regarding the fluidity between verbs and nouns, Xia (2000) assigned a verb tag if the word is used as a verb and a noun tag if it is used as a noun; whereas CKIP (1993) assigned the same 1 The digits following the Hanyu pinyin indicate the tone. 194 tag to the same word, but used features to encode specific grammatical functions, such as using [+nomj to indicate a nominalised usage of a verb. We suggest that the two concerns could be compromised, possibly via the tagset, as in Kwong and Tsou (2003), and maintain the mutual relation between the treatment of categorially fluid words and empirical evidence. Thus in the current work we further our empirical study of categorial fluidity between verbs and nouns. Moreover, we try to compare this phenomenon with respect to texts collected from various Chinese speech communities.","In Section 2, we first discuss the problem of POS ambiguity in Chinese. Then in Section 3, we consider the shift of a word from one POS to another a transitional process and identify three types of POS ambiguity along the categorial fluidity continuum. In Section 4, we describe the synchronous corpus-based study and report on the results obtained. Finally in Section 5, we discuss the results further with respect to their implications on lexicography, POS tagging, and other natural language processing tasks. 2 POS Ambiguity in Chinese When a word has multiple potential POS tags, the ambiguity has to be resolved in context. The problem of POS ambiguity is especially salient for Chinese, mainly for two reasons. First, categorial change in Chinese words is not often associated with morphological marking. As in (2), the genuine ambiguity between ling3dao3 as a verb (\"to lead\") and as a noun (\"leader\") is not marked by any derivational affixes, unlike its English counterparts. (2) a."]},{"title":"034","paragraphs":[".09visa (to lead the country forward) -- verb ling3dao3 guo2jial qian2jin4","b. fftAltillnIA4 (He is our leader) -- noun tal shi4 wo3men2 de5 ling3dao3 Second, there is no inherent one-to-one relationship between grammatical function and syntactic category. In (3), for example, the word 1I chang4gel (\"to sing\") is the predicate in (a) but is the modifier in (b) without any change in its form or indication by function words, unlike (c).","(3) a. 'tai (He sings) -- predicate","tal chang4gel","b. aggAW5 (inging skill) -- modifier","chang4gel ji4qiao3","c. rigiallig45Z15̀ (skill of singing) -- modifier","chang4gel des ji4qiao3 Hence it would not be ideal to classify Chinese words according to their grammatical function in a sentence as far as a classification system is concerned.","The first case above would be relatively easy to handle, as most people would accept it as genuine ambiguity and simply assign the corresponding category according to the sentential context. When fa","ling3dao3 refers to the person, it is a noun; and when it refers to the action of leading, it is a verb. The two uses are clearly distinguished. Similar examples include suo3 (noun for the \"physical lock\" and verb for the \"action of locking\"), Vi ff zhi3huil (noun for the \"conductor\" and verb for the \"action of conducting\"), IN guanl (noun for \"a difficult time or challenge\" and verb for the \"action of closing\"), etc.","The second case is more controversial. On the one hand, such variation of usages does not often involve substantial changes in the meaning, and is usually just a difference between the action itself and an abstraction of it. For instance, -VW ling3dao3 as in iftIgWafr9 tal ling3dao3 wo3men2 (he leads us) and .±-i-fteijois-F zai4 tal de5 ling3dao3 xia4 (under his leadership) only differ in the sense that the latter is an abstraction, referring to the activity of leading. On the other hand, it cannot be denied that 95 in changing the usage, the word has lost some or all of the properties belonging to its original category and acquired some or all of the properties belonging to another category.","There have been a number of different proposals for handling this phenomenon in Chinese. The earliest thoughts were to categorise a word according to its grammatical function in individual sentences, and we have just discussed its impracticality. This would presuppose the absence of inherent categorial property for relevant sentential units. It is also not acceptable as far as a classification system is concerned. Others suggested that the syntactic category of a word should to a certain extent depend on its meaning. If the meaning is the same or similar even if the word is used in different grammatical contexts, its syntactic category should not change. According to this proposal, all the rig chang4gel in (3) would be tagged as verb. Yet another approach, especially held by contemporary Chinese grammarians, is to determine the syntactic category of a word by the syntactic features it demonstrates or potentially possesses. We will further discuss this in the next section.","Notwithstanding what was said above, according to Liu (2000), POS ambiguity is a serious problem for Chinese but only in a small portion of the Chinese lexicon, especially among the most frequently used lexical items. 3\\tCategorial Fluidity and Shift Very often when a word is shifted from one lexical category to another, it loses and gains some syntactic features simultaneously. In this study, we will focus on the fluidity between verbs and nouns. For instance, verbs can usually be modified by adverbs and can be followed by tense and aspect markers. In the case of transitive verbs, they can take an object. Nouns, on the other hand, can most prominently be preceded by number and classifier, and modified by adjectives. Thus a nominalised transitive verb cannot take an object in the normal VO order, as in (4).

He found that in a stricter sense, 392 out of 3036 verbs (12.91%) fulfilled at least two of the three test criteria. In a looser sense, however, 587 (i.e. 19.33%) of the test words would be verb-noun ambiguous, fulfilling at least one of the three test criteria.","The asymmetry between nominalisation and verbalisation in Chinese was observed in Tai (1997). In other words, verbs are more freely deverbalised than nouns denominalised. This fluidity between verbal and nominal status of verbs can in theory be generalised to many, if not all, verbs. Nevertheless, does such categorial shift happen to all verbs? What words undergo such shift and how fast? At what point is 196 the shift significant enough to become genuine ambiguity? In the following we approach these questions with evidence from empirical data. 3.1 Three Levels of Ambiguity To start with, we consider categorial fluidity a continuum, from genuine ambiguities to specific cases of \"word play\". A categorial shift is treated as a transitional process, moving from the \"word play\" end toward the genuine ambiguity end. Thus we distinguish three levels of ambiguity, namely \"regular ambiguity\", \"transitional ambiguity\" and \"innovative ambiguity\". By regular ambiguity, we refer to a word having multiple POSs which are well accepted and described in any existing lexicon, as the example of 31 zhangl shown in (6) which may be argued to be cases of homonyms or even polysemy. Innovative ambiguity, at the other extreme, accounts for words which are sometimes deliberately used in uncommon ways to create a special effect, as the word"]},{"title":"/i\\axiao3chou3","paragraphs":["in (8). Such individual cases cannot be regarded as genuine ambiguity, until the special use becomes common enough. In between the two ends is transitional ambiguity, in which we are most interested for the current study. A word which originally belongs to a particular syntactic category and gradually assumes usage of another category undergoes a process of categorial shift. For instance, many prepositions in Chinese have evolved from verbs, as for the case of Ma tou4guo4 in (7).","(6) a. —Ene (apiece of blank paper)","yil zhangl bai2zhi3 b. 46N*Er=1 (rice ready,"]},{"title":"men","paragraphs":["mouth) fan4 lai2 zhangl kou3","c. 61%.

Nevertheless, it is the process of transition that is of linguistic interest, and the usage frequencies from corpus data gathered over time would give good evidence for it. As a result, when tagging a corpus, the different uses of the same word must be sufficiently represented to enable this kind of longitudinal empirical study to be carried out. 3.2 Treatment of Nominalised Verbs","For the current study, our working definition of nominalised verbs is corpus-based. A verb is tagged as","nominalised if it is found in one of the following five contexts: (i) directly preceded by number and classifier, (ii) directly modified by adjectival phrase, (iii) directly modified by a noun, (iv) as modifier in a nominal phrase, or (v) directly used as the object of you3. 197 News Type","Local International Financial","Sports Entertainment","Word Tokens 6,508 17,721 16,022 36,135 20,568","Word Types 1,906 3,477 3,390 6,172 4,855 4 A Synchronous Corpus-Based Study 4.1 Materials In this study, we used a subset of the LIVAC corpus 2 (Tsou and Lai, 2003). This subcorpus consists of newspaper texts from Hong Kong, Beijing, and Taiwan, covering local news, international news, financial news, sports news, and entertainment news, collected over the same period of time. The subcorpus sizes excluding numbers and non-Chinese characters are about 104K word tokens (15K word types) for Hong Kong data, 97K word tokens (13K word types) for Beijing data, and 74K word tokens (12K word types) for Taiwan data. The type-token ratios are similar for all three text sources. A further breakdown by news type is shown in Tables 1-3. The texts were segmented into words and each word was POS-tagged with the approach described in Kwong and Tsou (2003), and the notninalisation of verbs was determined by the criteria listed in Section 3.2. \\t","News Type\\tWord Tokens\\tWord Types Local\\t15,089\\t4,297 \\t International\\t19,670\\t4,886 Financial\\t18,898\\t3,596 Sports\\t31,518\\t5,967 \\t Entertainment\\t18,744\\t4,517 Table 1 Corpus Size by News Type for HONG KONG DATA Table 2 Corpus Size by News Type for BEIJING DATA News T e\\tWord Tokens\\tWord T es","Local\\t8,100\\t2,498 International\\t21,503\\t4,238 Financial\\t9,858\\t2,354","Sports\\t18,509\\t4,152","Entertainment\\t15,628\\t4,010 Table 3 Corpus Size by News Type for TAIWAN DATA 2 http://www.livac.org 198 4.2 Method First, all verbs (excluding copula verbs and auxiliary verbs) with their frequencies were extracted. Then out of these verbs, those which also exhibited noun or nominalised usages were extracted together with the corresponding frequencies. We call this set of verbs \"VN words\".","Next, a simple ratio (Eq.1) was computed for all VN words. The log ratio was used to give a linear scale. If verb usage outnumbers noun usage to a certain extent, i.e. when r >> 0, it suggests that the word is originally a verb and has just started to shift. If verb usage and noun usage are more or less equal, i.e. when r 0, then either the shift is mature enough or there is genuine ambiguity. Meanwhile, if noun usage outnumbers verb usage by a lot, i.e. when r << 0, it would mean that either the verb has over shifted or the word is originally a noun and is occasionally denominalised."]},{"title":"r","paragraphs":["= log 2"]},{"title":"verb uses\\t","paragraphs":["(Eq.1)"]},{"title":"noun uses","paragraphs":["4.3 Results The general results for the three data sources are shown in Table 4. The percentage of verbs is out of the total number of word types. The column \"No. in VN Shift\" indicates the amount of VN words out of all verbs. Out of these we analysed those with total frequency (i.e. the sum of both verb and noun usages) 5 or more for their r values, and the results are shown in the last three columns. It happened that each place had about 60% of the words reaching this threshold. With r ? 1, verb usage at least doubles noun usage. With 1 > r > -1, verb and noun usages are quite balanced. With r < -1, noun usage at least doubles verb usage. The general results in Table 4 thus suggest that in real use, there are about 3-4% more nominalised uses of verbs found in Beijing texts than in Hong Kong and Taiwan texts, which indicate quite a different, if not innovative, style of writing in Beijing texts. The figures also reflect the asymmetry between deverbalisation of verbs and denominalisation of nouns.","Hong Kong Beijing Taiwan 5,038 (33.8%) 3,913 (30.4%) 3,617 (31.4%) No. in VN","Shift 723 (14.4%) 724 (18.5%) 560 (15.5%)"]},{"title":"r>1\\t1>r>-1\\tr<-1","paragraphs":["(Only for word types with freq5̂) 51.6%","\\t 26.0%\\t22.4% 45.5%","\\t 29.7%\\t24.8% 49.1%","\\t 27.1%\\t23.8% Source\\tNo. of Verbs Table 4 Summary of Results (General)","The further analyses for the individual communities with regard to different news types are shown in Tables 5-7 for Hong Kong, Beijing and Taiwan respectively.

On the contrary, only about 35% on average of the VN words have r > 1 for the Beijing texts. In other words, many words which are verbs originally do not actually play the role of verbs in Beijing texts.

Thus, in Table 10 where we show examples from Hong Kong data under the three bands of r values, some of the words might belong to the so-called regular ambiguity, as discussed in Section 3. For example, -* sheng3 could mean \"province\" when used as a noun and \"to save\" when used as a verb, which are two substantially different meanings. In the future we might need to make such a distinction to better observe the more challenging phenomenon of transitional ambiguity regarding real verb-noun shifts. 201","Another point which might be of interest is to further analyse the nominalised usages with respect to the corresponding syntactic contexts, such as whether the nominalised verb is used as the head or the modifier in a nominal phrase. For instance, in the current study we did not analyse, for a VO structure, how often it is a verb-object structure and how often it is a modifier-head structure. This is worth further analysis in order to see the actual functions of nominalised usages of verbs.","The results of this study also have important implications on different natural language applications, such as lexicography, POS tagging, as well as other natural language processing tasks. For instance, on lexicography, a threshold could be devised and evidence could be obtained from our empirical data to determine when a verb undergoing the transitional verb-noun shift could be appropriately represented with both POSs in a dictionary. Thus in the last section we have seen that there is a continuum of the verb-noun shift and Table 10 shows examples with different r values. Hence, words like\\tyi4shi2 (\"consciousness\"), 3z-g jiao lyi4 (\"transaction\"), and Iff# xuan3ju3 (\"election\") could possibly be comfortably put under both verbs and nouns given their distribution of actual usages in real texts. For POS tagging, such transitional usages are preferably captured in the tagging process to enable empirical studies like this to be carried out on the one hand, and to distinguish between different syntactic structures such as verb-noun vs modifier-head on the other, which might be an important piece of information for subsequent language processing steps such as parsing.","Moreover, the relation between the extent of verb-noun categorial fluidity and text source as well as text type could be used as a cue for text categorisation. For example, in this study we found that Beijing texts exhibited 3-4% more verb-noun shifts than Hong Kong and Taiwan texts. This could be used as evidence or a feature for recognising writing styles or categorising texts by geographical origins."]},{"title":"T\\t","paragraphs":["4.1699\\tl'A\\t0.8074\\t"]},{"title":"ka\\t","paragraphs":["-2.0000 \\t 4.1699\\t:2?"]},{"title":"a\\t","paragraphs":["0.8074 \\t-2.0000"]},{"title":"ism\\t","paragraphs":["4.1699\\tÄit\\t0.8074glFiA\\t-2.3219"]},{"title":"itfla\\t","paragraphs":["4.0875\\t0.8074\\t"]},{"title":"-3ZA\\t","paragraphs":["-2.5850 g\\t4.0000\\t*.\\t0.8074\\t"]},{"title":"WV\\t","paragraphs":["-2.5850 \\t 4.0000\\t*\\t0.8074\\t"]},{"title":"iff\\t","paragraphs":["-2.6114"]},{"title":"Ea\\t","paragraphs":["3.9069\\t"]},{"title":"M$\\t","paragraphs":["0.8074 \\t-2.6630 brfig\\t3.8074\\t"]},{"title":"RN\\t","paragraphs":["0.2226\\t"]},{"title":"Wat\\t","paragraphs":["-2.8074 _Eli'\\t3.5850\\t"]},{"title":"A","paragraphs":["'YF\\t0.1926\\t"]},{"title":"SM\\t","paragraphs":["-2.9696"]},{"title":"4T \\t","paragraphs":["3.5850\\t"]},{"title":"_h \\t","paragraphs":["0.1769\\tgRa\\t-3.0000"]},{"title":"ITA.\\t","paragraphs":["3.5236\\t"]},{"title":"RM\\t","paragraphs":["0.1255\\t"]},{"title":"iTIJJ\\t","paragraphs":["-3.0000"]},{"title":"ffit\\t","paragraphs":["3.4594\\t"]},{"title":"it W\\t","paragraphs":["-0.0317\\t"]},{"title":"RN\\t","paragraphs":["-3.1699 *\\t3.4594\\t"]},{"title":"AM\\t","paragraphs":["-0.1375\\t"]},{"title":"fifft\\t","paragraphs":["-3.3219 g"]},{"title":"r.\\t","paragraphs":["3.1699\\titi9i\\t-0.1520\\t"]},{"title":"'w?\\t","paragraphs":["-3.3219 \\t 3.1699\\t"]},{"title":"glt\\t","paragraphs":["-0.1520\\t"]},{"title":"tH [\\t","paragraphs":["-4.0875 .M\\t3.1197\\t& \\t-0.2224\\tmi..,,\\t-4.1293"]},{"title":".e.iX\\t","paragraphs":["2.8074\\t"]},{"title":"5V,\\t","paragraphs":["-0.2224\\tfftt\\t-4.1699 .s=r . \\t2.8074\\tZe\\t-0.3219\\t"]},{"title":"flE\\t","paragraphs":["-4.3923 fila.at\\t2.8074\\tMI\\t-0.3219 \\t-4.4263lEi","\\t2.8074\\tffig\\t-0.3219\\t"]},{"title":"raJ\\t","paragraphs":["-4.9542 Table 10 Examples of VN Words from HONG KONG DATA 202","Thus in this paper, we have discussed the problem of verb-noun ambiguity in Chinese based on synchronous corpus data.
