{"sections":[{"title":"Non-monotonic Negativity","paragraphs":["Sumiyo Nishiguchi","Department of English Linguistics, Graduate School of Letters, Osaka University","Department of Linguistics, UCLA","405 Hilgard Avenue Los Angeles, CA 90024-1543 sue westgate@nifty.com Abstract The main aim of this paper is to provide a new analysis of licensers of negative polarity items (NPIs). The problems with Fauconnier-Ladusaw's downward entailment analysis have been argued since Linebarger (1980). I will show that there exists a class of weak NPI licensers characterized by non-monotonicity and exclusivity. Weak negation, which is monotone decreasing, has been known to license weak NPIs such as any and ever (Zwarts 1993). However, non-monotonic items also trigger these wideners. Exclusivity or uniqueness characterizes non-monotonic operators, such as only, exactly n, superlatives, ordinal numerals, the determiner the, generic NPs, and also if and only if clauses, hope, happy, glad and others. Many of them function as generalized quantifiers which prohibit either downward or upward entailment. As Jespersen (1917) traces the origin of NPIs back to the strengthening of negation, non-monotonic contexts also favor strengthening by these words.","We begin by considering the limited distribution of polarity items. The following section presents shortcomings of previous analyses, and then, non-monotonic expressions and their exclusivity are discussed. 1\\tIntroduction: Licensing Negative Polarity Items","Certain lexical items have been known to appear only in negative contexts. These, having been called","negative polarity items (henceforth, NPIs), are such as any, anything, anymore, ever, at all,","whatsoever, budge an inch, care to VP, and bother V-ing.","(1)\\tNot:","a.

A number of scholars have attempted to capture the common feature of NPI licensers from semantic (Ladusaw 1979, von Fintel 1999), syntactic (Progovac 1988, 1992, 1994), pragmatic (Yoshimura 1992), syntactic-pragmatic (Linebarger 1980), and semantic-pragmatic (Giannakidou 1998) viewpoints. None of them, however, are without shortcomings, as we will examine in the next section. 2 Previous Analyses and Problems 2.1 Ladusaw's DE Analysis and Counterexamples","Downward-Entailingness, proposed by Ladusaw (1979), is valid in characterizing numerous NPI","licensers.

Every student who attended the lecture had ever read anything about phrenology.","(ibid.:15)","The problem of DE analysis lies in that it fails to predict the NPI licensing in the scope of only, exactly","n and superlatives, which are neither monotone decreasing nor increasing (Linebarger 1980,","Hoeksema 1986b).","(8) Only: ..MON.. .TRIGGER. a.

John is the greatest man who ever lived in Japan.","Various attempts have been made to resolve the insufficiency of Ladusaw's DE analysis, with the emergence of two alternative methods: .) to discard DE theory and seek for another approach as Linebarger (1980) and others did; and, .) to adjust or expand DE analysis. Zwarts (1993, 1995, 1998), Giannakidou (1998), von Fintel (1999), van der Wouden (1997), Yoshimura (1992) and so forth have sought after this methodology. These suggestions are, however, not without inadequacies, as we discuss in the following sections. 1 Ladusaw (1980) defines scope as follows: \"For any two expressions a and p, constituents of a sentence 0, a is in the scope of p with respect to an interpretation of (1), 0', if the interpretation of a is used in the formulation of the argument to 13's interpretation in tr.\" (Ladusaw 1980:12) 2 Monotonicity in the first argument is called left monotonicity, and the one in the second argument is right monotonicity. Upward monotonicity in the first argument is described as MON, downward monotonicity in the second argument is MON 3 For notational convenience, in this paper, .̀TRIGGER' stands for NPI licensing in the first argument, and T̀RIGGER.' for triggering in the second argument. 4 In this paper the symbol 'I' represents invalidity in either upward or downward entailment. 205 2.2 Problems with Linebarger (1980, 1987)","Linebarger sets two-fold conditions for NPI licensing. First, NPIs must be in the immediate scope","of negation, and if not, Negative Implicature (NI) should provide negative contexts.","(10) Immediate Scope Contraint (ISC) A negative polarity item is acceptable in a sentence S if in the LF of X the subformula representing the NPI is in the immediate scope of the negation operator. An element is in the immediate scope of NOT only if (.) it occurs in a proposition that is the entire scope of NOT, and (.) within this proposition there are no logical elements intervening between it and NOT.","(Linebarger 1987:338)","For example, NPI is grammatical in the next sentence (13), for the reason that negation does not","have scope over the because-clause in LF: (11) He didn't budge an inch, because he was just a wooden statue.","LF: CAUSE ((NOT) he budged an inch)), he was just a wooden statue)","On the contrary, (12) *He didn't budge an inch because Mary pushed him (but because he was restless).","LF: NOT (CAUSE (he budged an inch, Mary pushed him)) (ibid.)","The NPI is ungrammatical, for negation has scope over the because-clause.","Second, the alternative condition, NI, grants any in the following sentence, although it fails to meet","the first criterion, ISC:","(13) The ocean isn't blue because it has any blue paint in it.","LF: NOT (CAUSE (it has any blue paint in it, The ocean is blue))","NI: The ocean doesn't have any blue paint in it.","(ibid.)","Even though there is CAUSE which occupies the place between NOT and NPI, (13) is grammatical,","by having negative implicature which permits any.","However, her dual standard fails to predict that glad and happy, which lack NI, trigger NPIs.","(14)a. A: But these tickets are terrible!","B: Be glad we got ANY tickets!","(Kadmon and Landman 1993:384)","b. I am glad that John bought a Honda.\\t--/-- >","I had expected that John would not buy a Honda.","Being glad that John bought a Honda does not necessarily indicate that the speaker did not expect it. \"I","was sure John would buy a Honda. I am glad he did so.\" is a possible utterance. Moreover, an example","with happy is:","(15) I am happy you passed the entrance exam. \\t>","I had expected that you would not pass the entrance exam.","The first sentence does not necessarily indicate that the admission was the last thing the speaker","expected. Thus, Linebarger's two-fold theory proves to be incomplete. 2.3 Nonveridicality (Zwarts 1995; Giannakidou 1998, 1999, 2001)","Zwarts and Giannakidou investigate the relationship between nonveridicality (Montague 1969) and monotonicity. Giannakidou claims that àffective' 5 dependencies come in two varieties: 0 \"narrow\" sensitivity- NPIs are sensitive to negation and negative operators, and 0 \"broader\" sensitivity– affective polarity items (APIs) are sensitive to nonveridicality). The former forms a proper subset of the latter, as NPIs are included in the APIs.","(16)•. A polarity item a is an expression whose distribution is limited by sensitivity to some","semantic property of the context of appearance. 5 The term 'affective' was first used by Klima (1964), meaning negative feature. 206 ••\\t(3 is (non)veridicality.","(Giannakidou 1998:17)","(17)\\tOp is veridical just in case Opp --0 p is logically valid. Otherwise, Op is","nonveridical.\\t (ibid. :106)","The merit of nonveridicality analysis is that it can rightly describe NPI licensing by non-monotonic","(NM) operators such as strong intentional verbs like hope. (18) I hope there is any left. ./.\\tThere is any left.","Nevertheless, although nonveridicality catches the common feature of NPI licensers such as modals","and intentional verbs, it falls short in explaining NPI licensing by superlatives, only, and exactly n,","which are veridical. (19) Only John eats oatmeal. John eats oatmeal.","Being aware of this problem, she adds another condition, namely, negative implicature, which","resembles Lineberger. (20) Licensing condition for affective polarity items",".. An affective polarity item a will be licensed in a sentence S iff S provides some","expressions 7 which is nonveridical, and a is in the scope of y.",".• \\t","\\t In certain cases, a may be licensed i (ibid.:149)","The second condition, NI, manages to explain the affectivity of only:","(21)a. Monon i Theodora idhe it Roxani. (Greek)","only the Theodora saw.3sg the Roxanne","Ònly Theodora saw Roxanne.'\\t--> b. Nobody other than Theodora saw Roxanne.","(ibid.:154)","Yet, the obvious counterexamples are, NPI licensing by glad and happy which are neither","nonveridical nor accommodating negative implicature. (22) I was glad that John had llamas in his apartment. -->","John had llamas in his apartment.\\t(veridical) (23) I was glad that John had llamas in his apartment. --/-->","I had expected that John would not have llamas in his apartment.","Being glad that John had llamas presupposes the veridicality of having llamas, without indicating","unexpectancy. Therefore, her suggestions do not cover the whole range of affective contexts. 2.4 Strawson DE (von Fintel 1999)","von Fintel (1999) claims that NPI licensing is sensitive to Strawson Entailment, which is the","expansion from logical DE-ness, for the purpose of accounting for the affectivity unexplainable by","Ladusaw's DE theory. (24) Strawson Downward Entailingness","A function f of type <a, t>is Strawson- DE","iff for all x, y of type a such that x y andf(x) is defined:","f(y)\\tf(x)","(von Fintel 1999:104)","The additional process, 'define f(x),' suffices for the presupposition of the conclusion.","To illustrate, only, which is not logical DE, is Strawson DE.","(25)a. Only John ate vegetables for breakfast. --->","b. Only John ate kale for breakfast.","Since only John ate vegetables does not guarantee that he ate kale, only N is not logical DE. But (a)","Strawson Entails (b), under the assumption that the presupposition of (b), namely, John ate kale for","breakfast, is satisfied.","However, even though the notion of Strawson DE-ness succeeds in solving certain problems, it","fails to offer sufficient explanation for the triggerhood of exactly n and the n. 207 (26)a. Exactly five children ate vegetables for breakfast.","b. Exactly five children ate kale for breakfast. (27) Kale is a vegetable.","Children ate kale for breakfast.","Exactly five children ate vegetables for breakfast. .*.\\t?Exactly five children ate kale for breakfast.","Provided that the presupposition of the (b) sentence, Children ate kale for breakfast, is satisfied, it","does not ensure that kale was the only vegetable they ate. Possibly, three of them ate kale, while the","other two ate broccoli. Although such a situation does not falsify the presupposition, the conclusion,","Exactly five children ate kale for breakfast, is not inferred, therefore, (a) does not Strawson Entail (b).","The same reasoning applies to the n. Thus, Strawson DE-ness also has to account for counterexamples. 2.5 A Hierarchy of Negative Expressions (Zwarts 1993; van der Wouden 1997)","Zwarts (1993, 1998) classifies three types of NPIs which are \"weak\", \"strong\", and \"superstrong\",","according to DE-ness, anti-additivity and anti-morphy respectively. van der Wouden (1997) develops","these features as follows:","(28) monotone decreasing f(X)uf(Y)c f(XnY)\\tfew, seldom, hardly f(XuY)c. f(X)nf(Y)","anti-additive\\tf(X)uf(Y)c f(XnY)\\tnobody, never, nothing f(XuY)c f(X)nf(Y) f(X)nf(Y) c f(XuY)","antimultiplicative\\tf(XnY) c f(X)uf(Y)\\tnot every, not always f(X)uf(Y) c f(XnY) f(XuY)c f(X)nf(Y)","antimorphic\\tf(XnY) f(X)uf(Y)\\tnot, not the teacher, not f(X)uf(Y) f(XnY)\\tJudas f(XuY)c. f(X)nf(Y) f(X)nf(Y) f(XuY)","(van der Wouden 1997:106)","The problem of these analyses is that non-monotonic NPI licensers such as only, the first, or the do","not fit even the weakest category, that is DE, but still they accommodate weak type of NPIs such as","any or ever.","(29) Only: non-DE","Only John smokes or only Mary smokes. -1—* Only John and Mary smokes.","Only John or Mary smokes \\t-1—> Only John smokes and only Mary smokes. (30) The first: non-DE","The first man who comes in smokes or the first woman who comes in smokes. -/--*","The first man who comes in and the first woman who comes in smoke. (31) The6: non-DE","The man who came in smokes or the woman who came in smokes. 4—*","The man who came in and the woman who came in smoke.","These examples clearly indicate that monotone decreasingness is not a sufficient description of","affective contexts. Rather, anti-UEness should be the key notion to polarity sensitivity, as we will","discuss in section 3. 2.6 A Binding Approach (Progovac 1988, 1992, 1994) Progovac advocates a binding-theoretic approach, assuming that NPIs obey locality conditions as anaphors do:","(32) NPIs are subject to Principle A of the Binding Theory. 6 See 3.1.1. 208 (33) PPIs are subject to Principle B of the Binding Theory.'","(Progovac 1994:2)","The basis of her claim is the fact that NPIs always take narrow-scope interpretation with respect to","negation, while other quantifiers produce scope ambiguity:","(34) Many/every people didn't come. (many/every > not; not>many/every) (35) I didn't do anything wrong.","(*anything>not; not>anything) The potential binders for polarity items are functional categories: negation in Infl or a truth conditional polarity operator (Op) generated in Comp (Laka 1990). Noticeably, in order to integrate questions, which are not DE, into Ladusaw's framework, she suggests the possibility to expand the range of non-negative licensing contexts to non-UE-ness:","(36) An NPI is prohibited in an Upward Entailing clause. (Progovac 1994:135)","As questions are not upward entailing, they can license NPIs:","(37)a. Do you have a dog? (No)","b. Do you have a pet? (No) However, her analysis wrongly predicts that any non-UE context would trigger any kind of","NPIs.","(38)a. *Exactly five children lifted a finger.","b. Exactly five children have ever done anything for her.","Obviously, more restrictions are necessary. In section 3, I will show that non-monotonic scope","can license only weak NPIs. Also, an additional condition should restrict non-UE NPI licensers. IT The Cognitive Structure of Negation (Yoshimura 1992, 1996) Yoshimura, advocating Ladusaw's DE theory, suggests the cognitive structure of negation in the","framework of Relevance Theory.","(39)\\tThe Cognitive Structure of Negation (CSN)","<4 ,\\twhere the logical forms 4 and lead to a contradiction.","(Yoshimura 1992:258)","The advantage of this analysis is the validity in explaining polarity sensitivity of adversative","predicates, which are not outward DE as the following examples demonstrate:","(40)a. Mary was surprised that John bought a car.","Mary was surprised that John bought a Mercedes.","b. Mary was surprised that John knew any spies.","According to Yoshimura, the contradictory assumption that John would not have any spy","acquaintances forms a mental process adequate for NPIs. CSN, however, is not able to explain why only and exactly n license NPIs, which are not equipped","with contextual contradiction. Being aware of this problem, she acknowledges the need for","amendments to DE theory. Superlatives are also problematic to CSN.","(41) John won the game. Actually he was the first student to have won the game.","The speaker does not have any contradictory assumption that John would not win the game. So, as we have seen, all previous analyses have their shortcomings respectively. A better","description of the whole range of NPI licensers is called for. The next section presents one. 3\\tSolution: Anti-UE and Exclusivity Condition","In this section, I propose a new description of NPI licensers; that is, anti-UEness (Upward Entailingness) and exclusivity condition, which non-monotonic NPI licensers should meet. I will show that non-monotonic licensers as a class can trigger weak NPIs. In order to support this argument, I will 7 P̀PIs' stand for Positive Polarity Items, e.g., some. 209 present an overview of this class, by way of listing its members, starting from NM determiners, and next NM non-determiners. Afterward, the exclusive feature of this class comes to the fore, which gives rise to NPIs in their scope. Lastly, pragmatic strengthening is considered as the force behind it. 3.1 Anti-UE","As indicated by Progovac (1992), non-UE contexts can license NPIs.","(42) A function f of type <a, s> is the NPI licenser iff","for all x, y of type a such that x y, f(x)\\tf(y)","Anti-UE contexts, which include the unified class both DE and NM scope, can be polarity sensitive.

We will expand the list of NM determiners by Zwarts","(1996), 8 and investigate if their NM scope can license NPIs. Moreover, I add ordinal numerals, the,","and generic NPs to NM determiners.","(43) Exactly n: ..MON. „TRIGGER.\\t(Ladusaw 1980)","a.

These, too, trigger NPIs in their NM scope, supporting the evidence of non-UE analysis.

We will","consider the relation between exclusivity or uniqueness and NPI licensing, in order to capture the","nature of affectivity. Non-monotonic operators which share the assertion, 'no other than x is g(y),'","pragmatically prefer strengthening by polarity items.

I proposed the new notion, anti-UEness (that is, DE plus NM) and exclusivity condition, which rightly predict the wider range of affective contexts, such as exactly n, the, glad, happy, and hope, which was not fully explained previously. Exclusivity characterizes NM licensers, functioning as generalized quantifiers which define the exact number of the NPs which are members of the intersection of the two arguments. Their uniqueness gives rise to the usage of NPIs for emphatic effect in NM contexts. Acknowledgements I wish to express my gratitude to COL1PS for granting conference sponsorship.
