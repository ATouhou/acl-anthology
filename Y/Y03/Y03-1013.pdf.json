These nouns can refer to either the contour (i.e. the outside edge) or enclosed area of the shape. In this paper, we will try to explain this lexical semantic fact both in terms of the cognitive theory of grounding and the visualization. Our study will be focused on quanlzi5 'circle', which has the typical semantic behaviors of the shape nouns but also allow two additional interesting meaning extensions. 1. Background: the meaning of shape nouns Shape is an instance of a visual configuration while people perceive or recognize an object (Zusne 1970). We name these visual forms in term of their stimulous properties that we identified, such as a triangle is composed by three co-terminated lines that form three angles, and a circle is a continuous curved line without angles. By studying the semantics of shape nouns, we can gain substantial knowledge about what prominent properties people perceive while identifying shapes, and what cognitive concept that underlying the meaning of shape nouns. Mandarin shape nouns, such as a fanglxing2 'square' and sanifiao3xing2 'triangle', share a set of very interesting lexical semantic features. These nouns can refer to either the contour (i.e. the outside edge) or enclosed area of the shape. In this paper, we will try to explain this lexical semantic fact both in terms of the cognitive theory of grounding and the visualization. Our study will be focused on quanlzi5 'circle', which has the typical semantic behaviors of the shape nouns but also allow two additional interesting meaning extensions. In the following, Section 2 presents the data of quanizi5. Section 3 describes the sense distinction of the meaning of quanlzi5. Section 4 explains the lexical semantics of shapes in term of the figure/ground theory and the visualization. Section 5 is a conclusion. 115 2. The Meaning of Quanlzi5 'Circle': the data Like all shape nouns, quanlzi5 has the basic meanings of a circular contour (1) or the area enclosed by the circular contour (2). In addition, its area meaning can be extended metaphorically to refer to an area defined by human activity (3), an abstract confinement (4), and a set of related people often defined by their social strata (5). And its linear contour meaning can be extended to refer to a path where the end point coincides with the start point (6).

Like all lexical polysemy, ambiguity between physical and metaphorical meanings of quanlzi5 is attested, such as in (7). Quanlzi5 has three possible readings: a professional group (7a), the area that dancing circle enclosed (7b), and the dancing circle itself (7c). \\t (7) NS\\tT\\tiAt\\trA\\tiflffl \\tyinwei\\ttiao lei le to jueding likai\\tzhe\\tge\\tquanzi \\t because\\tdance tired LE he decide leave \\tthis CLASS circle (7a) He decided to leave from the dancing circle (formed by dancers) because he is tired. (7b) He decided to leave the dancing area circle because of being tired. (7c) He decided to leave the dancing circle because he is tired of all the dancing. Based on the above examples, quanlzi5 seems to have four meanings. In next section, we will display the semantic representation of quanlzi5 in terms of a semantic model and give a clear explanation. 3. Accounting for the Meaning of Quanlzi5 Quanlzi5 is an example of polysemy, which is a situation where a single word has a set of related meanings. According to Ahrens et al (1998), the lexical meaning of a polysemy can be distinguished into two levels: senses and meaning facets'. They stated that a lexical sense entails the following properties: (A) different sense cannot appear in the same context (unless the complexity is triggered deliberately); (B) a sense is not an instance of metonymic or meronymic extension, but may be an instance of metaphorical extension (Lin and Ahrens, 2000); (C) the link between two senses cannot be inherited by a class of nouns. On the other hand, a meaning facet has the properties as follows: 1 The 'meaning facet' used here differs from 'facet' of Cruse (2000). For Cruse, facet is an expression to indicate a degree of meaning distinctness. For example, 'book' in (i) and (ii) is referred to 'a physical object' and 'the text which the physical object embodies' respectively. These two readings for 'book', which are not ordinary ambiguity, but still represent two senses, are called facets by Cruse. (i) Please put this book back on the shelf. (ii) I find this book unreadable.","(Cruse, 2000, p.114) In this paper, we use 'facet' to represent a meaning that extends from a particular sense. This concept is similar to Cruse's 'sense modulation' (2000, p. 120-123). 117 (8)\\tVt\\tT ,\\tti t\\trmi\\tfiti yinwei tiao lei le ta jueding likai the ge quanzi tuoli because dance tired LE he decide leave this CLASS circle leave H̀e decided to leave the dancing circle because he is tired of all the dancing.'","V.q itt (A) it can appear in the same context as other meaning facets; (B) it is an extension from a core sense or from another meaning facet; (C) nouns of the same semantic classes will have similar extension to related meaning facets. In terms of the examples of quanlzi5 given above, it is evident that the meaning in example (1) and (2) is locational (physical) sense, and meaning in example (3) to (6) is metaphorical (abstract) that is derived form locational sense. Physical concept and abstract concept belong to two knowledge domains. This means the meaning of quanlzi5 should be categorized into two kinds of senses in accordance with sense property (B) mentioned above. However, if we consider example (7), it seems that locational meaning and metaphorical meaning of quanlzi5 are two meaning facets of one sense, because these meanings can occur in the same sentence (context). To resolve this dilemma, we need to make a distinction between independent ambiguous meanings and co-dependent meaning facets of a word form (Huang et al. 2003). Even though multiple meanings are available to humans in both cases, the multiple meanings can and must be resolved (called disambiguation) only in the case of genuine ambiguity. Co-dependent meaning facets, on the other hand, allow the multiple meaning to exist and be interpreted by the hearer. Take (7) for instance. If we add more sentences (contexts) to (7), like (8), the context would force readers to choose one meaning between physical circle (7a, b) or metaphorical circle (7c). In the case of (8), quanlzi5 only has the meaning of a social group. M 5Ywudao jei dancing circle But, it is not easy to decide whether quanlzi5 has the meaning of the area that the circle limits or the circle itself, even we add extra information in (7), which is illustrated in (9), or in other sentence, like (10). (9) OS\\tT\\t''At\\tRid yinwei tiao lei le ta jueding likai zhe ge quanzi zuo huei yizi shang xiouxi because dance tired LE he decide leave this CLASS circle sit back chair \\trest (9a) 'He decided to leave from the dancing circle (formed by dancers) and sat back to rest because he is tired.' (9b) 'He decided to leave the dancing area circle and sat back to rest because of being tired.' 118 (10) EiEly; youyu\\trenshu\\tyu lai yu duo\\tquanzi\\tyu wei yu da because amount of people more and more circle bigger and bigger (10a) 'The circle (formed by people) became bigger and bigger because more and more people were joining in (the circle).' (10b) 'The area of the circle became bigger and bigger because more and more people were joining in (the circle).' Based on the discussion and sentences presented above, we can sum up that quanlzi5 has three senses. One is core sense and refers to physical circle (ex.l, 2, 7a, 7b, 9 and 10); the other two are metaphorical sense extended from the core sense and refer to abstract circle about human activity (ex. 3-6, 7c and 8). The core meaning we assign to quanizi5 is 'a directional circle-like line with end point coinciding with start point'. The reason we take this definition as a core meaning for all the senses is based on the contrast between quanlzi5 and huan2 'ring'. While both refer to a circular circumference, huan2 is a perfect sense that has no beginning and ending; while quanlzi5 always implies an end point coinciding with the start point. Hence, we can draw (hua4) a quanlzi5 but not a huan2. In addition, with the drawing meaning, quanlzi5 implies a center of the circle while huan2 does not. It is this entailed centric point which allows a human reference point for the other two abstract meanings of quanlzi5. Furthermore, under the core sense, quanlzi5 has two meaning facets. One refers to a physical object and the other refers to the area that the circle limits. According to Ahrens et al. (1998), they found that meronymic and metonymic extensions are two main ways that meaning facets extend from a sense. Meronymic extension is the part-whole relation that the whole stands for part, and part stands for whole. As for metonymic extension, it's \"extended meaning is related to the origin of the basic sense, but is not inherent to the basic sense\" (Ahrens et al., 1998, p.56). In the case of quanlzi5 in (2), we use one directional line (part) to stand for two-dimensional area (whole), so this meaning extension is meronymic, and can be explained in terms of cognitive and conceptual saliency. We will discuss it in next section. Based on the discussion, the meanings of quanlzi5 are represented in (11), where we repeat example (1)–(6) to show the context that different meaning of quanlzi5 appears in. The meaning representation is in accordance with Ahrens et al. (1998), which is elaborated in CKIP Technical Report 03-01 (2003).

Cognitive Explanation for the Lexical Semantics of Shapes In this section, we will give a explanation regarding meaning extension of quanlzi5, which will base on cognition theories. In the beginning, we will discuss the meronymic extension of two meaning facets of quanlzi5. 4.1 Meronymic Extension of Quanlzi5 In the area of visual form research, both shape and figure are terms for a stimulus of visual perception. Shape is more general term for visual stimulus while figure has a specific use in the distinction between figure and ground in Gestalt psychology (Zusne 1970). Therefore, in terms of cognitive linguistics, a shape is a Figure that achieved prominence in front of a less well-defined two-dimensional Ground (Ungerer & Schmid 1996). However, the contour of shape (or the circumference of circle for quanlzi5), is the transition between the Ground and Figure. For an abstract shape as a Figure (such as a triangle, a square, a rectangle, a circle etc.) the two-dimensional area it defmes is NOT different from its Ground. It is only the transition of the contour that defmes this Figure. In other words, the most salient cognitive feature in this abstract space is the contour. This explains why cognitively the contour is prominent for all shape nouns and can be distinguished as a meaning facet. In terms of visual perception, we know that human visual function identifies an object by identifying its shape (i.e. contour) first. This is represented in the above cognitive account of the prominence of transition. In other words, a homogenous area does NOT attract visual attention. It is the transitional feature that calls for visual attention. And when the transitional contour defines an area, we see a shape. This functional account of vision may be the fundamental motivation for language to encode the contour and the defined area as the two meaning facets of a shape. In the following section, we will then explain the metaphorical extension of sense 2 and 3 about quanlzi5. 4.2 Metaphorical Extension of Quanlzi5 As for shape-process noun, such as quanlzi5, which includes in the meaning the process of making/drawing that contour, a human reference point is implied. This human reference point is either the drawer, or the central point from which a circle is defined (mathematically as all area within the same distance from that point). This is the basis for the metaphorical extension where the locational definition of circle and quanlzi5, can be extended to mean a certain set of social activities or relations centered on that reference point. Without the reference central point, no such extension is possible. Hence, we do not find the same extensions for triangle, square, rectangle, etc. 121 On the other hand, the meaning of PATH in sense 2 requires a start point and an end point. The shape-process noun of circle necessarily involves these points. Hence, its extension to take on a PATH role with verbs that require them is natural. 5.
