During the past decades, many different techniques have been proposed for Chinese word segmentation, ranging from dictionary or rule based methods (Liang and Zheng 1991; Yeh and Lee 1991), statistical approaches (Fu and Wang 1999; Nie et al. 1995; Teahan et al. 2000; Wang et al. 2000; Yao 1997; Zhang et al. 2002), to machine learning approach (Hockenmaier and Brew 1998; Palmer 1997; Xue and Converse 2002). However, we are still faced with word boundary ambiguities and unknown words while developing a high-performance system for practical applications. What is more, ambiguity resolution and unknown word identification are often taken as two independent stages in previous word segmentation systems for Chinese. In this point, disambiguation is considered as a unique problem related to known word segmentation and unknown word identification is taken as a post-processing of known word segmentation. Although this two-stage strategy is simple and applicable, it usually fails to yield correct results for some complicated cases such as a mixture of ambiguities and unknown words. For instance, in a Chinese sentence 1"]},{"title":"1","paragraphs":["3"]},{"title":"IT\\t,","paragraphs":["the correct segmentation for the fragment 11:1 4T-LEX should be 11:1 X/ (zhonglhang2 chang2ge2,"]},{"title":"Bank of China/Changgel).","paragraphs":["However, Most two-stage systems cannot yield this segmentation because this string has been wrongly segmented as /IT -K/ / (zhongl hang2zhang3 ge2,"]},{"title":"middlelpresidentlGe6 in","paragraphs":["process of known segmentation and there is no a mechanism to re-segment the word IT (hang2zhang3,"]},{"title":"president)","paragraphs":["during unknown word identification.

However, the parser coverage may restrict its applications 80 in practical systems.

However, a role-tagged corpus is needed in their work to learn role knowledge, which is not always available in practice.","To address above problems, this paper presents an integrated word segmentation approach for Chinese, which can perform disambiguation and unknown word identification simultaneously on the input.

(2) Viterbi decoding: This step uses the hybrid model in equation (7) to score all possible segmentations, and then applies Viterbi algorithm to search an optimal path in above word lattice that has the maximum score. This optimal path contains the best word sequence for the input."]},{"title":"3.2 Filter algorithm","paragraphs":["Word candidate construction is a challenge in integrated word segmentation. Unlike the two-stage strategy mentioned above, all possible word candidates, including known words and unknown words, are considered equally in integrated segmentation. Obviously, it is easy to build all known word candidates for a sentence only by looking up the lexicon used. But for the construction of unknown word candidates, it is a very difficult task. In fact, Chinese unknown words constitute an open set in that they are generally built by rather free word-formation rules. In theory, any combination of characters in the input may be an unknown word candidate. If we freely consider all these possible combinations as word candidates, the number may increase exponentially, which will fmally results in combination explosion and rapidly decreasing in segmentation efficiency. Furthermore, building unknown word candidate without any restriction may yield a number of pseudo unknown words into the final result. Consequently, how to build effectively all eligible unknown word candidates for the input is crucial for integrated segmentation. (7) 83","The filter algorithm attempts to prevent some potential combinations of characters in the input from becoming an eligible word candidate, which have low likelihood in forming a word. Although an unknown word may be any combination of characters in Chinese, it does not mean that we can freely consider any character string as an eligible word candidate. In practice, some Chinese characters or character combinations are seldom or never used as parts of unknown words. As mentioned in (Nie, Hannan and Jin 1995), the so-called functional characters with low word-formation power, such as"]},{"title":"n","paragraphs":["(De3, of) and"]},{"title":"T","paragraphs":["(Liao3, already), are hardly found in unknown words. Nie et al.(1995) and Wu and Jiang (2000) use word-formation power to block such combinations in word candidate construction. However, their methods are character based. They only take into consideration the word-formation power of each component character in their work. In our opinion, whether a character string should be blocked from becoming an eligible word candidate depends not only on the word-formation power of each component itself but also on the internal juncture probabilities between these components. In particular, we employ the word-based word-formation power and the internal word juncture probability to capture these features and define three conditions for filtering these ineligible candidates in our algorithm.. Let w= el e2 • el denote a potential word candidate, then these conditions can be formally defmed as followings:","(1) Word-length condition: If w is an eligible word candidate, then its length 1w f< TL .

The larger TwFp and Tw jm generally results in higher precision and lower recall in unknown word identification."]},{"title":"4 EXPERIMENTS","paragraphs":["In evaluating the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct an experiment on Peking University corpus.

What is more, we also hope our experiments can answer how much contribution different strategies and models make to the performance in segmentation.","The results of this experiment are presented in Table 2. Note that only the first three methods have unknown-word identification capability, the measures on unknown words for the other methods should be zero in theory. However, they are not in fact due to the reason of non-standard unknown words. In general, there are two groups of unknown words in Chinese texts, i.e. the standard unknown-words that are made up of pure Chinese characters and the non-standard unknown-words that contain non-Chinese characters such as numerals and alphabets. We uses one and the same rule-based module to cope with the non-standard words throughout our experiments.","From these results, we can draw some conclusions. Firstly, the integrated segmentation outperforms other methods on a whole. As can be seen in Table 2, the integrated method achieves the best performances in all other measures, except for the recall on known word and the process time. In comparison with the typical two-stage segmentation (viz. M2) based on the same models, the integrated strategy leads to improvement in overall F-measure by 0.6% and the"]},{"title":"F-measure on","paragraphs":["85"]},{"title":"unknown words","paragraphs":["(Fuw) by 0.8%. Secondly, word-based models outperform character-based models. Although both M2 and M3 use the two-stage strategy to perform segmentation, M2 improves the segmentation accuracy (overall F-measure) by 1.8% from 93.7% to 95.5% and the unknown word accuracy (F-measure on unknown word) by 13.6% from 66.8% to 80.4%, compared with M3. This indicates that word-based word-formation models (viz. word-based word-formation patterns and word juncture models) are more powerful than character-based word-formation models (viz. character-based word-formation patterns and character juncture models), especially in unknown word identification. Thirdly, M4 achieves the highest score in the recall on known word segmentation, which shows word n-gram is powerful to capture the important contextual information for disambiguation. It also shows that there are still a number of pseudo unknown words identified wrongly by our system. Finally, although integrated segmentation yields the best results, further efforts are still needed to improve its efficiency."]},{"title":"5 CONCLUSIONS","paragraphs":["This paper presents an integrated word segmentation algorithm for Chinese.
