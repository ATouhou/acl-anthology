This paper proposes a method that extracts term pairs satisfying is-a relations or part-of relations from a mass corpus using pairs of patterns sharing a term. We extracted reliable single patterns and pattern pairs using some term pairs that satisfy the target relation, and extracted reliable term pairs using these patterns. The extracted term pairs were used to extract new single patterns and pattern pairs, and we repeated these steps several times. The proposed method achieved 71.5% accuracy in detecting is-a relations and 88% accuracy in detecting part-of relations, and extracted 144 new is-a relations and 85 new part-of relations which could not be extracted using single patterns. These results are useful in constructing an ontology and a thesaurus because these language knowledge bases consist mainly of is-a relations and part-of relations.

The ontology is useful in semantic analysis of natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR). Methods that construct the ontology fall into two categories: those that combine existing ontologies and thesauruses (Maedche and Staab, 2002) and those that semi-automatically construct the ontology using a mass corpus (Kavalec and Svatek, 2005). The first method focuses on expanding the ontology using existing resources, and the second method focuses on constructing new ontologies. Particularly, constructing the ontology using a mass corpus begins with automatic extraction of semantic relations.","Extraction of semantic relations is a process that extracts term pairs that satisfy a specified target relation. The most common approach in this process is a pattern-based approach for is-a and part-of relations (Berland and Charniak, 1999; Girju et al., 2003; Hearst, 1992; Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002). This approach regards words appearing between terms as patterns, and extracts term pairs using the patterns. Hearst (1992) extracts is-a relations using manual patterns, and proposes a bootstrapping algorithm using seed term pairs. To extract part-of relations, Berland and Charniak (1999) measure the reliabilities of terms using the frequencies of terms that have the concept of “whole” or “part,” and Girju et al. (2003) uses a lexical database (WordNet) and a decision tree. Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) extract semantic relations for various terms in a question answering (QA) system. Pantel and 260 23rd Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation, pages 260–268   Pennacchiotti (2006) propose Espresso algorithm that uses the reliabilities of terms and patterns, and that has good performance. This algorithm is applied to a coreference resolution (Yang and Su, 2007). However, these methods consider only single sentences to extract patterns, and can not extract pairs of terms in different sentences. In single sentences, the term pairs satisfying is-a relations are, in fact, few, and the kind of patterns reflecting each target relation are very restricted. If previous methods use an open-domain corpus, these methods may not be useful.","We propose a method that extracts term pairs satisfying is-a relations or part-of relations from a mass corpus using pairs of patterns sharing a term, and compare the result with a previous method (Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006) that uses single patterns. The proposed method can extract pairs of terms in different sentences in the corpus because this method uses pairs of patterns that can appear in different sentences. This characteristic of pattern pairs will enable extraction of reliable term pairs, and produce good performance.","For the previous method and the proposed method, we evaluate the accuracy of the extracted term pairs, and count the new term pairs which can not be extracted using single patterns. A description of the proposed method is given in Section 2, results are given in Section 3, a discussion is given in Section 4, and a conclusion is given in Section 5."]},{"title":"2 Materials and Methods 2.1 Overview","paragraphs":["A “term” is a meaningful noun or noun phrase that does not include articles, and a “pattern” is the set of positions of the terms and the words between the terms.

This algorithm extracts patterns appearing between some prepared term pairs (seed term pairs) that satisfy a specified target relation.
