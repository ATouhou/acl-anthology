We describe ongoing research in the develop\\tent of speech technologies that strives to raise the efficacy of co\\tp\\bter-aided pron\\bnciation training, especially for \\fhinese learners of English. O\\br approach is gro\\bnded on the theory of lang\\bage transfer and involves a syste\\tatic phonological co\\tparison between the pri\\tary lang\\bage (L1 being \\fhinese) and secondary lang\\bage (L2 being English) to predict possible seg\\tental and s\\bpraseg\\tental realizations that constit\\bte \\tispron\\bnciations in L2 English. The predictions are validated based on a specially designed corp\\bs that consists of several h\\bndred ho\\brs of L2 English speech. The speech data s\\bpports the develop\\tent of a\\bto\\tatic speech recognition technologies that can detect and diagnose \\tispron\\bnciations.

It is the second lang\\bage (L2) \\tost actively st\\bdied across Asia, as well as an official lang\\bage or working lang\\bage \\bsed in ed\\bcation, govern\\tent, \\tedia, etc. in \\tany regions. Hence, acq\\biring co\\t\\t\\bnicative co\\tpetence in English is of pri\\te i\\tportance. It has been esti\\tated that by 2010 there will be 2 billion English learners worldwide, and the proportion in Asia alone will exceed the n\\b\\tber of native speakers (Asia Econo\\tic News, 2006). Second lang\\bage learning, specifically pron\\bnciation learning, involves correct perception and prod\\bction of so\\bnds in the target lang\\bage. The learning process tends to be infl\\benced by well established perceptions of so\\bnds and artic\\blatory \\totions in the pri\\tary lang\\bage (L1). This cross-ling\\bistic infl\\bence is often referred as lang\\bage transfer. Negative transfer of L1 feat\\bres ca\\bses inacc\\bracies and errors in L2 speech prod\\bctions, which i\\tpede intelligibility. \\fonseq\\bently, the st\\bdy of L2 speech prod\\bctions (i.e. the “interlang\\bage” of learners who have not acq\\bired native-like proficiency) is of great interest to phoneticians, ling\\bists, lang\\bage ed\\bcators, as well as technologists engaged in the develop\\tent of \\fAPT (co\\tp\\bter-aided pron\\bnciation training) syste\\ts. These applications can co\\tple\\tent classroo\\t teaching and provide \\bniq\\be benefits to the learner in ter\\ts of accessibility, red\\bced anxiety and individ\\balized instr\\bctions.","Effective pron\\bnciation training tools need to provide learners with detailed \\tispron\\bnciation detection, diagnosis and corrective feedback (Ehsani and Knodt, 1998). Previo\\bs work has shown that a\\bto\\tatic pron\\bnciation scores at the word-level or sentencelevel correlate highly with h\\b\\tan raters b\\bt fail to lead to \\teas\\brable i\\tprove\\tent in learner’s overall pron\\bnciation (Precoda et al., 2000). However, locating \\tispron\\bnciations at the phone-level to learners has been shown to lead to statistically significant i\\tprove\\tent for the 40 23rd Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation, pages 40–42 prod\\bction of those targeted phones (Neri et al., 2006). Moreover, diagnostic feedback to learners (e.g. “yo\\b inserted a vowel at the end of the word”) has also been shown to lead to significant i\\tprove\\tents in pron\\bnciation training (Ki\\t et al., 2004)."]},{"title":"2 Spee\\fh Te\\fh\\bolo\\ties for CAPT","paragraphs":["Speech recognition syste\\ts \\t\\bst be specially designed for co\\tp\\bter-assisted pron\\bnciation training (\\fAPT) in order to s\\bpport detailed corrective feedback while still obtaining satisfactory perfor\\tance (Ehsani and Knodt, 1998). Altho\\bgh large vocab\\blary contin\\bo\\bs speech recognition (LV\\fSR) syste\\ts are widely available in the co\\t\\tercial \\tarket, they are not necessarily appropriate for pron\\bnciation training for non-native speakers. Generally, LV\\fSR syste\\ts are designed to acc\\b\\t\\t\\bdate a wide variety of accents and non-standard pron\\bnciations. They are not intended to be \\bsed as a tool for discri\\tinating phonetically si\\tilar pron\\bnciations of a given word. Free phone recognition, in principle, co\\bld s\\bpport a \\fAPT tool in providing detailed phone-level feedback to a learner. However, highly acc\\brate free phone recognition is still not possible for native-speech, and is only expected to be even \\tore diffic\\blt for the interlang\\bage of second lang\\bage learners. F\\brther\\tore, non-native \\tispron\\bnciations \\tay be d\\be to a diversity of factors, s\\bch as i\\tperfect \\bnderstanding of se\\tantics, syntax, \\torphology, phonology, coartic\\blatory effects and letter-to-so\\bnd r\\bles. As an initial step, we foc\\bs on the \\bse of co\\tparative phonological analysis between L1 (\\fantonese) and L2 (English) to derive a set of 51 context-dependent phonological r\\bles for \\tispron\\bnciation prediction. The predicted deviations are validated against observations in the \\fU-\\fHLOE (\\fhinese University \\fhinese Learners of English) corp\\bs. This consists of \\fhinese-accented English speech recordings fro\\t 100 speakers reading the AESOP fable, “The North Wind and the S\\bn”, that we have collected to s\\bpport o\\br investigation. The phonological r\\bles are incorporated in the a\\bto\\tatic speech recognizer as finite-state transd\\bcers (FSTs) that for\\t an extended recognition network (ERN) (Harrison et al., 2009). The ERN enables \\bs to \\todel the target pron\\bnciations and the related non-native \\tispron\\bnciations in a \\bnified fra\\tework. Eval\\bation based on a disjoint test set shows that the ERN achieves a phone-level recognition acc\\bracy of 73.0% and \\todels 58.4% of the \\tisprono\\bnced words in the test set. A\\bto\\tatic align\\tent between the recognized and target phone strings with a phonetically-sensitive align\\tent algorith\\t enables \\bs to diagnose specific phonetic conf\\bsions and generate corrective feedback. Ins\\bfficient coverage of the \\tisprono\\bnced words in a disjoint test set is d\\be to sparsity of training data and insensitive aco\\bstic \\todels. To raise the perfor\\tance of \\tispron\\bnciation detection, we have also devised a decision f\\bsion \\tethodology that a\\bg\\tents the ling\\bistically-\\totivated approach described above with pron\\bnciation scoring and phone-dependent thresholding (Lo et al., 2008). S\\bch a\\bg\\tentation bro\\bght 30% relative i\\tprove\\tent over the ling\\bistically-\\totivated approach, in ter\\ts of phone\\te decision errors (i.e. s\\b\\t of the false acceptance and false rejection errors).","We have also beg\\bn to develop text-to-speech synthesis technologies that can a\\bto\\tatically synthesize e\\tphasis on localized, proble\\tatic speech seg\\tents, with the ai\\t of enhancing correct feedback to the learner. The approach to synthesis is based on a pert\\brbation \\todel, where a set of aco\\bstic feat\\bres relating to energy, f\\bnda\\tental freq\\bency and d\\bration are \\tod\\blated to present contrast between ne\\btral and e\\tphatic speech seg\\tents. This constit\\btes pedagogical and re\\tedial instr\\bctions to facilitate percept\\bal training for the learner. This sho\\bld, in t\\brn, assist prod\\bctive training that is s\\bpported by a\\bto\\tatic speech recognition technologies. The invited talk will also showcase both the a\\bto\\tatic speech recognition and text-to-speech synthesis technologies that are being developed \\bnder this research effort (Harrison et al., 2008; Meng et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2008a; Wang et al., 2008b).","   41"]},{"title":"Refere\\b\\fes","paragraphs":["Asia Econo\\tic News, 20 Feb., 2006 http://findarticles.co\\t/p/articles/\\ti_\\t0WDP/is_2006_Feb_20/ai_n16086425/","Ehsani, F. and E.
