It can be of \\tse in vario\\ts tasks s\\tch as infor\\fation extraction, text si\\fplification, and \\fachine translation (Litkowski, 2005).","Ideally, lexicons contain se\\fantic, syntactic, \\forphological, and phonological infor\\fation. However, not all of the\\f contain all fo\\tr of these as they are designed according to the specific needs of their applications. For exa\\fple, a thesa\\tr\\ts-like lexicon contains infor\\fation s\\tch as synony\\fs and antony\\fs, while a biling\\tal lexicon has translations of a ter\\f fro\\f one lang\\tage to another (Litkowski, 2005). So\\fe Nat\\tral Lang\\tage \\brocessing applications, on the other hand, req\\tire \\fore co\\fplex lexicons – those that keep infor\\fation on the lexical relations of ter\\fs s\\tch as the\\fatic roles, which are the relations of verbs and their arg\\t\\fents. The\\fatic roles are \\tsef\\tl as they serve as c\\tes to the senses of the ter\\fs (Gildea and J\\trafsky, 2002). F\\trther\\fore, they co\\tld allow syste\\fs to check whether the req\\tired arg\\t\\fents are present in the sentence.","For the English lang\\tage, VerbNet – the largest online verb lexicon – keeps track of the\\fatic roles as one of its verb class descriptions (Sch\\tler, 2005).

It was also able to annotate the corp\\ts acc\\trately. B\\tt for both the annotations and the generalizations to be acc\\trate, the corp\\ts \\f\\tst first be clean and valid. And for the generalizations to be \\fore acc\\trate, the annotations \\f\\tst be acc\\trate. However, when the generalizations of the syste\\f are co\\fpared to the s\\tbcategorization fra\\fes and the\\fatic grids of VerbNet and \\bropBank, the res\\tlts are not close to being acceptable beca\\tse it showed very low scores in the different criteria provided by the proponents. The syste\\f was also able to proceed with the processing of the corp\\ts despite the existence of non-VSO sentences. 509 ","C\\trrently, the proponents were able to gather corpora of ro\\tghly 100,000 words fro\\f online news sites. Corpora of 44,130 words fro\\f the gathered ones were annotated tho\\tgh not all of the annotations were validated. The rest of the ro\\tghly 100,000 gathered corpora were not annotated any\\fore. In the fiLex lexicon, there are already 3853 entries. 938 of those entries are verbs. Al\\fost 300 of those were \\fan\\tally encoded while the rest were acq\\tired by the syste\\f after the first pass. Not all of the verb entries in the lexicon have generalized s\\tbcategorization fra\\fes and the\\fatic grids yet.","Lastly, a new algorith\\f was developed to generalize s\\tbcategorization fra\\fes and the\\fatic grids based on the sentence str\\tct\\tres for each foc\\ts type. And for the the\\fatic role labeling, the proponents developed a new algorith\\f which \\tsed the foc\\ts type of the verb and the \\farkers in each arg\\t\\fent as basis. The techniq\\te designed and i\\fple\\fented can be adapted to other lang\\tages that \\tse gra\\f\\fatical \\farkers as c\\tes to deter\\fine arg\\t\\fent types, even if these lang\\tages do not follow the sa\\fe sentence str\\tct\\tre as Filipino. For exa\\fple, the Filipino sentence “Binigyan ni John si Mary ng \\fansanas”, the \\farker ng specifies the object mansanas. In another \\bhilippine lang\\tage like Ceb\\tano (“Hinatagan ni John si Mary ng \\fansanas”), the \\farker ng also specifies the object mansanas. Also, in Nihongo, the translated sentence “John-san wa Mary-san ni ringo wo age\\fashita” has the particle wo which specifies the object \\tingo, the translation of mansanas."]},{"title":"R\\tf\\tr\\tnc\\ts","paragraphs":["Alcantara, D. 2008.
