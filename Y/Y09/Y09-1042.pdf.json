This paper offers a new analysis of the raising to object construction in Japanese. This has been extensively discussed following Kuno (1976) for the case where the matrix predicate is an epistemic verb. Under CCG analysis an o-marked phrase is a surface-compositional object rather than a raised argument. This new approach correctly predicts the thetic and categorical judgments of epistemic verb constructions, which have hitherto only been accounted for by the studies which emphasize only the syntactic aspects of the construction.

[embedded ti . . . ] . . . ] The term “raising” has its origin in the transformational analysis of such constructions in which the subject of the lower clause is “raised” to become the object of the matrix verb.","English has many examples of RTO verbs (consider, believe, think, etc.), which can be classified together as “epistemic verbs” (verbs of thinking, feeling, perceiving, etc.) in semantic terms. The RTO epistemic verbs take three kinds of complement clause, a fully-fledged clause as in (2a), an infinitive clause as in (2b), and a small clause as in (2c) below:","(2) a. I considered [ (that) she was intelligent.]","b. I considered [ her to be intelligent.]","c. I considered [ her intelligent.] Although her in (2b) and (2c) is understood semantically to be the subject of to be intelligent referring to the equivalence of propositional contents against (2a), they are both syntactic objects of consider. In this analysis, the argument her is “raised” from its initial position as the subject of the embedded clause to its final position as the main clause object as illustrated in (1).","There has been much debate about the derivation of RTO constructions such as that of (2b). In English, Postal (1974), Lasnik and Saito (1991), and others argue that (2b) involves the RTO movement illustrated in (1). Chomsky, on the other hand, argues that the derivation is either by the Exceptional Case-marking (ECM) process under S-deletion (Chomsky, 1981) or by IPcomplementation (Chomsky, 1986). However, his motivation for not accepting the RTO analyses is mainly theoretical. ⋆","We are indebted to the anonymous PACLIC reviewers and to Kiyota Hashimoto, Takeo Kurafuji, and Robert Logie","for their invaluable comments on the earlier version of this paper.

Watasi-wa I-TOP kanozyo-ga she-NOM kasiko-i intelligent-PRES to COMP minasi-ta. consider-PAST ‘I considered that she was intelligent.’","b.

(?)?Watasi-wa I-TOP kanozyo-o her-ACC kasiko-ku intelligent-INFL minasi-ta. consider-PAST ‘I considered her intelligent.’ The propositional contents of (3a), (3b), and (3c) are virtually equivalent and the differences between them lie in the case of the argument kanozyo ‘she/her’: nominative in (3a) and accusative in both (3b) and (3c). As those glosses indicate, (3) shows the same case alternation patterns that English exhibits in (2). It has been argued that (3b) is also derived by the RTO movement (Kuno (1976), Tanaka (2002), and others) or the ECM process (Kaneko (1988) and Ueda (1988)).","In this paper, we firstly examine Japanese data and their analysis for RTO leaving aside theoretical concerns about the transformation. Secondly we discuss the semantic and pragmatic properties of epistemic verb construction considering some facts which have been ignored by previous studies. Lastly, we propose an alternative analysis of the construction whose accusative object should be treated as a surface-compositional object rather than as a raised argument."]},{"title":"2 Raising to Object? in Japanese","paragraphs":["Most of the transformational approaches to Japanese epistemic verbs (minas(u) ‘consider’, omow(u) ‘think’, sinzir(u) ‘believe’, etc.) advocate the RTO analysis. For example:1","(4) a. Ken-wa Ken-TOP Mari-oi Mary-ACC","[ ti tensai genius da COP to COMP","] omot-ta. think-PAST ‘Ken thought Mary to be a genius.’","b. Ken-wa Ken-TOP [ Mari-ga Mary-NOM tensai genius da COP to COMP ] omot-ta.","think-PAST","‘Ken thought that Mary was a genius.’ (Kuno (1976): pp. 23-24, Slightly altered.) Since Kuno’s extensive discussion (Kuno, 1976) of RTO in Japanese, it has been noted that there are reasons that the accusative phrase in (4a) should not be treated on par with the embedded subject of ECM constructions in English, instead they should be treated as a matrix element leaving a “trace” in the embedded clause.2","Before proceeding, let us closely examine evidence that Japanese epistemic verbs involve syntactic raising into the matrix clause from such diagnostics as adverb placement, word order, and pronominal coreference.3 1 In the following, the sentences cited from other papers are slightly altered mainly for consistency. 2 The ECM analysis is not assumed in this paper. It also should be noted that the exact analysis Kuno proposed was “Subject Raising” in which the accusative object in (4a) is originally generated as the subject of the embedded clause as in (4b) and then “raises” into the matrix clause without “trace”. 3 Another piece of evidence that is often referred for the RTO analysis is scopal ambiguity. See (i) below:","(i) Dareka-ga Someone-NOM minna-o all-ACC mihat-tei-ta. watch-PROG-PAST","‘Someone was watching all.’ [∃ > ∀, ∀ > ∃] (Kuno (1976): p.27, Judgment is his.) On the basis of the judgment of (i) where the universal quantifier minna ‘all’ can take wider scope than the existential quantifier dareka ‘someone’ (∀ > ∃), Kuno (1976) among others claim that the following (iia) is scopally ambiguous since the accusative-marked universal quantifier minna-o patterns with a matrix object in (i), ’but (iib). 396","First, the matrix adverb orokanimo ‘stupidly’ may be placed after the accusative argument Mari-o as in (5a), but not after the nominative argument Mari-ga as in (5b) below:","(5) a. Ken-wa Ken-TOP Mari-oi Mary-ACC orokanimo stupidly","[ ti tensai genius da COP to COMP","] omot-ta. think-PAST ‘Stupidly, Ken thought Mary to be a genius.’","b. #Ken-wa Ken-TOP [ Mari-ga Mary-NOM orokanimo stupidly tensai genius da COP to COMP","] omot-ta. think-PAST","‘(lit.) Ken thought that stupidly Mary was a genius.’ (Kuno (1976): p.25, Slightly altered.) Owing to the relatively free word order in Japanese, the matrix adverb may appear in various positions as follows:","(6) a. Orokanimo Ken-wa Mary-ga/o tensai da to omot-ta. ‘Stupidly, Ken thought that Mary was a genius / Ken thought Mary to be a genius.’ b. Ken-wa orokanimo Mary-ga/o tensai da to omot-ta.","c. Ken-wa Mary-ga/o tensai da to orokanimo omot-ta. (Kuno (1976): p.25, Slightly altered.) The adverb in (5a) and (6) can modify the matrix subject in the intended reading, but this is not possible in (5b). This may be accounted for if the structures of the sentences are as shown in (5).","However, it should be noted that (5) just indicates that the subject-oriented adverb orokanimo ‘stupidly’ may be placed after an accusative argument, but not after a nominative argument.","Second, an accusative argument may be raised to the top of the matrix clause but a nominative argument may not be raised, this is shown in (7a) and (7b), respectively.","(7) a. Mari-oi Mary-ACC Ken-ga Ken-NOM t ′ i [ ti tensai","genius da COP to COMP","] omot-ta. think-PAST ‘Ken thought MARY to be a genius.’","b. *Mari-gai Mary-NOM Ken-ga Ken-NOM","[ ti tensai genius da COP to COMP ] omot-ta.","think-PAST (Kuno (1976): p.26, Slightly altered.) As noted in the literature (e.g., Saito (1985)), Japanese does not allow long-distance scrambling of a subject NP, thus a nominative argument originally located in an embedded clause, as in (7b), cannot undergo scrambling. On the other hand, an accusative argument can undergo short-distance scrambling moving it from the matrix constituent position t ′ to the top of the clause if the structure of the sentence is as shown in (7a).","It should also be noted that the scramblability fact in (7a) shows that the clause’s initial accusative argument may be moved from the position t ′ at best, and does not show that it was raised from the embedded clause constituent position t to t ′ beforehand.","(ii) a. Dareka-ga Someone-NOM minna-oi all-ACC","[ ti baka fool da COP to COMP ] omot-tei-ru. think-PROG-PRES ‘Someone thinks all to be fools.’ [∃ > ∀, ∀ > ∃]","b.

However, with regard to the scope relation of the two quantifier phrases in (i) and (iib), it is unambiguous for the authors of this paper. That is, the scope of dareka-ga ‘someone’ is wider than the one of minna-o ‘all’ [∃ > ∀], as is discussed in the literature (e.g., Hoji (1985)).","Moreover, it is important to note that even if we accept Kuno’s (1976) judgment and reasoning, that cannot be a direct evidence for the accusative argument raising as well as the other evidence that we examine in the following of this section. 397 Finally, the accusative pronoun kare-o ‘him’ may not be coreferential with the matrix subject","Ken-ga, but the nominative pronoun kare-ga ‘he’ may, this is illustrated in (8a) and (8b), respec-","tively: (8) a. # (GC Kenj -ga","Ken-NOM karej -oi he-ACC","[ ti tensai genius da COP to COMP","] omot-ta. ) think-PAST ‘Kenj thought him(∗j /k) to be a genius.’","b. ?

The referentiality in (8) is expected if the structure is as shown, because the GC is different between (8a) and (8b), and the pronoun can have an antecedent only in the latter case where the antecedent Ken-ga is not local.","Note that binding fact in example (8) only shows that the accusative pronoun kare-o is also located in the GC containing its potential antecedent Ken-ga, and does not show that the pronoun is raised to such a position.","Putting all of this evidence together, most transformational approaches claim that Japanese epistemic verb construction involves the RTO movement. However, each piece of evidence that they adduce is indirect and shows that the accusative argument may undergo raising from an embedded clause. The evidence only indicates that the argument is located in the matrix clause, as examined above."]},{"title":"3 Semantic and Pragmatic Properties of Epistemic Verb Constructions","paragraphs":["Kuno (1976) argues that the “Subject Raising” rule relates the sentence as in (10a) to as in (10b): (10) a.

This legacy transformation rule was thought to change the syntactic structure of (10a) to (10b) and to preserve the meaning. The current syntactic theories and their RTO analyses no longer claim that (10a) and (10b) have the same underlying structure and the latter is derived from the former. But they still implicitly assume that the propositional meaning of these sentences is equivalent.","However, there is a subtle difference in meaning between the sentences above. In (10a), the sentence speaker emphasizes with Ken-wa, while in (10b) he takes a detached view."]},{"title":"3.1 Point of View and Speaker-centered Adverb","paragraphs":["Regarding such a semantic or pragmatic distinction above, Tomoda (1976-77) proposes that Subject Raising is not meaning-preserving in a strict sense and the rule changes the “point-of-view” relationship between pairs of sentences as (10a) and (10b). See Tomoda’s examples in (11) below: (11) a. #Ken-wa","Ken-TOP Mari-ga Mary-NOM Mari Mary de-nai is-NEG to COMP omot-tei-ru. think-PROG-PRES","b. Ken-wa Ken-TOP Mari-o Mary-ACC Mari Mary de-nai is-NEG to COMP omot-tei-ru. think-PROG-PRES","‘Ken thinks that Mary is not Mary.’ (Tomoda (1976-77): p.362, Slightly altered.) 398 Example (11a) is semantically anomalous in that Ken’s thinking is illogical. The sentence recovers its grammaticality only when Ken is known to be insane or irrational. In example (11b), on the other hand, the speaker states the situation in which Ken does not know the fact that the woman whom he believes not to be Mari is indeed Mari. This shows that (11a) represents Ken’s point of view and (11b) represents the speaker’s own point of view.","Tomoda’s another example with an epistemic verb kantigaisuru ‘mistake’ makes the same point. Consider (12) below: (12) a. #Ken-wa","Ken-TOP Mari-ga Mary-NOM Naomi Naomi da COP to COMP kantigaisi-ta. mistake-PAST","b. Ken-wa Ken-TOP Mari-o Mary-ACC Naomi Naomi da COP to COMP","kantigaisi-ta.","mistake-PAST","‘Ken made a wrong conjecture that Mary was Naomi.’","(Tomoda (1976-77): p.362, Slightly altered.)","Kantigaisuru is a verb representing the speaker’s judgment. Such verbs are incompatible with the","sentence from Ken’s point of view as in (12a), whilst being compatible with the sentence from the","speaker’s own point of view as in (12b). One of the implications of Tomoda’s analysis referring to “point of view” mentioned above is","that it provides us with yet another account of “adverb placement” discussed in Section 2. The","relevant examples are repeated in (13): (13) a. #Ken-wa","Ken-TOP [ Mari-ga Mary-NOM orokanimo stupidly tensai genius da COP to COMP","] omot-ta. think-PAST","b. Ken-wa Ken-TOP Mari-oi Mary-ACC orokanimo stupidly","[ ti tensai genius da COP to COMP","] omot-ta. think-PAST","‘Stupidly, Ken thought Mary to be a genius.’ In examples (13a) and (13b), the adverb orokanimo ‘stupidly’ may be placed after the accusative argument Mari-o, but not after the nominative Mari-ga in the intended reading. The RTO approaches argue that such a subject-oriented adverb can modify the matrix subject Ken-wa in (13b) but not in (13a) because of their structural difference.","However, in this position the adverb orokanimo is speaker-centered. Example (13b) sounds perfect because it is a description from the speaker’s point of view, and the speaker-centered adverb can easily occur in the sentence. In (13a), on the other hand, the speaker emphasizes with Ken i.e., a subject-centered interpretation where the occurrence of the adverb in this position forces speaker-centered interpretation. Thus those two interpretations conflict and this is why the sentence sounds awkward."]},{"title":"3.2 Embedded Predicates and the Judgment of Embedded Clauses","paragraphs":["Kuno (1976) observes that the embedded predicate of RTO constructions in Japanese is limited to nominal + copula form as shown in the previous examples and for adjectives below (14): (14) a. Ken-wa","Ken-TOP Mari-ga/o Mary-NOM/ACC kawai-i pretty-PRES to COMP","omot-ta.","think-PAST ‘Ken thought that Mary was pretty. / Ken thought Mary to be pretty.’","b.

Ueda (1988) argues that -i ending of adjectives in (14a) and copula, da, are not present tense markers and claims that the construction’s embedded clause is infinitival. Sakai (1996) points out that the embedded predicates are not regulated by their form and proposes the semantic constraint that the predication in complements is a characteristic or an attribute of the entity represented by a raised NP, which is originally suggested by Borkin (1984). Compare examples (15a) and (15b): 399","(15) a. Ken-wa Ken-TOP ooame-ga/*o heavy rain-NOM/ACC hut-tei-ru rain-PROG-PRES to COMP omot-ta. think-PAST ‘Ken thought that it was raining heavily.’","b.

However, not all such predicates are compatible with the construction. Compare examples (16) and (17) below:","(16) a. Watasi-wa I-TOP Sahara sabaku-ga/?(?)o the Sahara desert-NOM/ACC atu-i hot-PRES to COMP kantigaisi-ta. mistake-PAST ‘I made a wrong conjecture that the Sahara desert is hot.’","b.

On the other hand, husinsya da ‘is a suspect’ in (17) concerns the speaker’s judgment. That is, he recognizes sihuku keekan ‘the plainclothes policeman’ at first, then judges the man to be a suspect. The adverbial yoru-demo ‘even at night’ in (16b) may change the judgment of the sentence from intuitive as in (16a) to reflective as in (17), and an accusative marked argument can easily occur in the latter.4","In a series of works Kuroda (Kuroda, 1992) has defended the relevance of a distinction in “judgment forms”. The important point for our observation on examples (16) and (17) above is that there are two different types of “judgments”, the thetic and the categorical. These are reflected in the root sentence by the markers of subject, ga and wa, respectively. Consider (18) below:","(18) Neko-ga/wa cat-NOM/TOP asoko-de there-at nemut-tei-ru. sleep-PROG-PRES .","‘The/a cat is sleeping there. / The cat is sleeping there’ (Kuroda (1992): p.13, Slightly altered.) A sentence with a ga-marked subject expresses a thetic judgment, reporting perception of a situation in which the/a cat is sleeping in a certain place. It simply affirms the existence of an eventuality of a certain type and represents the recognition or rejection of material of a judgment. 4","With regard to Japanese small clauses (SCs) shown in (3c), Mihara (1998) mentions, referencing Fujita (1981), that","there is the same selectional preference of embedded predicates and its judgment as shown in (i) below:","(i) a. Boku-wa Boku-TOP tyuusya-o injection-ACC","??(itumo-yori) usual-than ita-ku painful-INFL","kanzi-ta.","feel-PAST ‘Ken felt the injection (more) painful (than usual).’ [Intuitive]","b.

There is no distinction between RTO and SC constructions from the viewpoint of a few traditional Japanese descriptive linguistics. They suggest that the epistemic verb is a three-place predicate whose arguments are experiencer, theme, and predicative complement of theme (e.g., Masuoka (1987)). However, these two constructions show their respective characters, then we will leave open the possibility of a unified account of these constructions. 400","A sentence with a wa-marked subject is, on the other hand, used to describe the same situation as a thetic judgment. As a categorical judgment, this draws attention first to the neko ‘cat’, and then says of the neko that it is sleeping there. We assume that the o-marked phrase in examples (16b) and (17) share the properties of the logical subject of a categorical judgment for embedded sentence and that o is a marker for such a subject, and discuss this point in the next section."]},{"title":"4 A Surface-Compositional Analysis of Epistemic Verb Construction","paragraphs":["Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) (Steedman, 1996; Steedman, 2000), is a grammatical theory which provides a surface-compositional interface between syntax and semantics, in the sense of Hausser (1984), such that each syntactic derivation corresponds directly to an interpretable semantic representation including long-distance dependencies that arise through control, raising, and so on.

This has been explained as the violation of Proper Binding Condition (PBC): trace must be bound, and the underlying structure is given above by the RTO analysis (e.g., Tanaka (2002)). One of Kuno’s (1976) arguments concerning the scramblability of the clause is that a controlled complement can be scrambled over the dative NP, i.e., the controller, as shown in example (27) below: (27) a. Ken-wa","Ken-TOP Marii -ni Mary-DAT","[ ei sore-o it-ACC sitekureru do ] koto-o thing-ACC","kitaisi-tei-ru.","expect-PROG-PRES","‘Ken expects Mary to do it.’ (Kuno (1976): p.33, 35, Slightly altered.)","b. Ken-wa [ ei sore-o sitekureru ] koto-o Marii -ni kitaisi-tei-ru.","The admission of scramblability shown above seems to be problematic for the surface-","compositional analysis of epistemic verb construction in Section 4 since that postulates “control”. However, the argument is not decisive. The informants polled in Hoji (1991), for example,","judged the sentences like that of example (26) as being “not so bad”, and it is also not as bad as","the case of PBC violation as in (28b):","(28) a. Ken-wa","Ken-TOP [ Mari-ga Mary-NOM Naomi-ni Naomi-DAT at-ta meet-PAST to COMP","] omot-ta. think-PAST","‘Ken thought that Mary met Naomi.’","b. * [ Mari-ga tj at-ta to ]i Naomi-nij Ken-wa ti omot-ta. The scramblability of the complement clause is (almost) grammatical in the cases where no koto, a part of complex particle representing the meaning ‘(someone)’s matter’ is not omitted as in (29a) and where the scrambled clause is a emphatic part of the sentence as in (29b): (29) a.(?)Ken-wa","Ken-TOP [ tensai genius da COP to COMP","] Mari-no koto-o Mary-of","omot-ta.","think-PAST ‘(lit.) It was a genius that Ken thought Mari was.’","b. Ken-wa [ baka Ken-TOP fool de-wa COP-TOP na-ku NEG-INFL tensai genius da COP to ] Mari(-no koto)-o COMP Mary-of","omot-ta.","think-PAST","‘(lit.) It was not a fool but a genius that Ken thought Mari was.’ (p.c. Takeo Kurafuji) The judgment of sentences in (26) and (29) shows, essentially, that the scramblability of the construction is significantly influenced by the semantics, and then we conclude that the grammaticality of (26) is affected by semantic factors rather than by syntactic factors as in (28b).","Another of Kuno’s arguments for distinguishing control with RTO comes from ‘selectional restriction’. In control cases, the matrix predicate poses some selectional restriction on the dative controller, this is not the case with RTO constructions. Consider examples (30) and (31a): (30) *Ken-wa","Ken-TOP sono it hon-ni book-DAT yoku well ureru sell koto-o thing-ACC kitaisi-tei-ru. expect-PROG-PRES ‘Ken expects the book to sell well.’","(31) a. Ken-wa","Ken-TOP sono it hon-(??no koto)-o book-(of)-ACC tumaranai uninteresting to COMP","omot-tei-ru.","think-PROG-PRES","‘Ken thinks of the book to be uninteresting.’ (Kuno (1976): p.34, Slightly altered.)","b.(?)*Ken-wa tumaranai to sono hon-(no koto)-o omot-tei-ru.","It is important to note the contrast between (29) and (31b).6","Kuno argue that no-koto is optionally","added to the human object of RTO. However the contrast of the scramblability indicates that these","constructions are different and thus we propose that the sentence with the human object could be","a different construction, i.e., an epistemic verb construction whose underlying structure is control. 6 We are indebted to Takeo Kurafuji (personal communication) for calling this contrast to our attention. 403"]},{"title":"6 Concluding Remarks","paragraphs":["In this paper, we have argued that the so-called raising to object (RTO) construction in Japanese can be accounted for by assuming that the o-marked NP of the construction is a surface-compositional object as in English, which controls the semantic argument of complement clause. We have also proposed two types of epistemic verb construction (EVC) with human or non-human objects which account for the scramblability of the construction. We conclude that Japanese RTO/EVC is further affected by pragmatic factors with no obvious parallel in the English RTO construction."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Borkin, A. 1984.
