This paper proposes elaboration of the Generative Lexicon (GL) in Pustejovsky (1995) and the Extended Generative Lexicon theory (Lenci et al., 2000). My proposal is based on the Japanese genitive postposition no1",". The Japanese NP1-no NP2 “NP1-GEN NP2” construction expresses a wider range of relations between two entities than the English possessive NP1’s NP2, such that neither selective binding (Pustejovsky, 1995) nor type-shifting based on qualia roles in NP2 (Vikner and Jensen, 2002) captures the necessary relations— time, location, manner, and others of temporary nature. The disambiguation of possessive relations requires that lexical entries be augmented by incorporating a Referential Module comprising subcategories such as LOCATION, TIME, and MANNER.

CONSTITUTIVE quale represents part-whole relation, FORMAL role indicates shape, ontological category, and so forth, TELIC role represents purpose and AGENTIVE role expresses origin.","Pustejovsky (1995) further suggests selective binding when computing the meaning of the noun phrases modified by non-intersective adjectives. For example, fast in a fast typist does not denote a typist who is also generally fast apart from typing, but specifically a typist who is fast at typing. In other words, fast does not modify the typist himself, but it does modify the way that the typist types, i.e., fast modifies the event argument of the TELIC (purpose) quale of the noun typist—to type.

If the following noun is a non-relational common noun (CN) such as car, John’s composes with car which is a regular (e, t) type predicate, namely, a function from individuals to truth-values (Montague, 1973), and the relation between John and car is contextually supplied (16a). On the contrary, when John is followed by inherently relational nouns such as brother, employee and enemy, which are (e, (e, t)) type with an extra argument slot (a function from individuals to another function from individuals to truth-values), the relation between John and his brother in John’s brother inherits kinship from the two-place predicate brother. 3","BCCWJ (2008) 388","(16) a.

The meaning shifting operator QA raises a one-place holder poem into a two-place holder. The type-shifted NP2 can now combine with the possessive NP, which has a uniform type ((e, (e, t)), ((e, t), t))—a function from a two-place predicate to a generalized quantifier type—so that the authorship relation is inherited from NP2 poem, and R is no longer a free variable.

We also encounter a problem with boshi-no fujin “the lady with a hat.” Since wearing a hat is not part of the qualia roles of the non-inherently relational noun fujin“lady,” even Vikner and Jensen’s system is unable to supply the binder for R."]},{"title":"3 Extended GL: Extensional Module Modificatio 3.1 A Referential Module","paragraphs":["As explained in the previous sections, non-inherent properties cannot modify any inherent qualia or extended qualia roles in NP2 so that neither selective binding nor type-shifting mechanism can apply.

If NP2 refers to an object, then its qualia structure (Pustejovsky, 1995) determines the relation between NP1 and NP2 (e.g., Naomi-no haha “Naomi’s mother,” machi-no hakai “the destruction of the city,” and Toyota-no kuruma “Toyota’s car”).","c Neither NP1 nor NP2 determines the relation. In some cases, R is contextually determined. 389","In order to accommodate noun modification by postpositional phrases that denote temporary location, time, accompaniment, and property, I propose that additional information be encoded into the lexicon, specifically, a referential module be added to GL: (18) A Referential Module: TIME = AT LOCATION = IN MANNER = WITH INSTRUMENT = WITH","In harmony with the present analysis, Enç(1987) discusses the temporal ambiguity of nouns such as president, bird and brain. For example, the president in (19) may refer to (i) the current president at time of utterance who acted foolishly when he was not president, or (ii) then president who is no more president at speech time. (19) The president was a fool.","Musan (1999) also assumes that all noun phrases have a time argument. For example, in (20) below, the person referred to as the intern could have been a hard-working intern in the past or at present—the present intern who was a hard-working person when he was not an intern yet. In other words, the time argument of the intern can refer to the past time or the utterance time. (20) The intern worked hard. Moreover, according to Sowa (1999), all physical objects usually occupy some space and time. Therefore, we incorporate location and time as subcategories of the referential module.

Tables 1 and 2 demonstrate that -no is also translated into other prepositions, such as in, at, for, from, about, with, and also into noun compounds. They demonstrate that the Japanese genitive marker not only expresses possession as in Naomi’s bag and inalienable relations as in Naomi’s face but also aspects such as location, accompaniment, property, and quantity. There is even the reversal of the possessor argument between (I) and (V–VI). The possessor argument is NP1 in (I), as in English Naomi’s bag whose possessor argument is Naomi. On the contrary in (V), the possessor of the bag is NP2 hito “man” and there is no English equivalent big bag’s person. In (VI) Kaban-no Kochi “Bags Coach,” Coach is a store, and therefore the possessor of a bag. The controller-controllee relation is also reversed, for example, in Naomi-no kuruma “Naomi’s car” (type I), Naomi is the controller of the car, i.e., NP2 the car is at Naomi’s disposal as in English the girl’s car (Vikner and Jensen, 2002). On the contrary, in boshi-no fujin “the lady with a hat,” NP1 boshi is at the person’s disposal.
