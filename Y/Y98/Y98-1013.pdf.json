This system will provide a new foundation for the computational tagging of English texts and assist effective textual processing by the computer."]},{"title":"Introduction","paragraphs":["There has been little effort made to substantiate Halliday and Hasan's co-reference framework since their work was published 20-odd years ago, excepted for a slight modification in Martin (1992). Fligelstone (1992), Garside (1993), Garside et al. (1997) and Botley & McEnery (eds. forthcoming) have proposed an annotation scheme for tagging texts canpuationally. However, their theoretical foundation is Halliday & Hasan (1976), which is sketchy and confined to major co-reference relations. In this paper, I will examine thoroughly how English noun phrases are interpreted in discourse. I recognise two roles that a noun phrase plays in discourse. One is that of the introductory expression which may fimction as the antecedent of a co-referential / co-interpretational network. The other is that of the dependent co-referring / co-interpretational expression, which depends on the introductory expression for the interpretation of its co-referent or descriptive content. I will describe the major types of relation between two co-referring / co-interpretational expressions in a discourse in order to prepare for a comprehensive discoursal networking system of English noun phrases."]},{"title":"Textual co-interpretation / reference","paragraphs":["Linguistic interpretation involves the addressee's linguistic and encyclopaedic knowledge, his general reasoning ability, and his quest for relevance in ostensive-inferential communication.' When we come across a noun phrase in discourse, we process its linguistically encoded information in context, guided by some pragmatic principles, to recreate a mental representation of what its communicator intended.","Textual co-interpretation is a relation between two expressions in the same piece of discourse. One of the expressions is dependent and its interpretation depends on another expression, the antecedent. The dependent noun phrase may or may not co-refer with its antecedent. Both the definite determines and the third person pronouns may be used to signal a textual dependence for a correct interpretation of what is being expressed with that expression.2 [1] contains examples of dependent co-interpretational expressions:","[la]\\tTHE difficulties of being an only child are no more or less than those of any other child - they are simply different.

Similarly, in [lc], the antecedent of the underlined 'they' is the singular 'a sitting hen' and they are not co-referential.","In discourse, the entity or concept represented by an introductory expression may often be talked about again with other appropriate expressions. If the same entity is being referred to, the phenomenon is called textual co-reference. If various realisations of a concept is being talked about, the phenomenon should be termed co-interpretation. Co-reference and co-interpretation give rise to two issues, which relate to certain explicit linguistic features in noun phrases. One is the continuity in a co-referential network between co-referring expressions, indicated by the definiteness of the dependent expressions. The other is the dependence of the interpretation of a pronominal expression on its nominal antecedent. In this section both issues are discussed in relation to the two types of co-reference (interpretation). These are anaphora, relating to a foregoing expression and cataphora, relating to a following expression. Demonstrative pronominal anaphora and cataphora 4 will also be discussed.","In a co-referential network, there are both dependent co-referring expressions and their antecedents (see more in the next section); and the main task of textual reference assignment is to make connections among co-referring expressions, especially with the introductory expression. A dependent co-referring expression may be either a definite common noun phrase or a pronoun, as shown in [2]:","[2]\\tA van driver from Hendon emerged as the most envied white knight in Britain today after he tenaciously took on a gang of teenage girls who robbed actress Elizabeth Hurley at knifepoint.","The 32-year-old man, who lives in Aerodrome Road, gave chase when he saw the glamorous girlfriend of actor Hugb. Grant being mugged in a street near her Earls Court home last night - even though he did not recognise the actress at the time. (opening of a news bulletin in Evening Standard, 24/11/94) In [2], the underlined definite common noun phrases are used as a continuity device referring to the same representational referent of their antecedent, the italicised noun phrase. Meanwhile, the conceptual content they carry with them contributes to our overall interpretation of the message. On the other hand, if the dependent co-referring expression is pronominal, then its interpretation depends on its antecedent and they carry with them very little conceptual content, as is the case with the underlined pronoun 'he in [2]."]},{"title":"Anaphora and cataphora","paragraphs":["In textual co-reference, the antecedent may occur either before or after its dependent co-referring expression, i.e. being either anaphoric, as in [la] and [1b], or cataphoric, as in [lc] and [1d].

(Word Meaning by Richard Hudson, London: Routledge 1995, p. viii) Each of the pronominal expressions in [1] depends on its antecedent for its interpretation. At the same time, as a co-referring expression in a co-referential network, each dependant is also used to refer to the shared representational referent, contributing to the network with information attached to it. For example, in [la] the representational referent of both 'Tom' . and 'he' is the fictional character TOM in the novel while the textual antecedent of 'he' and h̀is' is the expression 'Tom' in the text. Again, the representational referent of the co-referential network in [lc] is t̀he particular brother of a particular friend of the writer's whom she's talking about'. 6 The pronoun 'he' in [1c] not only stands for its italicised antecedent 'a ... brother', but is also used to refer to the shared representational referent of the co-referential network in which it occurs. In the same way, the textual antecedent of the underlined pronouns in 141 Language, Information and Computation (PACLIC12), 18-20 Feb, 1998, 139451 [lb] is the expression 'the people of Maili Sai' and their shared representational referent is, first of all, the construction of a mental representation of what the noun phrase is used to refer to. [1d] is an even more interesting case: though the antecedent of the pronoun 'it' in [id] is a negative one, 'no concept or term', the pronoun is still used to co-refer with it to potential members of the class denoted by the head of the antecedent.","The examples in [2] are cataphoric. While [2a] has co-reference within one orthographic sentence, [2b] and [2c] contain co-reference crossing sentence boundaries.","[2a] - Ten weeks before he died, Mr Mohun Biswas, a journalist of Sikkim Street, St James, Port of Spain, was sacked.

Yet no great Victorian building in the capital has suffered such adversity as the Midland Grand Hotel at St Pancras. (the opening of a feature in The Times, Dec. 10, 94) When the reader of [2a] reaches the pronominal expression 'he' - because it is the first mention of the newly-introduced entity - he has to depend on the succeeding part of the text, where its antecedent is, for its interpretation. By the end of the first sentence, the reader may have established a mental representation of the shared fictional referent with 'Mr Mohun Biswas' as its address: 'a journalist of Sikkim Street, St James, Port of Spain, who was sacked two weeks before his death'. In both [2b] and [2c] the writers deliberately delayed supplying the reader with the antecedent to create suspense: who does 'they' refer to? What is this 'it'? Thus, the reader's curiosity is aroused.","When looking for the textual antecedent of a pronominal noun phrase, we generally make use of the principle of proximity and try to match the gender, number, and person, of the pronoun to those of its nominal antecedent. However, ambiguities do arise. For instance, the noun phrases 'shops' and 'supplies' in [lb] above and many plural noun phrases in [2b] are potential candidates of the antecedents of the underlined pronouns, especially from a computer's point of view. When there is such ambiguity, further inference both with our general knowledge and with what is contained in the text is needed, in order to reach the intended antecedent. For example, in [lb] above, we can conclude, based on our general knowledge and the criterion of consistency with the principle of relevance, that 'shops' and 'supplies' are not as likely as 'the people of Maili Sai' to feel 'less favoured'.","In the following example, we use deictic information, the speaker's point of view, to find the textual antecedent of the underlined pronouns: the vocative which one uses to address oneself has to be used to refer to oneself, the speaker. Therefore, J̀oe' can be regarded as the antecedent , of the first-person pronouns in [3], which is more suitable than 'I' to serve as the conceptual address for the representation of the fictional character.","[3] I came to Warley on a wet September morning with the sky the grey of Guiseley sandstone.

Though both the dependent expressions and their antecedents in [la] below are definite, they are definite for different reasons. The definiteness of dependent co-referring expressions indicates the continuity in the co-referential network whilst the definiteness of the introductory expression carries clues for the interpretation of its representational referent. When the antecedent is indefinite, as is the case in [lb] and [lc] below, there is an overt shift from an indefinite noun phrase to a definite noun phrase in the co-referential network, which signals the continuity between the two but does not affect the nature of their shared referent. It is the definite determiner in the dependent expression that indicates the existence of the antecedent and thus retains the continuity of the co-referential network. Once the addressee has decided that the expression is co-referentially used, what he then has to do is to infer its antecedent, which will be nearby in the text: a particular expression (or groups of expressions) which the communicator has used (anaphoric) or is about to use (cataphoric). The head noun of the co-referring expression can be a repetition of that of the antecedent, as shown in the examples in [1].","[la] A huge mudslide last spring nearly pushed a waste site into the nearby Maili Sai river.

Byatt, London: Vintage, pp. 20f,) 143 Language, Information and Computation (PACLIC12), 18-20 Feb, 1998, 139-151 The interpretation of a dependent expression in a co-referential (or co-interpretational) relation involves inference and, if the head noun in the co-referring expressions is a repetition of that in the antecedent, then less inference is needed. In [lb], the expression 'the building' not only is related to its textual antecedent 'a low building a few streets away' but is also used to refer to the shared representational referent of the co-referential network in which it occurs. In other words, textually, its referent is 'the building which the author has been talking about' and, representationally, it is 'the particular building that lay a few streets away from the Astrodome and existed in August 1992 in Houston, USA'.","If there is not a head noun repetition between the antecedent and its dependent co-referring expression (even repetition is not necessarily sufficient to establish such a relation), then we have to rely more on inference with our general knowledge, contextual information and the criterion of consistency with the principle of relevance.","The example in [la] above is counted as anaphoric because there is no reason to call the later-appearing co-referring expression the antecedent when the co-referring expressions are both definite and have the same head noun. On the other hand, if we believe that a proper name given to an entity is intuitively more legitimate as the antecedent than a description of the entity, then in the textual relations between two noun phrases such as 'John Major . . . the Prime Minister . . .' or 'The Prime Minister . . . John Major . . we can always call the proper name the antecedent and the description of the entity which has that name its co-referring expression. Given all this, we can find cataphoric examples for this category, as in [2]:","[2a] Here was this fat man up on a piano, dancing in a way that suggests that, during rehearsals, he had miscalculated a pervy groin grind and ended up on the floor, screaming for his manager to put a detachable, rubber, non-slip surface on the old Joanna ...","Àye, aye,' my dad said, looking up from the 1400 and Under' second-hand cars' section of the local papa, ìt's old Tommy Jones.

It may be used to create suspense, or to make the delayed, more informative expression a focus of attention.' The literary effect may be achieved because the norm or default sequence is that proper names presented as homophors911° precede their co-referring definite descriptions, as shown in [3] below (F̀riedrich Nietzche' appears before the noun phrase in italics) and [2] in the section on 'Textual co-interpretation / reference' above:","[3] Rocken, Germany - The change in Friedrich Nietzche's status in Eastern Germany can be seen on the welcome sign of this tiny hamlet in the state of Saxon-Anhalt where the philosopher was born 150 years ago and lies buried.

In addition, because the italicised co-referring expression is restrictively modified, it is intensionally as well as extensionally equivalent to its antecedent'. In [7b] the taxonomic name of the class which contains lobsters and crabs is used to co-refer with them.
