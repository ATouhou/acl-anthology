MORA S IN JAPANESE Moms are traditionally considered to be abstract units, but ones that play a crucial role in Japanese phonology (Bloch 1950, Hockett 1955, and Ladefoged 1982). Japanese poetry is often cited as proof that the mora is a psychological unit. Haiku, consisting of three lines Of five, seven, and five onsetsu, is one form of Japanese poetry. Onsetsu is often translated as 'syllables' in some of the Japanese literature, but this is a mistranslation. If the syllables are all light, as in (la), the syllable count and the mora count agree as to the onsetsu. But in (1b), the onsetsu of the poetry coincides with the mora count, but not the syllable count.","(1) a.

The mora, therefore, is accepted by many Japanese scholars as psychological units in Japanese. However, it should be noted that some scholars (Beckman 1982 and Larish 1987) deny the phonetic reality of the mora in Japanese. 106 Language, Information and Computation (PACLIC12), 18-20 Feb, 1998, 106-117 1.2. SYLLABLES IN JAPANESE When western scholars first introduced the concept of the syllable, many Japanese scholars did not accept it as a phonological unit in Japanese. Currently, the vast majority of Japanese scholars accept the notion of mora as a psychological unit, but the role of syllables in Japanese is still under debate. In general, some scholars accept the syllable as a unit in standard Japanese mainly for the following reasons: if the syllable is defined as the accent-bearing unit, some cases of accent assignment for loanwords or nonsense words can be accounted for in a very general way (McCawley 1968). Generally, the accent for loanwords is assigned on the antepenultimate mora (the third mora from the end), as in (3a). For some other loanwords, the accent is assigned on the fourth mora from the end of a word, as in (3b). With the concept of the syllable, the accent-assignment rule is formulated more simply and accurately by making reference to the syllable that contains the antepenultimate mora.

THE TRADITIONAL VIEW OF SYLLABLE-INTERNAL STRUCTURE","paragraphs":["Under the traditional view of the internal structure of the syllable, this phonological constituent is composed of an onset, a nucleus, and a coda. For Hockett (1955), a nucleus is an obligatory member of the unit. The nucleus and the coda form a unit called a rhyme, as in (4). (4)\\tSyllable Structure (Hockett 1955)","syllable /\\t\\","onset rhyme / \\ nucleus coda Fromkin and Rodman's (1983) study of speech errors shows that the onset-rhyme boundary in English is a significant switching point.

At least, the onset is a single unit. In Japanese, however, Kubozono (1989) shows that neither the onset itself, nor the rhyme, plays a significant role. (6) Blend Words in Japanese (Kubozono 1989) /tomare/ + /sutoppu/ 'stop'\\t'stop' /todana/ + /hoNdana/ 'cupboard' 'bookshelf /kosihikari/ + /sasanisiki/ 'rice variety' 'rice variety' /teNsai/ + /siNdoo/ 'genius' 'God's child' /kodomo/ + /otona/ 'child'\\t'adult' [tomappti] [ton:dana] [ten:do:] [kodona] Unlike English, the words above do not have a switching point between the onset and the rhyme. As Beckman (1982) states, one might relate the evidence as above to the ability of the speakers to recognize the writing system. Katada (1990), however, provides evidence for the switching point between the onset-nucleus and the coda, based on a language game called siritori 'end taking' played by two groups of literate adults and illiterate children. In this game; the current speaker is to give a noun beginning with 'the last sound' given by the previous speaker. For instance, one says jriogo] 'apple', which ends with jgo], and the next speaker takes a turn by giving a word like [gorira] 'gorilla', which begins with [go). The game is over when a player supplies a word, which ends with the placeless moraic nasal [N], such as [kiriN] 'giraffe' or [mikaN] 'orange', because there is no word beginning with the [N] in Japanese. Katada's paper shows that while the adults' group is orthography-oriented, the children's group is sound-oriented. However, it is very clear that the onset and the nucleus are treated as a single unit and the coda is treated as an independent unit by both groups. Furthermore, the breakdown into the onset-nucleus, or the coda, in Japanese is confirmed on phonetic grounds. While the lengthening of a vowel before a voiced consonant occurs in English (Chen 1970), in Japanese a preceding segment plays a crucial role for the duration of a vowel in word-medial position in Japanese (Takeda et al. 1989). This suggests that the preceding segment must be closer to the nucleus than the coda in Japanese. Thus, past studies such as Kubozono (1989), Katada (1990), and Ito et al. (1992) treat moras as subconstituents of syllables in Japanese, as in (7b), as opposed to the representation in (7a), which is often considered as the universal syllable structure. The lower-case 'a' is used to refer to a syllables, and the mu 'μ' to a mora. (7) a. English Syllable Structure\\tb.

THE BIMORAIC TROCHEE Han (1994) shows that moras are psychologically isochronous units, but no inference is drawn for psychological isochrony regarding the length of the syllable in Japanese. That is to say, moras play a crucial role as timing units in Japanese, but syllables do not. She states that there are many Japanese-Americans who speak perfect Japanese without the ability to read and write the language. They must have acquired regular patterns of timing by listening to the spoken language. Han questions how those illiterate speakers of Japanese could have acquired their oral language by listening and speaking if there is no phonetic correlates to the timing unit. In other words, moras are psychologically isochronous units, which must correlate patterns of timing at the surface level one way or another. If syllables do not correlate patterns of timing at the surface level, Hayes' (1995) moraic trochees in (10), which are originally proposed for stress languages, are misleading for Japanese. Syllables are neither the basic timing units nor parsable units, on which feet are built. Moras are the units of timing and directly related with feet . There is no reason for syllables to interpose between moras and feet. I propose the following bimoraic trochee for Japanese. (14) Foot Structure in Japanese (Bimoraic Trochee) Syllables are divorced from the foot and moms are direct subconstituents of the foot. Then, a question arises as: what is the role of syllables in Japanese? The answer lies in the fact that syllables are associated with the sonority scale as production units in Japanese. The divorced syllables are freed into a separate hierarchy; yet the whole prosodic make-up of Japanese includes the syllable structure. I will illustrate the whole prosodic hierarchy of Japanese in section 8. 6.2. INITIAL FOOT PARSING AND SURFACE FOOT PARSING When the strictly binary moraic feet are constructed, stray moras may occur. One important question is how and when exhaustivity should be achieved when there are stray moms. Halle and Vergnaud (1987) argue that the exhaustivity condition should be respected in foot parsing.","(15) Exhaustivity Condition (Halle and Vergnaud 1987) Rules constructing constituents apply exhaustively over the entire string. 111 Language, Information and Computation (PACLIC12), 18-20 Feb, 1998, 106-117 Exhaustivity may be satisfied by different types of operation. Kager (1993) argues that initial parsing feet and surface feet must be discussed at different levels. In other words, exhaustivity may be satisfied by parsing units into surface units and may be relaxed at the initial parsing level. Instead, the strict binarity requirement must be preserved at the initial parsing level, but the initial parsing allows stray moras. Along with these arguments, the bimoraic trochee in (14) can be defined as the initial foot as contrasted with the surface foot. While stray moras are allowed in Initial Foot Parsing (IFP), stray moras are adjoined in some way to achieve surface exhaustivity in Surface Foot Parsing (SFP). Furthermore, I include the idea that prosodic organization into a foot structure arises in the process of ongoing speech by complying with surface exhaustivity. IFP takes place right to left in Japanese and left to right in some other languages. However, based on the idea that footing occurs in ongoing speech, SFP should always take place from the beginning to the end of its domain, achieving surface exhaustivity. Levin (1988) reports that in Cahuilla foot parsing takes place from right to left after prefixation and from left to right after suffixation. If footing occurs in ongoing speech such bidirectionality is very peculiar. The distinction between IFP and SFP provides an explicit account of the bidirectionality. 6.3. SURFACE EXHAUSTIVITY Schutz (1985) provides foot structures for Fijian loanwords. He uses neither the term stray mora nor the distinction between the initial foot and surface foot, but I interpret his representations as follows. Bimoraic feet are built allowing stray moras at initial foot parsing. The output forms of initial parsing are represented in (16a-i) and (16bi). The stray mora is incorporated under the following bimoraic foot at surface foot parsing. A pair of square brackets is used to indicate a mora and a pair of parentheses to indicate a foot. The '+' in a pair of parentheses is used to refer to the head element of a foot and the '-' to the non-head element. Main accent is specified by an acute accent mark' ' ' and secondary accent by a grave accent mark ' ' (16) Initial Feet and Surface Feet in Fijian a. pirakaravu 'paragraph' (i) Initial feet\\t(ii) Surface feet","(+ -)\\t-)\\t -) (-\\t-) p[a]r[a]k[a]r[a]v[u]\\tp[a]r[a]k[a]r[a]v[u] b. talevisOni 'television' (i) Initial feet\\t(ii) Surface feet","-)\\t-)\\t(+ -) (- + -) t[a]l[e]v[i]s[o]n[i]\\tt[a]l[e]v[i]s[o]n[i] The'stray moras above are associated with the following foot in Fijian.

Inaba's (1997) phonetic experiment provides evidence for surface feet and shows that at the surface level in Japanese, the word-medial stray moras are associated with the preceding feet rather than with the following feet. Moreover, the experiment shows that the initial stray mora is extrametrical, which is indicated by '< >', as in (18b).

This strict binarity is parallel to the labels S (strong) and W (weak), which are relationally defined in major metrical theories. Another parallelism is that in both the syllable-based and the foot-based analyses, the specifier either precedes or follows the head, depending on the language.

CONCLUDING REMARKS","paragraphs":["Moras are generally believed to be abstract psychological units in Japanese. As the tempo of speech increases, however, the phonetic reality of moras becomes less obvious. The proposed prosodic hierarchy answer the question of why phonetic experiments have not successfully convinced us of the surface reality of moras at a relatively fast tempo, but have instead just provided a tendency toward mora isochrony at the surface level. That is to say, feet are bimoraic or trimoraic and thus moras themselves are no longer direct timing units at the surface level. This paper emphasizes an important consideration of the timing units larger than moras. Vance (1987) suggests that researchers must distinguish elaborate from careful pronunciations. Native speakers' intuitions apply to careful pronunciations. Elaborate pronunciations refer to overly precise pronunciations. Han had her subjects use careful pronunciations. Beckman conducted her experiment at 'a comfortable speaking rate'. It is assumed that Beckman's data were obtained at a faster tempo than Han's. Han's study is more likely to reveal native speakers' intuitions, but as the tempo of speech increases, the phonetic reality of moras becomes less obvious. The surface prosodic make-up in (24) reveals this fact.
