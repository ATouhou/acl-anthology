People usually can not be explicit about the rules of their own mothertongue of ambiguous words or phrase, whereas they can use their language appropriately in expression of their thought. Many linguists and psychologists have done numerous researches about this matter; however, it is still can not be made explicit how such knowledge of language is stored in our brain and how we use it (J.B. Gleason, 1993). Therefore, in order to find out some useful rules about languages, it is necessary to be restricted in different subdomains. The purpose of this paper is to give an applicable model in a subdomain of natural language processing (NLP) by computers.","In this paper, we are going to submit the fundamental analyses of Chinese temporal Coverbs, postpositions and Coverb-postposition pairs. Many natural language processing between European languages and English with respect to temporals have been researched and implemented. For example, Bree (1992) defined the temporal subordinate conjunctions (SC) and prepositions as temporals. The temporals of European languages such as English, Dutch and German have been studied in detail. Bree, Smit & Werkhoven (1990) have compared English and Dutch temporals. Furthermore, Bree (1992) has discussed the temporals between English, Dutch and German. The completion of examining the temporals of the European languages does not entail the understanding of temporals of all languages over the world. As the result, in order to get a clearer picture of the use of temporals across languages, studies of the Chinese temporal representation is necessary. In this paper, we will study the temporals of Chinese and find some applicable rules in translation from Chinese temporals to logic symbols.","In Chinese, a special collection of verbs called Coverb, has the same function as English prepositions. The Coverbs approach was introduced by Francis (1946) who defined the approach as below: Coverbs (CV) are transitive verbs which do not stand alone but precede and are secondary to the main verb of the sentence. Some Coverbs are sometimes used as full verbs; a few are never anything but Coverbs. All can be translated as prepositions in English.","Because we only concentrate on temporals, which mark a time clause or a time phrase, not all of Chinese Coverbs will be discussed in this paper, as will be explained in later sections. We are going to proceed in three steps in this paper. The first step is to make a description of an overview of English Temporals and in the way of English temporal logic representations. Secondly, we shall use semantic rules to represent the temporal Coverb, postposition and Coverb-postposition pair in Chinese. The semantics are categorised by means of diagrams and their usage will be illustrated by example. A table indicating Chinese temporals and English equivalents will be created in this stage. Finally, a constraint-based approach for Chinese temporals will be discussed."]},{"title":"2\\tThe English Temporal Representation","paragraphs":["We would be well advised to have a well-structured taxonomy of temporal prepositions and subordinating conjunction. These high frequency words are highly ambiguous, so it is essential to construct a good taxonomy for computerised natural language understanding or Machine Translation system. Bree (1987) described that the time of a Stevent, which means a state or an event, can be attached in two ways: by relating it to the time dimension, e.g. at 7 a.m., or by relating it to the time of another Stevent, e.g. during lunch. Also temporal prepositions can be considered as having either a durative or a non-durative use. One example of 20 Language, Information and Computation (PACLIC12), 18-20 Feb, 1998, 20-32 durative of the Stevent is something like: shave in five minutes, but, on the other hand, the non-durative of the Stevent is something like: shave at 7:00 pm or shave during breakfast. Bree et al (1993) marked the uses of duratives and non-duratives of English prepositions as: Durative: Floating use:","\\t to indicate the duration of a matrix event, Relative to ToR:","\\t to place the time of the matrix event within an interval adjoining the ToR (Time of Reference), Non-Durative:","Absolute use:\\tto place the time of the matrix event in the period specified directly by the prepositional noun phrase.","The floating use is that a temporal phrase is not fixed on a time axis and hence indicates an indefinite duration such as I run this circle in a minute. In the case of English, Bree has already sorted out the for and in in the floating duration of the matrix event. Besides that, within is also defined within the floating length of time. The relative to ToR use locates the time of reference (ToR) at one end of the duration given by the temporal duration to indicate an event that occurs either at the other side of duration (I will be back in a hour), or once within the duration (This country will be destroyed within a week), or continuously for the duration (1 will be away for three days). In the last one, the absolute use, a Stevent takes place in a definite time or event on the time axis such as in 1996, during the war.","To category the temporal use in English, we can refer to a selection tree, which is a special kind of decision tree and is useful for analysing the use of temporals (Bree, 1992). The selection tree has a root node and many leaf nodes. Each branch of the tree has a particular meaning. First, we begin to take both the main clause and the subordinate phrase of a temporal sentence, and sort out the relationship between them to see which main category of relation the temporal phrase belongs to. For example, in the durative cases, three different meanings are considered. One of them is that the duration of the matrix Stevent is equal to the time of the subordinate temporal phrase. The second of the main categories is that the sub Stevent represents a time cycle, for example every in English, of the main Stevent. The last main category is that the time of sub Stevent introduces a point on the time axis anchoring when the main Stevent occurs. Once the category of the temporal sentence is decided, further distinctions could be made among the sub-categories under the selected main category.","In the case of non-durative use of temporals, however, the sub-phrase specifies either a time point or period on the time axis. The major distinction in the non-durative use is between the sub-Stevent being used to indicate the time of the matrix Stevent versus indicating one (or more) end(s) of a time period in which the matrix Stevent falls. This corresponds to the distinction in the durative use between indicating the time of the matrix Stevent in relation to a time point some distance from the ToR (Time of Reference) versus the duration of the matrix Stevent itself. Moreover, there is no equivalent in the non-durative use of temporals that corresponds with the use to indicate . the cycle time of the matrix Stevent. Figure-1 and Figure-2 show the selection trees for English durative use of temporals and the non-durative (absolute) use of temporals respectively."]},{"title":"activity/state\\t","paragraphs":["for"]},{"title":"is duration M is an of M accomplishment is cycle time of M S\\t<ToR+S relates \\t= ToR + S ToR to M M\\t>ToR+S = ToR - ToR I\\t= now","paragraphs":["Legend:\\tM\\tTime of Matrix / Stevent\\tS\\t Duration of Sub Stevent","Source: Bree, 1992\\tToR\\tTime of Reference\\tDefault Figure-1 Selection Tree for English Durative use of Temporals"]},{"title":"21","paragraphs":["in every within in after ...before ... ago"]},{"title":"a (qualified part of a) day; an indefinite moment on an ongoing activity as a point event: a period Sub includes temp.term ? while during in for between... and + form... to + until by before","paragraphs":["• Language, Information and Computation (PACLIC12), 18-20 Feb, 1998, 20-32"]},{"title":"when at","paragraphs":["Legend: M, S","\\t Time of Matrix/Sub Stevent","S Duration of Matrix/Sub Stevent","Source: Bree, 1992 ToR:\\tTime of Reference","Figure-2 Selection Tree for English","condition fulfilled","• condition not fulfilled","Default","Non-Durative use of Temporals"]},{"title":"3\\tLogic Representation in English Temporals","paragraphs":["In this section, we are going . to introduce a methodology of translation from temporal English to a temporal logic (TL). Logic was developed as a formal notation to capture the essential properties of natural language and reasoning. As a consequence, many of the structural properties have a parallel in natural language. For instance, an important distinction that can be made is between expressions that identify objects and expressions that assert properties of objects and identify relationships between objects. In particular many of the notations used in AI can be shown to be notational variants, or subsets, of the first-order predicate calculus (FOPC). The temporal properties, however, of the sentences implies by the use of this tense usually have, in fact, been completely absent from the interpretation. This means that really the model theory treats all formulas as universal truths or universal falsehoods, as if they were all of the same sort as sentence like All human are mortal, No bachelors are unmarried, Nobody likes taxes, and so on. The proposition expressed by such sentences have the same truth value at all times and so may be thought of as timeless. It is therefore necessary to construct a temporal logic system to present real living sentences.","We concern with the definitions of a theory, which enables the difference between timeless and temporally bound sentence to be captured. The approach for temporal logic representation has taken up by Pratt & Br& (1994, 1995, 1996, 1997) in terms of English prepositions. Before we discuss the Chinese temporals and their logic representations, the English part of logic form in temporals will be introduced as following first. There are two English sentences: (ex. 1)\\tYork ate his sandwich between 7 o'clock and 8 o'clock. (ex. 2)\\tYork ate his sandwich from 7 o'clock to 8 o'clock. Sentence (ex.1) means that York has done an action eating his sandwich in a time point which locates within the interval [7:00, 8:00]. On the other hand, sentence (ex.2) obviously indicates the action continuously happening for whole the interval [7:00, 8:00]. We can define the truth condition of (ex.1) and (ex.2) as, respectively: (def. 1)\\tThere exists an interval J wholly contained within the interval [7:00, 8:00],","such that York eat his sandwich is true cover J. (def. 2)\\tFor all interval J wholly contained within the interval [7:00, 8:00],","such that York eat his sandwich is true cover J. Thus we can present their logic symbols as (TL.1) and (TL 2): (TL. 1)\\t31(J c [7:00, 8:00] & (York_eat_his_sandwich) (J)) (TL. 2)\\tVJ(J c [7:00, 8:00] -4 (York_eathis_sandwich) (J)) If we indicate the tenseless sentence to be the symbol and the two point of time of subStevent to be s 1 and s2, we can have"]},{"title":"22","paragraphs":["Language, Information and Computation (PACLIC12), 18-20 Feb, 1998, 20-32 (TL. 3)\\t3J(J c [s 1, s2] & (J)) (TL. 4)\\tVJ(J c [s 1, s2] -4 (J)) Now the temporal logic of (TL. 3) and (TL. 4) represent the restricted existential and universal quantification over intervals. These two temporal logic can be generalised to: (TL. 5)\\t3J(J c I & 0(J)) (TL. 6)\\tVJ(J c I -4 cA (J)) where J is an interval of time when an event occurs, I is a reference interval which is determined by duration or a time given in a sentence, and cA is an event (tenseless sentence) in the matrix. We propose if a temporal makes the predicate of sentence (TL. 5) true then we say that it has an existential meaning. Similarly, if a temporal makes sentence (TL. 6) true then it indicates a universal occurrence of the matrix Stevent. Sometimes a temporal can make both propositions true in this case we accept it captures both existential and universal meanings. Continuously, consider the following two sentences: (ex. 3)\\tYork will eat his sandwich within twenty minutes. (ex. 4)\\tYork has eaten his sandwich for twenty minutes. As we discussed in last section, for indicates a universal floating use whereas within and in indicate existential floating use. Floating use is a duration of matrix Stevent such as twenty minutes, five days, one month and so on. Thus we now define the truth condition of (ex. 3) and (ex. 4) as, respectively: (def. 3)\\tThere exists an interval J wholly contained within the duration K and","K=20_minutes, such that (York eat his sandwich) is true cover K. (def. 4)\\tFor all interval J wholly contained within the duration K and K= 20_minutes,","such that (York be eating his sandwich) is true cover J. As the result, we can explicate their logic symbols as (TL. 7) and (TL. 8): (TL. 7)\\t3K(K c [ToR, END] dur(K)=20_minutes","& 3J(J c K & (York_eat_his_sandwich) (J)))"]},{"title":"(m.","paragraphs":["8)\\t3K(K c [START, ToR] & dur(K)=20minutes","& VJ(J c K (York_be_eating_his_sandwich) (.1))) In these two functions,"]},{"title":"(Tl.","paragraphs":["7) indicates a static event:York eat his sandwich but"]},{"title":"(a.","paragraphs":["8) marks a dynamic event:York be eating his sandwich.

Similarly, Chinese temporal systems also can be presented using these logic forms which will be explicated in the later section."]},{"title":"4\\tThe Chinese Temporal Representation","paragraphs":["Almost all the English temporals are prepositions, but the Chinese temporals can be consisted by Coverbs, postpositions, and Coverb-postposition pairs. The features of Chinese Coverb enable us to select a set of Chinese verbs and classify them as prepositions of Chinese. In this paper, we are going to concentrate on a subset of Chinese temporal Coverbs, postpositions and Coverb-postposition pairs.","In . Chinese we use the Coverb E.:zai to specify a definite point of time, for example, -5.5M (at 5 o'clock), (in the morning) and -MAME. (on Friday). However, in English, three prepositions in, at and on are used to do this, for instance, at 6:00 am, in the morning, and Friday. On the other hand, Chinese postpositions, in grammatical uses, are more flexible than Chinese Coverbs. A same sense of postposition can be stated by one Chinese character, two Chinese characters and even three. For instance, the postposition phrase git El*It:deshiho can be interpreted as while, as and when. This Chinese phrase t=3 94. 1*.:deshiho can also be represented by only one character Et*:shi. That is, the word B:* :shi is the short form for the phrase ate:* 131:deshiho. Moreover, many of the Chinese postpositions the first syllable is optional, such as .Z.:zhi and gt:yi. For example, in Chinese ZEt*:zhishi and at WIR:deshiho and 84:shi express a same temporal concept, while (or when, as). We construct the Chinese temporals with their corresponding meaning in English in the Table-1 as below. 'ost s o PostPosition / English!

Floating Use:","We now concentrate on the Chinese floating temporal phrases which no particular interval is indicated. In the floating use, for instance, we use the Chinese words -a... A:zai..nei to indicate a duration of the main Stevent when it is an accomplishment. Sometimes, alternative postpositions which are optional, are found; for example, -5.. . klitt:zai..yinei or -E.. .

To demonstrate Chinese temporal logic forms we also divide Chinese temporals into durative use and non-durative use.

In this paper, we have presented an account of the semantics of Chinese sentences involving multiple temporal phrases. We have introduced a restricted temporal logic (TL) into which a wide range of such sentences can be translated, and we have outlined a translation process from Chinese into this logic. Together with specialised procedures for making inferences in this logic, this account holds out the prospect of exploiting the restricted expressiveness of temporal quantification of Chinese to design more effective natural language understanding system.","The taxonomy of Chinese temporals has been briefly defined in our work. From the temporal logic (TL) representations of Chinese, we learnt the theory of Chinese temporal system and the concept of Chinese logic 31 Language, Information and Computation (PACLIC12), 18-20 Feb, 1998, 20-32 representation forms. These forms are ready to code into a program for translation purposes. We found many interesting characteristics after we use this approach to represent Chinese temporal systems. For example, Chinese has no morphological problem because its characters can not be changed by tense, aspect, time, gender and so on. Thus in the logic representation forms, Chinese get a good property in matrix Stevent because of its non-inflection feature.","Furthermore, we argued that since a decision procedure exists for temporal logic (TL), automating the translation from temporal Chinese into Tri. gives us a system capable of determining the deductive validity of temporal arguments expressed in Chinese. Such a system has been implemented, and represents a useful development tool for our semantics, and in the purpose of preliminary beta version of multi-lingual (Chinese/English/Japanese) MT system. The ability to determine the precise ramifications of modifying and any one part of the total system, such as the syntax rules, the semantics of TL, the interpretation rules and the decision procedure for TL that is crucial for our strategy of piecemeal refinement and extension. One of the practical applications of our system is temporal deduction using Chinese input that includes the design of natural language interactive interface and the development of systems for MT.","However, in this paper, we ignored to discuss the problems of truth-conditions made by verb-aspect of Chinese, and of the delicate and somewhat irregular interactions between verb-aspect and temporals. Likewise, we have not describe how Chinese temporals interact with the determiners in their complements, or with a variety of temporally significant quantifiers, for example, in the expressions of iTc• (at most 5 days) or A In-W-4- (for another two years). We supposed that our approach proposed here, is to try to find out a suitable rule in translation for temporal sentences among different languages. In proposing ria, as a promising basis for giving the semantics of temporal expressions in Chinese, we presume that the extensions necessary to capture a much wider range of Chinese temporal expressions than considered here can be made gracefully, allowing the decision procedure to be extended in step with the expanded linguistic capabilities.","Acknowledgment","We would like to thank to Professor David S.
