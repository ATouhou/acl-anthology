INTRODUCTION","paragraphs":["This paper describes a method for analyzing embedded noun phrase structures that is derived from the Japanese double-nominal-case construction based on the valency structure used in ALT-J/E. ALT-J/E is a Japanese-to-English translation system (Ikehara et al. 87).","An embeddednoun phrase structure is the structure in which a sentence (hereafter, called the embedded sentence) modifies a noun phrase (hereafter, called the modified noun phrase). This structure is equivalent to the English structure in which a noun phrase is modified by a relative clause. Embedded noun phrase structures are frequently used in the Japanese language because an embedded sentence makes the modified noun phrase more expressive. In embedded noun phrase structures, the noun phrase modified by an embedded sentence is usually derived from a certain case of a predicate for the sentence. For this type of embedded noun phrase structure, several analysis methods have beenproposed (Tsujii 83, Yokoo & Hayashi 87). These methods analyze the modified noun phrase as the case extraposed from the embedded sentence.","In contrast, there is another type of embedded noun phrase structure in which the noun phrase modifying a certain case, especially the subjective case, of the embedded sentence is extraposed. Because, in this type, the modified noun phrase is not derived from the valency element for the Japanese verb or adjective of the embedded sentence, it is difficult to apply the analysis methods developed to handle the former type. This is the reason why an exceptional process is required to analyze the enbedded noun phrase structure in Japanese syntactic analysis. If the modified noun in the latter type can be connected to any valency element in the embedded sentence, then we can avoid processing the latter type as an exception and analyze both types uniformly. For this purpose, we regard the latter type as the structure derived from the Japanese double-nominal-case construction in which the adverbial particle \"wa\" is a proxy for the pre-nominal case-marking particle \"no\". This point of view allows us to treat the modified noun in the latter type as a virtual valency element for the embedded sentence.","In the following, chapter 2 defines terms used in this paper, and chapter 3 summarizes the Japanese sentence analysis based on the valency structure in ALT-J/E. Chapter 4 proposes processing the embedded noun phrase structure derived from Japanese double-nominal-case construction, and chapter 5 describes an evaluation that confirms the validity of the method proposed here. * Nu Information and Communication Systems Laboratories, 1-1 Hikari-no-oka, Yokosuka-shi, Kanagawa, 239 JAPAN, E-mail: oku@is1.ntt.cojp 60 Language, Information and Computation (PACLIC12), 18-20 Feb, 1998, 60-68"]},{"title":"2. DEFINITION OF KEY TERMS","paragraphs":["Key terms used in this paper are defined as follows: • case-marking particle In English, each case is marked by either its relative position in terms of the predicate or by a preposition. In contrast to this, Japanese language marks each case by a certain sort of postpositional particle located next to noun phrases such as \"ga\" or \"wo\". Such particles are called case-marking particles. • adverbial particle Adverbial particles give a case an additional function (topicalization etc.) by their attachment to the case-marking particle. Some adverbial particles such as \"wa\" or \"mo\" often stand-in for case-marking particles and give the case an additional function. • valency structure Sentence structure can be considered as a combination of a predicate and its modifiers. Such a structure is called the valency structure. The valency structure represents what surface cases the modifiers dominated by a given predicate correspond to. • valency pattern Valency patterns are structure patterns that formulate possible valency structures for predicates. A valency pattern is defined for each usage for each predicate. Figure 1 shows an example of a valency pattern for the verb \"shoukai-suru (introduce)\". For verbs and adjectives, valency patterns formulated as shown in figure 1 are cdlected beforehand in the dictionary called a valency pattern dictionary.

As shown in figure 1, valency elements are described using both the semantic restriction on the noun including the modifier and the restriction on the case-marking particles including the modifier. • semantic category A semantic category is a class for dividing nouns into concepts according to their meaning. For example, both \"men\" and \"women\" belong to the same semantic category [(human)]. Hereafter, the words surrounded by [( )] are semantic categories. • double-nominal-case construction Usually, a simple sentence has only one subjective case. However, many Japanese adjectives (and some verbs) can dominate two surface subjective cases within a simple sentence. Such sentence structure is called the doublenominal-case construction. This construction includes both the adverbial particle \"wa\" and subjective case-marking particle \"ga\". Therefore, the Japanese double-nominal-case construction is also referred to as the \"wa\"- \"ga\" construction. • embedded noun phrase structure An embedded noun phrase structure is the structure in vhich a sentence called the embedded sentence modifies a noun phrase called the modified noun phrase, such as \"kare-ga watashi-ni shoukai-shita kare-no-imouto (his sister whom he introduced to me)\". In this example, the modified noun phrase \"kare-no-imouto (his sister)\" is modified by the embedded sentence \"kare-ga watashi-ni shoukai-shita (he introduced to me)\". • analyzing embedded noun phrase structure Analyzing the embedded noun phrase structure is one process in sentence analysis and is the process that reveals the relation between the embedded sentence and the modified noun phrase. In the previous example, the embedded noun phrase structure is analyzed as that the objective case \"kare-no-imouto (his sister)\" is extraposed from the original sentence \"kare-ga watashi-ni kare-no-imouto-wo shoukai-shita (he introduced his sister to me)\". 61 sentence analysis as double-nominu case construction correct valency structure","NI (subjective case)","I/ N(present","tense)","(long)","73 (ga) modifying-N I (subjective case 2) OD (no)","Japanese input sentence: *Ut-AtRII (elephants have long trunks) dependency structure morphological analysis","and dependency analysis Japanese valency pattern for \" V N\" N1","\\t SR: [(*)] (subjective)","\\t JR: refer to valency pattern Language, Information and Computation (PACLIC12), 18-20 Feb, 1998, 60-68"]},{"title":"3.

All valency patterns for each usage with eachpredicate are prepared beforehand and held in the valency pattern dictionary. As shown in figure 1, for each predicate, both the semantic restriction (hereafter, called SR) on a head noun including its modifier and the restrictions on case-marking particles including its modifier (hereafter, called JR) are described for each valency element. When the modifier in the input sentence satisfies both restrictions for a certain valency element in the valency pattern for the predicate, the modifier is bound to that valency element. The valency structure is determined by binding all predicate modifiers to valency elements. An adverbial particle can correspond to more than one case-marking particle, for example, \"wa\" is a possible proxy for \"ga\", \"wo\", \"ni\" and so on. Therefore, sentence analysis first tries to bind modifiers that have case-marking particles, each of which unambiguously marks a case such as \"ga\" which marks subjective case, to valency elements in the valency pattern for the predicate. The analysis then tries to bind modifiers that have an adverbial particle to the unbound valency elements."]},{"title":"3.2 OUTLINE OF ANALYZING THE JAPANESE DOUBLE-NOMINAL-CASE CONSTRUCTION IN ALT-J/E","paragraphs":["The Japanese double-nominal-case construction has already been studied (Mikami 60; Kuno 73; Ishigami 77; Murata 90).

One of them is involved in the proposed method for analyzing the embedded noun phrase structure. This type is the Japanese double-nominal-case construction in which adverbial particle \"wa\" is a proxy for the pre-nominal case-marking particle \"no\". This section describes this variant of the Japanese double-nominal-case construction in detail.","Figure 2 shows the -analysis of this variant of the Japanese double-nominal-case construction.

The virtual valency element has \"wa\" as JR and has \"has-a N1\" or \"is-a N1\" relation as SR. \"zou-wa\" is bound to this virtual valency element because \"zou (elephant)\" has \"hana (nose)\" bound to N1, i.e., \"zou (elephant)\" satisfies SR, \"has-a N1\", and \"zou-wa\" satisfies JR, \"wa\". Consequently, \"zou-wa\", associated with the predicate \"nagai (long)\", is analyzed as the pre-nominal case associated with the modifier \"hana-ga\". Generally, in processing this variant, adverbial particle \"wa\" is taken as a proxy for the pre-nominal case-marking particle \"no\" and the modifier with adverbial particle \"wa\" must be analyzed as the phrase which modifies the subjective case with \"ga\".
