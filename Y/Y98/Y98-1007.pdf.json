In contrast to traditional Japanese linguistics, most generative studies of Japanese have made no such distinction but rather focused their attention on such issues as the interaction between a scope of negation and a quantifier and the behavior of negative polarity items.

The example of the latter is:","(1) Kokoni ringo wa nai here apple Nom not Here is no apple. which is the negation of:","(2) Kokoni ringo ga aru here\\tapple Nom is Here is an apple. The former is exemplified by the sentence:","(3) watashi wa\\tringo o\\ttabe-nai I\\tNom apple Obj eat not I do not eat an apple. where tabe-nai is the negation of the verb taberu (eat), and the following:","(4) Kono hon wa omoshiroku-nai this book Nom interesting not This book is not interesting. where omoshiroku-nai is the negation of the adjective omoshiroi.","While the traditional Japanese linguistics has generally treated the independent nai as an adjective, it regarded the nai which occurs after a verb as an auxiliary and the nai which occurs after an adjective as an adjective.

He called the nai after a verb fuzoku-keishiki (dependent form) while he called the one after an adjective fuzoku-go (dependent word).","In a strong contrast to traditional Japanese linguistics, almost all the studies in generative grammar have made no distinction between the nai occurring after a verb or an adjective with no independent status, and the nai having an independent status by giving a unified name NEG whose syntactic or semantic status is left unspecified. They have focused their attention on the interaction between a scope of negation and a quantifier or the issue of the behavior of negative polarity items.","In this paper we attempt to integrate all the proposals , of each position by making use of both syntactic and semantic features. Moreover, it is our main claim that the independent nai has a distinctly adjectival status in terms of a semantic structure which we propose below.","The paper consists of the following arguments. Firstly, the independent nai shows a semantic structure which is characteristic of ordinary adjectives. Secondly, it shares the same feature with the dependent nai in terms of the sensitivity to what is called negative polarity items, that is, NPI. Thus, it can be argued that the independent nai has an overlapping feature of being an adjective and at the same time of being sensitive to NPI."]},{"title":"2 Semantic Structure of Adjectives 2.1 Three Dimensions","paragraphs":["In English, as well as in Japanese, there is a group of so called \"degree adjectives\" whose interpretation is heavily dependent on linguistic or pragmatic contexts. One such contextual factor is called Thematic Dimension by Bartsch (1986/1987). In addition to this dimension it is proposed in Ikeya (1991, 1996) that it is necessary to recognize two other such dimensions, which are termed the Comparative Contrastive dimension and the Degree dimension. Only after these three vectors are specified is it possible to determine the truth condition of a sentence which contains a degree adjective.","When we say he is good, the sentence has to be specified in terms of in what respect he is good, as compared or contrasted with whom he is good and to what degree he is good. For example, in he is very good at basketball for a short Japanese all these dimensions are expressed: at basketball is what we call the THEMATIC DIMENSION (TD), for a short Japanese is the so called COMPARATIVE CONTRASTIVE DIMENSION (CD) and very is our DEGREE DIMENSION (DD).","In English TDs have the following varieties:","(5) a. John is good at tennis. b. John is fine healthwise. c. John is fine in terms of health. d. John is fine in regards to his health. e. John is excellent in English. f. John is quick with words. g. John is quick in the uptake. h. John is quick about words. i. John is quick off the mark. j. John is cautious with respect to standard theory.","As these examples show, in English TDs are expressed by such expressions as 'in terms of', 'as regards', or other prepositional phrases headed by 'of', 'at', 'about', 'off', 'in', etc. All these expressions give specification to adjectives in what respect John is good, fine or quick. It should be noticed that all . these expressions grammatically correspond to adverbials. It should also be mentioned that TD is not obligatory. In such a sentence as the business is very slow no TD is expressed.","A degree adjective like tall implicitly encodes a comparison dimension like taller than X, with X being specified either by a linguistic or non-linguistic context. Take for example, the following sentences. 70 Kare ni has the following feature structure: [ CAT I PP [ PRED. MOD:\\tkare ni (in him)","CONTENT\\tCONTEXT DI: TD","THEM REL:\\tLOC"]},{"title":"I 1","paragraphs":["Language, Information and Computation (P'ACLIC12), 18-20 Feb., 1998, 69-81","(6) a. He, is tall. b. For a Japanese, he is tall. In (6a), size \"tallness\" is always relative to some implicit measure such as the height of an average person and it is nonsense to talk about tallness except relative to such a comparison class. On the other hand, in (6b) a comparison class is explicitly encoded in the form of for a Japanese. This is the case of a linguistic specification of a comparison dimension, while (6a) is the case of contextual non-linguistic specification of a comparison dimension.","We incorporate the idea of three dimensions of adjectives, into that of HPSG as outlined in Pollard and Sag (1987, 1994) in order to explain a wider range of data. At the same time this is an attempt to expand the original architecture of the HPSG framework, where there is no mechanism to handle the three kinds of dimensions. According to an expanded version of HPSG, the adjective nai has the following feature structure. As shown below, the three dimensions are treated as predicate modifiers.

Its thematic relation denotes an abstract location. Here it would be convenient to make a distnction between a thematic role and a semantic functon when we talk about the content of predicate modifier. 2.1.1 Feature Classes of Adjectives Before we go into detail, the following features have been proven useful in making a generalization of both the independent and dependent nai in terms of the behavior of NPI. Those features are","adjective(adj.), ± composite (compo.), ± negative (neg.), ± verb (vb.). By those features the following classes • are distinguished. 71 Language, Information and Computation (PACLIC12), 18-20 Feb, 1998, 6941 a. nai (not):\\t +adj –compo +neg b. omoshiroi (interesting):\\t+adj –compo –neg c. omoshiroku-nai (not interesting) : +adj +compo +neg d. yoma-nai (not read):\\t+vb +compo +neg e. omowa-nai (not think):\\t+vb +compo +neg, +bridge f. yomu (read)\\t+vb –compo –neg","By the feature [+neg] the lexical items from (a) to (e) except (b) can be placed together into one group. The first nai can be distinguished from omoshiroku-nai, yoma -nai, omowa-nai by the absence of a feature +compo, which means that a negative element occurs after a verb adjective stem forming a composite word. Omoshiroku-nai and yoma-nai can be differentiated by the features +adj. and +vb. We will not treat the feature +bridge in this paper. In this way all the ideas contained both in the traditional and generative linguistics are incorporated into this feature system. For example, Hattori's fuzoku-keishiki (dependent form) can be represented as [+vb, +compo, +neg]. It should be noted that a feature [+neg] is a semantic head feature, which plays a crucial role in the licensing of NPI, as we will note below.","2.2 • Negative Adjective nai and an NPI Before we go into the problem of sensitivity of a Japanese NPI shika to a negative element we will state briefly how the simple sentence containing an negative nai can be described in terms of the semantic structure proposed in the foregoing section.","(8) Kare ni\\twa\\ttairyoku\\tga\\tnai ( ga kanojo niwa aru.)

The sentence (7) can be generated by the following rule. (9) [SUBCAT <>] --+ H [LEX] , C, (A)*","We have shown that the semantic structure proposed above can be incorporated into the basic framework of HPSG. It does not mean, however, that we can dispense with the semantic structure: the implicit element of the contextual dimension cannot be incorporated into the HPSG architecture. Hereafter, therefore, both the basic framework of HPSG and the semantic structure of adjectives as outlined above will be employed as a basic theoretical tool for the description of Japanese NPIs.","(10) Kare ni\\twa\\tdonyoku shika nai He\\tDat.

Before we go on to define the meaning of NPI shika let us consider a simpler plain negative sentence like (12):","(12) Kare ni wa\\tdonyoku ga\\tnai He\\tin Top. greed • Nom not In him there is no greed. Suppose that all the attributes that kare (he) has are represented by K. Then what (12) means is effectively the same as: --,(greed E K) Using a quantifier and letting a variable range over the set of (possible) attributes of a person, we can express the same condition as follows: (Vx E A)[(greed = x)\\tE K)}• This says that for all the attributes that a person may have if an attribute is shown to be greed then this attribute does not belong to (the set of attributes of) kare. This is intuitively correct and satisfactory for our present purpose. One notices in this condition that the consequent —.(x E K) is clearly to be associated with the negative nai, and since K represents all the properties possessed by kare, it is natural to associate K with kare. The rest of the condition, (Vx E A)[(greed = x)\\tx . then, is attributable to donyoku-ga. Notice that the condition (... x ...) need not be negative, since ga is not an NPI.","Now let us turn to our goal, the semantics of shika. The sentence (10) means, in a similar manner to the representation above, roughly the same as follows: (Vx E A)[(greed x)\\tE"]},{"title":"K)]","paragraphs":["This is to interpret the shika... nai sentence as saying that for all the attributes that a person may have if it is not greed then it does not belong to kare. This condition is logically equivalent, classically, to the condition that any attribute he has is identifiable as greed. We notice that the first condition is practically the same as the set-theoretical condition A— {greed}, so we can rephrase this condition to: (Vx)[x E (A — {greed})\\tE K)]. Looking at this formulation, it is not too difficult to see, just as in the case of ga above, that the meaning of shika can be seen as corresponding to the condition: (Vx)[x E (A — {greed})\\t(...x ...)]. Main part of its job is the condition (A — {greed}) which is to exclude, or select, depending on which side of the set you are on, those elements not identical to 'greed'. In other words, the meaning of shika is a sort of a selection, or exclusion, function that given an item and an appropriate domain, selects the set of elements that are not identical to, or sometimes incompatible with, the given item. Notice also that, unlike ga, shika requires the condition (... x ...) to be in negative since it is an NPI.","But how do we decide the appropriate domain? This is where the contrastive dimension (CD) comes in. CD can be seen as defining a function that given an element, associates with it its possibly relevant 'comparable elements'. More formally, let us denote by D all the possible objects of a world, including such intensional objects as concepts and properties. Then for each object in this domain, 74 Language, Information and Computation (P. ACLIC12), 18-20 Feb, 1998, 69-81 we cane think of a function that given the contextually defined contrastive dimension c, gives a set A C D of objects related, with respect to the comparability given by c, with the object in question. In other words we are thinking of a function G : D x CD —4 D such that: G(greed)(c) = A C D.","From the universal domain D the function G selects the possible items which can be compared or contrasted with the particular item x, e.g. 'greed', in question and assigns them the status of the exponents of a comparative/contrastive dimension specifying at the same time that x exists. This means that G is a selection function which picks up possible candidates of contrastive or comparative dimension and at the same time an exclusion function which excludes all the items except a particular x by assigning them the status of exponents of a comparative or contrastive dimension. For example, there is a relevant domain where 'greed' is contrasted in sentence (10): 'ambition', 'noble spirit', 'good will', 'kind heart', and so forth.","Now the meaning of the phrase donyoku shika in context c can be represented as: [donyoku shika], = Fgreed(G(greed)(c)) = Fgreed(A) = AN[(Vx)[x E (A — {greed}) --+ N(x)]] This•condition will allow a compositional interpretation of shika\\tnai construction without positing such a global operation as shika ... nai lowering.","The function. F selects from the domain one particular item, that is, 'greed' by specifying its unique existence and excludes other items in the domain in question: 'ambition', 'noble spirit', 'good will', 'kind heart' and so on. Thus it plays the role of exclusion and selection function at the same time."]},{"title":"3 Independent and Dependent nai","paragraphs":["In the,, preceding two sections we have demonstrated the basic tools with which to describe the two kinds of nai in Japanese: the independent nai and dependent nai. The former shares the characteristics of ordinary adjectives, which the latter lacks. But on the other hand, both share an interesting character of being sensitive to NPI. In order to capture this fact, we have given two kinds of nai a common semantic feature [+neg].

One is that nai in the sentences above is a case of independent nai. As an independent nai it is a one-place adjective taking a nominalized sentence [Meth wa kodomotati ni eigo o osieta koto], meaning ' the fact that Mary has taught English to children.' This is indicated by koto in Japanese. Furthermore, when nai acts as a predicate the feature [+nai ] has a scope over every internal constituent NP or PP constituent within the nominalized sentence as well as the nominalized sentence itself. This is contrastive to the case where nai is a dependent element of a verb or an adjective.

Equivalently, we can restate that a predicate have a scope over an argument and a predicate modifier in terms of a predicate-argument structure.","(3) The Scope Principle","'In the scope of is defined over a head-complement with or without an adjunct daughter or a predicate argument structure in the case of independent nai, both of which are in an equivalent relation. The scope of a head daughter consists of its complement and or adjunct(s), and possibly their internal constituent(s). 11 PP 79 Language, Information and Computation (PACLIC12), 18-20 Feb, 1998, 69-81","(4) NPI absorption","The semantic feature [-I-NPI} in a shika phrase is absorbed by [-Fneg] feature in a head daughter whenever [+NPI] is in the scope of [+neg] in the head daughter. This mechanism ensures that there must be only one shika present in the scope of a head daughter with [ -1-neg]. The first assumption implicitly states that there is a one-to-one mapping relation between a syntactic structure and a semantic counterpart, a basic claim made by traditional Montagovian frameworks. By the second and fifth principle it is easy to make a general statement why sentences with two shika's like (38) and (39) are grammatical, while the sentence (40) is judged as ungrammatical.","(38) watashi-shika anata-ni [asu-shika ame-ga hur-anai] \\t-to iwa-na katta I-only\\tyou-Dat.

The [+NPI] in the . phrase watashi shika is absorbed by the predicate iwanakatta 'said not' since it is in the scope of a negative predicate iwanakatta 'said not' in the next higher domain. In (39) the negative predicate hanasarete inai 'is spoken not' has an adjunct daughter, sono chihoo de shika, to which shika is attached. In a matrix clause a complement daughter [[sono chihoo de shika hanasarete inaalhoogen shika] the feature [+NPI] in hoogen shika is absorbed by a head daughter rikai dekinai so that the sentence as a whole is judged as grammatical. In (38)","NPI] in the phrase asu shika is absorbed by a negative particle huranai 'rain not' so that there is no counterpart by which [+ NPI] in the phrase watashi shika is absorbed. Hence ungrammaticality of (38) results.","The third principle plays a most important role in this framework in that it attempts to define the licensing condition of an NPI without having recourse to the notion of configurational definition such as a c-command relation. If we follow the configurational principle, we are going to specify all the constituents in a clause as being in a c-command domain.","(41) [John-wa] [[kare-no otooto-no hon-o]\\tyom-anaii] John-Top he-Gen brother-Gen book-Obj read-not John does not read his brother's book.","Unless there is some ad-hoc restriction, all the constituents in a clause are in the c-command domain of the negative predicate yomanai 'read not'.
