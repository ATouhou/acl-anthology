The Kana4o-Kanji conversion is perfonned by the morphological analysis an the input Kana string with no space between words. Wad- or phrase-segmentation is carried ort by the analysis to decide the substing of fir input to be converted fromKana to Kanji. Kara-Kanji mixed string, which is the ordinary form ofJapanese written text is obtained as the final result. The major issue ofthis techrology lies in raising the a:curacy ofthe segmentation and the horn:phone prooesing to select the most poperKanji among many hornopluic candidates. The conventional methodology for Foca:sing the homophare has used the function to give de first ptiotity to the wad which was used lastly or to the vvord wlich is used most frequently.

Concluding Remarks In this paper, the effectiwness ofthe large scale collocation data for the improvement ofthe conversion accuracy ofKana-to-Kanji conversion process used in Japanese word procesior was clarified, by nom' large scale experiments. The extensive collection affix collocations has been carried out manually for thzse ten years byte authors in °alert° realize not only high precision Aced processor but also more general Japanese language proces3ing in future. A lot ofresources, school textbooks newspapers, novels, journal%dictionaries, etc have been investipittcl by workers for die collection of collocations. The arndidates for the collocation. haw been judged ow after another by ten. Among collocations described in this paper, the idiomatic expressions are quite burdensome in the development afthe natural language processing since they do rot follow the principle dcompositionality ofthe meaning. Generally speaking the mcre extenive collocational data k dais with, the less the \"rule system\" of the rule based natural language processing system is burdened. Thies means that it is quite important to encidithe collocational data lather.
