INTRODUCTION","paragraphs":["The purpose of this paper is to consider assimilation of English prefix-final nasals within the framework of Optimality Theory(henceforth, OT; Prince & Smolensky 1993), especially making use of a relation of correspondence (McCarthy & Prince 1994b, 1995, Lamontagne & Rice 1995). There has been in the literature much discussion on the phenomenon (to name a few, Chomsky & Halle 1968, Kiparsky 1982, Borowsky 1986), none of which, however, provides a satisfactory account. In this paper, by employing the framework of OT, I will show that a constraint-based approach can give a better account of the phenomenon. In order to do this, following Kenstowicz(1995), I will posit a constraint of Uniform Exponence which evaluates sets of morphologically related words for segmental and prosodic similarity. In particular, I will assume that the candidates for the allomorph of a prefix are evaluated so as to minimize allomorphic difference in the realization of the morpheme itself. I will show that we can account for the phonology of the nasal-final prefixes in a unified way by appropriately ranking the constraint Uniform Exponence among the other constraints. That is, I will claim that no level ordering (cf. Kiparsky 1982) nor different underlying representations (cf. Borowsky 1986) need to be specified in the grammar, and that what is needed is a set of some ranked and violable constraints. The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 reviews earlier analyses. Section 3.1 provides a brief introduction to the principles and assumptions of OT, and section 3.2 proposes an alternative analysis of the alternations of the nasal-final prefixes, arguing for a special constraint hierarchy which produces correct outputs. Finally, section 4 summarizes the paper."]},{"title":"2. PREVIOUS ANALYSES","paragraphs":["In this section, I will review previous analyses of assimilation of nasal-final prefixes.

SPE distinguishes between the affixes with + (close juncture) boundary and the affixes with # (open juncture) boundary. These two affix classes have been variably termed level 1 and 2, class 1 and 2, and stratum 1 and 2 in the literature. Here I use the terms level 1 and 2 affixes. I also use the -̀' boundary for both kinds of affixes for convenience' sake. For the kinds of affixes, see Siegel(1974), Allen(1978), Kiparsky(1982), Halle & Mohanan(1985), Inkelas(1989) and others. 118 Language, Information and Computation (PACLIC12), 18-20 Feb, 1998, 118426 so-called Nasal Assimilation. In (1b), preceding sonorant-initial stems, no nasal appears in the prefix; the analysis of this case is usually considered to be total assimilation of the prefix nasal followed by degemination of the resulting sequence (cf.

It was also argued that degemination is a feature of level 1 phonology and not of level 2 phonology. However, a problem arises for this analysis if we consider another nasal-final prefix /en-I.

Preceding sonorants as shown in (3b), however, there is neither total assimilation nor degemination found in (lb). In this respect, it is like /un-/. Therefore, it is unclear phonologically to which level (a la Kiparsky 1982) this prefix belongs. The morphology associated doesn't throw much light either. That is, /en-/ attaches only to words but not to root, which suggests that it is a level 2 prefix like /un/. Yet it attaches inside of level 1 suffixes (e.g., 'encapsulate), suggesting that it is a level 1 prefix like /in/.4 Therefore, as Borowsky(1986) points out, the argument for level ordering as the sole explanation becomes dubious in its own right; i.e., it is not possible to account for the alternations of the prefixes in a natural way by invoking the notion 'level ordering'. Borowsky(1986) claims that the prefixes' behavior with respect to the processes mentioned above follow from their underlying representations rather than from anything about level ordering. In order to account for the 3 In fast speech, the nasal of /un-/ optionally assimilates in place of articulation to the following obstruent.

However, her analysis also has certain shortcomings. First, she has to posit three different underlying representations for one and the same phoneme /DJ, which is unconvincing. Second, according to her, the assimilation rule in (6) has the effect of inserting place features lexically, but postlexically it also applies in a feature changing fashion. It is unreasonable to assume that a rule can apply in two different ways depending upon levels. Finally, she asserts that the 'unmarked sonorant be a nasal and that the default rule in (5b) fill in the value j+nasall in (4a). However, there are some other sonorants such as /1/ and In which are not [+nasal].

AN ALTERNATIVE ANALYSIS 3.1. OPTIMALITY THEORY","paragraphs":["As noted above, in this paper, I consider the alternations of English nasal-final prefixes by employing the framework of OT, and especially I make use of an identity relation between input and output, i.e., a relation of correspondence. Therefore, before I proceed to an OT account of the facts, I will first provide a brief introduction to OT and the identity relation. OT espoused by Prince and Smolensky(1993) is a purely constraint-based approach to phonological well-formedness. OT says that there are no phonological rules but well-formedness constraints on the surface forms. In this theory, Universal Grammar provides a set of highly general well-formedness constraints. Languages differ in how they rank these often conflicting constraints in strict dominance hierarchies; the constraints are ranked on a language-particular basis. Constraints are in principle violable, but violation is minimal. OT maintains that phonological generalizations can be treated by a two-step process given in (8).","(8) a. Gen (Ink) -4 {Out' , Out2, b. Eval (Out;, 1 S i .°) -4 Outer First, the Gen operation generates all possible candidates for a given input. Then Eval determines the relative harmony of the candidates in terms of a hierarchy of constraints. An optimal output is the one that best satisfies the constraint hierarchy. Best-satisfaction of the constraint hierarchy is computed over the whole hierarchy and the whole candidate set. Turning now to the notion correspondence, it is a relation between two structures, such as base and reduplicant or input and output. McCarthy and Prince (1994b) formally define the correspondence relation as follows:","(9) Correspondence6 Given two strings S 1 and S2, related to one another as reduplicant/base, output/input, etc., correspondence is a function ffrom any subset of elements of S2 to S1 . Any element a of S 1 and any element 13 of S2 are correspondents of one another if a is the image of 13 under correspondence; that is, a = f(0)- The notion correspondence is designed to capture the identity relation between the input and the output. Each candidate comes from Gen with a correspondence relation between the elements of the output and those of the input. I refer the reader to Prince and Smolensky(1993), and McCarthy and Prince(1994b) for the comprehensive view and formalization. Given this much theoretical background, in the following section, I will provide an OT account of the phonology of English nasal-final prefixes."]},{"title":"3.2.

(15a) is excluded from consideration immediately, since non-violating candidates exist. Of the two surviving candidates, candidate (15b) passes but (15c) fails MAX-I0, and so the former emerges as optimal. Note that candidate (15b) fails Uniform Exponence-/in/ because it contains [im], and it also violates IDENT-I0(place) because the place feature of the nasal has been changed. However, candidate (14b) is selected as optimal in spite of these violations, for it satisfies the high-ranked constraints Nasal Pla\" and MAX-I0. For the cases in (11b), two more constraints come into play. These phonotactic constraints are as follows: (16) *[+nasal][+sonorant]7 (17) No-Geminate: There should be no geminate consonants in the output Constraint (16) requires that there be no sequence of nasal and sonorant in the output This constraint is ranked high, accounting for why sequences such as *[u] in (11b) are not allowed. 8 In English, in addition, consonant length is not distinctive; i.e., geminate consonants are not part of the phoneme inventory. Geminate consonants in the output are ruled out by the constraint No-Geminate. The constraints in (16) and (17) should outrank MAX-I0 and -Uniform Exponence-/in/ to produce optimal outputs in (11b). Tableau (18) exemplifies how the constraints discussed above work to produce correct outputs. (18) input: in - reverent (18a) contains a sequence of nasal and sonorant, violating high-ranked *[+nasal][+sonorantl, which is fatal. (18c) fails No-Geminate because of [rr], and it also violates Uniform Exponence-/in/ due to the realization of the prefix /in/ as [ir]. The optimal output is (18b) which satisfies both of the high-ranked constraints. Even though it violates the low-ranked constraints MAX-I0 and Uniform Exponence-%m/, these violations have no effect on the outcome. Let's tum now to the cases of the prefix /un/ in (2), some examples out of which are repeated here as (19) for convenience. It has been shown that the prefix shows no obligatory alternations parallel to those found with the prefix /in/. That is, it does not assimilate to the following nonsonorant (19a), nor does it undergo deletion when followed by sonorants (19b).","(19) a. un - bind u[n]bind\\t*u[m]bind b. un - loosenable --> u[n]loosenable \\t*u[ Jloosenable\\t","*u[l]loosenable un - natural -9 u[n]natural\\t*u[ ]natural We can account for these facts by ranking Uniform Exponence-/un/ over all the other constraints proposed above. That is, the required ranking of the constraints is as follows9: 7 Vowels are also [+sonorant]. But note that sonority is not distinctive for vowels. Thus I assume that vowels are represented with the [sonorant] feature unspecified. (cf. Archangeli 1984) 8 Nasals can be followed by sonorants morpheme-internally as in 'only', 'henry', etc. The nasal-sonorant sequences in these cases will violate *[+nasal][+sonorant]. However, these violations may be tolerated to gain success on the higher-ranked constraint Uniform Exponence(stem). (cf. McCarthy & Prince 1995, Kenstowicz 1995) 9 In (20), A >> B means that A is more highly ranked than B. 123 Language, Information and Computation (PACLIC12), 18-20 Feb, 1998, 118-126","(20) Interim Constraint Hierarchy: Uniform Exponence-/un/ >> NasPlace >> *[+nasal][+sonorant], No-Geminate >> MAX-IO >> Uniform Exponence-/in/, 1DENT-I0(place) Given the constraint hierarchy above, the phonology of the prefix Am/ can be accounted for in a natural way. The following tableaux, for example, illustrate how the correct outputs in (19) are produced. It is clear from these tableaux that Uniform Exponence-/un/ plays a decisive role in selecting the optimal outputs. This constraint is undominated, and so any violation of this constraint is fatal. In (21), to begin with, candidate (a) meets Uniform Exponence-/un/, while candidate (b) fails it due to the change of fun/ into [urn]. Hence, (a) is selected as optimal. In (22), candidates (b) and (c) violate the top-ranked constraint Uniform Exponence-/un/, which is fatal. Only candidate (a) satisfies this constraint, and so it emerges as optimal. In (23), candidate (a) satisfies Uniform Exponence-/un/. However, candidate (b) violates it, for the nasal of the prefix is unparsed. As a result, candidate (a) is the optimal output. (21) input: un - bind (22) input: un - retractable (23) input: un - natural Up to now, I have shown that the phonology of prefixes /in/ and /un/ can be accounted for in a unified way in terms of OT. Now let us consider the alternations of the prefix /en/, which was problematic under the previous analyses. As discussed above, it is_ unclear phonologically to which level this prefix belongs; hence it is not possible to account for the alternations of the prefix /en-/ in terms of level ordering. It is also unreasonable to posit different underlying representations like Borowsky(1986). In what follows, I propose an alternative analysis which capitalizes on the assumption discussed above, showing that the phonology of the prefix /en/ is directly related to the ranking of Uniform Exponence-/en/ with respect to the other constraints. First, let us consider the cases in (3a), where the nasal of the prefix /en/ assimilates in place to the following obstruents (e.g., 'en - broil' -4 e[m]broil, *e[nibroil). For the case at hand, NasPlace must dominate Uniform Exponence-/en/ and IDENT-IO(place) in order to produce correct outputs.

Now let's consider the examples in (3b), which shows that when /en/ is concatenated to sonorant-initial stems, neither assimilation nor deletion occurs (e.g., 'en - rich' --> e[n]rich *e[r]rich, *e[ ]rich).
