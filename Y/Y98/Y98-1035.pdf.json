Table 1 summarizes the types of dependency relation that could exist in word bigrams composed from nouns, verbs, and adjectives. • ActantlRel The actantl relation, denoted as ActantlRel, connects between a lexeme whose meaning is a functor (the head) and its first argument (the dependent).

This classification is derived by adopting the taxonomy of linguistic meanings proposed in the Meaning-Text approach (Polguere, to appear) and developing it further based on (Dong, 1994; 14:13M-Mra, 1993). Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 shows the details. The object name and predicate classifications are adapted from EMICS (Dong, 1994). The difference is that our classifications are not as fine-grained as EMICS. We prefer to verify the adequacy of our classification with actual applications before working on a finer classification. The quantifier and operator classifications are adapted from 1993). The most general concept of quantifier is used here. Words of measure, for example, are interpreted as quantifiers. Their first actant being a lexical meaning. It is the quantified element as well as the dominant node of the utterance meaning. The second actant is an utterance meaning containing the first actant. Figure 6 shows an example of the graphical representation of a quantifier. Operators are words having utterances as the actancts. Figure 7 shows an example."]},{"title":"3\\tWord-Class Distributions","paragraphs":["Eight articles on the theme of travelling from the Sinica Corpus V1.0 ( r c-Mr(ga, 1995) are used in the study. They comprises a total of 5882 Chinese characters. There are 46 classes in the CKIP tagset. This tagset is derived from (11:13HZIa*, 1993). In this paper, it is sufficient to simply state that tags which begin with \"N\" are noun classes; tags which begin with \"V\" are verb classes; non:predicative adjective is \"A\". Details about the CKIP tagset can be found in (E173a9Z1a*, 1995). Word bigrams with word-class equals to noun, verb, and adjective are extracted. These bigrams are manually examined. Those with either an attributive relation or coordinative relation are retained. In Chinese, the vast majority of adjectives may function as the head of a verb phrase (Li and Thompson, 1981). This type of adjectives has been classified as verbs in CKIP. Adjectives which cannot be the head of a verb phrase are called non-predicative adjective (4MMI7) in CKIP, and they are denoted by the tag \"A\". Examples are: 'big-scale', Mt 'positive', * 'newly properous', NE 'truly', AO, 'permanent', 'most properous', and _EAT 'best'. For verbs which could be used in a position that expects a nominal, they are not regarded as having two word classes: verb and noun. CKIP treats them as verbs. When they appear in a nominal position, they are tagged with an additional grammatical feature \"+nom\". For example, in the following bigrams: (1) ONI/VC+nom PEjr,/ Na (\"visit ticket\") (2) le / VC+nom\\t/Na (\"manage method\") In (1) and (2), the verbs OE 'visit' and 'manage' are used as modifiers to a noun. They are therefore tagged with an addition grammatical feature +̀nom'. Though CKIP has classified adjectives which may function as the head of a verb phrase as verbs, this class of verbs is handled differently with respect to the issue of nominalization. For example, in the following bigrams: (3) RAN / VH A±/Na (\"handicap people\")"]},{"title":"(4)a","paragraphs":["ff /VH f /Na (\"friendly country\") the verbs RN 'handicap' and"]},{"title":"Aff","paragraphs":["'friendly' are not tagged with the feature +̀nom' . These verbs would traditionally be regarded as adjectives. From the different treatment of verbs of this class (VH) from verbs in the previous class (VC) when both function as modifiers to nouns, CKIP does make an implicit distinction between them. Based on the word-class distributions of bigrams with attributive and coordinative relations, the following observations are noted. • An attributive relation or a coordinative relation could exist in a word bigram with word class equals to","V̀H VA'.","CoordReM5NH 'clever',"]},{"title":"a","paragraphs":["NA 'dedicate')\\tAttrRel(AMNA 'tour', M .A/VH 'deep into')","• It is not clear why verbs such as frff 'camp' and eg 'rest' in the following bigrams are tagged with the grammatical feature -̀i-nom' while verbs such as VT7 'tour' and my6 'sightseeing' are not, even though all of them have the same word class 'VA' and all of them appear in bigrams with an attributive relation. Similar cases are also observed for verbs in the VJ and VK class.","AttrRel(/Na 'certificate', afRvA 'tour')\\tAttrRel(gn /Na 'purchase team',\\t /VA 'sightseeing')"]},{"title":"341","paragraphs":["Language, Information and Computation (PACLIC12), 18-20 Feb, 1998, 340-347 AttrRel(*/Na 'car', Xt NA+nom 'camp')\\tAttrRel(XW/Na 'need', SANA+nom 'rest') • A difficult issue in automatic word class tagging lies in nominalization, as exemplifed in the following","examples. AttrRel(F9X/Na 'ticket',"]},{"title":"OSINA+nom","paragraphs":["'visit')","\\t Actant2Rel(f,tENA 'visit', Il1J/Nc 'musuem')","AttrRel(*a/Na 'car type',\\tNA+nom 'drive')\\tActant2Rel(M Na 'drive', ;.:M*/Na 'van') It is not clear how statistical information such as word ,cooccurrence frequency and word-class cooccurrence frequency are sufficient to decide whether nominalization exists in cases like PO s̀ightseeing' and WI'drive', since there is no inflection in Chinese. It is not clear how unmarked coordinative relation could be identified with word-class information alone. We observed that a coordinative relation could exist in a word bigram with two different subcategories of verb, such as VA VCL, VA VH, VC VA, VH VA, and VL VC. However, it is also possible for an attributive relation to exist in a bigram with two different subcategories of verb, such as VA VF, VA VB, VH VA, VH VC, VH VCL, and VH VK. A parser to identify both the attributive and coordinative relations in our list of word bigrams based on word-class information alone will have an approximate baseline recognition rate of 45.6% (41/90) and 21.2% (3/14) respectively: These figures are derived by considering only those cases without ambiguity. For example, all bigrams made up of (A Na), (A Nc) and (VH *) are attributive relations. All bigrams with its constituents having the same word-class are coordinative relations."]},{"title":"4.\\tSemantic-Class Distributions","paragraphs":["The same list of word bigrams described in Section 3 are manually tagged with semantic classes.
