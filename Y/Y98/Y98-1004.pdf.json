Also cross-linguistically, there are two devices for grammar to process the focus mark (+Focus]: the fronting of focused constituents and the insertion of a. Focus Marker such as the English 'be' before focused constituents. In this mode of formulation, a set of language-particular and structure-particular grammatical properties such as those of English interrogative/cleft sentences, and the Archaic/Modern Chinese focus constructions are decomposed, reanalysed and thus significantly simplified. 1. INTRODUCTION In the literature, \"Focus\" - related issues have been studied from different perspectives. Following Culicover and Rochemont (1983, 1990) and Horvath (1986), we in this paper assume that this essentially semantic conception of \"Focus\" can be characterized as a purely formal syntactic feature [+Focus] or [+F], which gets assigned to constituents at a certain • appropriate level of syntactic representation, participating syntactic operations under the general syntactic principles and constraints. In Section 2 we will first review some basic assumptions about the formal characterization of [+F], then moving quickly onto the question of how [+F] is reflected in the formal syntax, especially how it is marked syntactically. Section 3 is devoted to a discussion of the so-called \"Focus-Fronting\", we in particular will argue that a constituent with feature [+F] will be fronted in exactly the same fashion in English no matter whether it is a Wh-phrase or not, and the so-called \"Wh-Movement\" is in fact one type of instanciation of \"Focus-Fronting\" so that postulation of the former in the grammar is essentially redundant. In Section 4 we will demonstrate that the cluster of properties normally being associated with English \"Question-Formation\" can be decomposed and simplified. Cleft-sentences and Wh-questions in the language, as well as in many others, have more similarities than differences, and their similarities can be attributed quite naturally to the fact that they both result from the instanciating of a single syntactic rule thus well expected, and their differences can be accounted for independently in a modularized theory of grammar. Our major conclusions are summarized briefly in Section 5. 2. [+FOCTJS1 AND ITS GRAMMATICAL PROCESSING"]},{"title":"2.1. [+Focus]: Some Working Assumptions","paragraphs":["It is noted in some early generative literature that one aspect of semantic interpretation of a sentence is a division of its reading into FOCUS and PRESUPPOSITION. As a working definition, we follow Jackendoff (1972) to assume (1) below.","(1) FOCUS: The information in the sentence that is assumed by the speaker not to be shared by him and","the hearer.","PRESUPPOSITION: The information in the sentence that is assumed by the speaker to be shared by","him and the hearer. According to (1), for a normal sentence, the matter is whether the FOCUS or FOCI is reflected syntactically or not, rather than whether it has a FOCUS at all. Sentence (2) below, for example, may be analyzed as (3) in terms of FOCUS and PRESUPPOSITION, although it only has phonological but no syntactic FOCUS marking (The capitalized word represents the main stress and the highest pitch of the sentence).","(2) Mary hit JOHN. . he Xu, Department of Chinese Studies, National University of Singapore, 10 Kent Ridge Crescent, Singapore 119260.

Given the line of pursuit adopted in this study, we here would follow Culicover and Rochemont (1983, 1990) and Horvath (1986) to postulate that Focus can also be characterized as a purely formal syntactic feature [+FOCUS], which gets assigned to constituents at an appropriate level of syntactic representation. We will refer to the process of associating the feature [+FOCUS] with particular constituents as -Focus-Assignment\". We assume, leaving arguments and motivations to be offered later, that Focus-Assignment takes place at the level of D-Structure, and not until then does the issue of \"Focus\" turn into a syntactic one. If so, (6) below can be taken as the DS representation of sentence (2) above if the information about \"Focus\" is to be included.","(6) Mary hit JohnE±F) .","Although every sentence by definition has at least one focused constituent, degree of focalization (i.e., the degree of emphasis) on constituents may vary from one sentence to another. For expository convenience, we assume that there are two types of Focus which are formal-linguistically relevant: \"Strong Focus\" and \"Weak Focus\" (henceforth, \"Fs\" and -Fw\" respectively when necessary). We assume that this information is also available at D-Structure to trigger certain syntactic processes. Also, given the existence of multiple wh questions, a single sentence may have more than one constituent being assigned the feature [+FOCUS]."]},{"title":"2.2. A Device in the Grammatical Processing of [+F]: The Focus Marker in Chinese","paragraphs":["The [+F] marking, resulting from Focus-Assignment may trigger phonological or/and syntactic processing.","The phonological processing of [+F] such as primary stress and higher pitch have been well noted in the","literature (e.g., Jackendoff (1972), Culicover and Rochemont (1983) among others). As for syntactic","processing, the most conceivable one is simply to insert an overt Focus mark in the sentence whatever the","marker is in a particular language. This possibility is attested in Chinese. e.g. (7) Shi wo mingtian cheng huoche qu Guangzhou.","SHI I tomorrow ride train go Guangzhou","Ì will go to Guangzhou by train tomorrow /","It is I who will go to Guangzhou by train tomorrow.\" (8) Wo shi mingtian cheng huoche qu Guangzhou.","I SHI tomorrow ride train go Guangzhou","Ì will go to Guangzhou by train TOMORROW /","It is tomorrow when I will go to Guangzhou by train.'

(10) wo mingtian cheng huoche shi qu Guangzhou.","I tomorrow ride train SHI go Guangzhou","Ì will go to GUANGZHOU by train tomorrow /","It is to Guangzhou that I will go by train tomorrow.'","As seen in the above examples, shi (literally t̀o be') is employed to mark the focused constituents in Chinese.","Of course, this is not the only usage of shi in Chinese. Shi, just like its ,English counterpart to be, may also be a","regular copular verb as in T̀a shi yige xuesheng' ('He is a student'). We may call the shi in copular usage","C̀opular ski's and that in emphatic usage 'Emphatic shi'. In terms of parts of speech, shi is a verb in both","usages. It also should be noted that the status of the emphatic shi as a Focus Marker is controversial in the","literature. To my knowledge, it is Teng (1979) who first calls it a 'Focus Marker'. But, Huang (1989), among","others, argues that shi cannot be analyzed as a pure Focus Marker, since it exhibits a whole set of features of","regular Chinese verbs. For example, it may enter the so-called V̀-neg-V' questions as in (11) below; it can be","negated by a negative adverb such as bu 'not' as in (12). More importantly, argues Huang, the distribution of"]},{"title":"34","paragraphs":["Language,. Information and Computation (PACLIC12), 18-20 Feb, 1998, 33-47","emphatic shi is very much restricted. It can be placed only before the subject NP or somewhere between the","subject and the main verb, but never between a verb and its object as in (13) nor between a preposition and its","object as in (14).","(11) Shi bu shi ta zuotian jie-le\\tni de shu?","SHI not SHI he yesterday borrow-Asp your book","Ẁas it he who borrowed your book yesterday?'","(12) Ta bu shi guai ni.","he not Sill blame you","H̀e does not blame YOU / It is not you that he blames.'","(13) *Wo zuotian zai xuexiao pengjian-le shi ta.","I yesterday on campus meet-Asp SHI him","Ìntended: I met HIM on the campus /","It was him whom I met on the campus yesterday.'","(14)*Wo bei shi ta pian-le.","I by SHI him cheat-Asp","Ìntended: I have been cheated by HIM /","It was he who has cheated me.'","These observations are true. All they suggest to us, however, is only that shi syntactically behaves as a verb","while functioning as a Focus Marker, but don't contradict the claim that shi is a Focus Marker. The initial","purpose of inserting shi may well be just to mark the focused constituent. But after being inserted into the","sentence, shi takes up its own way of life, so exhibiting a set of properties of regular copular verbs. This is","expected. Putting it in different words, we can say that the ungrammaticality of sentences like (13) and (14)","has nothing to do with the insertion of shi as a Focus Marker. Rather, that they are ungrammatical is because","such verbs as pengjian 'meet' may only have an NP but not a VP as its complement. In short, seen from","different perspectives, shi could be different things. In terms of grammatical processing of [+F-1, shi is a Focus","Marker. In terms of parts of speech, it is simply a verb. In employing this lexical item shi as a Focus Marker,","the grammar automatically places it under the constraint of the conditions which govern verbs in general no","matter whether you like it or not.","Theoretically, every and each sentence has at least one focused constituent. Superficially, some sentences don't appear to have focused constituents. But in fact it may be the case that they don't have presuppositions. The whole sentences, at least their predicates, are focused. But we all know that not all Chinese sentences employ the Focus Marker shi to mark the constituents. Here the division between Strong and Weak Focus proposed earlier in this paper plays crucial role in determining whether a focused constituent is syntactically processed through the insertion of Focus Marker shi in Chinese. Suppose that all focused constituents are all somehow phonologically reflected in the component of PF. The formal syntax is sensitive only to the marking of [+Fs] (Strong Focus). Assuming that zai bangongshi li 'in the office' is the focused constituent in both (15) and (16) below, and that it is strong (15), but weak in (16), we can *analyze them as followings at different levels of representation.","(15) DS: Wo zuotian [zai bangongshi li] l+Fsl deng ni.","SS: Wo zuotian shi [zai bangongshi li] [+Fs} deng ni","PF: Wo zuotian SHI ZAI BANGONGSHI LI deng ni. \\t I yesterday SHI in office\\twait-for you waited for you IN THE OFFICE yesterday.' OR Ìt was in the office that I waited for you yesterday.'","(16) DS: Wo zuotian [zai bangongshi li] [+Fw] deng ni. SS: Wo zuotian [zai bangongshi li] [+Fw]","deng ni PF: Wo zuotian ZAI BANGONGSHI LI deng ni. \\t","I yesterday SHI in office\\twait-for you","Ì waited for you IN THE OFFICE yesterday.' We propose that the insertion of Focus Marker shi is triggered by the [+Fs] marking from the DS representation. The process of Focus Mark insertion, we assume, is an instance of Adjoin-@ in the sense of Lebeaux (1991), which, along with Move-(a), and Project-CO, takes place in the course of derivation of SS from DS. i.e. (17) (Lebeaux (1991)). 35 Language, Information and Computation (PACLIC12), 18-20 Feb, 1998, 33-41 (17) DS Move-@. Project-A, and Adjoin-@, SS This proposal amounts to saying that the Focus Marker shi is not present at DS, but be adjoined-in later in the course of derivation. According to Lebeaux's Principle of Licensing Well-Formedness as in (18), for an element to be present in the phrase marker, it has to be properly licensed perhaps in different ways for different grammatical elements. An element cannot be present until the relevant licensing relation allowing or requiring it into the phrase marker has applied.","(18) PRINCIPLE OF LICENSING WELL-FORMEDNESS (UG)","A subtree Ts may not appear in a major tree Tm prior to the point in the derivation that Ts is","licensed in Tm (Ts, Tm relative). Note that neither the Projection Principle nor anything else requires the presence of shi in the DS representation. Shi as an emphatic verb has to be analyzed not to participate in the Argument Structure, otherwise the obvious similarities among sentences (7) (8) (9) and (10) above which differ in nothing but in the Focus-Marking cannot. be properly captured. We assume that these sentences share the same common DS representation in terms of the basic structure, but have different assignments of [+Fs], the latter eventually triggers the insertion of Focus Marker shi before different constituents, perhaps to satisfy an SS condition like (19) below.","(19) A constituent with [+Fs] marking must be reflected with Focus Marker shi at SS in Chinese. Also note that the Focus Marker shi is absent at DS. But the [+Fs] marking has to be assigned or/and checked at the level to provide proper triggering for the insertion of shi. This proposal represents a nontrivial departure from those of Chomsky (1981), Jackendoff (1972) and Horvath (1986) who all explicitly or implicitly assume that Focus Assignment takes place at SS. One reason that forbids us from adopting the SS-Focus-Assignment approach is that it will put us in a dilemma in handling the Chinese case, since if so, shi will have to be preexisting at DS on one hand because the necessary triggering which calls for its insertion will not be available before SS, but we know it cannot be there on the other hand as its licensing takes place at SS. Additional arguments will be provided for our DS-Focus-Assignment approach as we proceed.","The placement of the Focus Marker shi in linear word order is determined jointly by two factors: [1] Shi, as a verb in terms of parts of speech, has to observe all relevant syntactic conditions governing verbs in Chinese. For example, it cannot be inserted between a verb and its object even the object NP has an [+Fs] mark from DS representation. In this case, shi normally is placed immediately before the verb; [2] Shi is to be placed as close as possible to the focused constituent in a sentence should applicable conditions allow so. A single sentence, as noted above, may have two or more focused constituents. Now it should be pointed","out that only one of the several focused constituents can be marked overtly with shi. The following sentences","are unacceptable. (20)*Wo shi zuotian shi zai bangongshi li deng ni.","I SHI yesterday SHI in office\\twait-for you","\"Intended: I waited for your IN THE OFFICE YESTERDAY.\" (21)*Shi wo shi mei mai na ben shu.","SHI I SHI not buy that book","Ìntended: It is I who did not buy THAT BOOK.'","To account for this phenomenon, we propose a condition on Focus-Assignment (22). (22) The Unique Strong Focus Condition","A simplex sentence can only have one constituent assigned a Strong Focus Mark [-FFs].","If so, then we can say that the Unique Strong Focus Condition is violated in (20) and (21) so that they are","ungrammatical. Also note that (22) should be taken as a condition on clauses, i.e., unembedded simplex","sentences. A sentence with embedded clauses, of course, may have two or more strongly focused constituents,","and consequently may have two or more constituents being syntactically marked with shi. e.g. 36 Language, Information and Computation (PACLIC12), 18-20 Feb, 1998, 33-47 (23) Shi Zhangsan zhidao [shi Lisi dasui-le nage beizil.","SHI Zhangsan know SHI Lisi break-Asp that cup","Ìt is Zhangsan who knows that it is Lisi who broke the cup.'","In wh-questions, only the wh-phrases but not any others could be the strongly focused constituents. With","arguments to be provided later, we assume that this is because those wh-phrases have been assigned the Strong","Focus mark [+Fsl already in the lexicon and carry the mark into syntax when they themselves are composed","into the phrase marker. Such a lexical marking interacts with the syntactic marking in an interesting way. e.g. (24) Shui[+Fs1 mai-le neiben zidian?","who\\tbuy-Asp that dictionary","Ẁho bought that dictionary?' (25) Ni shenme shihou E+Fsi nian-de daxue?","you what time\\tattend-Asp college","Ẁhen did you attend college?'","If necessary, the Focus Marker shi may also be inserted to intensify the focus marking, giving rise to sentences","like the following.

(25') Ni shi shenme shihou[+FsI nian-de daxue?","you SHI what time\\tattend-Asp college","ẀHEN did you attend college?'","In case the wh-phrase is in an object position, the Focus Marker will have to be placed before the main verb","rather than before the wh object. (26) Zhangsan shi mai-le shenmeE+Fs1 ?","Zhangsan SHI buy-Asp what","ẀHAT did Zhangsan buy?'","The constituents with [+FsJ mark in sentences (23') (24') and (25') have double focus marking, one is brought","in along with the wh-phrases from the lexicon, and another obtained through a syntactic process -- the","insertion of Focus Marker shi. This kind of double focus marking is allowed in Chinese, but not in English.","We will return to this issue in section 4.2. The Unique Strong Focus Condition as stated in (22) which disallows a single clause to have more than","one strongly focused constituent and the assumption that wh-phrases are assigned [4-Fs] in the lexicon so that","they carry the mark inherently jointly makes a prediction: the Focus Marker shi can be inserted only to mark","the wh-phrases in wh questions. This prediction is borne out in Chinese as seen from the ungrammaticality of","the following sentences. (27)*Shi Zhangsan \\tpian-le shui E+Fsl ?","SHI Zhangsan cheat-Asp who","Ìntended: *Is it Zhangsan who has cheated who? /","Who has ZHANGSAN cheated?'

'","The ungrammaticality of the above sentences may represent a puzzle for an alternative analysis of the Focus","Assignment, since the Focus Marker shi in general may be inserted to mark any constituent which is strongly","focused in a sentence. Given that the Unique Strong Focus Condition is indepently motivated, the phenemenon","can be taken as a strong arguement for our assumption that wh-phrases are marked [+Fs] in the lexicon and","carry the mark along into the syntax. In short, syntactic marking and lexical marking of strong focus must","coincide. 3. FOCUS-FRONTING Cross-linguistically, the insertion of a Focus Marker perhaps just represents one means of syntactic processing of strong focus. An alternative device is to move the focused constituent to a certain position, and in most cases 37 Language, Information and Computation (PACLIC12), 18-20 Feb, 1998, 33-47 the constituent is preposed to a front position. This is what is so-called 'Focus-Fronting', which is observed in such languages as Archaic Chinese, Hungarian and English."]},{"title":"3.1 Focus-Fronting in Archaic Chinese","paragraphs":["The basic word order of Archaic Chinese, just like that of modern Chinese, is of S-V-O. e.g. (30) Wan\\tmin pi\\tqi (Mozi, Shangxian Zhong)","ten-thousand people receive its benefit","T̀he people all benefit from it.'

Most of the authors including Wang (1958) attempt to relate this kind of 'Object-Preposing' to the formation of questions and negations. Note that this kind of structure-particular approach leaves a big question unresolved: What do those interrogative, negative and emphatic sentences have in common that eventually get their object NPs preposed? It is also a puzzle that all Wh-object NPs ifs questions, but only some object NPs in negative sentences get preposed. Taking a different line of approach, we here would propose that these superficially unrelated sentence patterns are all derived through one single syntactic process, the fronting of strongly focused constituents. As a first proximation, we propose (39).","(39) Move those constituents with [+Fs] marking to pre-verbal positions in Archaic Chinese. Under this . proposal, the observed 'Object-Preposing' phenomena can all be accounted for neatly. Wh-phrases, as argued above, are all marked [+Fs] in the lexicon and they carry this mark into the syntax. Also, as proposed in Xu and Li (1993) on independent grounds, negative adverbs have dual functions: Negating and Focusing. In case the object NP in a negative sentence happen to be a focused constituent, its focalization will be intensified by a negative adverb and will become stronger. In addition to all of these, an object NP in a regular, non-interrogative and non-negative sentence still can be assigned the mark [4-Fs] through Focus Assignment.

Details aside, one of Larson's important claims is that a VP may consist of an empty V position (i.e., VP shell) that takes another VP as a complement. Under this proposal, the VP structure underlying a double object construction like (40), for example, will be postulated as (41). And from their respective DS positions, the verb send as being driven by the Case assignment and tense/agreement requirements, raises up into the empty V position, and Mary, to receive Case assignment, moves to the 'subject' position of the complement VP in a fashion that Larson identifies with passivization.","(40) John sent Mary a letter.

Theoretically, there is nothing in principle that disallows this possibility. In this section, we are to propose that the formation of the English cleft-sentences is an instantiation of this logical possibility. Consider the following examples.","(56) It is the new house; that John will buy ti for his mother tomorrow.","(57) It is tomorrow; when John will buy the new house for his mother ti.","(58) It is for his mother; that John will buy the new house t i tomorrow.","(59) It is John- ti who will buy the new house for his mother tomorrow. Our proposal is that sentences (56-59) have a common DS representation in terms of the basic syntactic structure and they differ minimally in the assignment of focus. i.e.","(56') John will buy the new house[+Fsi for his mother tomorrow.","(57') John will buy the new house for his mother tomorrowE+Fs}.","(58') John will buy the new house for his mother[+Fs] tomorrow.","(59') JohnE+Fs1 will buy the new house for his mother tomorrow. To process the [+Fs] marking syntactically, English employs two devices: 'Focus-Fronting' and 'Insertion of Focus Marker', and the Focus Marker in English, interestingly, is also a copular verb to be. These two devices are both triggered by the same mark [-F-Fs] and both take place in the course of derivation of SS from DS. Since a complementizer such as that always co-occur with the moved focused constituents, it is reasonable to assume that the landing site of focused constituents is Spec/CP. Also. although evidence does not strongly choose between two options of application order of the two devices, we assume that 'Insertion of Focus Marker' takes place before 'Focus-Fronting'. In short, we postulate (60) as the derivational course for an English cleft-sentence such as (56)."]},{"title":"41","paragraphs":["Language, Information and Computation (PACLIC12), 18-20 Feb, 1998, 33-47 (60) .\\t"]},{"title":"CP Spec that Spec 1 V John I\\t'VP I","paragraphs":["\\t"]},{"title":"will","paragraphs":["•"]},{"title":"\\7NP\\tAdv. l","paragraphs":["u.)4\\the new house [+Fs]"]},{"title":"tomorrow Insertion of Focus Marker to be","paragraphs":["This movement approach to the analysis of the English cleft-sentences may represent a non-trivial departure from the traditional analysis and some justifications are thus in order.

For example, it","cannot move a constituent out of a complex NP, as shown in the following sentences.

Note that the English Focus Marker to be is also a copular verb. As discussed above, a Focus Marker must be a certain part of speech so it must observe the relevant conditions that other members of its part of speech in general observe. Shi behaves just like a regular copular verb while functioning as a Focus Marker. This is also the case for the English to be. After being inserted into the sentence, to be behaves just like a verb. For instance, it may be reflected for tense as in (67) and exchange positions with the subject NP in questions (i.e., S̀ubject-Auxiliary Inversion') as in (68).","(67) It was your cat that I found in the park.","(68) Is it Bill that Mary hates? There seems to be a salient difference between English and Chinese in the insertion of Focus Marker. It is clear in Chinese that what is inserted as a focus marker is just shi, but in English what is inserted before focused constituents seems to be it is. We propose that the Focus Marker in English as well as in Chinese is the copular verb shi/be. The existence of expletive it has nothing to do with either focus or focus marking. Rather, the insertion of it is due to a completely different requirement of the English grammar which, presumably as an effect of the Null Subject Parameter setting, requires the subject position be fulfilled with a lexical NP. In other words, it has to be inserted there for the same reason which is responsible for the insertion of the same expletive pronoun in (69) (70) and (71)."]},{"title":"42","paragraphs":["Language, Information and Computation (PACLIC12), 18-20 Feb, 1998, 33-47","(69) It is raining.","(70) It seems that John will buy the new house.","(71) It is assumed that John will buy the new house.","Given that the insertion of it is due to a motivation completely independent of Focus and Focus Marking, we","should not be surprized if somebody says that there is a language which, unlike English, employs the two","syntactic devices of Focus-Processing, but, unlike English, allows null subjects.","The cluster of properties that one normally relates to the formation of the English cleft-sentences now has been decomposed and made to follow from independently motivated principles. We take this feature of the approach as a simplification of the grammar. This is a welcome result in the spirit of modular theory of grammar. .Superficially, the syntactic devices in processing strongly focused constituents appear to be very much different from one language to another. But we now see that those cross-linguistic diverse facts resulted from the choice between only two possible devices (a very limited number of options) in interaction with independently motivated principles.","Archaic Chinese and modern Hungarian on one hand and modern English on the other differ minimally in the landing sites of the focused constituents. Recall that focused constituents in Archaic Chinese and modern Hungarian move to a pre-verbal position, i.e., the Spec position of complement VP, while their counterparts in English move to the Spec position of a CP. Obviously, it will be an interesting question as why there is such a cross-linguistic difference. We leave this question open but simply point out that this difference may also be due to a reason independent of focus and explainable in a modular theory of grammar. 4. ẀH-MOVEMENT' AS FOCUS-FRONTING Our proposal is that the movement of focused constituents is triggered by the strong focus mark [+Fs] both for Wh-phrases and non-Wh-phrases. Wh-phrases and non-Wh-phrases differ minimally in how and where the mark (+Fs] is assigned but neither in whether the mark is assigned nor in whether the [+Fs]-marked constituents will move. [+Fs] is assigned to Wh-phrases in the lexicon and be carried along the Wh-phrases into syntax, whereas it is assigned to non-Wh-phrases at DS through} F̀ocus-Assignment'. The formal syntax is sensitive only to whether a certain constituent is so marked, but not to where and how it is marked. If this approach is on the right track, we are in a position to say that the widely recoganized, structure-particular rule ---- Ẁh-Movement' can be subsumed under the general 'Focus-Fronting', and there is no such thing as Ẁh-Movement' in the formal syntax.","The above unified account of wh-questions and cleft sentences works straightforwardly in Archaic Chinese and modern Hungarian as there is virtually no difference between Focus-Fronting of Wh-phrases and that of non-Wh-phrases. However, there appears to be an obvious problem when we take a second look at the English phenomenon. As demonstrated above, the formation of English cleft-sentences involves the joint application of two focus devices ---- the insertion of the Focus Marker to be and the fronting of the focused constituents. But the formation of Wh-questions seems to involve only the fronting of Wh-phrases but no insertion of Focus Marker. Also, the subject NP and the auxiliary verb are inverted in Wh-questions but not in cleft-sentences. In this section, we shall argue that the differences between Wh-questions and cleft-sentences in English can either be accounted for independently or made to follow from a minimal and reasonable assumption. Neither in Hungarian and Chinese nor in English is there a principled contrast between 'Focus-Fronting' and WA-Movement'. The former is an instantiation of the latter. We will begin our discussion with a brief review the relationship between question formation and Wh-Movement since they have been widely assumed in the literature, explicitly or implicitly, to be inherently related."]},{"title":"4.1.Decomposing 'Question-Formation'","paragraphs":["There is a salient difference between questions and non-questions.

Consider the following two questions.","(72) Will you buy the new house?","(73) What will you buy?"]},{"title":"43","paragraphs":["Language, Information and Computation (PACLIC12), 18-20 Feb, 1998, 33-47 The DS representations of these two questions can be postulated as (74) and (75) below respectively, whereby some kind of abstract question morpheme [-I-Wil] is included. Crucially, the abstract question morpheme as functional category is a property of the whole CP, rather than that of any lexical constituent in the CP. As a working hypothesis, people normally assume that this property of CP results from a percolating of the same property from its head, C. Also, the Wh-phrase what in sentence (73) should be marked [+Fs] in the lexicon and carries the mark into the phrase marker.

(75) involves two steps of movement while (74) involves only one. What they have in common are the presence of the abstract question morpheme [+Wh] at DS and the application of S̀ubject-Auxiliary Inversion' and there is a systematic correlation between the two, so it must be the former that triggers the latter. It should be clear that 'the formation of questions' in English is simply the application of a syntactic process, 'Subject-Auxiliary Inversion'. The movement of the Wh-phrase what in (75) has nothing to do with question formation. Rather, it is triggered by a strong focus mark [+Fs] on completely independent ground assigned in the lexicon. As argued above, any constituent with mark [+Fs], no matter whether it is a Wh-phrase or not, has to move to the position Spec/CP in English. In other words, sentences like (73) result from the joint application of two syntactic processes --- the syntactic process of [+FsJ (i.e., 'Focus-Fronting' in English) and that of [+WhJ (i.e., S̀ubject-Auxiliary Inversion' in English) ---- and they are completely independent of each other, whereas sentences like (72) result only from the application of a single syntactic process, the process of [+Wh] as no constituent of it is marked [±Fs]. Let us look at anther related example.","(76) Is it the new house; that you will buy ti ? (76) is like (73) in the sense that it is also derived from the joint application of 'Focus-Fronting' and 'Subject-Auxiliary Inversion'. But unlike (73), (76) is not a Wh-question. Interestingly, the auxiliary being inverted is the inserted Focus Marker is but not will, which suggests to us that Focus Marker insertion and Focus-Fronting both apply before Subject-Auxiliary Inversion in English, whereby the former feed the latter.","The cluster of properties that are normally related to q̀uestion formation' have been successfully decomposed, with 'Wh-Movement' being recast as an instantiation of 'Focus-Fronting' which is completely independent of questions and S̀ubject-Auxiliary Inversion' being analyzed as the only syntactic process of the abstract question morpheme [+Wh]. Subject-Auxiliary Inversion indiscriminately applied to all types of questions including yes-no questions and Wh-questions. For this decompositional approach, an interesting argument can be constructed on some language facts observed in the Early English grammar. As noted in Hyams (1986) and Weinberg (1991), the acquisition of the so-called 'Wh-Movement' in English occurs significantly earlier than that of Subject-Auxiliary Inversion. While the former may be observed in the speech of 28 month or younger children, the latter is rarely seen in the speech of children until they are around 38 month old. Following sentences have been collected from the speech of children around 28 month old (Hyams (1986)).","(77) What doing?\\t(Cf: What are you doing?)","(78) What cowboy doing?

(Data from Weinberg (1991)).","(79) What you are gonna wear? (Adult: What are you going to wear?)","(80) What the mouse is doing? (Adult: What is the mouse doing?) For us, the difference in acquisition timing suggests that Subject-Auxiliary Inversion as the English process of [+Wh] and Ẁh-Movement' as the English process of [+Fs] are treated independently and thus acquired independently, confirming our proposal that they are of different conceptions. Given that Ẁh-Movement' is just an instantiation of Focus-Fronting, a prediction can be made here that Focus-Fronting in English cleft-sentences should also be acquired around 28 month old, and children of 28-38 month old may produce 'wrong' questions like (81) below.","(81) (It is) John you know?

It is noted above that English represents a joint application of the two focus-processing devices ---- the insertion of Focus Marker to be and the movement of focused constituent. However, it has to be pointed out that this is the case only in cleft sentences with non-Wh-focus. In Wh-questions, there is only movement of focused constituent, but no insertion of Focus Marker. This contrast demands an explanation from our proposal under which Ẁh-Movement' and regular 'Focus-Fronting' are unified. To pose the question more concretely, why should sentences (84) and (85), which also have been inserted a Focus Marker, be ungrammatical while (82) and (83) are well acceptable sentences?","(82) Is it the new house; that you will buy ti ?","(83) Is it John who; will buy the new house?","(84)*Is it what (that) you will buy ti ?","(85)*It is what. will you buy t, ? If we take cleft-sentences such as (82) and (83) as the canonical case of syntactic processing of [+Fs] in English, then the question is why Wh-questions don't allow the Focus Marker be inserted. To tackle this problem, here we would make a language-particular claim for English. We claim that Wh-phrases themselves represent a sort of overt Focus Marking (Let us call it F̀-wh'), which is comparable to be in English that also can be assumed to be [F-be] at an abstract level. Under this proposal, an enriched specification of sentences (86) and (87) at an abstract level will be (86') and (87') respectively, whereby they both have overt Focus Marking: [F-be] in (86) and [F-wh] in (87).

The Chinese Focus Marker shi, for instance, is also a verb while functioning as Focus Marker, the grammar must ensure that it will observe the conditions that are applicable to verbs in general. A syntactic restriction on the distribution of verbs does not allow shi to be inserted in between a verb and its object even when the object is strongly focused. The English Focus Marker be is also a verb. When being finite, it will be subject to the subject requirement so an extra expletive pronoun it has to be inserted along. 5.CONCLUSION Starting with some minimal assumptions about 'Focus', we in this paper argue that the initially semantic conception of 'Focus' can be taken a purely formal syntactic property, and that this formal property is assigned and/or checked to certain sentential constituents at the DS level of syntactic representation. 'Focus' should be divided into two relative categories: Strong Focus [+Fs] and Weak Focus [+Fw]. While the [+Fw] marking generally triggers some phonological process such as the assignment of primary stress in one way or another, the [+Fs] marking normally triggers different syntactic processes in different languages. A language typology has been established about the syntactic processing of [+Fs] by which there are two devices of [+Fs] processing: the insertion of Focus Marker be before focused constituents and the fronting of focused constituents, and English represents the third type of languages which employ both devices. Other superficially complex cross-linguistic differences have been made to follow from the choice between these two limited options in interaction with independently needed principles.","On the assumption that Wh-phrases are all marked [+Fs] in the lexicon and they automatically carry this mark into the phrase Marker, we also have argued that there virtually is no such thing as 'Wh-Movement' in the fol\\tmai syntax of English. What is called 'Wh-Movement' is shown to be in fact an instantiation of a more generally applicable rule 'Focus-Fronting' in English Wh-questions., The so-called 'Question Formation' is thus decomposed into two independent processes: 'Subject-Auxiliary Inversion' and 'Focus Fronting', only the former is a syntactic process of the abstract question morpheme [+Wh] and the latter is completely independent of questions.
