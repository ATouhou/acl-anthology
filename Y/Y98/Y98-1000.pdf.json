The Conference solicits papers treating all fields in theoretical and computational linguistics, including syntax, morphology, phonology, semantics, pragmatics, discourse analysis, corpus linguistics, formal grammar theory, natural language processing, and computer applications. PACLIC12 is the twelfth of this series of conferences held in the Asia Pacific region. This year, PACLIC12 is hosted by the Singapore Chinese and Oriental Languages Information Society (COUPS) and Computational Linguistic Lab, Department of Information Systems and Computer Science, National University of Singapore(NUS). It is to be held from 18-20 Feb, 1998 at the Science Auditorium of NUS. For PACLIC12, we had requested full papers for reviews. Though it is common for conferences in computer information sciences to ask for full papers, we admit that this is not an usual practice in linguistics. We are now very pleased to conclude that such a requirement did not in any way affect the enthusiasm of our learned colleagues on submitting papers. We received a total of 62 submissions from 15 countries and regions. These include: Japan, Korea, Taiwan, United Kingdom, Singapore United States, Australia, France, Hong Kong, Russia, Brazil, China, Denmark, Greece and Slovenia. From this list, we can see that the influence of PACLIC has spread far and wide. It is never an easy task to review papers from linguists and computer information scientists at the same time. For PACLIC12, each paper is reviewed by 3-5 reviewers. Comments from reviewers whose expertise does not fall into the area of the paper carry substantially less weightage than those who are specialized in the area. In. the end, a total of 30 papers are carefully selected for oral presentations. This implies a stringent acceptance rate of only 44%. Another 6 papers are included for postal presentations. All 36 papers are included in this proceedings. We have observed that there is a fairly equal distribution of papers in both linguistic and language information processing. Papers from linguistics cover grammar, syntax, phonology, lexicon and semantics, while papers from language information processing covers language modeling, parsing and processing. The strength of PACLIC is its ability to attract, in a single conference, two completely different disciplines which traditionally do not have any interaction with each other at all. Yet, they cover mostly similar areas of research. In this conference, researchers from these two fields will sit down together and discuss face-to-face common topics from very different angles and perspective. This synergy will definitely benefit both fields tremendously. In PACLIC12, we are fortunate enough to have been able to invite 2 key researchers to deliver speeches in their respective fields of expertise. Professor Thing-fa Wang, who is well know in speech processing (and who will be chairing the PACLIC 13 in Tawian), will speak on \"Experience on the Development of Spoken Language System based on Continuous Speech Recognition\". Professor Mohanan K. P. from National University of Singapore will deliver his keynote speech on \" Non-Monotonicity in Linguistics\" iv We wish to take this opportunity to thank the National University of Singapore for providing the conference facilities and logistic support for the conference. We would also like to express our sincere thanks to the PACLIC12 co-chairs and technical committee members. Reviewing papers from unfamiliar areas is always a difficult experience. Special thanks go to Professor Thing-fa Wang and Professor K. P. Mohanan for delivering the keynote speeches. Prof Wang has to make special arrangement to rush back from a conference in India. We also wish to thank all our learned colleagues who submitted papers and who come to Singapore to attend the conference. Without them, PACLIC12 will lose all its meaning. Last but not least, we wish to thank Ms Toh Siew Kek, our COLTS secretary for her help in the booking of hotels, arrangement for the conference banquet and all other 'little-little' things.","Lua Kim Teng (PACLIC12 Chair) Feb, 1998 CONFERENCE CHAIRS Kim Teng Lua"]},{"title":"PACLIC12 Committees","paragraphs":["National University of Singapore, and President of the Chinese and Oriental Language Information Processing Society (COUPS) City University of Hong Kong Taiwan Academia Sinica Korea Chosun University, and President of the Korean Society for Language and Information (KSLI) Tokyo Galcuen University National Cheng Kung University Benjamin K.
