Based on the observation that the English translation of a Chinese compound often involves two or more English words, a heuristic is presented that accepts Chinese-English word pairs as correct if two consecutive English words are proposed to correspond to the same Chinese word in ,a statistical or dictionary-based approach. In addition, document-external word distributions are utilised to measure word pair co-occurrences in the whole corpus. Words with low co-occurrence ratios are then filtered out. The two proposed methods can derive a translation lexicon of more than 94% precision."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["The compilation of a large translation lexicon is very costly, laborious, and time-consuming. Automation of all or most of the compilation process is therefore highly desirable. This goal has been made possible by the availability of large parallel corpora, machine-readable bilingual dictionaries, and statistical algorithms that have been proposed in recent years. In this paper, we address the problems encountered by statistics-based and dictionary-based approaches in deriving and augmenting a translation lexicon. We advocate a hybrid approach combining statistical and dictionary information to increase the recall, In addition, we suggest using proximity and global distributions of word pairs to enhance the precision."]},{"title":"2. The K-vec Algorithm","paragraphs":["Fung and Church (1994) propose a simple algorithm to find word correspondences from unaligned parallel texts. The basic idea is that a true word pair should have similar distributions in terms of the position of its occurrence in the text. To estimate the similarity of co-occurrence, the parallel texts are split into the same number of segments (K) and the distributions of each word are represented in a 1...K binary vector. For instance, suppose the Chinese and English texts are divided into ten segments. Suppose further that the Chinese word tiff daxue occurs ten times, with the first 3"]},{"title":"occurrences in","paragraphs":["the fourth segment and the remaining 7 occurrences in the seventh segment and that the English word university appears twelve times, with the first 4 occurrences in the fourth segment and the remaining 8 occurrences in the seventh segment. Using the K binary vectors, the distributions of both the Chinese and English words in question can be represented as <0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0>. Mutual information (MI) and t-score are then used to estimate the correlation of a proposed word correspondence. The mutual information and t-score of the word pair are defined in (1) and (2).

The threshold value of MI and t-score are set to be 0 and 1.65, respectively. Only word pairs which are higher than the predetermined threshold values and in the frequency range 3-10 are considered to be potential mutual translations. Fung and Church (1994) observe that K, the number of segments in the bilingual texts, has a decisive factor in the performance of the algorithm. If K is too large, there will be many spurious word pairs. On the other hand, if K is too small, very few word pairs can be identified. They thus suggest that K be set to the square root of the length of the bilingual texts.","We reimplemented the K-vec algorithm and tested it with seven articles of the Sinorama Chinese-English parallel corpus, which consists of bilingual articles from the Sinorama Magazine. Since there are no delimiters between words in Chinese, the Chinese texts were first preprocessed by the word segmentation program reported in Chen and Liu (1992).","Table 1 summarises the results of the experiments. It indicates that the number of word pairs proposed by K-vec depends on the length as well as the nature of the text. Although K-vec invariably performs poorly with small texts, there are significant discrepancies between bilingual texts of similar length. Take texts 5 and 6 for example, which are of similar length but for which the results differ radically. Equally noticeable in Table 1 is the fact that longer texts do not necessarily have better performance in terms of recall or precision, as can be seen from comparisons between texts 2 and 5, as well as 6 and 7.","Table 1.

Quantitatively speaking, if a bilingual text is full of recurrent terms or proper names, the co-occurrence ratio of a true word pair will be high, as they do not have morphological variants, synonyms, or hyponyms which discount the similarity measures. As a result, K-vec can perform better. If, however, the lexical patterning of a bilingual text involves relatively few identical repetitions, the performance of K-vec will inevitably be poor. In other words, the cohesive devices employed in a bilingual text greatly influence the performance of K-vec.","K-vec is a typical example which shows the strength and limitations of statistical word alignment algorithms. In fact, all the statistical algorithms that have been proposed to extract word correspondences from unaligned parallel corpora including Kay and ROscheisen (1993), K-vec, and DK-vec (Fung and McKeown (1994, 1997)) cannot be exempt from the limitations on text length and frequency (c.f.

Due to the shortcomings of statistical approaches, several researchers (e.g. Kumano and Hirakawa (1994), Utsuro et al. (1994), Haruno and Yamazaki (1996)) have advocated, combining statistical and linguistic information. In the following section, we explore a dictionary-based approach and show why it is necessary to integrate linguistic with statistical information."]},{"title":"3.

In other words, .the precision of exact matching was only 70.59%, while the recall was as low as 5.66%.","The low recall was due to three factors. First, the bilingual dictionary we used was not comprehensive. Second, we did not use morphological processing and simply removed the most productive suffixes such as -ed, - ing, -er, and -est. Third, words might not be the smallest units for translation. Often, translations are done chunk by chunk, where a chunk might consist of a phrase, collocation, fixed expression, or even a sentence. Furthermore, some constructions or patterns must be regarded as translation templates that cannot be decomposed into smaller units.","Since the recall of dictionary lookup based on exact matching was too low, we experimented on using inexact (i.e. partial) matching. In the same sample paragraph of 212 English words, English-to-Chinese dictionary lookup based on partial matching suggested 172 word correspondences, 51 of which were correct, obtaining 29.65% precision and 24.05% recall. This result showed that inexact matching has higher recall (24.05% vs. 5.66%) but lower precision (29.65% vs. 70.59%) than exact matching. The choice of exact or inexact matching is thus a trade-off between precision and recall. The following question naturally arises. How can we filter out spurious word pairs if inexact matching is adopted?"]},{"title":"4.

Using Proximity to Find the Translations of Chinese Compounds","paragraphs":["It has been noticed that there is a large number of Chinese compounds whose English translations involve more than one word. This characteristic can be easily utilised to identify translations of Chinese compounds from the output of K-vec and dictionary lookup based on partial matching. Since K-vec extracts bilingual word pairs which co-occur in the same segment more often than by chance, if it associates the same Chinese word with two or more English words which are adjacent to each other, then we can reasonably infer that these English words are translations of the Chinese word. Given that tables of word position•indexes of the bilingual text are required by K-vec, extraction of the translations of Chinese compounds is very straightforward. The second and third columns (i.e. the Chinese and English words) of Table 4 are the word pairs extracted by K-vec.

We are currently implementing an iterative algorithm in the spirit of Kay and ROscheisen (1993) to improve the recall of the translation lexicon.. In the first iteration, the algorithm treats each individual document as a segment to calculate the co-occurrences of word pairs in the whole corpus. Word pairs which meet the proximity condition before the cleaning algorithm or above the threshold of co-occurrence ratio after the cleaning algorithm are identified as anchor points. These anchor points then become boundaries of segments for the next iteration. As the number of segments in each document increases, many correct word pairs incorrectly filtered out by the cleaning algorithm in the first few iterations can be expected to be recovered later."]},{"title":"Acknowledgement","paragraphs":["The author wishes to express his gratitude to the Sinorama Magazine for permission to use the Sinorama Chinese-English parallel corpus and to Dr. Harold Somers, Dr. Tony McEnery, Mr. John McNaught, Prof. Chu.- Ren.
