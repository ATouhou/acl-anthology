For this, how we collect, sort and allocate information to the dictionary headwords is critical, and this is what I shall be discussing in this paper."]},{"title":"2 Collecting Machine-Readable Dictionary Headwords","paragraphs":["The following arc fundamental requirements in collecting machine-readable dictionary headwords.","(1) We should analyze the corpora and adopt headwords that appear frequently. Crucial to this is a clear standard on the frequency point at which a headword is adopted and below which it is rejected.","(2) We have to decide whether to use long or short terms as headwords. Generally in natural language processing, long terms arc used to reduced ambiguity. The problem with this, though, is that using long terms will make the dictionary much more voluminous because of the greater number of words needed. Considering the importance of clarity, however, this cannot be helped.","(3) Certain words form natural groups, and all words belonging to these groups should be included; for example, prefectures, days of the week, months of the year, and planets in the solar system. Including just one of these words in their respective groups without the others will create functional problems.","(4) Collation of synonym and antonym dictionaries. Synonym and antonym dictionaries have to be checked against each other to ensure there arc no inconsistencies between the two, such as an entry in one but no corresponding entry in the other. Where thore is no corresponding entry, the reason must be clearly shown. The idea behind dictionaries for machine processing and that behind dictionaries that people can thumb through arc different, so we have to be aware that different terms are used. It is often best to include in machine dictionaries even terms that arc easy for people to understand and to break down into their key elements. For example, : rfirf (on duty, at work) and Fl7rKv(the end of the same month). These terms arc not used as headwords in dictionaries for use by people.","(6) Collation with other machine-readable dictionaries. Machine-readable dictionaries sourced from normal dictionaries that people use to read and understand arc not suitable for machine processing. This is because people arc able to understand and infer as necessary, whereas this is not possible in machine processing.","tt Hyogo University, 2301 Shinzaike Hiraoka Kakogawa, Hyougo, Japan 675-01.

Writings by people who have developed normal dictionaries indicate that of all the possible headwords collected for the dictionary, only about a half or even fewer were actually used. We, too, have to think along these lines for machine- .","readable dictionaries. Headwords may become obsolete or fall out of common use as the language evolves over time, so we must always analyze the frequency with which they arc used. We must constantly monitor any changes in usage and frequency. Non-standard usage, young people's language, lyrics and proverbs arc- all a reflection of their age and change from generation to generation, or even more quickly.

In normal dictionaries variations in the listings can be standardized into a single entry, but for machine-readable dictionaries, in most cases processing is simpler if the number of headwords is increased. This does, however, have its drawbacks in that the dictionary will be larger, and there will be some duplication of items when printed."]},{"title":"3 Collation with Data-Based Machine-Readable Dictionaries","paragraphs":["Next I looked at data-based machine-readable dictionaries using dictionaries produced by two private companies."]},{"title":"3.1 Collation of three-character compounds","paragraphs":["For this collation I used five year& worth of data from the Nihon Kcizai Shimbun, namely three-character kanji compounds extracted using changes in character kind.","Some of the three-character compounds in the data were extracted incorrectly or by mistake, so the totals do not correspond.","Company A was set up with finance from several major manufacturing companies and the government, and has produced several machine-readable dictionaries.

(1) Differences in reading of two-character compounds from Nikkei corpora Number of cases Total words Japanese reading is different from first character One of the readings has an extra character (difference of one character between the two readings in the number of distinct characters) One of the characters in the two readings is different (making the number of different characters two; e.g. one reading uses a $8 and the other a $B) One of the characters in the two readings is different (different from the above example; making the number of different characters two) Two of the characters in the two readings are different (making the number of different characters three or four) Three of the characters in the two readings are different (making the number of different characters five or more) Multiple readings are given, so there will be differences in readings and also variations in the number of readings Japanese reading is different from first character One of the readings has an extra character (difference of one character between the two readings in the number of distinct characters) One of the characters in the two readings is different (making the number of different characters two; e.g. one reading uses a $8 and the other a $B) One of the characters in the two readings is different (different from the above example; making the number of different characters two) Two of the characters in the two readings are different (making the number of different characters three or four) Three of the characters in the two readings are different (making the number of different characters five or more) Multiple readings are given, so there will be differences in readings and also variations in the number of readings \\t 273\\t33,438 \\t 84\\t140,423 \\t 10\\t1,396 \\t 71\\t5,989 \\t 46\\t7,139 \\t 15\\t10,332 \\t 246\\t141,257 \\t 745\\t339,974 Total words \\t 13\\t192 \\t 5\\t3,978 \\t 3\\t124 \\t 18\\t1,755 \\t 19\\t1,390 \\t 5\\t203 \\t 5\\t79 \\t 68\\t7,721 (2) Differences in reading of three-character compounds from Nikkei corpora Number of cases","These differences can be put down to either differences in attaching kana readings to the different parts of speech resulting in different kana being used to show declension or inflection, or the differences in classical and contemporary kana renderings of certain compounds.","A check of the readings that did not match showed that Company A's dictionary tended to use the older readings and Company B's dictionary the more contemporary readings. 313 Language, Information and Computation (PACLIC12), 18-20 Feb, 1998, 310-315","For example, Company A used the reading ooakindo for the compound Bg>&?M (major trader), while Company B used daishonin.

Natural language processing where meanings have to be processed 314 Language, Information and Computation (PACLIC12), 18-20 Feb, 1998, 310-315 Long terms arc used for technical terminology. Although effective for removing ambiguity, long terms do have their drawback in that thcy increase the volume of the dictionary and lower the collation rate (appearance rate). Therefore perseverance is necessary when collecting these terms. Cutting long terms down to short terms with the structure intact is, however, quite simple using the following method.","Natural language processing --0 ((natural language) processing) 4-- Term can be written with a space between the three distinct words while keeping the structure intact","There is, however, no one single accepted way of converting the three distinct words back into the one term.

In using machine-readable dictionaries, we have to know how the dictionary was developed, what its special features are, how it functions, and its capability. These aspects arc rarely, if ever, indicated in the dictionary. A well balanced assessment on the quality of a dictionary cannot be made just on the number of headwords.","3.

And although computers arc essential for analyzing word frequency within corpora, even a small human input can achieve significant results.","It is clear where priority should be placed, and this will reduce the effort used in making the necessary judgements. Unless corpora arc analyzed regularly, past analysis results will quickly become outdated. We have to systematize the experience gained by our predecessors in this field, and work out the most effective way of using this bank of experience in computer processing. I have also found out that we need to examine the dictionary headwords and content rather than just rely on computer analysis of large volumes of corpora.","Several companies arc producing machine-readable dictionaries on CD-ROM. and I believe we need to refer to these, together with our analysis of corpora, in our aim of developing an extensive machine-readable dictionary. It would be preferable to develop a dictionary with roughly one million headwords.","Similar issues arise in the development of technical dictionaries, so it is necessary to research and build up corpora in the technical fields.","I am confident that the quality and capability of the dictionaries will only be improved as more and more people use them and their suggestions and criticisms arc taken on board by the developers and manufacturers."]},{"title":"Regarding the data","paragraphs":["Data used in this analysis arc from Nihon Kcizai Shimbun CD-ROM. 1990. 1991. 1992. 1993 and 1994 editions, purchased from Nikkei Sogo Hanbai Co., Ltd."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["[1] K.
