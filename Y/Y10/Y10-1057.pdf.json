The aim of this paper is to provide formalization of Japanese sentence-final particles in the framework of Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) (Steedman 1996, 2000, Szabolcsi 1987). While certain amount of literature has discussed the descriptive meaning of Japanese sentence-final particles (Takubo and Kinsui 1997, Chino 2001), little formal account has been provided except for McCready (2007)’s analysis from the viewpoint of dynamic semantics and relevance theory. I analyze particles such as yo and ne as verum focus operators (Höhle 1992, Romero and Han 2004). Keywords: verum focus, questions, focus semantic value"]},{"title":"1 Research Questions","paragraphs":["The questions to be addressed in this paper are: – What are the lexical categories and meaning of Japanese sentence-final particles? – Is subcategorization, e.g., SF OC , SQ, the right way to go?","– Should semantics of questions and focus be reflected in types and categories (Hamblin 1973, Rooth 1996)? What about direct compositionality (Barker and Jacobson 2007)?","Section 3 answers the first question and provides lexical entries in CCG for Japanese sentence-final particles, which has not be discussed much so far (Steedman 1996, 2000). Regarding the second question, the subcategorization adopted in the literature as in Steedman (2000) is introduced in the following section 2. Even though the categories given in section 3 use subcategorization, the semantics avoids any subcategories and reflect the theories on questions and focus in Hamblin (1973) and Rooth (1985, 1992), which leads to the third question discussed in section 4."]},{"title":"2 Steedman (2000): Prosodically Annotated Categories","paragraphs":["In CCG, a transitive verb eat would have a following lexical category, which is a function from a noun phrase (NP) to another function from NP to a sentence (S).

The semantics, however, attempts to account for the meaning of questions and focus."]},{"title":"3 Categories of Sentence-final Particles in Japanese 3.1 Syntactic Behavior","paragraphs":["Given that Japanese is a SOV language, sentence-final particles may attach either to a verb as in (3), a modal in (4) or a tense marker in (5) which fall in the end of sentences. These particles are generally ungrammatical elsewhere, except for ne and na which may attach to case markers as well as shown in (4d).","These particles often convey subtle nuances although many appear to be question or exclamative markers which turn the sentences into questions or exclamatives.","(3) a.

The literature from the pedagogical view point, such as Chino (2001), lists Japanese sentence-final particles such as no, ne, yo, na, ke, mono, and others and describe their meanings. Only McCready (2007) presents an analysis from the viewpoint of dynamic semantics and relevance theory.","In harmony with their syntactic position as sentence-final particles, semantically speaking, all Japanese sentence-final particles, in common, take the entire proposition in its scope. The sentence-final particles take a proposition as the argument and returns a set of propositions. Below I define them as functions from a proposition to another proposition.","1. no: a question marker or a polarity focus operator (Höhle 1992, Romero and Han 2004).

Semantically speaking, these particles are functions from a proposition to a set of propositions. For example, no as a question marker is a function from a proposition to a set of possible answers in a given context (Hamblin 1973). The meaning of (14a) is a set of propositions as in (14b).","(14) a. Arisu-o mi-ta-no. Alice-ACC watch-PAST-PAR “Did you see Alice?” b.

Therefore, their categories remain S\\SQ or S\\Sfoc and cannot be S\\(S\\S) which seems to reflect their semantics better.","The hypothesis of direct compositionality assumes that the syntax and the semantics work together in tandem. Every expression that is computed in syntax has meaning (Jacobson 2002, Barker and Jacobson 2007). Direct compositionality advocates a rule-to-rule view–each syntactic rule is a semantic rule specifying how the meaning of the larger expression is derived from the meanings of the smaller expressions.","Our dilemma is that the semantic type of sentence-final particles <st, <st, t>> more straightforwardly correspond to type S\\(S\\S) rather than S\\SQ or S\\Sfoc even though there is no syntactic composition with two sentences."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Barker, C. and Jacobson, P.
