The discipline where sentiment/opinion/emotion has been identified and classified in human written text is well known as sentiment analysis. A typical computational approach to sentiment analysis starts with prior polarity lexicons where entries are tagged with their prior out of context polarity as human beings perceive using cognitive knowledge. Till date, all research efforts found in sentiment analysis literature deal mostly with English texts. In this article, we propose an interactive gaming (Dr Sentiment) technology to create and validate SentiWordNet in 56 languages by involving Internet population. Dr Sentiment is a fictitious character, interact with players using series of questions and finally reveal the behavioral or sentimental status of any player and store the lexicons as the players polarized during playing. The interactive gaming technology is then compared with other multiple automatic linguistics techniques like, WordNet based, dictionary based, corpus based or generative approaches for generating SentiWordNet(s) for Indian languages and other International languages as well. A number of automatic, semiautomatic and manual validations and evaluation methodologies have been adopted to measure the coverage and credibility of the developed SentiWordNet(s). Keywords: SentiWordNet, Global, Sentiment Analysis."]},{"title":"1 Prior Polarity Lexicon","paragraphs":["In order to identify sentiment from a text, lexical analysis plays a crucial role. As example love, hate, good, favorite etc words directly indicate sentiment or opinion. Various previous works (Pang et al., 2002; Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006; Esuli et. al., 2006) have already proposed techniques for making dictionaries for those sentiment words. But identification of polarity orientation of those words is another vital research issue, called polarity identification.","Polarity Identification and classification of such sentiment lexicons is a hard contextual semantic disambiguation problem. The regulating aspects of semantic orientation of a lexicon are natural language context information (Pang et al., 2002) language properties (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006), domain pragmatic knowledge (Aue and Gamon, 2005) and lastly most challenging is the time dimension (Read, 2005).","The following two examples show that the polarity tag associated with a sentiment word depends on context / domain knowledge and time dimension.","","Example 1: I prefer Limuzin as it is longer than Mercedes.","Avoid longer baggage during excursion in Amazon.  In the previous two examples the word long has been used as a sentiment/opinion word. But in the first sentence the word long depicts positive sentiment and in the second example it express as a negative sentiment.  PACLIC 24 Proceedings 799 ","Example 2: During 90’s mobile phone users generally reported in various online reviews about their color-phones but in recent times color-phone is not just enough. People are fascinated and influenced by touch screen and various software(s) installation facilities on these new generation gadgets.","Therefore lexicon level polarity assignment is bit difficult. Previous researches (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006; Aue and Gamon, 2005) proposed corpus heuristic based polarity assignment at lexicon level. That means total occurrence of a particular word in a domain corpus counted and the distribution of the word as positive or negative. Suppose total occurrence of a word “long” in a domain corpus is n. The positive and negative occurrence of that word is pS and nS respectively.","Therefore in a developed sentiment lexicon the assigned positivity and negativity score of that word will be as follows: Positivity : pS n ","Negativity : nS n ","These associative sores are called prior polarity. Prior polarity is an approximation value and not exact. Prior polarity sentiment lexicons are required for any new language as a foundation to start the exploration of computational sentiment analysis for the language. Although contextual polarity disambiguation techniques are still required for further sentiment/opinion analysis task. Sentiment lexicons only provide a good baseline i.e. without using any NLP techniques only dictionary based approach produce a good performance. The performance of polarity classifier has been reported in the Section 5.2. Feature ablation method, reported in Table 7 shows that only dictionary based approach give good baseline score."]},{"title":"2 Motivations","paragraphs":["Several prior polarity sentiment lexicons are available for English such as SentiWordNet (Esuli et. al., 2006), Subjectivity Word List (Wilson et. al., 2005), WordNet Affect list (Strapparava et al., 2004), Taboada’s adjective list (Voll et al., 2006). Among these publicly available sentiment lexicon resources we find that SentiWordNet is most widely used (number of citation is higher than other resources 1",") in several applications such as sentiment analysis, opinion mining and emotion analysis. SentiWordNet is an automatically constructed lexical resource for English that assigns a positivity score and a negativity score to each WordNet synset. Therefore we decided to develop SentiWordNet for new languages.","There are numbers of research endeavor could be found in literature for creation of Sentiment Lexicon in several languages and domains. These techniques could be broadly categorized in two genres, one follows classical manual annotation (Andreevskaia and Bergler, 2006);(Wiebe and Riloff, 2006); (Mohammad et al., 2008) techniques and either proposes various automatic techniques (Tong, 2001). Both types of techniques have few limitations. Manual annotation techniques are undoubtedly trustable but it took long time. Especially high numbers of annotators are needed to overcome one’s senti-mentality. Automatic processes are good but still it demands manual validations. Automatic processes may fail to cover the multiple domains as automatic processes trust on specific corpus.","Literature survey strongly proves that the polarity of sentiment lexicons depend on multiple factors such as: language specific, domain specific, time specific and may be other hidden multiple aspects. Moreover sentiment is a social understanding which we, the human being learn from the society by cognitive interaction day by day. Therefore sentiment is one’s or more  1 http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/ 800 Workshop on Model and Measurement of Meaning than one’s out of context (as prior polarity has no contextuality) psychology regarding any topic or concept.","Therefore involving people is the best way to capture the sentiment of the human society. But as stated earlier human annotators are quite unavailable. Hence we created an online game to attract internet population for the creation of SentiWordNet(s) automatically. Involvement of Internet population is good idea as the population is very high in number and ever growing (approx. 360,985,492) 2",", there are peoples with various languages, cultures, age etc. Therefore Internet population is not biased towards any domain, language or particular society.","The developed online game “Dr Sentiment”, revolutionize the idea of making prior polarity sentiment lexicon for any new language (presently 56) by involving internet population. We compare the coverage and credibility of the generated sentiment lexicons by Dr Sentiment with the generated lexicons by automatic processes involving WordNet, generative approach or by corpus based approaches. As our understanding is only limited to few Indian languages therefore we are only able to evaluate SentiWordNet(s) for Hindi, Bengali and Telugu. May be evaluation for other languages produces different results but we hope the generated SentiWordNet(s) are still useful and could be expanded by other automatic process such as: WordNet, generative approach or by corpus based approaches (Das et al., 2010)."]},{"title":"3 Source Lexicon Acquisition","paragraphs":["SentiWordNet and Subjectivity Word List have been identified as the most reliable source lexicons. A merged sentiment lexicon has been developed from both the resources by removing the duplicates. It has been observed that 64% of the single word entries are common in the Subjectivity Word List and SentiWordNet. The new merged sentiment lexicon consists of 14,135 numbers of tokens. Several filtering techniques have been applied to generate the new list.","A subset of 8,427 sentiment words has been extracted from the English SentiWordNet, by selecting those whose orientation strength is above the heuristically identified threshold of 0.4. The words whose orientation strength is below 0.4 are ambiguous and may lose their subjectivity in the target language after translation. A total of weakly subjective 2652 words are discarded (Rada et al., 2007) from the Subjectivity word list.","In the next stage the words whose POS category in the Subjectivity word list is undefined and tagged as “anypos” are considered. These words may generate sense ambiguity issues in the next stages of subjectivity detection.","Table 1: English SentiWordNet and Subjectivity Word List Statistics","Words SentiWordNet Subjectivity Word List Entries Single Multi Single Multi 115424 79091 5866 990 Unambiguous 20789 30000 4745 963 Ambiguous","Threshold Orientation Strength Subjectivity Strength POS","86944 30000 2652 928"," Some words in the Subjectivity word list are inflected e.g., memories. These words would be stemmed during the translation process, but some words present no subjectivity property after stemming (memory has no subjectivity property). A word may occur in the subjectivity list in many inflected forms. Individual clusters for the words sharing the same root form are created and then checked in the SentiWordNet for validation. If the root word exists in the  2 http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm PACLIC 24 Proceedings 801  SentiWordNet then it is assumed that the word remains subjective after stemming and hence is added to the new list. Otherwise the cluster is completely discarded to avoid any further ambiguities. Various statistics of the English SentiWordNet and Subjectivity Word List are reported in Table 1."]},{"title":"4 Dr Sentiment","paragraphs":["There are several motivations behind developing an intuitive game to automatically create","multilingual SentiWordNet(s). Sentiment lexicon generation from any source language to target","language has several issues or limitations i.e. • Source language word may have no sentiment value in target language (cross language","limitation) • Sentiment score may not be equal to source language • Relative sentiment score is needed rather than absolute score • Language / Culture specific lexicons should be included • Sentiment score should be updated by time","In the history of Information Retrieval research there is a milestone when ESP3","game (Ahn et al., 2004) innovate the concept of a game to automatically label images available in World Wide Web. It has been proven as most reliable strategy to automatically annotate the online images. We are highly motivated by the success of the Image Labeler game and thus proposed an intuitive game to create and validate sentiment lexicons in wide range of 56 languages. Dr Sentiment is an interactive game 4",". Dr Sentiment is a fictitious character, will ask a player a set of simple questions and can reveal his/her sentimental status. This strategy revolutionize over every technique we discussed above. The lexicons tagged by this system are credible as it is tagged by human being moreover all the aspect of limitations has been covered using this strategy. As player can play in their native language so there is no issue of cross language limitations. Different tables are maintained for different languages. Relative sentiment score has been calculated by question type 2 (described in 4.1.2 Section). Language or culture specific words are being captured by question type 3 and 4 (described in 5.4.3 and 5.4.4 sections respectively). It has no limitations as a static sentiment lexicon set as it is updated regularly. Almost 100 players per day are currently playing it throughout the world in different languages.

Player specific separate log has been maintained for tagging. A word previously tagged by a player is avoided by the tracking system for the next time playing as our intension is to tag more and more words involving Internet population.
