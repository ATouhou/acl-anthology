We introduce a method for learning to find the representative syntax-based context of a given collocation/phrase. In our approach, grammatical patterns are extracted for query terms aimed at accelerating lexicographers’ and language learners’ navigation through the word usage and learning process. The method involves automatically lemmatizing, part-of-speech tagging and shallowly parsing the sentences of a large-sized general corpus, and automatically constructing inverted files for quick search. At run-time, contextual grammar patterns are retrieved and presented to users with their corresponding statistical analyses. We present a prototype system, GRASP (grammar- and syntax-based pattern-finder), that applies the method to computer-assisted language learning. Preliminary results show that the extracted patterns not only resemble phrases in grammar books (e.g., make up one’s mind) but help to assist the process of language learning and sentence composition/translation.

For example, Word Sketch Engine (www.sketchengine.co.uk) is a concordancer that automatically summarizes a word’s grammatical and collocational behavior while services such as TANGO","1","and MUST2","provide a means of collocation finding (e.g., verb-noun and adjective-noun collocations) and collocation correcting.","Language-learning tools such as Word Sketch and TANGO typically accept only one querying word and retrieve sentences with it or words it co-occurring probabilistically more frequently than usual. However, learners may attempt to learn the usage of a certain word sense of the query word.","Consider the polysemy “play”. In WordNet, it has a myriad of senses including ‘participating in games or sport’, ‘act or having an effect in a specified way’ and ‘play on an instrument’. Learners may be aware of its senses but intend to acquire more knowledge on the context or usage of the word sense ‘act or having an effect in a specified way’. Suggested by (Yarowsky, 1995), accompanying “play” with its collocate “role” is a good way to narrow down"," 1 candle.fl.nthu.edu.tw/collocation/webform2.aspx 2 candle.fl.nthu.edu.tw/vntango/ PACLIC 24 Proceedings 357  the senses of “play” (and vice versa). Therefore, multi-word query might be as important in language learning. However, the best response to the multi-word query “play role” is probably not an overwhelming set of sentences with it which may be returned by general-purpose concordancers and search engines (e.g., Google). A good response might indicate that the collocation “play role” is frequently followed by the grammatical part-of-speech (PoS) patterns ‘preposition determiner’ (e.g., “in the” and “in this”), ‘preposition noun’ (e.g., “in society” and “in relation”) and ‘preposition gerund’ (e.g., “in determining” and “in shaping”), and preceded by the patterns ‘noun auxiliary_verb’ (e.g., “communication will” and “confidence will”) and ‘adjective noun’ (e.g., “voluntary groups” and “foreign aid”) and that “play” and “role” are usually separated by the grammatical patterns ‘article adjective’ (e.g., “an important” and “a major”), ‘determiner gerund’ (e.g., “the leading” and “the supporting”) and ‘adjective’ (e.g., “significant” and “crucial”). Intuitively, these PoS patterns provide a general idea on how the querying terms are usually used in context. ","Figure 1. An example GRASP response to the query “play role”.","We present a new system, GRASP, that automatically learns to extract representative grammar-based patterns of the querying collocations/phrases. An example GRASP responses to is shown in Figure 1. GRASP has determined the sentences containing the query’s words of a specific underlying corpus (e.g., British National Corpus). GRASP learns these word-to-sentence mappings during corpus preprocessing. We describe the GRASP preprocessing process in more detail in Section 3.","At run-time, GRASP starts with a collocational/phrasal query submitted by language learners (e.g., “play role”). GRASP then identifies the sentences with the words in the query within proximity and retrieves the grammatical patterns commonly occurring before, after, within the query. In our prototype, GRASP returns patterns together with statistical analyses to users directly (see Figure 1); alternatively, the statistics returned by GRASP can be used as reference to automatically extract possible phrases regarding the query words (e.g., “make up one’s mind” concerning the query words “make up” or “make mind”)."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Computer-assisted language learning (CALL) has been an area of active research.

The grammatically-motivated context with statistical analyses is returned as the output of the system. The returned analyses can be examined by human learners or lexicographer directly, or passed on to a phrase extraction model (extracting phrase like “make up one’s mind”). Therefore, our goal is to return a reasonable-sized set of grammatical patterns that, at the same time, highly represent the context of the query phrase. We now formally state the problem that we are addressing.","Problem Statement: We are given a general corpus C (e.g., British National Corpus) that collects articles from a wide range of sources, and a collocation/phrase query Q. Our goal is to extract a set of grammatical patterns from C that are likely to represent the context Q commonly used in. For this, we transform words, w1,..., wm in Q into sets of (word position, sentence record) pairs such that the top N grammatical patterns depicting the query’s context are likely to be quickly retrieved.","In the rest of this section, we describe our solution to this problem. First, we preprocess the large-sized general corpus (Section 3.2). This preprocessing includes lemmatizing, PoS tagging, shallow parsing, and constructing aforementioned (position, sentence) pairs. Finally, we show how GRASP extracts and evaluates grammatical patterns/context at run-time (Section 3.3)."]},{"title":"3.2 Corpus Preprocessing for GRASP","paragraphs":["We attempt to find transformations from words in the query phrase into (position, sentence) pairs expected to accelerate the search for grammatical patterns preceding, following, and separating the query. Our preprocessing process is shown in Figure 2. ","Figure 2. Outline of the GRASP Preprocessing. Lemmatizing and PoS Tagging. In the first stage of the preprocessing (Step (1) in Figure 2), we lemmatize the sentences and generate the most probable PoS tag sequence for each sentence in the general corpus C. For example, the sentence “The British Section refugee office has"," 3 http://candle.fl.nthu.edu.tw/totalrecall/totalrecall/totalrecall.aspx (1) Lemmatize and PoS tag the sentences in C (2) Shallowly parse the sentences in C (3) Construct inverted files for corpus C (4) Output inverted files and phrase pairs PACLIC 24 Proceedings 359  played a leading role in this area of work.” is lemmatized and grammatically tagged as “The/DT British/JJ Section/NN refugee/NN office/NN have/VBZ play/VBN a/DT lead/VBG role/NN in/IN this/DT area/NN of/IN work/NN ./.”. The goal of lemmatization is to reduce the impact of inflectional morphology of words on statistical analyses.","On the other hand, the goal of PoS tagging is to provide a way to group/classify the context/usage of a collocation/phrase. Actually, using PoS tags is quite natural: a myriad of examples of them being used for generalization can be identified in grammar books, such as the “one’s” (i.e., possessive pronoun) in the phrase “make up one’s mind”, the “superlative adjective” (e.g., happiest) in “the most superlative_adjective”, the “oneself” (i.e., reflexive pronoun) in “enjoy oneself very much”, the “NN” (i.e., noun) and “VB” (i.e., base form of verb) in “insist/suggest/recommend/demand/propose that NN VB” and so on. Shallow Parsing. In the second stage of the preprocessing process (Step (2) in Figure \\2), we generate the shallow parsing result for each sentence. The input to this stage is a set of sentences (likely with PoS tag sequences) while the output of this stage is a set of parsing results of base phrases such as noun phrases, verb phrases, and prepositional phrases. Shallow parsin\\g is also aimed to generalize the query’s context. Constructing Inverted Files. In the third and final stage of preprocessing, we build up inverted files for the lemmas in the corpus C. It is one thing to answer to which lemmas occur in the sentences but it is another to answer to in which sentences and positions a lemma appears. While the former is quite straightforward, the latter is not and an opposite case of the former, thus the term “inverted”.","For each lemma in C, we record the positions and sentences it occurs for run-time search. We also keep track of its corresponding surface word form, PoS tag and shallow parsing result for reference in that they are useful in grammatical pattern finding and language learning. The lemmas’ inverted files are targeted at short response time and quick search."]},{"title":"3.3 Run-Time Grammatical Pattern Finding","paragraphs":["Once the word-to-sentence mappings, or inverted files, and PoS tagging and shallow parsing results are obtained, GRASP retrieves and evaluates the grammar-based context of the search phrase using the procedure in Figure 3.","In Step (1) of the algorithm we initialize a set, interInvList, to collect the intersected inverted lists of the lemmas in the collocation/phrase query. For each lemma wi in query, we first obtain its inverted file, InvList (Step (2)) and then perform an AND/intersection operation on interInvList from previous iteration and InvList (from Step (3a) to (3j)4",").","The AND operation is defined as follows. Firstly, we enumerate the inverted lists, interInvList and InvList (Step (3b)) after the initialization of their respective indices (i.e., i and j) and resulting list newInterInvList (Step (3a)). Secondly, we incorporate new instance into newInterInvList (Step (3e)) if the sentence records of the elements of interInvList and InvList in question are the same (Step (3c)) and the distance between the word positions of these elements are within proximity (Step (3d)). Otherwise, the indices (i.e., i and j) to the lists are moved accordingly (from Step (3f) to (3i)). Note that, in Step (3e), an instance of (word position, sentence record) is created based on interInvList[i] and InvList[j]. For example, if interInvList[i] is (4,90) and InvList[j] is (7,90), the newly-created instance is ([4,7],90) indicating the have-already-been-examined lemmas in the search phrase appear in the positions of 4 and 7 of the sentence number 90. Furthermore, to cover more context of the search phrase, function withinProximity of Step (3d) considers the absolute difference between word positions. Subsequently, the query words may not appear in order in the patterns. For instance, GRASP would also find the pattern “DT JJ+role+TO+play” (e.g., a vital role to play) for the query “play role”. On the other hand, since query may contain more than two words (e.g., “in order to” and “as a matter of fact”), interInvList[i].wordPosi may be a list of word positions of lemmas"," 4 These steps only hold for sorted inverted files. 360 Poster Papers already seen. In our prototype, the distance between interInvList[i].wordPosi and InvList[j].wordPosi is defined as the absolute value of the smallest difference between InvList[j].wordPosi and word position in interInvList[i].wordPosi. Alternatively, it may be defined as the farthest. Finally, we set interInvList to be newInterInvList for the next iteration of the AND operation.","Figure 3. Evaluating Patterns at Run-Time.","In Step (5) for all the legitimate sentence records, the query’s lemmas along with their context words’ PoS tags and shallow parsing results are identified and extracted from sentences. Such information is gathered to express the context of the search phrase in a syntax-based manner: querying words are shown in lemmas and the context in PoS tags (e.g., “play+DT JJ+role”). With the intuition that more frequent the patterns, more representative they are, we rank patterns according to their occurrences in PatternCol (Step (6)).","At last, we return the top N frequent grammar patterns preceding, following, and separating the query phrase. These patterns are aimed for learners’ and lexicographers’ quick grasp on and navigation through the usage of collocational/phrasal query. Aside from grammatical patterns, GRASP also displays some of the patterns’ characteristic examples for users to better understand the contextual words to choose. The retrieved patterns and examples of a query “play role” are shown in Figure 1. For simplicity, Figure 1 does not include the patterns with reverse word order of “play role”, such as “DT JJ+role+TO+play”, “DT VBG+role+TO+play” and etc."]},{"title":"4 Preliminary Results","paragraphs":["GRASP was designed to retrieve grammatical patterns from a large-scale monolingual corpus that are likely to impose a grammatically-motivated thesaurus structure on the context of a given collocation/phrase in the same language as the monolingual corpus.

Also, GRASP pointed out that if “play” and “role” are to appear in reverse order in context, they would often be preceded by “DT JJ” (e.g., “a vital”), followed by “IN DT” (e.g., “in the”), and separated by “TO” (e.g., “to”), implying a common pattern to include the inverted “play role” is “DT JJ+role+TO+play+IN DT” (e.g., “a key role to play in the”).","For queries “have impact”, “exert influence” and “in order for”, GRASP retrieved the worth-learning syntax-based patterns “have+DT JJ+impact+IN NNS” (e.g., “have a profound impact on people”), “exert+DT JJ+influence+IN DT” (e.g., “exert a significant influence on the”) and “in order for+PRP TO” (e.g., “in order for us to”), respectively. For the query “make up”, four frequently used phrases/patterns were extracted: “make up+PRP$ NN” (e.g., “make up his mind”), “make up+IN DT” (e.g., “make up for the”), “NNS WDT+make up” (e.g., “groups that make up”) and passive “make up+IN NNS” (e.g., “made up of representatives”).
