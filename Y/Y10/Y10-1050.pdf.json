The so-called serial verb construction (SVC) is a complex predicate structure consisting of two or more verbal heads but denotes one single event. This paper first discusses the grammatical properties of Korean SVCs and provides a lexicalist, construction-based analysis couched upon a typed-feature structure grammar. We also show the results of implementing the grammar in the LKB (Linguistics Knowledge Building) system couched upon the existing the KRG (Korean Resource Grammar) which has been developed since 2003. The implementation results provides us with a feasible direction of expanding the analysis to cover a wider range of relevant data.

Mia-ka hakkyo-ey kel-e ka-ss-ta Mia-NOM school-to walk-COMP go-PAST-DECL ‘Mia walked to school.’","b. Mia-ka cwul-ul cap-a tangki-ess-ta Mia-NOM rope-ACC draw-COMP pull-PAST-DECL ‘Mia pulled a rope, drawing it.’ Both sentences here, though including two serial verbs with their own predicate relations, semantically represent only a single event. These sentences display the canonical grammatical properties of SVCs in that the two successive verbs behave like a complex predicate, sharing one tense and subject value, and even the object value as in (1b).","The generation of Korean SVCs is quite flexible as attested by the corpus examples of the verb mek-ta ‘eat’:","(2) nanwu-e mek-ta ‘divide and eat’, kkulhi-e mek-ta ‘boil and eat’, mandul-e mek-ta ‘make and eat’, cap-a mek-ta ‘catch and eat’, cip-e mek-ta ‘pick up and eat’, ssip-e mek-ta ‘chew and eat’, kwu-e mek-ta ‘broil and eat’, ppal-a mek-ta ‘suck and eat’, etc. The examples, extracted from the Sejong POS-tagged Corpus, show us that the activity verb mek-ta ‘eat’ can combine with various types of verbs, forming an SVC.1 ⋆ Many thanks go to anonymous reviewers for helpful comments. Main theoretical aspects sketched here follow those in Kim (2010). 1 The Sejong Corpus, released by the National Institute of the Korean Language, is a balanced corpus consisting of about 12 million words with 311,048 sentences. PACLIC 24 Proceedings 439","In this paper, we try to explore the syntactic and semantic properties of the Korean SVCs and build a computationally feasible analysis that can parse the desired set of examples. We then test the analysis with implementing it in the LKB (Linguistic Knowledge Building) System within the preexisting computational grammar, KRG (Korean Resource Grammar)."]},{"title":"2 Grammatical Properties of the SVCs 2.1 Syntactic Headedness and Types of the SVC","paragraphs":["As noted, one main property of the Korean SVCs is that each SVC sentence has only one tense, aspect, and mood value realized on the final verb. The appearance of this value on the first verb is thus not licensed:","(3) a. Mia-ka sayngsen-ul kwu-(*ess)-e mek-ess-ta Mia-NOM fish-ACC roast-PAST-COMP eat-PAST-DECL ‘Mia roasted fish and ate it.’","b. Mia-ka ttwi-(*ess)-e ka-ss-ta Mia-NOM run-PAST-DECL go-PAST-DECL ‘Mia left, running.’ Honorification information, which canonically surfaces in the subject and verb together as an agreement in the language, also appears on the final verb:","(4) sensayng-nim-kkeyse John-ul tolli-(*si)-e ponay-si-ess-ta teacher-HON-NOM Chelswu-ACC turn-HON-COMP send-HON-PAST-DECL ‘The teacher sent Chelswu back.’ These facts support the idea that the final verb functions as the syntactic head.","The following question is then what kind of verbs can be combined in the SVC. For this purpose, we have performed a corpus search and extracted VV sequence verbs from the Sejong POS-tagged Corpus. Depending on the transitivity of the two verbs (intransitive, transitive, and ditran-sitive), we classified the extracted VV (called V1 and V2) sequence instances as following:2 (5) Frequency of VV Sequences by Transitivity V1 V2 # of type # of token percentage examples intran intran 3,566 14,658 32.07% kel-e kata ‘go on foot’ intran tran 1,794 5,217 11.41% ttwi-e nem-ta ‘jump over’ intran ditran 86 180 0.39% nayli-e pat-ta ‘download’ tran intran 2,501 9,651 21.11% cip-e ka-ta ‘pick up and go’ tran tran 3,902 14,499 31.72% cap-a tangki-ta ‘catch and pull’ tran ditran 142 359 0.79% cip-e cwu-ta ‘pick up and give’ ditran intran 82 350 0.77% ponay-e o-ta ‘send to me’ ditran tran 127 756 1.65% pat-a mekta ‘receive’ ditran ditran 6 43 0.09% pat-a kalochay-ta ‘usurp’","sum 12,206 45,713 100.00% The table shows us that the most frequent (or natural) combinations are between transitive and intransitive verbs, for example, intransitive + intransitive/transitive or transitive + transitive/intransitive verb combinations, covering almost 95%. The corpus search has shown that since the SVCs describe an event or process, rather than a state, we observe that stative (or adjectival) 2 There are more than three verb types in terms of argumenthood, but for simplicity, we introduce only these three types. 2 440 Poster Papers verbs do not appear in the constructions. After checking the grammatical properties of these sequences, we have first build an analysis that can capture these and then implemented it in the LKB system.3"]},{"title":"2.2 Argument Sharing and Composition","paragraphs":["One main characteristic of the SVCs is that the succession of multiple verbs behaves like a complex predicate with mono-clausal properties. Korean SVCs are not exception. For example, we can observe that only one subject or one object is required though there are more than one verb:","(6) a. Mia-ka (*Chelswu-ka) hakkyo-ey kel-e ka-ss-ta Mia-NOM Chelswu-NOM school-to walk-COMP go-PAST-DECL ‘(int.) Mia walked to school.’","b. Mia-ka (*koki-lul) sayngsen-ul kwuw-e mek-ess-ta Mia-NOM meat-ACC fish-ACC roast-COMP eat-PAST-DECL ‘(int) Mia roasted fish and ate it.’ When both verbs are transitive, they share the object as illustrated in (7a). The object in the SVC can also be linked only to one of the two verbs. In (7b), the object Mia is the argument of the first verb chac-a only, whereas the locative argument hakkyo-ey is selected only by the final verb ‘go’.","(7) a. Mia-ka lopu-lul kkul-e tangki-ess-ta Mia-NOM rope-ACC draw-COMP pull-PAST-DECL ‘Mia pulled a rope, drawing it.’","b. Chelswu-ka hakkyo-ey Mia-lul chac-a ka-ass-ta. Chelswu-NOM school-to Mia-ACC look.for-COMP go-Past-Decl ‘Chelswu went to school to look for Mia.’ Unlike (7b), the object can be selected by the final verb too:","(8) a. Mia-ka kang-ul hyeemchi-e kenne-ess-ta Mia-NOM river-ACC swim-COMP cross-PAST-DECL ’Mia crossed the river, swimming.’","b. Mia-ka Chelswu-lul toli-e ponay-ess-ta. Mia-NOM Chelswu-ACC turn-COMP send-PAST-DECL ’Mia sent Chelswu back.’ In the examples (8) here, it is the final verb that selects the object kang-ul ‘river-ACC’ and Chelswu-lul ‘Chelswu-ACC’, respectively. It is also possible that the complement(s) in the SVC is selected only by one of the verbs:","(9) a. Mia-ka hakkyo-ey kel-e ka-ass-ta. Mia-NOM school-to walk-COMP go-PAST-DECL ’Mia went to school, walking.’","b. Mia-ka Chelswu-lul ccoch-a ka-ass-ta. Mia-NOM Chelswu-ACC follow-COMP go-PAST-DECL ’Mia went (somewhere), chasing Chelswu.’","In (9a), the locative complement is selected by the second one whereas in (9b) the accusative","object is selected by the first one. 3 For this experimental study, we have made a random selection of 100 sentences whose number of words are less than 10 and tried to see how the present analysis can parse these. Of these total 45,713 tokens, we have first made a random selection of 10,000 and removed non-serial verb instances and again extracted 100 sentences for the test. 3 PACLIC 24 Proceedings 441"]},{"title":"3 A Computational Treatment: Typed-feature Structure Approach","paragraphs":["The Korean Resource Grammar (KRG) has been developed since 2003, aiming at building a computationally feasible grammar with a comprehensive coverage (see Kim and Yang 2004). In the grammar, all the linguistic expressions are types of sign which in turn has lex-sign (lexical sign) and syn-sign (syntactic sign) as its subtypes. Following traditional Korean grammar, the KRG takes the basic lexical categories of the grammar (lex-sign) to include verbal, nominal, adverbial, and adnominal as its subtypes which again are subclassified according to their properties. The verbal category includes verbs and adjectives.","As for the combination of the sequence of such lexical expressions to form a bigger constituent, the KRG posits a small set of well-formed syntactic combination rules such as Head-Subject Rule (XP → ZP X′","), Head-Complement Rule (X → YP X), and Head-Modifier Rule (XP → Mod, XP) as given in the following:","(10) a. Head-Subject Rule:","XP[hd-subj-cx] → 1 , H[","SUBJ ⟨ 1 ⟩]","b. Head-Complement Rule: XP[hd-comp-cx] → 1 , H[ COMPS ⟨..., 1 , ...⟩]","c. Head-Modifier Rule: XP[hd-mod-cx] → [ MOD ⟨ 1 ⟩]",", 1 H These simple rules can license major phrasal constructions in the language. The Head-Subject Rule, generating a hd-subj-cx, allows a VP to combine with its subject. The Head-Complement Rule ensures a head to combine with one of its COMPS (complements) elements, forming a hdcomp-cx. The Head-Modifier Rule allows a head to form a well-formed phrase with an adverbial element that modifies the head, resulting in hd-mod-cx.4","In addition to these basic grammar rules, the KRG assume the following grammar rule to license the combination of two lexical expressions:","(11) Head-Lexical-Cx:[","hd-lex-cx]","→ [ LEX +]",", H[ LEX +] This grammar rule basically licenses the combination of two verbs as in the following:","(12) a. [[cal] [mek-ta]] (Adv + V) well eat-DECL(‘eat well’)","b. [[mek-ko] [siph-ta]] (Main V + Aux) eat-COMP would.like-DECL(‘would like to eat’)","c. [[cap-a] [tangki-ta]] (V + V) catch-COMP pull-DECL(‘catch and pull’) In (12a), the lexical adverb occurring only with a verb (not a VP) combines with the main verb whereas in (12b), the main verb forms a complex predicate with the auxiliary verb. (12c) is a SVC where two lexical verbs are combined.","In dealing with the generation of SVCs, another thing to note is that the verbs participating in the SVC are non-stative (activity) verbs. This constraint applies to both verbs in the SVC:","(13) a. *cap-a ppalu-ta/*ppalu-a mek-ess-ta catch-COMP fast-DECL/fast-COMP eat-PAST-DECL","b. *kel-e apu-ta/*himtul-e ka-ass-ta walk-COMP sick-decl/difficult-COMP go-PAST-DECL 4 Note that the grammar rules here place no restriction on the SUBJ value: this allows the head to combine with the subject before combining with a complement. One great advantage of this is to allow sentential internal scrambling with no further operation or mechanism. See Kim and Yang 2004 for details.","4 442 Poster Papers","c. *ccoch-a apu-ta/*apu-a nay-ss-ta chase-COMP sick-DECL/sick-COMP take.out-PAST-DECL","The properties of the Korean SVCs we have seen, we assume, are reflections of the constructional properties (cf. Ginzberg and Sag 2001, Sag et al. 2003). That is, the Korean grammar introduces the SVC construction whose general constraint is given in the following (cf. Chung and Kim 2008):5","(14) Head-SVC:         hd-svc C-CONT       IND e0 RELS 〈  PRED svc-rel ARG1 e1 ARG2 e2    〉                →   nonstative-v VFORM (a/e)se IND e1   , H [ nonstative-v IND e2 ] The constructional declaration on the head serial verb construction (hd-svc) specifies that two nonstative verbs are combined with the first carrying the a/e VFORM value. Each of these two denotes its own event e1 and e2, and these two events are in the semantic relation svc-rel which includes the semantic relations such as a temporally-precedence (for SSVC) or overlap, manner or direction-relation. At this stage, the rule does not tease out all these three different ways of meaning composition in a formal way: we just assume that the semantic relation in the SVCs is constructionally-related as represented with the C-CONT (constructional meaning).6","As we have noted so far, the Korean SVCs allow the argument composition: the subject and object are shared while all the remaining arguments are composed together. To formalize this argument composition, we differentiate object-sharing cases from the other general SVCs cases, assuming two different SVCs.7","Consider the general cases with no object sharing first:","(15) Head-Gen-SVC:[","hd-gen-svc","COMPS A ⊕ B ] → [ nonstative-v COMPS A ] , H [ nonstative-v COMPS B ] This constructional declaration means that a nonstative verb will combine with a preceding nonstative main verb, forming a head-gen-svc.

That is, given the two nonstative verbs as input, the lexicon generates a serial verb compound with an idiomatic meaning. See Hashimoto and Bond (2005) for similar Japanese examples. 6 Representing this svc-rel in a finer and more precise way is thus our future project. 7 The main reason for positing these two subconstructions has to do with computational ones: we have found there is no clear formal way of representing object sharing cases together.","5 PACLIC 24 Proceedings 443 This assumption will basically license the combination of two nonstative verbs with different argument structure values as illustrated in the above structure for the sentence (8). In the SVC sentence, meaning ‘(Chelswu) went to school to look for Mia’, the two verbs ‘look-for’ and ‘go’ will combine first.8","This resulting complex predicate will combine with the two arguments Mia-lul and hakkyo-ey. This is possible from the argument composition in accordance with the Head-Gen-SVC rule. That is, the rule allows us to compose the argument ‘school-at’ selected by the second verb ‘go’ with the object ‘Mia’ selected by the first verb ‘look.for’. Note that this argument process is not a lexical one, but licensed by the constructional constraint.9","In addition to this general case, as we have seen, there are cases where the two verbs in the SVC share their object. We separate this kind of SVC case from the general cases with the following constructional constraint:10","(17) Head-Obj-SVC: [ hd-obj-svc COMPS ⟨ 2 ⟩ ⊕ A ⊕ B ] → 1[ COMPS ⟨ 2 [GCASE acc]⟩ ⊕ A ] , H [ nonstative-v COMPS ⟨ 2 [GCASE acc]⟩ ⊕ B ] This rule refers to the GCASE (grammatical case) whose value is acc. That is, when both verbs in the SVC select an object whose structural case value is acc, the combination of these two verbs will then share this object ( 2 ) while the remaining complements are composed. This will then allow a structure like the following for (1b): (18) S","iiiiiiiiiiii \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\","1 NP"," ,,,,,,,,,,","VP[ SUBJ ⟨ 1 ⟩ COMPS ⟨ ⟩ ]","qqqqqqqqqqqqq \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\","Mia-NOM 2 NP  ,,,,,,,,,, V′      hd-obj-svc HEAD verb SUBJ ⟨ 1 ⟩ COMPS ⟨ 2 ⟩      bbbbbbbbbbb \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ rope-ACC","V[ SUBJ ⟨ 1 ⟩ COMPS ⟨ 2 ⟩","] V[ SUBJ ⟨ 1 ⟩ COMPS ⟨ 2 ⟩ ] draw-COMP pull-PAST-DECL In the sentence, meaning ‘Mia pulled a rope, drawing it’, the head serial verb tangki-ta ‘draw’ now shares its object with the preceding verb cap-a ‘catch’.

To check the computational feasibility of the analysis, we have implemented the analysis into the LKB (Linguistic Knowledge Building) system.11 As the first step we selected 100 test suite sentences. The test results give us the proper syntactic as well as semantic structures for Korean serial verb constructions. For example, the following two figures are sample results of parsing the two main SVC sentences. Figure 1: Parsed Tree and MRS for the phrasal comparative Mary went to school, looking for Chelswu. Figure 2: Parsed Tree and MRS for the phrasal comparative Mary caught the bag and pull it.","Figure 1 represents a general SVC where all the arguments are composed whereas Figure 2 is the object sharing case. The small boxes in both the figures indicate parsed tree structures whereas the big boxes denote the semantic representations. In both small boxes, the grammar licenses binary structures in which two serial verbs are combined and then the resulting phrase combines one argument in turn. The big boxes represent semantics. We can notice here that the MRS the","11 The current Korean Resource Grammar, version 2.0, as of June 2010, has 659 lexical types and 114 phrasal types, 99 grammar rules, 304 inflectional rules, 39,688 lexical entries, and 1198 test-suite sentences, and 77% successful parsing rates. 7 PACLIC 24 Proceedings 445 grammar generates provides enriched information of the phrase.12","The value of LTOP is the local top handle, the handle of the relation with the widest scope within the constituent. The attribute RELS is basically a bag of elementary predications (EP) each of whose value is a relation. The attribute HCONS is to represent quantificational information (see ?). Each of the types relation has at least three features LBL, PRED (represented here as a type), and ARG0. For the proper noun English and Korean, each has two related EPs: named rel and proper q rel.","As noted earlier, the meaning of the SVC construction is added as a construction constraint, represented as svc rel. The constructional-added relation, as noted, is inferred from the world knowledge or lexical properties. In terms of computational implementation, there still are more issues for our analysis to be resolved. However, we can observe that the grammar implemented in the LKB system appears to be feasible enough to extend to more complex data in a process of building a comprehensive KRG."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Bender, Emily M. and Dan Flickinger and Stephan Oepen. 2002.
