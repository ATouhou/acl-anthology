In this paper we define a lexical metrology in graphs of verbal synonymy to compute the flexsemic score of speakers from their verbal productions in action denomination tasks.

Our research combine two sides: a psychological side and a computational side. In a recent work (Gaume et al., 2008) we showed that the psychological results on verbal lexicon acquisition fit our computational model of the semantic organization of the verbal lexicon. Based on these results, we propose here to use our computational model to build a measurement of the lexical acquisition useful to categorize the healthy young children vs. healthy adults.","The first part of this paper presents the Approx protocol, the data collected in French and Mandarin and the first psychological results about verbal lexicon acquisition. Then, the second part accounts for the computational model and describes three preliminary measurements useful in our categorization while the next section describes how to assign a “flexsemic” score to a participant. Then, the way we used this score for the categorization task and the results analysis are exposed. This paper ends with a short presentation of the web platform Flexsem usable to build online categorizations."]},{"title":"2 Approx protocol 2.1 General overview","paragraphs":["In order to compare the lexical acquisition of verbs in French and Mandarin, we used the Approx protocol initially built to study the production of verbal approximations and the hierarchical dimension of the lexicon in normal and pathological development (Duvignau et al., 2005; Gaume et al., 2008). The material of this protocol consists in 17 speechless action-movies divided as in Table 1 into 3 action concepts: TO DETERIORATE, TO REMOVE, TO SEPARATE","In each movie, a woman alters an object from an initial state to a final state with the help of her hands or with an instrument. ⋆","The research presented in this paper is supported by the ANR-NSC (France-Taiwan) bilateral project M3 (Modeling","and Measurement of Meaning).

After showing the video, the experimenter asked the children what the woman had done. Between each action movie, a distractor (i.e. popular cartoon characters in Mandarin Team) was shown to the children to avoid perseveration effects. Children who didn’t finish watching the 17 movies were discarded. Verbs extractions Verbal forms that denominate the action were extracted from each elicited response and were lemmatized. When a verbal form was compound, it was split, depending on its components, into: • simple verb + complement (e.g. to break into pieces → to break + into pieces) • simple verb + simple verb (e.g. to make broken → to make + to break)","• simple verb + result when the verb is a mandarin resultative compound verb (Thompson, 1973; Lu, 1977; Gu, 1992; Cheng and Huang, 1994; Gao, 1997) (it is not useful in French)","Like this, the verbal forms recorded in French and Mandarin were built in the same way, and so, one can compare the analyses of the verbal productions between the two languages."]},{"title":"2.4 First psycholinguistic results","paragraphs":["A first study, based on the Approx data, has been done in French to compare the verbal productions of the healthy 2-4 years old children and the adults who have stabilized their lexicon structure. The verbal productions were compared on two criterion:","• the verbs’ genericity to discriminate, in front of the denominated action, the specific verbs (e.g. to saw / SAWING A PLANK OF WOOD) from the generic verbs (e.g. to cut / SAWING A PLANK OF WOOD); 810 Workshop on Model and Measurement of Meaning","• the verbs’ conventionnality to discriminate the conventional verbs that belong to the semantic field of the action and fit the action (e.g.to peel / PEELING A BANANA), the intra-domain approximations that belong to the semantic field but not well fit the action (e.g. to cut / PEELING A BANANA) and the inter-domain approximations that are out of the semantic field of the action but convey the action’s concept (e.g. to undress / PEELING A BANANA convey the concept /TO REMOVE/). All the data analyses come from the agreement of two french linguists. The results confirm that 2-4 years old children produce more approximations than adults (Ta-","ble 1).

It contains about 70000 lexical items under 12 broad semantic classes marked from A to L. These broad classes are further divided into 94 subclasses, and 1,428 heads.
