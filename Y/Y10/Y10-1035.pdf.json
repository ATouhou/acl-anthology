This paper presents an event semantics-based investigation of Japanese complex predicates of the form V1+V2, to clarify their syntactic and semantic constitution. The Japanese V1+V2 formation primarily exploits the aspectual modification of a core event; of particular interest here are complex predicates composed of intentional active verbs with te-form + the existential verb a-ru; this complex pattern is known to be ambiguous between what is usually termed a ‘resultative’ and a ‘preparative’ reading. One major problem of the “V-te-a-ru” construction is retrieving the semantic relation linking their components, which is (partially) implicit on the surface. To date, no uniform analysis has been developed to formally account for these facts. The main goal of this study was to develop a uniform analysis of their meaning representations, using Davidson’s (1967) event semantics as a reference model. Basic data revealed some interesting findings, indicating some asymmetry in event structure. This could help identify the semantic relations of components and clarify the semantic representation of a given syntactic paradigm.","","Keywords: event structure, complex predicate, Japanese, experiencer-agent alternation."," ","1. Introduction","","When children acquire the meaning of a verb, they understand the possible state or event it describes. However, many verbs also come with arguments. Do we know what arguments a verb accepts when we understand the verb’s meaning? It is still not clear how arguments are matched with the right kind of verbs; neither are the possible repercussions from theories about argument structured. Clarification of these issues will require thinking about the meanings of verbs in non-traditional ways. For example, verb denotations might not carry all the information about a verb’s argument structure.","This study investigated Japanese complex predicates of the kind “V-te-a-ru”, composed of an intentional active verb2","in te-form3","and an existential verb aru, which is taken to be either a  1 This work was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) (21520403). 2 The term “intentional active verbs” refers to verbs that have a control relation with their argument. These may primarily involve transitive verbs, but (unergative) intransitive verbs too. A sentence that includes the intentional verb read in (i) can be paraphrased by (ii).","(i) John read a book.","(ii) What John did is to read a book. In contrast, “non-intentional active verbs” can not co-occur with “V-te-a-ru”as in (iii): PACLIC 24 Proceedings 311 resultative or preparative predicate (this distinction has been discussed previously by Japanese linguists with regard to agentive argument realization: see, e.g., Masuoka, 1987 and Kinsui, 2009, among others, but these scholars have not provided an appropriate description of the event or argument structures of “V-te-a-ru” constructions). Intuitively, intentional verbs appear to specify as part of their meaning an action carried out by an implicit agent, while the existential verb a-ru specifies the ‘coming about’ of a result state. They instantiate well-formed complex patterns, which are not totally predictable with regard to regular syntactic constructions, or are ambiguous between what is usually termed a ‘resultative’ and a ‘preparative’ reading. One major difficulty in dealing with “V-te-a-ru” constructions is retrieving the semantic relation linking their components. For example, an agent is logically implicated but not explicitly realized in such instances. Further, an argument, which can be realized as an agent in causing a sub-event, can be construed as an experiencer of a “resultative” or a “preparative” state.","The claim is, thus, that some sort of semantic information about the relationship between the elements is required to provide an adequate characterization of the meaning production process. Here, Davidson (1967)’s event semantics was applied and extended event semantics (Parsons, 1990; Larson and Segal, 1995) as reference models, among others. The main objective was to develop a formal analysis to identify semantic relationships between the elements and to clarify the uniform representations of given syntactic paradigms. The following section provides a brief description of the data.",""]},{"title":"2. Ambiguity in “V-te-a-ru” Constructions ","paragraphs":["In general, complex predicates are expressions with strong lexical-like behavior, the","interpretation of which can be (at least partially) compositional in the sense that it relies heavily","on the particular semantic relation between the component elements.

In example (3), the “si-te” do type intentional active verb applies both to “zyuken-benkyoo” examination-study qua direct object and “I” (=speaker) qua implicit subject-agent, although the “a-ru” type state verb is the head of “si-te-a-ru”. Thus, in these cases, no agent is explicit on the surface. However, in example (4), “ne-te,” sleep. applies to “boku,” I (= speaker), qua topic-agent and qua experiencer, and these are stipulated overtly.","Logically, at least two different kinds of diagnoses could be used to explain the ambiguity found in “V-te-a-ru” constructions. First, intentional active verbs could be the source of semantic complexity; in other words, it is the classes of verbs that ultimately yield the ambiguous result. In example (2), “ake-te,” open, is a change-of-state verb and denotes a causative event that brings about a change in the entity acted upon (i.e., window). In contrast, in examples (3) and (4), (benkyoo) “si-te,” do study/study, and “ne-te,” sleep, are non-causative verbs and denote an activity to be aspectually atelic. This difference is reflected in their readings (i.e., the existence of a resultative state or the duration of a preparative effect). This kind of analysis might rest on the assumption that these sentences contain some hidden agents that are revealed in combination with the intentional active verbs. This kind of analysis occurs throughout Japanese linguistic literature, and can be termed “argument-descriptive-analysis” (A-analysis). Alternatively, “V-te-a-ru” constructions could be considered descriptions of events, and the source of ambiguity could be ascribed to the event-structures that yield the different semantic relation linking their components; this can be termed “event-descriptive-analysis” (E-analysis).",""]},{"title":"3.

Event Semantics ","paragraphs":["Davidson (1967) pointed out the theoretical importance of events and states to the semantics of verbs. Parsons (1990) later presented an event semantics in which English sentences were analyzed as containing existential quantification over eventualities; agent and theme arguments were also introduced by independent predicates. In this model, verbs describe events or states and arguments are associated with their verbs via secondary predicates that denote general thematic relationships, like “agent-of\"’ “theme-of”, etc. Thus, action verbs, such as sing and dance, are relational, containing an extra argument place for an event e, as shown in examples (14a ,b) and example (15) can be rendered as shown in example (15’).

This is called the “neo-Davidsonian method.” Parsons (1990) also tried to capture the dichotomy between events and states using two predicates: “Cul” and “Hold.” With regard to ∃e, the standard view is that every sentence has an event quantifier, either overt or tacit.",""]},{"title":"5. Event Structures of “V-te-a-ru” Constructions ","paragraphs":["This section investigates how the two types of “V-te-a-ru” constructions, shown in examples","(2) and (3) /(4), can be represented using a neo-Davidsonian framework.  5.1 “Resultative” Reading Types  Example (2) makes a statement about the existence of a subject: an open window; as a whole,","the example denotes non-delimited eventuality. Remember that even if example (2) indicates","some implicit agents, the agents cannot be overtly expressed: they are excluded from subject","positions, as shown in (9a). For “ake-te-a-ru” open and exist, we can extend the logical","representation of secondary predicate construction (Larson and Segal, 1995) to represent the","semantic relation between “ake-te” open and “a-ru” exist: they are united by being co-predicated","on a common entity “mado,” window. Here, we note that the causing sub-event temporally","precedes the result sub-event. Therefore, it is natural that the event structure of “V-te-a-ru”","constructions requires the temporal restriction between the two sub-events. Thus, example (2) can","be expressed as example (16), where (“e < e’ means that e precedes e’):  (2) Mado-ga ake-te-a-ru.","Window-NOM open-and-exist-PRESENT (The window is open (for some purpose/) ) (16)∃e, e’ [[Open (e) & Theme (window, e) & Cul (e)] & [Exist (e’) & Theme (window, e’) &","Hold (e’)]] & e < e’]  The truth conditions of example (2) require an event of opening, whose agent is not given, whose theme is a window, and an existence of an (open) window, but no further relationship between the event and the state is mandated. Thus, beyond sharing the common entity “mado,” window, the culmination of an event and the holding of an actual state need to be linked by relativizing them to time. (16) says that an actual state or existence of an (open) window must be obtained after an event of opening occurs. ","5.2 “Preparative” Reading Types"," Regarding examples (3) and (4), “V-te-a-ru” also expresses an eventuality to be aspectually atelic. However, they have one significant peculiarity: it can take the topic qua experiencer in the experiential sub-event. Thus, as shown in the above section, at the semantic level, the experiencer (which can be considered the topic) is also an agent causing the sub-event: the agentive process of sleeping causes the experiencer to enter an actual physical state. In other words, example (9c) has PACLIC 24 Proceedings 319","two sub-events, which share the common individual “boku” I. Therefore, the truth conditions in","example (9c) require an event of a sleep in which “boku” I is the agent and a state of holding an","actual physical state in which “boku” I is the experiencer. Then, example (9c) can be expressed as","in (17):  (9) c. {Boku –wa/Boku-tati-de} zyuubun-ni ne-te-a-ru.","I-TOP/We-DAT sufficiently sleep-and-exist-PRESENT","(I /We have slept sufficiently.) (17)∃e, e’ [[Sleep (e) & Agent (I, e) & Cul (e) ] & [Good condition (e’) & Experiencer (I, e’)","& Hold (e’)]] & e < e’]  Here too, we must note that the causing sub-event temporally precedes the resulting sub-event. Therefore, the temporal order of the two sub-events is restricted: the agentive process causes the experiencer to maintain an actual physical state. Thus, (17) basically refers to an event template that is similar to (16) with the exception of the EXP-agent alternation, which is crucial to reconstruct the causing sub-event into an experiential sub-event.
