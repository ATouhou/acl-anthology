This paper presents an analysis of the language of patents, as a contribution to the field of English for Specific Purposes (ESP). While there work appears to fill a niche in the ESP field (and particularly in the English for Occupational Legal Purposes), the present study insists that statistical approach is necessary for compiling patent technical word list for ESP. Since research studies on word associations of patent lexis have been relatively scarce, this paper reports the technique to select appropriate words from high frequency words is required for modern patent language. The research content and statistical investigations building up a patent technical word list which helps learners of modern patent language expand the vocabulary size for a better understanding of patent writing. Keywords: English for Specific Purposes, intellectual property rights, corpus linguistics, lexical semantics, patent",""," The authors would like to thank Dr. Wen-Gin Yang, National Taiwan Normal University, and Dr. Pi-Ching Chen, National Cheng Kung University, for commenting on the previous version of this work.

Especially to the knowledge industry, the IPR is the key measure of a company competing with others.","The area of IPR includes patent law, copyright law, trademark law and trade secret law, together with some aspects of other branches of the law, such as licensing and unfair competition (American Bar Association, 2010). Besides, intellectual property lawyers are required interdisciplinary knowledge as new development in law generate needs for lawyers with specific backgrounds—patent law, technology law, business law, and economy law. The fact that even when the global markets have been affected by economic recession in the end of 2007, the demand for intellectual property lawyers remains unusually high (World Intellectual Property Organization, 2009) is worth mentioning. As long as novel inventions were created, there is a need for intellectual property law to be enforced to protect human rights and their invisible property for specific purposes.","As globalization has resulted in greater economic growth rapidly, inevitably the challenges of interdisciplinary communication that concerned with intellectual property and other significant sector encounters has increased. This recognition of the importance has brought intellectual property to the limelight. Resulting from such recognition, the recent emphasis that has been placed on using English as the lingua franca to apply patents on an international level and the PACLIC 24 Proceedings 417   application of technical vocabulary for the writing of professional patents becomes an essential issue in applied linguistic research."]},{"title":"2 English for Specific Purposes (ESP)","paragraphs":["ESP is now well established as an important and distinct part of English Teaching (Cheng, Sin, & Li, 2008). As English has acquired the status of lingua franca in almost any field of research, the teaching of ESP has generally been seen as a separate activity within English language teaching, and ESP research as an identifiable component of applied linguistic research (Dudley-Evans & St. John, 1998).","Basically, the origins of ESP can be traced back to the 1960s when there is a growing need for the technological and business industries (Swales, 2000). ESP, the prime realization of applied discourse analysis, was later evolved for every specialized area needs appropriate teaching materials. Recently, ESP is utilized as an umbrella term with multitudinous acronyms standing for the various sub-fields (Dudley-Evans & St. John, 1998).","Under ESP framework, there are two major sub-fields, English for Academic Purposes (EAP) and English for Occupational Purposes (EOP) which are distinguished by their research nature and pedagogical tradition (Robinson, 1991; Dudley-Evans & St. John, 1998). EAP concerning students’ needs to learn academic language constitutes the majority of ESP, whereas EOP comprises of professional purposes in administration, medicine, law and business, and vocational purposes for non-professionals in work or pre-work situations (Dudley-Evans & St. John, 1998).","In the ESP domain, ELP is an important but comparatively uncultivated corner (Dudley-Evans & St. John, 1998:51). González and Vyushkina (2009) characterize English for Academic Legal Purposes (EALP) is to be used in university degree program, while English for Occupational Legal Purposes (EOLP) is to be used in training practical skills for workplace. Over the years there has been continuing interest in the research of EALP (Bhatia, 1993; Bowles, 1995; Harris, 1997; Feak et al, 2000; Candlin et al, 2002; Badger, 2003; Du, 2009). However, those were carried out were mostly concerned with material development, genre analysis, and curriculum design. Corpus-based studies on EOLP, in contrast, are relatively undeveloped. Badger (2003) once conducted a corpus-based study on law in the genre of newspaper law reports. He found that newspaper law reports serve the same function as law cases do which facilitates law school students to identify rational of the legal decision of the case. Basically, this corpus-based study is innovative, but that is EALP and solely for reading. To be specific, corpus-based applications on EOLP are comparatively unseen and the voice that professional writing gathers the workplace needs entail the directions for future research.","Accordingly, it is confirmed that while EALP is nowadays widely developed for law school students of academic purposes, there is an underlying purpose to build up EAOP, in particular, Patent English, for workplace needs."]},{"title":"3 Vocabulary in ESP","paragraphs":["Writing for specific purposes requires familiarity with not only knowledge of the content but knowledge of the language. Unfamiliarity with vocabulary in writing is perceived to be a challenging task for language learners. As the importance of teaching vocabulary in ESP has gained recognition (Swales, 1983), Coxhead and Nation (2001) categorize vocabulary in ESP into four groups: high frequency words, academic vocabulary, technical vocabulary, and low frequency vocabulary.","Nation (2001) defines those words in the use of writing. High-frequency words refer to the most frequently used 2000 words of English that were used in all types of writing. Low-frequency words are the rarely used terms and covered only 5% of all words. Academic words, namely semi-technical or sub-technical vocabulary, were for academic purposes. This vocabulary is common to a wide range of academic fields but is not what is known as high frequency 418 Poster Papers   vocabulary and is not technical in that it is not typically associated with just one field (Chung 2003). In contrast, technical words are the ones used in a specialized field, which are considerably different from subject to subject. As Chung (2003) point to, technical vocabulary is largely of interest and used to people working in a specialized field. In the genre of law, Mellinkoff (1963) suggests legal vocabulary were those of common words with uncommon meanings. For example, merger and acquisition bear the same literal meaning as ‘combination’ in general English. However, of economic and financial law, merger depicts the acquisition of one company by another. The combination into a single legal entity will increase the benefits to each other is semantically positive. As to acquisition, the combination often bears unequal treatments is often negative.","Since there is very little technical vocabulary in legal disciplines, Harris (1997) analyzed procedural vocabulary extracted from the area of English contract law. His research shows that technical words enhance not only legal reading but strengthen text analytic skills. Denton (2009) covered frequently used legal vocabulary in his teaching. Specific meaning of vocabulary, such as merger and acquisition of economy law, is viewed as concept for him to teach. His research concludes that the learning of terminology for Legal English is the priority that accounts for participants’ motivation to foster when learning vocabulary conceptually. Better to say, learning legal vocabulary with concepts of the target context is essential in vocabulary development. Haberstroh (2009) develops the legal academic word list. His research enriches the well-established area of EALP at present day; however, the rapidly growing trend of EOLP remains comparatively undeveloped.","To sum up, a general conclusion can be drawn is that there is a need to prepare interdisciplines for patent writing, but exploring technical vocabulary with corpus-based approach into such development has the high priority."]},{"title":"4 Compilation of the Patent Technical Word List 4.1 Technical Vocabulary of Intellectual Property","paragraphs":["The relevant technical words in this study were mainly obtained from the USPTO (United States Patent and Trademark Office) Glossary1",". Consider the proper coverage needed for a lexical study, the distribution of each IPR context is taken into consideration beforehand. Figure 1 shows the results of the coverage of technical words in intellectual property. 050100150200250 Patent Trademark Infotech General   Figure 1: The coverage of technical vocabulary in intellectual property The coverage was confined to the contexts. As USPTO glossary surveyed, four primary contexts were outlined—patent, trademark, infotech (information technology), and general context. Among the total 558 words in the glossary, 212 words are included in the patent on a context level,  1 USPTO Glossary is available at http://www.uspto.gov/main/glossary PACLIC 24 Proceedings 419   making up 38% of all. Better to say, the coverage of patent technical words was 38% which is much higher than the 18.3% of the 102 words used in a general context as shown in Figure 1. Compared with the coverage of trademark (26.6%) and infotech (17.4%) context, patent technical words are more widely covered in intellectual property. This suggests there is a growing need in the area of patent and is consistent with literature review of the present research which suggests that patent plays a significant role in the genre of intellectual property."]},{"title":"4.2 Frequency of Patent Technical Vocabulary","paragraphs":["One of the major objectives in this section was to find out the most frequently used technical words in patents. This aim was achieved by calculating the frequencies of each patent word in Figure 1. The frequency of the patent technical words has been listed according to the frequency of their occurrence in the USPTO Patent Full-Text and Image Database (PatFT), 2 and the distribution is presented in Table 1.  Table 1: Distribution of patent technical words in PatFT Times of Occurrence Number of Words Percentage Accumulative Percentage ≧ 1,000,000 7 53.20 53.20 1,000,000 ~ 999,999 23 42.56 95.76 10,000 ~ 99,999 21 3.62 99.38 1,000 ~ 9,999 39 0.53 99.91 100 ~ 999 40 0.07 99.98 1 ~ 99 53 0.02 100.00 0 29 0 100.00 Total 212 100 100.00  Based on USPTO Glossary, we retrieved 212 patent technical word families from PatFT, we found 90 word families (99.91%) occurred more than 1000 times, which were considered as frequently used patent technical words. There are only 53 word families (0.02%) appeared less than 100 times and 29 word families did not appear at all, both of which were viewed as not frequently used technical words in patent. The other 40 word families occurred less than 1000 times but more than 100 times in PatFT.","In the present research, there are 7 word families occurred more than one million times. Among them, the most frequently used technical word was a verb ‘comprising’ which appears 3,785,213 times in PatFT. Other technical word items such as scope, patent, group and element, consisting of, and drawing occurred frequently over one million times. The high-frequency of these words reflects the important role of technical vocabulary in patent texts."]},{"title":"4.3 Word Associations of Patent Technical Vocabulary","paragraphs":["With regard to word associations, Nattinger (1988) suggests that grouping of the words according to their meanings enhances vocabulary learning. He once mentioned word grouping can be presented in the form of topic (situational sets) with a library such as book, shelf, borrow, loan, and so on can be taught together for teaching and learning. In order to get a clearer picture of the patent technical words in a better use, the researcher made a detailed analysis into the word associations based on topic.  2 USPTO Patent Full-Text and Image Database (PatFT) is available at http://patft.uspto.gov/netahtml/PTO/searchadv.htm 420 Poster Papers  ","The 212 patent technical words are considered to be statistically unusually frequent in their occurrence, but it was then noted that they seemed to fall into a limited number of recurring topic sets; six sections were therefore proposed based on words in the same semantic network or field that share similar meanings or semantic features in PatFT: ‘patent activity (99)’, ‘patent aid (25)’, ‘patent community (23)’, ‘patent claim (17)’, ‘patent description (30)’ and ‘people of the patent community (18).’ This was not only made on an intuitive basis, but on the criteria of the produced data. The following illustrates the criteria the researcher sets up for each section.  (1) What do patent-specific activities usually comprise? (patent activity) (2) What tools can be applied in a patent-specific context? (patent aid) (3) Where are patent-specific places in United States? (patent community) (4) What entities do patent applicants need for specific requests? (patent claim) (5) What specific entities can usually be found in US patents? (patent description) (6) Who are in the patent-specific contexts? (people of the patent community)  Table 2 presents the top 10 frequently used technical word in each of the six sections, which are arrayed according to their frequency of occurrence in descending order in PatFT.

Patent aid constitutes only 1.5% of all.","As patent law 35U.S.C.§112 paragraph 1 reads, “patent claim” is viewed as the specification contain a written description of the invention, and of manner and process of making and using it, in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains, or with which it is most nearly connected, to make and use the same, and shall set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention. That is to say, patent claims of a published patent inform the public the scope of rights that distinguished the invention. As it is technically dealt with specific terms used, it allows the users to familiarize with the invention an applicant owns.","As shown in Table 3, “patent claim” which has high priority is valuable for a corpus-based research. Besides, to build up a small-scale corpus for the present research, the researcher analyzed ‘patent claim’ based on verb and noun word for further investigation.

As noun words provide a comprehensive view of patent claim texts, it is noted that more efforts have to be made to explore the possibilities. Based on this, the researcher suggests future studies research on noun words of patent claim to compile a patent technical word corpus."]},{"title":"5. Conclusion","paragraphs":["There has been little investigation probed into the modern patent language in applied linguistic research. The present research therefore fills the gap by compiling a patent technical wordlist regarding frequently used word items of six primary patent areas in Table 2. Such word list is significant in that it can help learners expand the vocabulary size by displaying which words they should learn. Since patent claim denotes the precise legal definition of the invention and identifies the specific elements of the invention for which the inventor is claiming rights and seeking protection, the compilation of patent technical word corpus of patent claim texts entails the direction for future research."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["American Bar Association. 2010.
