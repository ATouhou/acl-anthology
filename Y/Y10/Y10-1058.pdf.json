This paper discusses the semantic and pragmatic properties of Japanese benefactives with the main focus on the yaru-construction. The benefactive sentence is judged to be acceptable if the transitive verb complement falls into a certain semantic class in which the meaning of transfer of possession is expressed. Hence, the distribution of the recipient role rather than the beneficiary role is crucial for determining the acceptability of the construction. To capture such a multi-dimensional linguistic information, HPSG account will be given.","Keywords: yaru-construction, beneficiary, recipient, transfer of possession, multi-dimensional architecture of HPSG"]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["In English, verbs such as bake are used ditransitively (Green, 1974; Oehrle, 1976; Levin, 1993): (1) a.

In this case, to describe the situation in which Ken gets a benefit of incinerating garbage, a complex postpositional phrase X-no-tame-ni ‘for X’ benefit’ is used:","(6) Anna-wa Anna-TOP Ken-no-tame-ni Ken-GEN-benefit-DAT gomi-o garbage-ACC yaite incinerate age-ta. give-PAST","‘(Lit.)

The polite verb ageru (type I) is used when talking politely to addressee. The honorific verbs indicate something about the speaker’s relationship with one of the verb’s arguments. For instance, kudasaru (type II) brings along the honorific contribution that the speaker regards a referent of the subject as socially superior to him. This meaning is independent of the constructional meaning of the benefactive sentence and thus we deal with only the basic verbs.","Benefactive constructions conceptually include two human entities, the one who performs an act for someone’s benefit ( BENEFACTOR) and the one who receives the benefit (BENEFICIARY). In the sentences above, the BENEFACTOR is watashi ‘I’ in (9a) and imooto ‘younger sister’ in (9b) and (9c). The BENEFICIARY is imooto in (9a) and watashi in (9b) and (9c).","There are two types of (basic) verbs of giving, yaru (type I) and kureru (type II). Yaru ‘give’ is used when the situation is described from the subject (giver)’s point of view, whereas kureru ‘give’ is used when the situation is described from the indirect object (receiver)’s point of view. 1"]},{"title":"2.2 Restriction on the Beneficiary","paragraphs":["A human participant represented as the indirect object of a ditransitive verb is naturally taken as the BENEFICIARY noun phrase when such a verb is used with a benefactive verb. In the following, Ken in (10a) and watashi ‘I’ in (10b) are easily construed as such. (10) a.

Anna-wa Anna-TOP watashi-ni I-DAT atte meet kure-ta. give-PAST","‘Anna took the trouble to meet me.’","In the following sentences, the BENEFICIARY can be the direct object, the indirect object as in","(12a), or an adjunct as in (12b).2 1 When the speaker is not involved, someone related to him holds the point of view. The ‘point of view’ of the constructions remains without any explanation but does not affect the analysis in the paper. 2 Space is lacking for a full exemplification, and therefore we focus on the yaru (type I) construction in the following. PACLIC 24 Proceedings 505","(12) a.

Watashi-wa I-TOP Naomi-no-tame-ni Naomi-for Ken-o Ken-ACC Anna-ni Anna-DAT syookaishite introduce yat-ta. give-PAST ‘I introduced Ken to Anna for Naomi’s benefit.’ This shows that the syntactic configuration of the participant carrying the BENEFICIARY role is quite unrestricted. The only restriction is that it cannot be the matrix subject (Uda, 1994).","Note that same the benefactive verb may express a ‘malefactive meaning,’ i.e. some action performed in order to negatively affect someone. See below. (13) a. Anna-wa","Anna-TOP Ken-o Ken-ACC naguritsukete beat yat-ta. give-PAST ‘Anna beat Ken.’","b. Anna-wa Anna-TOP Ken-o Ken-ACC kenashite condemn yat-ta. give-PAST","‘Anna condemned Ken.’ (13a), for example, may be interpreted as malefactive if Ken is a victim of Anna’s beating.3","However, the malefactive sentence is only a slightly special case of the benefactive sentence with the BENEFICIARY coinciding with the subject (i.e. Anna satisfied her own desire by beating Ken). As shown above, a wider range of interpretations becomes possible when the infinitive is more or less of a negative nature.","To summarize, the benefactive meaning is expressed via the benefactive verb with an infinitive but no clear syntactic configuration is available to code the BENEFICIARY. In fact, sometimes the semantic coding of the BENEFICIARY is not possible. The BENEFICIARY must be pragmatically construed, In all benefactive sentences."]},{"title":"3 The Recipient and the Transferable Object 3.1 Verb Classes and the Dative Noun","paragraphs":["In the examples in Section 2.2, in particular those with a ditransitive verb, the inclusion of the benefactive verb does not affect the argument structure of the infinitive. When certain transitive verbs appear with the benefactive verb, however, the BENEFICIARY always occurs: (14) a. Anna-wa","Anna-TOP Ken-ni Ken-DAT keeki-o cake-ACC yaite bake yat-ta. give-PAST ‘Anna baked Ken a cake.’","b. *Anna-wa Anna-TOP Ken-ni Ken--DAT gomi-o garbage-ACC yaite incinerate yat-ta. give-PAST","‘Intended: Anna incinerated garbage for Ken.’","With regard to the semantic class of such verbs, Miyake (1996) has noted that the verbs which allow the occurrence of a dative noun are verbs of creation in the benefactive constructions. The following kaku ‘paint’ in (15a) and amu ‘knit’ in (15b), whose process creates an e ‘picture’ and a kaadegan ‘cardigan’ respectively, are able to introduce a dative noun. (15) a. Watashi-wa","I-TOP imooto-ni y.sister-DAT e-o picture-ACC kaite paint yat-ta. give-PAST","‘I painted my younger sister a picture.’ 3 Alternatively, (13a) may be a benefactive sentence if the BENEFICIARY is someone unexpressed in the sentence (i.e. a revenge on behalf of someone) or if it is Ken who enjoys Anna’s beating him (i.e. a masochistic interpretation). 506 Poster Papers","b. Anna-wa Anna-TOP Ken-ni Ken-DAT kaadegan-o cardigan-ACC ande knit yat-ta. give-PAST","‘Anna knitted Ken his cardigan.’ Notice that the difference between (14a) and (14b) is that (keeki-o) yaku ‘bake (a cake)’ in the former is typically a VERB OF CREATION, like examples above, while in the latter (gomi-o) yaku ‘incinerate (garbage)’, whose process does not create anything, is a VERB OF CHANGE-OF-STATE.4 Thus, (14b) contrasts with (14a) in which the same dative noun results in an grammatical sentence.","There are some other verbs which allow the occurrence of a dative noun. For example, (keeki-o) kau ‘buy (a cake)’ and (sakana-o) tsukamaeru ‘catch (a fish)’ do not describe the creation of products, but the following sentences which include these verbs are grammatical: (16) a. Watashi-wa","I-TOP imooto-ni y.sister-DAT keeki-o cake-ACC katte buy yat-ta. give-PAST ‘I bought my younger sister a cake.’","b. Ken-wa Ken-TOP Anna-ni Anna-DAT sakana-o fish-ACC tsukamaete catch yat-ta. give-PAST","‘Ken caught Anna a fish.’","Aside from the classification of verbs, benefactive verbs bring out the RECIPIENT role implicit in the verb, and also assign the BENEFICIARY role to the argument, making it a part of the benefactive construction. In (16a), for example, the RECIPIENT role is not part of the argument structure for the verb kau ‘buy.’ Rather the argument imooto ‘young sister’ is implicitly included and can be made manifest with the help of the benefactive verb."]},{"title":"3.2 Transfer of Possession and Transferable Object","paragraphs":["The contrast between (17a) and (17b) below shows the contribution of the benefactive verbs.

Ken-wa Ken-TOP Anna-ni Anna-DAT sakana-o fish-ACC hanashite release morat-ta. receive-PAST","‘Intended: Ken had Anna release a fish.’ The sentences (16b) and (17a) are minimally distinct in the infinitive, but (16b) is judged to be acceptable, while (17a) is not. The unacceptability of (17a) is explained in terms of the mismatch of transfer of possession between the benefactive verb and the infinitive.","The benefactive verb describes an abstract transfer of ownership, which is coded as the verb semantics. The verb yaru ‘give’ implies such transfer from the subject to the ni-marked argument, so the ni-marked argument is construed as a GOAL/RECIPIENT. The verb morau ‘receive’, on the other hand, implies a reverse transfer, so the ni-marked argument is taken as a SOURCE, and the subject a GOAL/RECIPIENT. The infinitive hanashite ‘release’ also describes a reverse transfer of the possession of the o-marked argument, so the ni-marked argument is construed as a SOURCE. In (17a) and (17b), both ni-marked arguments are made manifest with the identical SOURCE role by the verb hanasu, even though they are the participants of events representing different orientations of transfer. This is why (17b) is acceptable, while (17a) is not.5","In the examples given so far, the sense of a concrete object being transferred is very strong. With other type of transitive verbs in the following, a more abstract kind of transfer is implied. 4","Miyake’s (1996) Japanese verb classification does not correspond exactly with Levin’s (1993) English verb classifi-","cation. The names of verb classes employed here are a translation from Miyake (1996) written in Japanese. 5","In the series of the cognitive analysis (Shibatani, 1994; Shibatani, 1996), Shibatani has proposed that the crucial","factor determining the acceptability of benefactive constructions is the resulting possessive control of an entity on","the part of the GOAL/BENEFICIARY. Here we do not go into detail about his analysis, but we may reconcile a part","of his idea with our proposal in Section 4.2. Admitting the plausibility of his approach, we leave the issue open.

Passive and causative predicates are formed by a stem verb followed by a bound morpheme. Benefactive predicates, on the other hand, are seemingly composed of an infinitive (V1) followed by te which is arguably a marker, and an auxiliary verb (V2). However, the syntax of the infinitive complementation, where the V1 in the sentence final verb cluster is semantically a complement of V2, has long been a issue in Japanese generative grammar. This construction falls between the sentential complementation and lexical complex predicates.","For phenomena such as (i) adverb placement, (ii) scrambling and (iii) right-node raising, it lines up with typical complex predicates in that the V1 and the V2 form a tight lexical unit. On the other hand, with respect to another set of phenomena such as (iv) embedded VP coordination, (v) focus particle insertion and (vi) reduplication, the construction lines up with typical sentential complementation in that the V1 and V2 do not behave like a lexical unit."]},{"title":"4.2 Intentionality and Possessive Control","paragraphs":["Regarding to the transfer of possession discussed in Section 3.2, (20a) and (20b) show a contrast.","(20) a.
