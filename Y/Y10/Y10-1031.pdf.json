This paper investigates some important constraints on the licensing of nominals in the so-called Multiple Nominative Constructions (MNCs) in Korean from a mereological point of view, proposing a semantic relation hierarchy. The main idea advanced in this paper is that MNCs are cyclically formed only when the relationship between the two consecutive NPs satisfies one of the conceptual constraints including inclusion, possession and attribution. The inclusion constraints are further divided into meronymic relations, spatio-temporal relations and classificational relations. The meronymic relations integrate some essential ideas of the tradition of mereological thoughts. Some appealing consequences of this proposal include a new comprehensive classification of MNCs and a straightforward account of some long standing problems such as how the additional nominative NPs are licensed.

They properly include the so-called Double Nominative Constructions (DNCs) and Multiple Nominative Constructions (MNCs). The former is characterized by the occurrences of two NPs marked with the nominative case-marker within a clause headed by an intransitive predicate. The latter is referred to the clauses containing three or more nominative case-marked consecutive NPs.","Althought a large number of studies have been made on these constructions, there is still little agreement as to the nature of these constructions. One of the controversial issues is the issue why only a subset of the clauses containing three or more nominative case-marked consecutive NPs is grammatical and the issue whether or not the two constructions are grammatically related. If so, in what way? If not, why not? The questions raised above, in my opinion, may be answered by investigating the constraints on the licensing of nominals in the MNCs in Korean.","The purpose of this paper is to tackle this licensing issue and to propose a set of licensing conditions from a mereological point of view. What I wish to show in this paper is that MNCs are cyclically formed only when the relationship between the two consecutive NPs satisfies one of the conceptual constraints including inclusion, possession and attribution."]},{"title":"2 Basic Data and Issues","paragraphs":["The set of sentences in (1) is the most frequently cited one in the literature on this topic at all (see Yang (1972), Yoon (1986), O’Grady (1991), Schütze (1996), Kim (2001), Park (2001), Park (2005) and Kim, Sells & Yang (2007), among others.)1 Copyright 2010 by Byong-Rae Ryu 1 The nominative case markers -ka and -i are allomorphs.

Based on this similiarity, the most","widespread approach claims that the MNCs may be formed if the the two consequtive nominative","case-marked NPs is in a possessor-possessed relation.2","This claim might seem to be supported by","the contrast between (5) and (6). for the glosses and attributes used in this paper are as follows: NOM (nominative), ACC (accusative), GEN (genitive), DAT (dative), PRES (present tense), PAST (past tense), DECL (declarative), COP (copula), LOC (locative), and TOP (topic). 2 The approach advanced along this line of ideas is highly common in the derivational grammar framework. According to this approach, generally known as Genitive approach, additional nominative NP occurs via cyclic NP movement out of the subject NP with genitive specifiers. 272 Regular Papers (5) { khokkili-uy khokkili-ka } elephant-GEN/elephant-NOM kho-ka nose-NOM kil-ta. be.long-DECL (= (1a)) ‘The nose of elephants is long.’ (6) { *Mary-uy *Mary-ka } Mary-GEN/Mary-NOM kihwu-ka weather-NOM onhwaha-ta. be.mild-DECL (=(60), Park (2001)) In the same vein, Park (2001) proposes a semantic relation g(eneralized)-possess for licensing the consequtive NPs in MNCs. According to him, the relation g-possess includes not only inalienable (physical) possession like an elephant’s nose or Mary’s eyes, but also non-physical abstract possession like Mary’s honesty, John’s mind, a friend’s daughter, or California’s weather.","While there can be no doubt that there exists a certain similiarity between the MNCs and the corresponding sentence with subject with a genitive NP, there are many other conceptual or distributional differences between the two sentences (see Na & Huck (1993) and Kim (2000), among others)","First, the two sentences menifest meaning differences, as Na & Huck (1993: 190) pointed out.","Second, while the genitive approach might seem to be plausible at least for some MNCs, there are other MNCs which have no acceptable genitive source (Na & Huck (1993: 190)): (7) { kkoch-i *kkoch-uy } flower-NOM/flower-GEN kwukhwa-ka chrysanthemum-NOM olaykan-ta. last.long-DECL ‘As for flowers, chrysanthemums last long.’","Third, in a variety of cases a genitive is not readily convertible into a nominative NP (Na & Huck (1993: 191): (8) { pyeng-uy *pyeng-i } illness-GEN/illness-NOM akhwa-ka worsening-NOM i this sathay-lul state cholayha-ess-ta. cause-PAST-DECL ‘The worsening of the illness caused this condition.’","Fourth, MNCs in which some NPs are realized as nominative and some as genitive do not have corrsponding genitive sources, as shown in (9).","(9) John-i John-NOM { chinkwu-ka *chinkwu-uy } friend-NOM/friend-GEN apeci-ka father-NOM pwuca-i-ta. be.rich-PRES-DECL [Mixed Genitive] ‘The father of John’s friend is rich.’","Fifth, it is to be pointed out that all MNCs in which the Collection-Member relationship holds between the two nominative NPs do not have corrsponding genitive sources.3 (10) { pihayngki-ka *pihayngki-uy } airplane-NOM/airplane-GEN 777-i 777-NOM khu-ta. be.big-DECL [Collection-Member] ‘It is as for airplanes that 777 is big.’ Sixth, all MNCs in which the Mass-Portion relationship holds between the two nominative NPs","do not have corrsponding genitive sources, as shown in (11). 3 Since Na & Huck (1993: 190) alluded just to the sentence in (7), it is unclear whether, by this example, they mean a general unacceptability of the genitive sentecnes showing the Collection-Member relationship or not.

He argues that the macro-micro relation is one of the generative sources.4","This relation is based on a semantic conception of non-symmetric inclusion, and it is realized as multiplication of the same case marker on the surface. The macro-micro relation is subcategorized into 5 types according to their semantic 4 The macro-micro relation refers to a relation where an NP is conceptually divided into the whole NP itself and a subpart of it. The NP which corresponds to the former is referred to as a macro-NP, while that corresponding to the latter is referred to as a micro-NP. 274 Regular Papers content: Whole-Part as in (15), Class-Member as in (16), Type-Token as in (17), Total-Quant as in (18) and finally Affected-Affector as in (19):5","(15) khokkili-ka elephant-NOM kho-ka nose-NOM kil-ta. be.long-DECL [Whole-Part, Yang (1972)] ‘The nose of elephants is long.’","(16) pihayngki-ka airplane-NOM 777-i 777-NOM khu-ta. be.big-DECL [Class-Member, Yang (1972)] ‘It is as for airplanes that 777 is big.’","(17) hay-ka sun-NOM ttu-nun rise-REL hay-ka sun-NOM mesiss-ta. be.beautiful-DECL [Type-Token, Yang (1972)] ‘As for sun, the rising sun is beautiful.’","(18) ttang-i land-NOM 100 100 m2 -i m2 -NOM pali-ess-ta. be.sold-PAST-DECL [Total-Quant., Yang (1972)] ‘It is as for land that 100 m2","were sold.","(19) nay-ka I-NOM apeci-ka father-NOM aphu-si-pni-ta. be.sick-HON-SUF-DECL [Affected-Affector, Yang (1972)] ‘It is me that father is sick(, which affects me).’","The licensing issue is tackled again by Na & Huck (1993). They proposes that the two consequtive nominative case-marked NPs need to be in a certain semantic relation, called thematic subordination: X is thematically subordinate to an entity Y iff Y’s having the properties that it does entails that X has the properties that it does. Na & Huck (1993: 195) classify these thematic subordination relations into five types: part-whole relation (e.g., cover-book, morning-day, eye-person, etc.), qualitative relation (e.g., use-tool, length-pants, height-woman, etc.), conventional relation (e.g., car-man, picture-woman, dog-girl, etc.), conversive relation (e.g., parentchild, master-servant, employer-employee, etc.), and taxonomic relation (e.g., apple-fruit, oaktree, chair-furniture, etc.). The part-whole relation and the taxonomic relation in Na & Huck (1993) corresponds to the Whole-Part and the Class-Member relation in Yang (1972). The other three relations can be illustrated by the examples below:","(20) nwun-i eye-NOM sayk-i color-NOM ppalkah-ta. be.red-DECL [qualitative, Na & Huck (1993)] ‘The (color of the) eyes is/sare red.’","(21) cha-ka car-NOM isangha-n be.strange-REL naymsay-ka smell-NOM","na-n-ta.

He agrees with Yang (1972) that the Whole-Part type such as in (15) and the Class-Member type such as in (16) should be distinguished as independent classes. While he do not allude to the other three types which Yang (1972) classified, he added three new types of MNCs: Locative MNCs such as in (23), Psych-Verb MNCs such as in (24), and Copulative MNCs such as in (25). 5","According to Yang (1972: 45), the Affected-Affector macro-micro relation is a ‘solidarity’ relation and some sort","of natural pairing, e.g., kindship, teacher-student, society-individual, etc. We do not assume this relation as an","independant class, but regard it as an instance of ‘Mutual Relation’ class.

(1988) and Winston et al. (1987)). Some of these works tried to introduce a classification of these relations and to discuss the validity and accuracy of such categories. Because it is not the place to talk about it, we will not go here into a discussion about the appropriateness of existing classifications. Rather, we will give the main lines of the categorization of part-whole relations we assume in this paper.","One of the main ideas advanced in this paper is that the semantic relationships between the consequitive NPs are the crucial to license an additional NP in the MNCs. In othe words, MNCs are formed cyclically only when the relationship between the two adjacent NPs in the MNCs satisfies one of the conceptual constraints listed in Table 2.","Based on psycholinguistic experiments and the way in which the parts contribute to the structure of the wholes, Winston, et al. (1987) determined six types of part-whole relations: (1) Component-Integral Object, (2) Member-Collection, (3) Portion-Mass, (4) Stuff-Object, (5) Feature-Activity, and (6) Place-Area. If we advance the idea the the six relations can be subsumed under the meronymic relation, we can further group the other semantic relations and hierachically organize the relations in a linguistically relevant way, be it a ontological hierarchy or semantic type hierarchy in Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar. PACLIC 24 Proceedings 277","We propose a semantic relation hierarchy in which inclusion. possession and attribution occupy the top-level nodes. Each type of the 14 different classes of MNCs we establish in this paper are properly assigned a semantic relation, which is roughly organized as in Figure 1. We assume that each type of the semantic relations in Figure 1 has its own constraint on the formation of the MNCs.","Possession, in general, is an asymmetric relationship between two constituents, the referent of one of which (the possessor) possesses (owns, rules over, has as a part, etc.) the referent of the other. Alienable and inalienable possession are commonly distinguished. In the semantic relation hierarchy, we understand only the alienable possession under the possession relation. The inalienable possession is a propoer portion of Integral object-Component.","Attribution, in general, is an asymmetric relationship between two constituents, the referent of one of which has the property of described by the other. We assume this relation includes Object-Quality (e.g., eye-color, hair-shine, etc.), Object-Predication (e.g., person-complaint, father-love, etc.), Mutual Relation (e.g., doctor-patient, husbad-wife) and Object-Attribution (e.g., car-smell, tiger-area of movement, etc.).","Spatio-Temporal Relation (e.g., kid-illness, container-crack, tomato-worm, beach-girl; summer-beer, city-weather, etc.) and Classification Relation (e.g., student-some, apple-two; sun-rising sun, dog-biting dog, etc.) are inclusion relation. Figure 1 A Lexical Semantic Relation Hierarchy as Condition on Lecensing Nominals in MNCs","The Integral object-Component relation is the relation between components and the objects to which they belong. Integral objects have a structure, their components are separable and have a functional relation with their wholes (e.g., kitchen-apartment, aria-opera, cup-handle, car-wheel, elephant-nose, person-hand).","The Collection-Member relation represents membership in a collection. Members are parts, but they cannot be separated from their collections and do not play any functional role with respect to their whole (e.g., soldier-army, professor-faculty, tree-forest, deck-card, flower-rose, airplaine-777).","Mass-Portion captures the relations between portions and masses, extensive objects, and physical dimensions. The parts are separable and similar to each other and to the wholes which they comprise, and do not play any functional role with respect to their whole (e.g., slice-pie, meterkilometer, salt-grain of salt).","The Object-Stuff category encodes the relations between an object and the stuff of which it is partly or entirely made. The parts are not similar to the wholes that they comprise, cannot be separated from the whole, and have no functional role (e.g., car-steel sheet, alcohol-wine, , bike-steel).","The Feature-Activity relation captures the semantic links within features or phases of various activities or processes. The parts have a functional role, but they are not similar or separable from the whole (e.g., golf-putting, eating-swallowing, paying-shopping and chewing-eating). 278 Regular Papers","Area-Place captures the relation between areas and special places and locations within them.

If the added nominative happens to be conceptually incemplete, then another nominative may be added, resulting in a tripple nominative construction. This process may occur repeatedly.
