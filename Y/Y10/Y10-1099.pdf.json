A theory of natural language production (speaker mode) has to answer the following questions: (i) Where does the content serving as input to language production come from? (ii) In which format is this relatively language-independent content stored, processed, and retrieved? and (iii) How is activated content mapped into well-formed surfaces of a certain natural language? After brief answers to (i) and (ii), this paper concentrates on (iii), illustrating the time-linear method of Database Semantics (DBS) on some of the most notorious grammatical constructions of natural language.

The DBS approach requires an agent with a body and external interfaces for recognition and action. These are connected by a database supporting an autonomous control for maintaining the agent in a state of balance vis-à-vis a constantly changing environment.","This overall approach provides language production with a declarative specification of (i) a data structure for representing content, (ii) a database schema for storing and retrieving content, (iii) elementary contents defined as basic recognition and action procedures (lexical semantics), and (iv) complex contents based on semantic relations of structure (compositional semantics).","For our software reconstruction of language production, the agent’s action may be confined to the speaker mode (producing natural language surfaces from content). Moreover, the What to say? part, played by the agent’s autonomous control and realized as the selective activation of content for maintaining balance, may be taken temporarily by the linguist selecting contents by hand.","The focus of this paper is a graph-theoretical representation of content, serving as the simplified start structure of the speaker mode (as well as the goal structure of the hearer mode). By defining directed graphs indicating the time-linear activation of content, language production may be analyzed in a conceptually clear and simple format which translates directly into efficiently running code. After introducing our method with elementary intra- and extrapositional constructions, it is tested successfully on relative clause, unbounded dependency, and gapping constructions."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Hausser, R. 2006.
