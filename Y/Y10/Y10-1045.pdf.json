In this study, we propose to use two corpus-based linguistic approaches \\for a sense prediction study.

In particular, we will look at words without lexically-assigned senses and try to predict the range of senses each word form may have. Since lexical information of senses of these words is not available, we propose to use corpus-driven distribution as the main information is prediction. We will determine the collocation clusters of our target word through characters, semantic features, and concepts by using corpora and tools, such as Chinese Gigaword Corpus, Chinese Wordnet and Xiandai Hanyu. Our study showed the feasibility of sense-prediction without lexically assigned senses.","If a word has more than two senses at the same time, then it is usually called a lexically ambiguous word, for example, bank. We need to divide its correct senses and assign its appropriate senses to the different contexts. However, “lexical ambiguity” is presented in several different related researches to present and refer the same target. In WordNet, the definition of a lexically ambiguous word is the ambiguity of an individual word or phrase that can be used (in different contexts) to express two or more different meanings. WordNet researchers also regard polysemy and lexical ambiguity as synonym. In the case of the PACLIC 24 Proceedings 399  previously related lexical ambiguity, several studies have concentrated on the corpus-based and computational perspective included: Peng et al. (2007), Xue et al. (2006), Chen et al. (2005), Moldovan and Novischi (2004) ...and so on and they took several different approaches: used the corpus-based approach, an adaptive system, divided the sense of lexically ambiguous word and found the possibility of the senses of a word.","Although a suite of heuristical methods are presented for word sense disambiguation of Chinese Wordnet glosses, unfortunately we know of several researchers who use only manual analysis to find out the argumentative roles and predict their semantic features to determine their senses. Therefore, they can’t deal with more quantities of lexically ambiguous words at the same time. We consulted Fujii and Croft’s study (1993) to collect relevant collocations to categorize different clusters by using the character similarity clustering approach for achieving automatic sense prediction. In addition, we also consulted Liu and Li (2002), Li et al. (2005) and Dai et al. (2008) to take different dimensions to calculate and obtain the similarities by using the concept similarity clustering approach.","In this study, we first review some related previous studies of sense prediction and lexical ambiguity resolution. Second, we point out lexical ambiguity determination, hypotheses, research questions, and the goal of this study. Third, we will introduce many important corpora and tools, such as Chinese Gigaword Corpus, HowNet, Chinese Wordnet and Xiandai Hanyu. Further, data collection, two main research approaches and evaluation will be shown and explained. Finally, we will show some results of combining, comparing, and discussing for these two approaches in this study."]},{"title":"2 Research Question","paragraphs":["When we seek to define lexically ambiguous senses, we need to notice that (1) senses are represented as sets of necessary and sufficient conditions that fully capture the conceptual content conveyed by words; (2) there are as many particular senses for a word as there are differences in these conditions; and (3) senses can be represented independently of the context in which they occur.","Regarding lexical ambiguity, there are two hypotheses in this study. Lexical ambiguity means some words have multiple meanings or senses (Moldovan and Novischi, 2004). Therefore, the first hypothesis is that words with similar morpheme-character components and concept elements are similar in sense. We will follow Fujii and Croft (1993) to observe character similarity and refer to Li et al. (2003) and Dai et al. (2008) to explore conc\\ept similarity via HowNet. Peng et al. (2007) mentioned that a corpus was divided into five equal parts which one part was used as the test corpus and the collocation list was constructed from the other four parts of corpus. In this study, the second hypothesis is that different corpora with particular functions which provide different lexical knowledge bases. we will use Chinese Gigaword Corpus to select related collocations for the four target words; we will use HowNet to assign all possible concepts to ambiguous senses of the four target words; we will use Chinese Wordnet to estimate the evaluations for the four target words and we will also use Xian Han to estimate the evaluations for the four target words. For this reason, there are two research questions in this study: (1) How do we predict the word senses of a lexically ambiguous word to present different interpretations in different contexts or domains? And (2) How do we use a corpus as the database to support a word sense prediction study?"]},{"title":"3 Methodology","paragraphs":["In this sense prediction study, we would like to explore all possible senses of my four target words --- chi1 “eat”, wan2 “play”, huan4 “change” and shao1 “burn”, therefore, we need to collect large data to analyze and examine them in order to achieve the objectivity, equitable and rational. Chinese Gigaword Corpus is a good candidate. In addition, it’s because we will map and assign all related collocation words of four target words in the concept similarity clustering 400 Poster Papers analysis to represent their semantic features and concepts, we choose HowNet as the knowledge bases. When we do the sense prediction study, of course, it’s necessary to evaluate their evaluations. We then select Chinese Wordnet (CWN) and Xiandai Hanyu Cidian (Xian Han) as criteria to evaluate for these four target words.","In order to collect large data to explore our sense prediction study, we focus on Taiwan’s Central News Agency Gigaword Corpus (Traditional Gigaword Corpus). The Chinese Gigaword Corpus contains about 1.4 billion Chinese characters, including about 800 million characters from Taiwan’s Central News Agency (from 1991 to 2004), nearly 500 million characters from China’s Xinhua News Agency, and approximately 30 million characters from Singapore Zaobao.","We would like to present their semantic features and concepts of the related collocation words in order to predict their different senses for these four target words in the concept similarity clustering analysis of the corpus-based and computational approach. HowNet is the knowledge bases which can show their internal semantic components, features and combination of sememes and pointers for all words in detail. HowNet is an on-line common-sense knowledge base that reveals the inter-conceptual and inter-attribute relations of concepts as connoted in the Chinese lexicon and that of their English equivalents. HowNet includes an abundance of both semantic and world knowledge and thus is an important resource for NLP and knowledge mining (Dong and Dong 2006).","For the evaluations of the four target words, we will use Chinese Wordnet (CWN) and Xiandai Hanyu. The architecture of CWN follows the standard established by Princeton’s WordNet (WN, Fellbaum 1998), which has two unique design features. First, it aims to maintain the balance between the universality of cross-lingual synset-based sense mapping and the felicity of language-specific lexicalization of concepts. Second, it aims to represent sense at the level of lexical conventionalization, we well as meaning facets at the level of conceptual specification (Ahrens et al. 1998). In addition, we then take XianDai HanYu CiDian (Xia Han, the fifth version, 2005) to evaluate them in the same time.","In order to gain these related collocations, from Taiwan’s Central News Agency Gigaword Corpus, we use three different ways to collect them: (1) the noun after the target word; (2) the head noun of the first noun phrase after the target word; (3) the head noun of the last noun phrase before the first punctuation mark of the target word; (4) the noun before the first punctuation mark of the target word; and (5) the noun nearest the punctuation mark before the target word. They are shown following, in Table 1.","","Table 1: The related collocations","Category Connected Sentence Related Collocation 1 民众除了多食用蔬菜,多吃鱼也有益健康。 鱼{Na} 2 一种绝不含油脂的减肥食谱--盐包鸡,又称减","肥鸡,并保证有吃五味盐酥鸡的滋味与口感。 盐酥鸡{Na}","3 巴拿马人自己不吃猪内脏与猪脚筋,台湾二千 三百万人口,每人每年平均消费四十点五公斤 的猪肉,引起他们莫大的兴趣。 猪脚{Na}","4 从玩彩色木棒或积木块的游戏中,能轻易学到 像是长、高、形状、表面、尺寸。 游戏{Na}","5 喝完汤后先吃蔬菜,尤以叶菜类及瓜类热量最 低,蔬菜尽量以凉拌或生吃,不加油更佳。 蔬菜{Na} ","Following these five different collocation selection criteria, there are 29,421 sentences for the collocation words of chi1 “eat”; 8,833 sentences for the collocation words of wan2 “play”; 19,394 sentences for the collocation words of huan4 “change”; and 4,668 sentences for the collocation words of shao1 “burn”. From these sentences, there are 3,961 collocation words for PACLIC 24 Proceedings 401  chi1 “eat”; 2,086 collocation words for wan2 “play”; 3,003 collocation words for huan4 “change”; and 1,565 collocation words for shao1 “burn”. This empirical data can then be used to process the character similarity clustering analysis and the concept similarity clustering analysis using a corpus-based and computational approach; moreover, it can predict all of their possible senses."]},{"title":"4 Analysis 4.1 Character similarity clustering analysis","paragraphs":["Following Fujii and Croft’s study (1993), we will use character similarity to cluster relative collocations in order to predict possible senses of the four target words, although by a different method. Similar features are often synonymous compounds that share a common morpheme. For instance, [饭 (fan4 “rice”), 米饭 (mi3 fan4 “rice”)] and [案 (an4 “case”), 案件 (an4 jian4 “case”)], respectively, share a common morpheme [饭 (fan4 “rice”)] and [案 (an4 “case”)]. Fujii and Croft (1993) also pointed out a similar thesaurus effect of Chinese characters in Japanese Information Retrieval. In the cluster step, there are two sub-steps here: (1) character similarity comparison between words; and (2) group similarity comparison between words. Two formulas for these sub-steps are presented as the following: Formula 1: Character similarity comparison between words  (1) ","By using this formula, we will obtain some collocations and regard 药 (yao4 “medicine”), 减肥药 (jian3 fei2 yao4 “reducing weight medicine”), and 中药 (zhong1 yao4 “traditional Chinese medicine”) as the same cluster. Formula 2: Group similarity comparison between words  (2) ","In Formula 2, x represents one undefined word, while y represents each word of Y, where Y indicates a particular cluster. To determine which words belong in which clusters, first, one undefined word (x) must be compared with another word (y), then their average similarity must be calculated in order to gain the maximum similarity, and, finally, this undefined word (x) is placed into a particular cluster (Y). After comparing the cluster similarities, 敗績 (bai4 ji1 “defeat”) and 敗仗 (bai4 zhang4 “defeat”) can be placed into the same cluster.","After finishing the two sub-steps of the character similarity clustering analysis, we will use another automatic programming strategy to achieve more precise sense clusters by averaging the similarity of two different clusters, as shown in Formula 3 below. Formula 3: Average similarity of two different clusters  (3)  ","In Formula 3, clu1 and clu2, respectively, represent different clusters; s and t, respectively, are the word members of clu1 and clu2; and |clu1| and |clu2|, individually, represent the number of clusters of clu1 and clu2. Hence, not only are two similar words clustered into one particular cluster, but also different clusters are combined into clusters with the highest similarity.","In general, observations show that high-frequency words are usually highly ambiguous and have more senses; on the contrary, low-frequency words usually have less senses or only a single sense.

But before reducing these collocations to these clusters, collocations with frequencies that are less or equal two (≦ two) will be cut.","We will focus on more types of clusters to examine their accuracy in 100 clusters, 200 clusters, and 300 clusters for chi1 “eat”; 90 clusters, 180 clusters, and 270 clusters for wan2 “play”; 70 clusters, 140 clusters, and 210 clusters for huan4 “change”; and 60 clusters, 120 clusters, and 180 clusters for shao1 “burn”. However, in order to achieve an integral, 30 senses of chi1 “eat”, 10 senses of wan2 “play”, 6 senses of huan4 “change”, and 15 senses of shao1 “burn” will be regarded as the standard default targets. In order to select particular clusters to examine their accuracy, the testing cluster sizes will be 1, 1.5, and 2 times that of the senses. In other words, when examining the accuracy of the four target words in the character similarity clustering analysis, we will select the top 30 clusters, 45 clusters, and 60 clusters of the 100 clusters, 200 clusters and 300 clusters for chi1 “eat”, respectively; the top 10 clusters, 15 clusters, and 20 clusters of the 90 clusters, 180 clusters, and 270 clusters for wan2 “play”, respectively; the top 6 clusters, 9 clusters, and 12 clusters of the 70 clusters, 140 clusters, and 210 clusters for huan4 “change”, respectively; and the top 15 clusters, 23 clusters, and 30 clusters of the 60 clusters, 120 clusters, and 180 clusters of shao1 “burn”, respectively.

However, if we focus only on the morpheme, perhaps many non-related collocations will be assigned to the same cluster, or perhaps many related collocations will be assigned to different clusters. For example, 山藥 (shan1 yao4 “Chinese yam”) and 藥 (yao4 “medicine”) are in the same cluster. 漢堡肉 (han4 bao3 rou4 “hamburger meat”) is categorized into 漢堡 (han4 bao3 “hamburger”) cluster rather than 肉 (rou4 “meat”) cluster.","We would like to attempt to assign all words to lexical concepts via HowNet and we then can calculate their concepts similarities in order to cluster these words. Because HowNet can present more definite semantic elements and semantic features of all words, we will utilize them to examine and ensure feature and concept determination. We will extract the sememes of the PACLIC 24 Proceedings 403  concept for each collocation word by HowNet. Owing to more words map to the same concept, they usually are regarded as synonymous words in some kind of degree, for instance, the concepts of xi1 gua1 “watermelon”, shi4 zi5 “persimmon”, ping2 guo3 “apple” and pu2 tao2 “grapes” are fruits and they are regarded as synonym and clustered in the same cluster.","It’s important view that two main strategies are in concept similarity clustering analysis as 1) similarity between sememes and 2) similarity between concepts through HowNet. HowNet organizes all the sememes into several trees, and each sememe is considered a node of a tree. In this way, we can calculate the distance between any two sememes (Dai et al., 2008). We are also able to define the distance between the sememes as the length of path between them, as shown in Formula 4. Formula 4: Similarity between sememes  (4) ","Among them, d(S1) and d(S2) represent the level of sememe S1, and S2, separately, in the semantic concept tree, while dis(S1, S2) represents the distance of sememe S1 and S2 in the semantic concept tree.","Following Liu and Li (2002), Li et al. (2005) and Dai et al. (2008), to find the similarity between the two concepts; however, we use three different dimensions to calculate them, sum these three amounts by their weights, and then obtain their similarity. Our schema is shown and expressed in Formula 5. Formula 5: Similarity between concepts  (5) ","In Formula 5, pm and pn represent the primary sememes of concept m and concept n, separately. We then calculate similarity, which is sim_seme(pm,pn), between the main sememes of two concepts. Then we gain the final average similarity via Formula 5 in order to determine the sense clusters.","In the case of the precisions of these four target words in the concept similarity clustering analysis, it’s necessary that we need to examine them manually. Taking the same method as the character similarity clustering analysis, we also randomly select some clusters as my testing data.","We presume there are 10 senses for chi1 “eat”, 9 senses for wan2 “play”, 7 senses for huan4 “change” and 6 senses for shao1 “burn”, therefore, we will randomly select 10 clusters for chi1 “eat”, 9 clusters for wan2 “play”, 7 clusters or huan4 “change” and 6 clusters for shao1 “burn”.

We use corpus-based analysis and evaluate their performances. The corpus-based and computational approach in this sense prediction study was aided by two main strategies: (1) character similarity clustering approach; and (2) concept similarity clustering approach. In the character similarity clustering approach, character similarity was compared between words and then grouped according to their similar morphemes. In the case of the concept similarity clustering approach, we mapped all possible concepts for all the collocation words of the four target words using HowNet; hence, two important strategies emerged: (1) similarity between sememes; and (2) similarity between concepts. We then clustered some collocation words into the same cluster based on their concepts in order to predict all possible concepts. We are able to obtain higher accuracy rates and better performances using the concept similarity clustering approach in the sense prediction study. Regarded as the evaluation via Chinese Wordnet and Xiandai Hanyu Cidian, from these valuable evaluations of the character similarity clustering approach and the concept similarity clustering approach, we are able to demonstrate the viability of these two approaches as a superior model for this sense prediction study."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Ahrens, Kathleen. 1998. “Lexical Ambiguity Resolution: Languages, Tasks and Timing.” In Sentence Processing: A Cross-linguistic Perspective.
