Either word sense classification or word sense clustering can not avoid this problem: what features people can get from word meaning that can be used as the tools employed for producing word sense ontology. In this paper, we present a lexical semantic-syntactic model to define and subcategorize a noun class—attribute noun class, by acquiring syntactic behavior and semantic restrictions from corpus. First we introduce the idea of attribute noun class. Then we describe the model, which is a specific tool providing a practical method to decide whether a word should be located in a specific word sense class or not. Then we apply the model to 15 nouns to show how the model works, and create a sample taxonomy for the 15 nouns.

The noun is called attribute noun if it can be classified into ANC. The “attribute” presents the incomplete information—it is supposed to combine with other words to make an integrated expression, in other words, the attribute noun “looks forward to” collocating with words which can specify its meaning. In a1, “red” specify the meaning of attribute noun “color”; in a2, “暴躁(irritable)” specify the meaning of attribute noun “脾气(temper)”"]},{"title":"2. The syntactic and semantic features of attribute noun","paragraphs":["Syntagmatic mode of word has two sub-modes: syntactic behavior and semantic selectional restrictions. While the lexical meaning of word impacts the syntagmatic mode. PACLIC 24 Proceedings 65 The meaning of a word might impact the syntactic behavior of the word. For example, attributive adjectives (also called non-predicative adjectives or as qu bie ci known in Chinese) in Chinese like “雪 白(snowy white)” can not be syntactically used with adverb, so “非常(very)/adv 雪白(snowy white)/adj” is not a legal phrase in Chinese. Because there is a adverbial morpheme “雪(snowy)” in word “雪白(snowy white)” which means “snowy”, the word merges the meaning of adverb into its lexical meaning. Attribute noun can not be attributive in attributive-head relation and rarely be isolate subject in subject-predicate relation which we will show in the following section. The semantic selectional restrictions are semantic frame in which words should appear. The semantic frame is the grammatical relation with semantic constrains. For example, there are two grammatical slots in VO relation: verbal and objective. The meaning of object must semantically match with the meaning of the verb and vice versa, in other word, either verb or object has semantic “preferences” to the collocate words; such “preferences” is “selectional restrictions” in lexical semantics. The selectional restrictions also exist in semantic role frame, but we do not discuss the issue in this paper."]},{"title":"2.1 Syntactic behavior of ANC","paragraphs":["ANC is one of the classes making the noun ontology. There have to be some formal features to distinguish ANC with other noun classes—we have to tell how ANC different with other noun classes. The syntactic behavior, as we discussed before, is the grammatical relations in which attribute noun could appear.","Generally, noun is grammatically united other words with following syntactic relations:","a. Subject-predicate (SP) relation: 今天 星期一。(Today is Monday.) Noun can be either subject or predicate in Chinese.","b. Verb-object (VO) relation: 今天 下午 打 篮球。(Play basketball this afternoon.) Noun can be object.","c. Attributive-head (AH) relation: 皇帝 的 新装。(The king’s new dress.) Noun can be either attributive or head.","Chinese is SVO language which is word-order-dependent, so we might acquire the syntactic behavior by studying the grammatical distribution of attribute noun in these grammatical relations.","The meaning of attribute noun presents incomplete information—it is supposed to combine with other words to make an integrated expression, in other words, the attribute noun “looks forward to” collocating with other words which can specify its meaning. According to this, attribute noun can not be isolate subject in SP. In sentence “今天 星期一(today is Monday)”, the noun “今天” is an isolate subject in the sentence, it can be subject by itself without combining with other word. Because subject should be definite in Chinese and present integrated information, so attribute noun can not be isolate subject in a sentence. For example, a3 颜色 是 绿色 的 (color is green)","the meaning of a3 presents incomplete information. It is supposed to tell the color of what thing or who so that people can understand the expression. Thus the attribute noun “颜色(color)” can not be isolate subject in sentence like noun “今天(today)”.","With the same reason, in AH relation, the attribute noun can not be the isolate attributive modifying head. Because the meaning of attribute noun needs to be specified by other words rather than specifying, thus it can be head modified by the attributive in AH. Thus, if we put a word before a3: a4 衣服 的 颜色 是 绿色 的 (color of the clothes is green)","the meaning of a4 is complete, we have a AH, in which attribute noun is head, to make a4 understandable. 66 Regular Papers Therefore, we have the syntactic behavior of ANC by studying its lexical meaning. F1. The attribute noun can not be the isolate subject in SP. F2. The attribute noun can not be the attributive in AH. We will use F1 and F2 to determine whether a noun is an attribute noun or not in the section below.

We use the semantic features to subcategorize ANC which are the semantic constrains between attribute noun and the collocate words in SP, VO and AH. The selectional restrictions can be learned by studying the meaning of attribute noun and it’s collocate words in AH, SP and VO."]},{"title":"2.2.1 Attribute Noun Used as Subject in SP","paragraphs":["Predicate tells something about the subject. In SP, predicate is the value of attribute noun. Attribute nouns with different meanings calls for predicates that with different concept. Thus, we can assign an attribute noun to more specific ANC class in terms of the meanings of predicate collocated with. 2.2.2 Attribute noun as object in VO","Attribute noun is object in VO, which is one of the arguments of verb. Object semantically matches with verb as other types of arguments. For example, for the attribute noun “外貌”, it can collocate with verb with the meaning of “watch” like “看” in VO (看/v 他 的 外貌/o, watch his appearance); while for the attribute noun “性格”, the verb should be with the meaning of “mental action” like “了解” (了 解/v 他 性格/o, know his temperament). Different attribute nouns “tend to” collocate with different verbs."]},{"title":"2.2.2 Attribute noun as head in AH","paragraphs":["The function of attributive in AH is specifying the head. There are two meanings of attribute: 1) the value of attribute (昂贵/a 的 价格/h, high price) which semantically resembles the predicate in 2.2.1; 2) the host which semantically possess the attribute (书/a 的 价格/h, price of the book). Thus the meanings of host of attribute and attribute, as well as attribute value and attribute should match each other.","The attribute nouns can be assigned to more specific ANC classes in terms of the meanings of words with which the attribute nouns collocate in SP, VO and AH. Thus the selectional restrictions in three grammatical relations can be used as subcategorization criterion for ANC."]},{"title":"3.
