This paper studies the adjectival modification to nouns in Mandarin Chinese based on selective binding. The main findings include: $tAn adjective can select different types of head nouns as arguments and an adjective may modify an individual or an event. $uThe qualia structure of a noun helps us better understand an adjective’s selectional preference. Meanwhile, an adjective can modify multi-facet or one facet of the qualia role of a noun. $v The adjacent adjective of a noun is not necessarily modifying the noun.

However, the meaning of an adjective is dependent on the head it modifies. Considering this, (Pustejovsky, 1995) proposed selective binding, which takes place where a lexical item or phrase operates specifically on the substructure of a phrase, without changing the overall type in the composition. (Pustejovsky, 2000) further revealed that adjectives bind into the qualia structure of nouns to select a narrow facet of the noun's meaning. For example, a large (Formal) carved (Agentive) wooden (Constitutive) useful (Telic) arrow ([Formal; Constitutive; Agentive; Telic]) illustrates the richness of the qualia structure and each adjective selects individual qualia.  Moreover, (Lapata, 2001) explored polysemous adjectives whose sense changes due to the nouns they modify. The probabilistic model he proposed can provide a ranking on the possible interpretation of the adjectives. (Saint-Dizier, 1998) proposed several extensions to the telic role through analyzing the French adjective “bon”. (Lenci, et al., 2000) extended the possible qualia role values to express fine-grained distinctions between semantic types. These studies give us a general idea of the behavior of adjectival modification to nouns and the way of extending qualia structure. However, no previous research on adjectival modification based on selective binding has been conducted regarding Mandarin Chinese.  The goal of our research is to find out the interaction between adjectives and their head nouns, including: $tfinding out the argument types an adjective can combine with; $ushowing an adjective may modify individuals or events; $vlooking into what qualia role of the head noun that an adjective selects.  * The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewer for his/her important comments.  Copyright 2010 by Shan WANG and Chu-Ren HUANG PACLIC 24 Proceedings 701 The following sections are organized as follows. The theoretical basis is introduced in Section 2. Then we analyze “w(cháng, long)+noun” and “adjective+Wfł((tú shū guǎn, library)” respectively in Section 3. Finally, we summarize the paper and suggest future work in Section 4."]},{"title":"2 Theoretical Basis","paragraphs":["(Pustejovsky, 1995) gave an interpretation of qualia structure as follows:  (1) The constitutive role is about the relation between an object and its constituents or parts. Its role values include material, weight, parts and component elements. (2) The formal role can distinguish the object within a larger domain. Orientation, magnitude, shape, dimensionality, color, and position are its role values. (3) The telic role is about the purpose and function of the object. (4) The agentive role describes factors involved in the origin of an object, such as creator, artifact, natural kind, causal chain.  Based on the qualia structure, (Pustejovsky, 2001, 2006; Pustejovsky & Jezek, 2008) separated the domain of individuals into three distinct levels: (1) Natural Types: which direct at formal and constitutive qualia roles; (2) Artifactual Types: which refer to telic or agentive role; (3) Complex Types: which make references to the relation between types. Furthermore, (Pustejovsky, 1995) represented selective binding in the following way: If α is of type <a, a>, β is of type b, and the qualia structure of β, QSβ, has quale, q of type a, then αβ is of type b, where [[αβ]] = β ∩ α (qβ). In the following section, we put the above theoretical foundation into use to analyze adjectival modification to nouns by studying “w(long)+noun” and “adjective+Wfł((library)”."]},{"title":"3 Data Analysis","paragraphs":["This study makes use of Chinese word sketch engine1 and Sinica Corpus2 to get data. Also, a few data are collected by informants’ intuition. In this section, we look at adjectival modification from two directions. One is how one particular adjective modifies different nouns, and the other is how different adjectives modify one particular noun. The two cases we choose for the above directions are “w(long)+noun” and “adjective+Wfł((library)” respectively."]},{"title":"3.1 One particular adjective modifies different nouns","paragraphs":["In this part, we focus on “ w(long)+noun” construction to see the argument selection and polysemous behavior of w(long). 3.1.1 Argument Selection of w(long)  1 http://wordsketch.ling.sinica.edu.tw/ 2 http://dbo.sinica.edu.tw/SinicaCorpus/ 702 Student Papers w(long) can modify a wide range of nouns. For example, $tw(long)+natural type nouns, such as wY(long night), w(long road), w(long hair); $uw(long)+artifactual type nouns, such as wß_q(long movie), wLv(long title), wâTJ(long advertisement); $vw(long)+complex type nouns, such as _wvo(long speech), _wvSH(long lunch). 3.1.2 Polysemous Behavior of w(long) The interpretations of w(long) can be quite diverse when it modifies different nouns, as shown in the following two examples: $‘\\1Y}P̌W( _ w _ w v §S Æ Lp O<v0 just like in very long very long DE tunnel in walk like “It is just like walking in a very long tunnel.” $aN T N N _ w v SH0 he eat ASP a very long DE lunch “He had a very long lunch.” In $‘, w(long) is referring to the shape of §S(tunnel), which is a formal role value. In such a case, w(long) modifies the individual object. In $a, the interpretation needs the duration of an event. w(long) coerces the bare NP to an event reading."]},{"title":"3.2 Different adjectives modify one particular noun","paragraphs":["In this part, we discuss “adjective+Wfł((library)” construction to see how adjectives modify facets of the head noun Wfł((library). The qualia structure of Wfł((library) is shown below: CONSTITUTIVE = collections QUALIA = FORMAL = shape, color.... TELIC = provide knowledge AGENTIVE = build In the following table, the top ten modifiers of Wfł((library) ranked by F-score were extracted from Chinese Word Sketch Engine. The qualia roles that these adjectives select when it modifies Wfł((library) were annotated. Table 1: Adjective Modifiers of Wfł((library) Number Adjective Modifier Frequency F-score Qualia role 1 v{j#(decent) 1 12.53 formal+constitutive+telic+agentive 2 \\[(́silent) 1 10.45 formal PACLIC 24 Proceedings 703 3 Y’(large) 3 8.88 formal 4 j(luxury) 1 8.27 formal+constitutive+telic 5 T̂(famous) 1 7.44 formal+constitutive+telic+agentive 6 QxW(typical) 1 7.14 formal+constitutive+telic 7 S(old) 1 7.11 agentive 8 q‘(familiar) 1 6.2 (refer to the agent) 9 [et(integral) 1 6.1 formal+constitutive+telic 10 Y}(good) 1 3.75 formal+constitutive+telic+agentive  Through examining Wfł((library)’s qualia roles that different adjectives modify, we can find the following facts: (1) Some adjectives are able to modify multi-facet of a noun. Here we take the evaluative adjective Y}(good) as an example: bP wv NP Y}v Wfł( T «[⁄ 0 We really need a good library and medical room. “We really need a good library and medical room.” NPY}v Wfł((a good library) could be a library which is large and multifunctional with lots of collections and is well-built. These properties are the possible values of Wfł((library)’s qualia roles, as shown below below: FORMAL = large QUALIA = CONSTITUTIVE = collections TELIC = multifunctional AGENTIVE = build Y}(good) itself does not specify any facet of the head. It generally describes something with desirable and positive qualities. Similar examples are v{j#(decent), j(luxury), T̂(famous), QxW(typical), [et(integral). (2) Some adjectives only modify one facet of a noun. For example, Y’Wfł((large library) usually means that a library that is spacious. HereY’ (large) is a value of Wfł((library)’s formal role. SvWfł((old library) is a library which have been in existence for a long time. Here S(old) indicates the origin of a library, which is the agentive role of Wfł((library). 704 Student Papers (3) The semantic orientation of some adjectives is not pointing to the head noun, as shown in the following example. zN h!W pR0 N g 8̂ S» g q‘v Wfł(0 across campus, go to ASP most usually go most familiar library “Across the campus, I went to the library that I most usually went and was most familiar with.” Though q‘ (familiar) is modifying Wfł((library), it does not point to the property of Wfł ((library). It refers to the agent who is familiar with the library."]},{"title":"4 Conclusion and Future Work","paragraphs":["In summary, this study has the following findings. $tAn adjective can select different types of head nouns as arguments and an adjective may modify an individual or an event. $uThe qualia structure of a noun helps us better understand an adjective’s selectional preference.
