This paper deals with an aspectual classification of Korean and Japanese verbs based on Vendler (1967). Both of Korean and Japanese verbs are classified into 12 distinctive aspectual categories by their restrictions on time adverbials, progressive tenses and logical entailments. A well-established aspectual verb classes provide us not only with a better understanding of both languages, but also with an explicit explanation concerning some grammatical phenomena relevant to time. The aspectual classes of Korean verbs clarify the ambiguous semantic functions of so called Korean tense forms ‘-ess-‘ and ‘-essess-‘, while those of Japanese verbs elucidate the semantic functions of ‘sudeni’, the equivalent of ‘already’ in English, when it occurs with a variety of verbs in sentences.

We classify Korean and Japanese verbs into 12 distinct aspectual classes respectively on the basis of Vendler (1967).","The temporal characteristics of the Korean verbs are closely related to a variety of the interpretations of the Korean past tense forms ‘-ess-‘ and ‘-essess-‘ which have been controversial, and also the semantic distinctions of ‘te iru’ form of Japanese verbs combined with ‘sudeni’ result from the internal time structure of the verbs. Of the temporal properties inherent in the verbs, telicity1"," plays a significant role in relation to linguistic phenomena. Tense and aspect are concerned with time, but in different ways. Tense is a deictic category which locates a situation in time, while aspect is a non-deictic category which is a different way of viewing the internal constituency of a situation (Comrie,1976).","Two different definitions of aspect are given, i.e. one is the aspectual classes of verbs and the other is the aspectual forms of verbs. The first is called aktionsarten and the second is what are called the progressive, perfect, and resultative which the verbs show when combined with aspect markers. The verbs which have the same internal temporal structure form a certain aspectual class and the verbal behaviors of each aspectual class are differentiated syntactically and semantically. "]},{"title":"2 Vendler’s Classification of Verbs ","paragraphs":["Vendler classified English verbs into four aspectual classes by means of their compatibility with the three time adverbials, i.e. for-time interval, in-time interval, at-point of time; the possibility of progressive form and logical entailments. He distinguished states, activities, accomplishments and achievements. States lack the progressive form and co-occur with time adverbial ‘for-phrase’ which  1 Telicity means some verbs necessarily involve an end or goal in a way that other verbs don’t. PACLIC 24 Proceedings 471   shows the situation described by the verb lasts for a certain period of time. Activities can take the progressive form and co-occur with the time adverbial ‘for-phrase’. Accomplishments can take the progressive form and co-occur with the time adverbial ‘in-phrase’. ‘In-phrase’ represents the time which it takes for the situation to reach the goal. They have necessarily terminal points in their internal structures. Achievements lack the progressive form and occur with time adverbials ‘in-phrase’ and ‘at-phrase.’ The adverbial ‘at-phrase’ indicates the point of time at which the situation described by the verb takes place. It should be noted that activities co-occur only with ‘for-phrase’, while accomplishments co-occur only with ‘in-phrase. Vendler’s four verbal classes can be covered by the term ‘situation’",""]},{"title":"3 The Aspectual Classes of Korean and Japanese Verbs ","paragraphs":["The Korean and Japanese counterparts of time adverbials ‘at’, ‘for’, and ‘in’ are ‘ey’, ‘tongan’ and ‘maney’ in Korean and ‘ni’ ,‘kan’ and ‘de’ in Japanese respectively. The Korean and Japanese equivalents of progressive markers are ‘-ko issta’ and ‘-te iru’2 , which are shown in table 1.  Table 1 : Time adverbials and progressive markers in Korean and Japanese English Korean Japanese at ey ni for tongan kan in maney de be~ing -ko issta -te iru ","The first step of the aspectual classification of Korean and Japanese verbs is to separate two verbal families by the possibility of the progressive, and then to sub-classify each family in terms of restrictions on time adverbials, that is, whether or not the verb can co-occur with each of the time adverbials. Now we have 16 possible aspectual classes by means of Vendler’s four classificatory criteria which are applied independently of each other. Finally we get 12 different Korean aspectual classes as in table 2 and 12 different Japanese aspectual classes as in table 3. In these tables, O is marked when the verbs combined with ‘-ko issta’ or ‘-te iru’ exhibit progressive meaning, , whereas X is marked when they don’t. When the verbs combined with Korean ‘T-ey’ or Japanese ‘T-ni’ exhibit the moment at which pun.ual situations have taken place, O is marked, otherwise X is marked. When the verbs combined with Korean ‘T-tongan’ or Japanese ‘T-kan’ indicate that the situations described by the verb go on for the period of time, O is marked, otherwise X is marked. It should be noted that when the verbs combined with ‘T-tongan’ or ‘T-kan’ express the resultative meaning, which implies the state following the termination of the event, X is marked even though the sentences are grammatically correct. When Korean ‘T-maney’ or Japanese ‘T-de’ exhibit the time it takes for the situations described by the verb to terminate, O is marked. However, when they exhibit ingressive meaning, X is marked. The internal temporal structure of the verbs is established as in Figure 1.

Class 1: The combination of activities and achievements","[-stative] [-punctual] [-telic] (activities)","[-stative] [+punctual] [+telic] (achievements)  The Korean verb ‘chacta’ has two different internal time structures, i.e. those of activities (search) and achievements (find).

Japanese, however, ‘iku (go)’ and ‘ kuru (come)’ belong to achievements and when combined with ‘-te iru’, they allow only the resultative as in the following examples :  (3) a. tongsayng-i o-ko iss-ta.
