Evidentiality is one of the important issues in the recent studies of linguistic typology whereby the Korean evidentials are not so much talked about. In Korean the evidentiality is not so systematically represented as other grammatical categories such as tense or honorifics. But it does have some means for evidential expression. The past retrospective ending -deo- has this function. And the 'say' verb malhada underwent many kinds of formal reduction and contraction to develop various report/hearsay evidential markers which are very frequently used in colloquial speech. The 'see' verb boda expresses also the evidential meaning in the biclausal structure or as an auxiliary. Besides we have some other auxiliaries for this purpose. We propose two simple tests to distinguish the modal and evidential auxiliaries.

In some languages it is obligatory in every sentence, and there are also languages in which it is an optional category (Jacobsen, 1986; Aikhenvald, 2003a; Aikhenvald, 2004). According to Aikhenvald (2004: 1), about a quarter of world's langauges have obligatory evidentiality systems.","Evidentiality has been typically considered as one of the subcategories of modality (Palmer, 1985/2002; Willett, 1988; Frawley, 1992; Bybee et al. 1994). But recently some linguists are of the position that the two are separate categories (Bernd Heine, p.c., Aikhenvald, 2003a; de Haan, 2001, 2005; see also Nuyts, 2006: 2, de Haan, 2006: 57ff). This paper will take the second position and try to differentiate the two categories in Korean.","Since Chafe & Nichols (eds.) (1986) evidentiality has been one of the important issues in the recent studies of linguistic typology (cf. Johanson & Utas (eds.), 2000; Aikhenvald & Dixon (eds.), 2003; Aikhenvald, 2004). The Korean evidentials are thereby not so much talked about, although we observe some interesting phenomena in this language. Jae-mog Song (2002) might be the first attempt on the topic. It is concerned with the verbal ending -deo-, a visual evidential marker. In Korean we find some further meaningful evidential markers. This paper explores the evidential markers/expressions in Korean in general to contribute to the typological discussions in this area."]},{"title":"2 The evidential ending -deo /-deon/-deoni","paragraphs":["PACLIC 24 Proceedings 895   Among Korean grammarians the ending -deo- is traditionally categorized as a past retrospective marker (cf. Hyun-Bae Choi, 1937; Ung Heo, 1987) or a mood or aspect marker (cf. Ho-min Sohn, 1975; Hyo-Sang Lee, 1991). Recently it is analyzed as an evidential marker by Jae-mog Song (2002). Primarily it is used as a visual/sensory evidential (cf. (1)-(2)).  (1) Mary-ga bang-eseo ja-deo-ra. Mary-NOM room-LOC sleep-SEN-DCL. 'I saw that Mary was sleeping in the room. ' (2) Mary-ga bang-eseo ja-deo-nde. Mary-NOM room-LOC sleep-SEN-DCL. 'I saw that Mary was sleeping in the room. '  If combined with a ‘say’ verb, the ending -deo- develops a report/hearsay evidential (cf. (3)-(4)).  (3) Peter-ga [Mary-ga ja-n-da-go] malhayeo-ss-da.

' ","The report/hearsay meaning came from the ‘say’ verb -malhada combined with the evidential marker -deo-. We may say that this ending functions yet as a sensory evidential here. But in the meanwhile the malha-deo-ra(say-SEN-DCL) developed to a separate ending and functions as report/hearsay evidential by itself. The developmental process may be explained as follows: In Korean we also use the verb hada, literally ‘do’, as ‘say’ verb instead of the full form -malhada, i.e. instead of (4) we can say this as in (5a). In (5a) we may delete the COMP to get the sentence (5b).  (5) a. Peter-ga [Mary-ga ja-n-da-go] ha-deo-ra.

In this sentence we have namely two verbs, jan-da and ha-deo-ra. The first is related to the subject as main verb. But the latter is not directly related to the subject of the sentence. It rather relates to the position or attitude of the speaker. We may consider this an evidential auxiliary. 1 ","","(6) Mary-ga ja-n-da ha-deo-ra. Mary-NOM sleep-PRS-DCL do/say-SEN-DCL.

In present Korean, ja-n-da-deo-ra as shown in sentence (7) is written as a single word. But it is pointed out that the word status of the expression ja-n-da-deo-ra is dubious, because semi-final endings can be inserted between -da- and -deo-. In this case it is analyzed as a simple contracted form. The same point could be argued in the other contracted constructions below.","2"," Now there are some interesting examples in (8) which are related to this discussion. The","evidential function of deo in (8a) is obvious, which is supported by the ungrammatical sentence","(8b).","3","But deo in (8c-d) seems to be something other than an evidential marker.

And this may be an important reason why we should not classify -deo as a tense marker. 4 See Haspelmath (1993), Willet (1988), LaPolla (2003), Aikhenvald (2004, chap. 9) among others for the similar","origin of evidential markers.

"]},{"title":"6 Concluding Remarks","paragraphs":["In Korean the evidentiality is not an obligatory category and hence not a systematic one such as tense or honorifics. But we find a lot of means for evidential expressions in various linguistic levels, i.e. in the morphological, lexical and also in the syntactic level. Besides the semi-final ending -deo-, the only Korean evidential marker discussed by now, the verbs of 'say' and 'see' are playing thereby important roles. The construction [S + malhada ‘say’] undergoes various contractions to develop evidential endings. The verb boda ‘see’ in its infinite form and passive form expresses also the evidential meaning in biclausal structures. Besides, we have some evidential auxiliaries. We proposed two simple tests to distinguish the modal and evidential auxiliaries. They are only first trials and should be refined further. There are topics which are closely related to evidentiality: mirativity, the interactions of evidentiality and tense/aspect, and the person of the subject among others. These are not covered in this paper and we leave them for our future research."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Aikhenvald, A. Y. 2003a. Evidentiality in Typological Perspective. In A. Y.
