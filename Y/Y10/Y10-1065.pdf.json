Thee was not as lage of a gap n the famng o manne encong as was ognally expecte between m an hgh level leanes of Englsh. Howeve, n makng a secon goup vson base on length of tme n Ameca, ths stuy was able to uncove the fact that length of tme n an Englsh speakng county seems to have a geate effect on the acquston of Englsh moton event famng than peceve Englsh ablty (test scoes) oes. Ths scovey hnts at the vey lkely possblty that the nput pove to secon language Englsh leanes n both Chna an Japan s not aequately epesentatve of natual Englsh moton expessons. Hopefully, the esults an conclusons awn n ths stuy can be use to bette secon language eucaton of Englsh n these countes.","Fom the esults an conclusons awn n ths pape, the followng avce coul be consee n the futue of Englsh as a secon language eucaton:","1) When teachng about moton events, showng stuents Englsh's manne of satellte-famng an encong manne on the veb shoul be shown fst. Although t woul be ease fo stuents of veb-fame languages especally to lean Englsh path vebs such as “ente” an “ext”, such phases woul be lkely to fosslze quckly, esultng n less natual Englsh speakng an a weake gasp of Englsh's stana moton event conflaton pattens.","2) Some popula pattens taught n Englsh as a Secon Languages, such as “go to X by Y” (whee X s the goal an Y s the means of tanspotaton) ae easly acque, but ae athe unnatual n Englsh (no natve Englsh speakes use such a patten once out of 209 esponses n the ata). Futhemoe, they pomote the cognton of ungammatcal Englsh, such as “I went to the stoe by unnng”, an ae easly fosslze. Such pattens shoul be econsee n secon language Englsh eucaton.","3) Moe effot shoul be expene to bng leanes to an unestanng of the vaous meanngs that Englsh pepostons can encoe, such as path of moton. Futue eseach n the aea of secon language moton event famng acquston shoul PACLIC 24 Proceedings 571 hopefully bul on the expement epote n ths pape. Ieally, such expementaton woul nclue low, m, an hgh level leanes, an woul hopefully eal wth languages fom at least two ffeent geogaphcal locatons. It woul also pove benefcal to look futhe nto the ffeences of acquston between goups ve by test scoes an length of tme lvng n a county n whch the taget language s spoken natvely. Once futhe eseach s pefome, t woul pove benefcal to secon language eucaton to attempt to test altenatve methos of teachng to help bng leanes' secon language poucton futhe away fom a pouct of the L1 tansfe, an close to that of natve speakes."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Beaves, J., Levn, B., & Tham, S.
