{"sections":[{"title":"The future role of language resources for natural language parsing (We wonâ€™t be able to rely on Pierre Vinken forever... or will we have to?)","paragraphs":["Julia Hockenmaier Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois, 201 N Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801-2302, United States","juliahmr@illinois.edu","The transformation that natural language parsing has undergone since the nineties would have been impossible without the availability of syntactically annotated corpora such as the Penn Treebank and similar resources for other languages. By now, it has become increasingly difficult to increase parsing accuracy on our standard data sets. But as we move to other domains of text, or aim to recover richer representations that are required for natural language understanding, it is also clear that parsing is far from being a solved task. In this panel, I would like to initiate a discussion about the kind of language resources needed to advance natural language parsing. I will also reflect on what the translation of existing resources into other grammatical representations has taught us about treebank design.
