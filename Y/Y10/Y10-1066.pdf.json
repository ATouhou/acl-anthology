These two types of topics, however, are available only when the Davidsonian argument is bound via different means: the former gets bound in the existential domain, while the latter is constrained by the generic operator. Concerning the situation variable constrainer in sentences with individual-level predicates, we argue that besides general additional information, like adverbials ‘usually’ in English, ‘tongchang’/’yibande’, ‘yaoshi... jiu’ (if... then), etc, in Mandarin, bare NPs with kind-denoting and predicates denoting inherent property will help accommodate the generic operator, and thus a generic situation topic is available and sentences with indefinite subject NPs and individual-level predicates thus get licensed. As a consequence, we suggest that the necessary condition for the indefinite subject sentence should be that the indefinite subject NP is interpreted as specific or a stage topic/generic situation topic is available.

Introduction","paragraphs":["It has long been noted that the distribution of sentences with indefinite subject NPs is quite restricted, especially with respect to Mandarin Chinese which does not allow an indefinite NP to appear in the subject or topic position unless it is interpreted as specific (see Chao 1968, Li and Thompson 1981, Lee 1986, Tsai 2001, Xu 1996, among many others) or gets bound by an existential or a generic operator (Pan 2009). Some recent studies, however, claim that it is not correct to treat sentences with indefinite subjects uniformly without distinguishing between stage-level and individual-level predicates (Erteschik-Shir1997, de Swart 1999), as shown by sentences from English (1)-(2) and Mandarin (3)-(4), which clearly shows that both these two languages allow sentences with the indefinite subject and a stage-level predicate, as in (1a) and (3a), but not sentences with the indefinite subject and an individual-level predicate, as in (1b) and (3b). However, when the subject is a bare NP, sentences with individual-level predicates are acceptable, as in (2b) and (4b), contrasting with the indefinite subjects in (2a) and (4a): English","(1) a.

Different approaches have been proposed to account for the contrast above, and no complete consensus, however, have been achieved on the necessary or sufficient conditions of sentences with indefinite subject NPs. Li (1997), concentrating on the semantic difference between DP and NumP (numeral phrase) subjects, proposes that both DPs and NumPs, corresponding to CPs and IPs in clause structures, can directly function as arguments. Li’s proposal thus makes a good predication that sentences like (5) are acceptable, which abounds in Mandarin and named as the pair-matching sentence in Lu and Pan (2009). ","(5) a.

Overview 2.1 Background: Stage-level Predicates vs. Individual-level Predicates","paragraphs":["Carlson (1977) differentiates stage-level predicates from individual-level predicates, which has been widely reported to exist cross-linguistically and these two types of predicates behave differently on several aspects, as listed in (7)-(10) below, which shows that stage-level predicates are compatible with temporal adverbials, locatives, perception sentences and there-sentences, but individual-level predicates are not:  Temporal adverbials","(7) a. *John was tall yesterday/last month/a year ago b. John was drunk yesterday/last month/a year ago","Locatives (8) a.*John is a linguist in his car","b. John is always sick in France","Perception sentences (9) a. *I saw John a linguist","b. I saw John drunk","There-sentence (10) a.*There are two men intelligent","b. There are two men drunk  Basically, there are two competing approaches to the distinction between stage-level and individual-level predicates, and the central point of the debate lies in whether there is an external event/situation argument in the individual-level predicate, as the stage-level predicate does. Krazter (1989/1995) argues that these two types of predicates differ from each other in having different argument structures, and only stage-level predicates have the so-called Davidsonian event argument in their argument structure. An important paradigm which Kratzer can easily explain on the basis of her hypothesis is the when-conditional sentence, as shown in (11) below, as the sentence (11a) with an individual-level predicate is unacceptable since there is no variable introduced by the predicate for the adverb of quantification (Q-adverb), which thus violates the vacuous quantification (Krazter 1989/1995); whereas the sentence (11b) with a stage-level predicate can provide an extra free variable for Q-adverb, thereby no violation of vacuous quantification arises and the sentence is thus well-formed.","(11) a.* When John knows Latin, he always knows it well.","b. When John speaks Latin, he always speaks it well. However, Chierchia (1995) proposes that both the stage-level and individual-level predicate have the Davidsonian event/situation argument, but the former differs from the latter in that the external event/situation argument in the latter is inherently bound by the generic operator induced in the predicate given. The assumption obviously has several advantages over Krazter’s operation. Firstly, Krazter’s (1989/1995) use of when-conditional sentences as a strong piece of evidence to her assumption is quite questionable, which should not be taken as a challenge to Chierchia’s proposal. According to De Hoop and De Swart (1989), not all stage-level predicates are compatible with when-conditional sentences, and the problem of the contrast like (11) in fact lies in whether the situations denoted by the predicates can be iterated, as shown in (12), in which ‘die’, ‘destroy’ and ‘kill’ are typical stage-level predicates, when-conditional sentences with them, however, are unacceptable: PACLIC 24 Proceedings 575","(12) a. *When John dies, he is unhappy b. *When John destroys this house, he destroys it thoroughly c. *When John kills this rabbit, he kills it cruelly","Moreover, Chierchia’s proposal can be extended to the well-known puzzle, as shown in (13)-(14)","below, in which a verb that is normally classified as stable can in certain cases be reclassified as","transient. Under Chierchia’s analysis, such changeability between stage-level and individual-level","predicates is predicated since the nature of the difference between these two types of predicates lies","in whether the Davidsonian argument is bound by the existential operator or the generic one.

"]},{"title":"2.2 Stage Topics and Indefinite Subjects","paragraphs":["The first attempt to connect the Davidsonian argument and indefinite subject sentences is Erteschik-Shir (1997), who attributes the contrast on acceptability in data (1)-(2) above, repeated in (15)-(16) below, to the distinction between stage-level and individual-level predicates by adopting Krazter’s (1989/1995) proposal mentioned above. According to Erteschik-Shir, sentences with stage-level predicates, as in (15), have stage topics, which correspond to Kratzer’s spatio-temporal argument, referring to the slice or zone of time and space within which an event takes place, and are rather discourse specified if not overt, i.e., usually being fixed as ‘here’ and ‘now’ of the current discourse; by contrast, individual-level predicates have no such spatio-temporal argument, thus sentences with the individual-level predicate and the indefinite subject NP are not unavailable under the assumption that a sentence must have a topic, like (16a). The acceptability of sentences with individual-level predicates and indefinite subjects, however, can be improved if the indefinite NP is available to be interpreted as kind or generic reading, as in (16b), or an introduction is involved which provides a stage topic, as in (17).","(15) a. A man arrived b. It is raining","(16) a.*A boy loves a girl b. Dogs are intelligent","(17) a. Once upon a time, a boy loved a girl","b. Look out! A boy has a gun. (Erteschik-Shir 1997) De Swart (1999) provides a similar account for the contrast above, which differs from Erteschik-Shir (1997) in that she argues that the unacceptability of (16a) lies in the fact that the Davidsonian argument in an individual-level predicate is inherently non-specifying, which thereby cannot function as the topic, since an individual-level predicate describes properties which are not tied to a particular location in time and place, following Chierchia (1995).  576 Student Award Papers The analyses given by Erteschik-Shir (1997) and de Swart (1999) above, however, are quite problematic. First of all, they do not explain why sentences like (16a), cannot be interpreted as generic, as (16b) does. Suppose that a bare NP is kind-denoting, but not an ‘a/an-NP’, following Carlson (1977). However, the problem still remains since English, as well as Mandarin Chinese, is abundant in generic/kind denoting sentences with indefinite NPs and individual-level predicates, as shown in (18) and (19). Moreover, the question why a generic Davidsonian event argument cannot function as the generic topic, just as the generic NP does in (16b), is neither touched in Erteschik-Shir’s (1997) nor answered clearly in De Swart’s (1999).","(18) a.

In other words, the so-called Davidsonian variable takes effect on the process of topicalization unless they are introduced into and get bound correctly via different means. Also, as far as the topicality is concerned, we’d like to suggest that both the bound Davidsonian event and situation argument function as a topic, which saves sentences with indefinite subjects from being unacceptable. "]},{"title":"3.1 Stage-level Predicates: e-binding (constrainer)","paragraphs":["The idea that the Davidsonian e variable must be bound as a matter of fact is not a novel one. Huang (1996/2005), based on Parson (1990), proposes the Hypothesis on Constraining the Event Argument (HCEA), which says that ‘the event argument (e-argument) introduced and carried by a syntactic predicate must be properly constrained by some morphologically or lexically overt elements, and only an overtly constrained e-argument is available for quantification at the first stage of interpretation’. Following Huang, I argue that tenses in English are able to play the role of e-binding or constrainer, as in (21); whereas in Chinese, some other appropriate elements serve to constrain PACLIC 24 Proceedings 577 the e-argument, including time, location, aspects and manner adverbial phrases, etc, as in (22) below, since Chinese does not have tense (Hu, et al, 2001).","(21) a.

The accommodation of generic operator in natural languages, however, is much complicated. In this section, we attempt to discuss the cases with the generic operator accommodation both in English and Mandarin Chinese.  Roughly speaking, the simple present tense, adverbials like ‘usually’, ‘if/when-conditions, modalities, etc. in English can facilitate the accommodation of the generic operator, which then takes the s variable as argument and binds it, as regulated by the rule of the vacuous quantification (Krazter 1989/1995); therefore, the sentences in (23) with a generic topic are well-formed. Correspondingly, adverbials like ‘tongchang’, ‘yibande’ conditional connectives, like ‘ruguo’, modalities ‘yinggai’, etc, in Mandarin can serve to constrain the s variable in individual-level predicates, as demonstrated below.","(23) a. A dog is usually intelligent","b. A cowboy usually carries a gun.","","(24) a.

Note that sentences with bare NP subjects and indefinite subjects, however, behave differently, especially when the predicates are individual-level. To be much more precise, additional information, such as adverbial quantifier ‘usually’ in English, ‘tongchang’/’yibande’, ‘yaoshi... jiu’ (if... then), etc, in Mandarin, is necessary in sentences with indefinite NP subjects, but not in sentences with bare NP subjects, as shown in (25) and (26) below:","(25) a.

Thereby we’d like to suggest that the key of the problem above lie in the genericity expressing. Following Carlson (1977) that bare NPs are kind-denoting, one can say that the default reading of sentences with bare NPs is the kind reading, which is thus compatible with genericity (modal universal), while an indefinite NP is not.  In addition, a sentence with the indefinite subject NP and individual-level predicate is acceptable when the property of the predicate given expresses the inherent property of the subject NP in the sense of Burton-Roberts (1977), which provides a good clue for the generic operator accommodation via the help of world knowledge. Therefore, sentences like (27), but not (28), are well-formed.","(27) a. A beaver builds dams. b. A tomato contains Vc.","c. A gentleman opens doors for ladies. ","(28) a. *A dog is intelligent","b. *A boy loves a girl  The distinction between (27) and (28) above becomes quite sharp with respect to the test of ‘to be’ constructions, in which the properties denoted by the predicates are inherent part of the subject NPs. Note that sentences like (27) are changeable with ‘to be’ constructions, whereas sentences in (28) are incompatible with ‘to be’ constructions, as shown in (29) and (30), respectively.","(29) a.

Precisely, the existential Davidsonian argument in sentences with stage-level PACLIC 24 Proceedings 579 predicates functions as the stage topic, and the generic one in sentences with individual-level predicates is able to function as the generic situation topic. Assuming further that more than one topic is allowed in the topic area, although it is not necessary, NPs in the subject position thus can be a topic or a pure subject depending on the discourse consistency. If that is true, sentences without context are generally ambiguous with respect to the topic-comment configuration. Taking the following two sentences as an example, one can see that sentences like (31) and (32) have two distinguished topic-comment structures.","(31) zuotian, yige gongren cong chuangkou diao le xialai. yesterday, one-MW worker from window-seat fall LE off-come 'Yesterday, a worker fell down from a window seat.'

The sole difference between these two configurations is that the subject NP ‘yi-ge gongren’ (one worker) in the latter must be interpreted as specific to conform to the so-called topic constraint, but no such requirement for the former.  Similarly, sentences with individual-level predicates are also ambiguous with different topic-comment configurations, as shown in (32) above, in which the structure (a) takes the generic situation as the topic, and the left as a whole is the comment; whereas in the structure (b) both the generic situation and kind-denoting NP are topics, and the rest is the comment. "]},{"title":"4 Conclusion and the Problem for Future Studies","paragraphs":["Unlike Erteschik-Shir (1997) and de Swart (1999), we have shown in the sections above that the generic Davidsonian situation argument in sentences with individual-level predicates also can function as a topic, as the existential Davidsonian event argument does in sentences with stage-level predicates. This so-called Davidsonian event or situation argument, however, must get bound via different means before they take effect on the process of topicalization. Briefly, it is bound by the existential operator in sentences with stage-level predicates, and by the generic operator in sentences with individual-level predicates. Moreover, under the assumption that every sentence must have a topic, we also have uncovered the necessary condition for a sentence with an indefinite subject, namely that it is acceptable if the indefinite subject NP can be interpreted as specific, or a stage topic / generic topic is available.  One more question why the indefinite NPs in English and Mandarin behave differently with respect to genericity, however, remains unanswered in this paper. Roughly speaking, Mandarin tends to use bare NPs to express genericity instead of indefinite NP ‘yi-Cl N’, which is normal in English; and the distribution of indefinite NP ‘yi-Cl N’ in Mandarin is much restricted than that in English, as 580 Student Award Papers shown in (31). The question, however, will not affect the solution we have presented above and we will leave it for future research","(33) a.
