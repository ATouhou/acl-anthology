The present work deals with the extraction of emotional expressions and tagging of English blog sentences with Ekman’s six basic emotion tags and any of the three intensities: low, medium and high.

Application of admissible tag sequences and a class-splitting technique improves the system’s performance and reduces the label bias problem of SVM. The supervised system outperforms the baseline system and achieves average F-Scores of 82.72%, 76.74% and 89.21% for emotional expressions, sentential emotion tags and intensities respectively on 565 gold standard test sentences. A comparative evaluation shows that sentential emotion tagging based on emotional expressions, intensities and context features bridges the gap of identifying sentential emotion depending only on words.

Emotion identification from natural language texts has drawn the attention of several information processing communities, e.g. reviews (Turney, 2002), news (Lin et al., 2007), Question Answering (Wilson et al., 2005), Information Retrieval (Pang and Lee, 2008).","Several efforts have been made by the natural language processing researchers to identify emotion at different level of granularities such as word, sentence or document (Ku et al., 2006; Das and Bandyopadhyay, 2009b; Das and Bandyopadhyay, 2010). But in many domains of text, the values of individual phrases may bear little relation to the overall sentiment expressed by the text. Just like words, phrases are considered as the informative and emotion expressive units of any sentence and are used in identifying document level emotion tags (McDonald et al., 2007). Hence, the current dependence on individual word level information to identify sentential emotion has motivated the search for phrase level clues.","The present task extracts the emotional expressions (word/phrase) from each of the English blog sentences and assigns any of the Ekman’s (1993) six basic emotion tags along with any of the three intensity types: low, medium and high to each sentence. Blog is one of the crucial, PACLIC 24 Proceedings 95  communicative and informative repository of text based emotional contents in the Web 2.0 (Lin et al., 2007). The English blog corpus (Aman and Szpakowicz, 2007) annotated with emotional expressions, sentential emotion tags and intensities is considered to accomplish our present task.","The baseline system identifies emotional expressions, sentential emotion tags and intensities. Sentences are passed through the Stanford Dependency Parser (Marneffe et al., 2006) to identify the dependency relations. Emotional expressions are identified using WordNet Affect (Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004). Different types of dependency relations of the parsed sentences provide positional, as well as intensity related hints to the emotional expressions. The evaluation on 565 gold standard test sentences gives the F-Scores of 62.44%, 56.97% and 79.01% for emotional expressions, sentential emotion tags and intensities respectively.","The best emotion feature set for the Support Vector Machine (SVM) based supervised framework is identified based on the F-Scores obtained from 358 development sentences. The features like emotion words, intensifiers, negations, conjuncts and discourse markers obtain high Information Gain (InfoGain) on the development sentences. The unnecessary words, which carry no emotion features, yield low Information Gain (InfoGain) and are filtered out. The performance of the supervised system is further improved by identifying the admissible tag sequences and a class splitting technique. Emotion pairs like happy-surprise, angry-disgust, and angry-sad and intensity pairs like high-medium and medium-low show the problem in sentential emotion and intensity tagging. Adding a special feature of emotional composition that identifies the closeness between two emotion types solves the problem. Overall, the supervised system achieves average F-Scores of 82.72%, 76.74% and 89.21% for emotional expressions, sentential emotion tags and intensities on 565 gold standard test sentences respectively. The supervised system outperforms the baseline system significantly and also performs better in terms of F-scores compared to the accuracy values of the word level system (Das and Bandyopadhyay, 2009a).","The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 surveys the related work. Pre-processing is described in Section 3. The baseline system is discussed in Section 4. Section 5 describes a supervised framework for identifying the emotional components. Experimental results are discussed in Section 6. Finally Section 7 concludes the paper."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["The earlier works on polarity shifters and prior or contextual polarity approaches for sentiment analysis are described in (Polanyi and Zaenen, 2004; Kim and Hovy, 2004). Another related work described in (Wilson et al., 2005) gives the ground to analyze sentiment at phrase levels. The tasks described in (Meena and Prabhakar, 2007) determine the sentential sentiment based on the phrase level information considering the impact of conjuncts or intensifiers. Majority of the above studies are carried out for sentiment expressions whereas our present approach aims to identify emotional expressions and assigns the emotion tags and intensities to the sentences.","In order to estimate affects in text, the model proposed in (Neviarouskaya et al., 2007) processes symbolic cues and employs natural language processing techniques for word/phrase/sentence level analysis, considering relations among words in a sentence. The current trend in the emotion analysis area is exploring machine learning techniques (Sebastiani, 2002), which considers the problem as text categorization or analogous to topic classification and underscores the difference between machine learning methods and human-produced baseline models (Alm et al., 2005). As large blog data set is suitable for machine learning models, several supervised and unsupervised machine learning classification techniques on blog data for comparative evaluation have been carried out (Mishne and Rijke 2006). Affective text shared task on news headlines at SemEval 2007 for emotion and valence level identification (Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2007) has drawn the focus to this field. In contrast, our present task extracts the emotional expressions and identifies the sentential emotion tags and intensities based 96 Regular Papers on intensifier, negations and conjuncts. The incorporation of Information Gain Based pruning (IGBP) and class splitting techniques are the contributions in present task."]},{"title":"3 Pre-Processing","paragraphs":["In the present study, we have used the English blog corpus described in (Aman and Szpakowicz, 2007). The sentences are tagged with single or multiple emotion tags and intensities. Emotional expressions are also annotated in the corpus. The whole corpus is divided into training, development and test sets containing 2500, 300 and 500 sentences with single emotion tags respectively. In addition to that, 200, 58 and 65 sentences of mixed emotion types are considered for training, development and test respectively.","The emotion word lists, WordNet Affect (Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004) is available for Ekman’s six basic emotions in English. The six lists are used to obtain the emotion or affect words present in the emotional expressions that in turn contribute for identifying sentential emotion tags. The blog corpus contains different emoticons (,, ) that represent different types of emotions. No prior knowledge was given for the emoticons in the corpus. Hence, the emoticons are replaced by the appropriate emotion words using a manually prepared knowledgebase.","The input sentences are passed through the Stanford Parser (Marneffe et al., 2006), a probabilistic lexicalized parser containing 45 different part of speech (POS) tags from the Pen Treebank tagset. Different types of dependency relations and POS tags are retrieved successively from the parsed data. The parsed results are used in the baseline and supervised systems."]},{"title":"4 Baseline System","paragraphs":["The overall emotion expressed in a sentence depends on the emotional constituents present in the phrases or in the words along with other surrounding contextual hints (Neviarouskaya et al., 2007). The emotional components present in an emotional expression are represented as an anchoring vector. Each slot of the vector is filled by the information extracted from the emotional expression such as emotion or affect word, intensifier, negation and conjuncts."]},{"title":"4.1 Extracting Emotional Expressions","paragraphs":["We extract all component words from the dependency relations that contain at least one emotion word, and match them against the WordNet Affect lists. The words present in the extracted relations are then treated as candidate seeds for the anchoring vectors representing emotional expressions. Identification of an emotional expression containing a single emotion word is straightforward. But, we include the positional information about words from the dependency relations in order to identify long emotional expressions. Consecutive words that appear in the dependency relations and contain at least one emotion word are identified as an emotional expression. For example, in the following sentence, the dependency relations containing the emotion word ”angry” and the consecutive component words ”really”, ”angry” and ”rant” with position number 9, 10 and 11 constitute the underlined emotional phrase.","“But the rest of it came across as really angry rant”. [advmod(angry-10,really-9), amod(rant-11,angry-10) ]","In many cases, the components of a given emotional expression are separated by articles (e.g. a, an, the) conjuncts (e.g. and, or, but etc.), negations (e.g. not, neither etc.) or intensifiers (so, very, less, much). The aim is to accumulate the words for constructing the emotional expressions based on the positional clues with maximum coverage of the contributory components. Based on empirical testing, the limit for the maximum difference between the successive positions is set at 2~3. The technique is used for identifying longer emotional expressions. For example, in the following sentence, two emotional words ”angry” and ”frustrated” are not consecutive but are joined by a conjunct ”or” and separated by 2 positions. PACLIC 24 Proceedings 97  “We feel angry or frustrated with others or ourselves”. [acomp(feel-2, angry-3), acomp(feel-2, frustrated-5), conj_or (angry-3, frustrated-5)]","In addition to the dependency relations containing emotion words alone, other dependency relations such as advmod()[adverbial modifier], amod() [adjectival modifier], neg [negation modifier], conj_( ) [conjunct] are also extracted as these relations carry emotional intensifiers that contribute towards tagging the sentences with emotion tags and intensity. Each emotional expression is tagged with the WordNet Affect classes in which the words of the emotional expression occur. Each of the sentences is also tagged with Ekman’s six emotion tags that are associated with its corresponding emotional expressions. Each sentence may contain more than one emotion tag. Otherwise, the sentences are treated as neutral sentences."]},{"title":"4.2 Identification of Intensity","paragraphs":["Three types of intensities (I) (e.g. low (L), medium (M) and high (H)) have been considered in the present task. Two types of intensifiers (INTF) such as positive and negative are considered for assigning intensities to the sentences. The intensifiers may be present inside an emotional expression. The POS categories of the preceding and following elements of the emotion word in an emotional expression are identified from the parsed sentences. The JJ (adjective) and RB (adverb) tagged elements are considered as the candidate of intensifiers. To identify the polarity of an intensifier, each of them is searched in the SentiWordNet (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006). If the candidate word is found in the SentiWordNet , then the positive and negative scores of the word are retrieved from the SentiWordNet . The intensifier is classified as either positive (pos) or negative (neg) for which the average retrieved score is higher. A list of commonly used negative words has been prepared manually. The words present in the neg [negation modifier] type dependency relation are also considered as the negative words. Some rules (as shown in Table 1) are applied to capture the role of different intensifiers and negations in marking the sentences with post emotion tags along with intensity.","Table 1: Rules for tagging an emotional anchoring vector with intensity.","(Sentence with prior tag [EW])[Example] post tag [EW_I]","([EW])[happy] [EW_M] (INTFpos, [EW]) [very, happy] [EW_H] (INTFneg, [EW]) [less, surprised] [EW_L]","(NEG, [EW]) [not, happy] [EW_L]","(NEG, INTFpos, [EW]) [not, very, happy] [EW_M]","(NEG, INTFneg, [EW]) [not, less, disappointed] [EW_H]"]},{"title":"4.3 Sentence Level Tagging","paragraphs":["Each sentence is assigned with the emotion tags according to its corresponding emotional expressions. The emotion tags are considered as prior tags to each sentence. The final sentential emotion tagging is done based on the intensity assignment along with the role of conjuncts.","Rule based strategies have been adopted to cope with conjuncts. Emotional expressions containing conjuncts do not change the sentential emotion tags given for the corresponding emotional expressions. In the following example, the sequence of negation (nothing), conjunct (but) and emotion word (sorry) does not change the emotion tag, “sad”. Robert feels nothing but sorry for the common people”. Sometimes conjuncts present between two or more emotional expressions do not play any role to change the sentential emotion tags that were already associated with the sentence. For example, “They were very angry at that moment but you managed the situation with your impressive quality.” The rules are shown in Table 2. The symbol “X” stands for any of the three intensities as identified for the emotional expressions. 98 Regular Papers","The baseline system achieves the average F-Scores of 62.44%, 56.97% and 79.01% for emotional expressions, sentential emotion tags and intensities respectively on 500 gold standard test sentences of single emotion tags and 65 sentences of multiple emotion tags.

Other words are tagged as neutral (emo_ntrl). The sentential emotion and intensity tagging to the sentences is based on the emotional expressions along with other discourse level features. First a set of standard pre-processing steps is carried out, viz., tokenizing, stemming and stop word removal. Tools provided by Rapidminer’s 1","text plug in were used for these tasks.

In case of a tie in majority voting, the intensities associated with the sentences are considered for assigning the final tag. The preferred ordering sequence is high > medium > low which means that the emotion tag with high intensity is assigned at the sentence level over the emotion tag with medium intensity and so on. A noticeable improvement of precision is achieved for sentential emotion tagging. It is observed that the sentences with high intensity type improve the precision rather than low or medium type. The reason may be more explicit usage of high intensity than the others. The individual contributions of three types of intensities in calculating the precision score are shown in Table 5.
