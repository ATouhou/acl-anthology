We aim at studying these semantic structures at both a global, lexicographic level, using lexicons, synonymy and translation dictionaries and at a more localised, experimental level, using data collected in parallel psycholinguistic experiments in French and Mandarin. After presenting our research project, the data we need to carry it out and the available resources, we analyse several linguistic issues arising from the structural differences between the French and Mandarin lexicons. We then explain the construction of the synonymy and translation networks from the available resources and detail specific choices that will enable us to produce meaningful experimental results based on this prepared data. Two kinds of networks are built: lexicographic networks and smaller movie-based networks extracted from experimental recordings. We conclude by describing how we intend to use this data.

We suppose that we can trace concepts of a community of speakers by detecting salient patterns in the networks constituted by all the words of the language, linked by synonymy. There is a long standing debate on the question whether there exist universal cognitive concepts (Pinker, 1994) whether they necessarily translate into language, or on the contrary whether the absence of universal concepts in the variety of languages in the world calls for an entirely different account of human cognition (Evans and Levinson, 2009). Evans and Levinson also argue that understanding the diversity of languages is fundamental to a realistic account of human cognition by psycholinguistics. We attempt, in this project, to move one step further than the debate over linguistic universals, and to create a measure of similarity between lexico-semantic concepts across languages. In this approach, the notion of a common concept, and a fortiori of universal concepts is broadened, because, more than asserting whether concepts are common to several languages, we aim to measure their similarity which can cover the whole range of possible values. ⋆","The research presented in this paper is supported by the ANR-NSC (France-Taiwan) bilateral project M3 (Modeling","and Measurement of Meaning).

In order to model this , paradigmatic structure we study synonymy graphs, that are networks of words connected by an edge if they are synonyms. This approach to studying lexicons has proved to be fruitfull for example in (Gaume, 2008; Gaume et al., 2008). The necessary lexical knowledge to build such networks is usually extracted from electronic dictionaries of synonyms, thesauruses, lexical databases such as WordNets or even participatory resources such as Wiktionary (Navarro et al., 2009; Sajous et al., 2010). These networks, being real word complex networks, have Hierarchical Small World (HSW) characteristics (Gaume, 2008). One of these characteristics is a strong clustering: there are salient sets of vertices (clusters or communities) that are significantly more connected to each other than to the rest of the network. Formally defining and detecting such clusters is out of scope of this paper but is currently the subject of intense research (Fortunato, 2010). We assume that these clusters denote concepts, as they highlight semantic associations and sets of words with a strong confluence as defined in (Gaume et al., 2008).","The cross-linguistic study of semantic associations that we will carry out in subsequent stages of this research project is based on lexical networks. The subject of this paper is the construction of these networks from available lexicographic resources: we describe the construction of a French synonymy graph, a Mandarin synonymy graph and a Mandarin-French translation graph.","So far we have introduced the long term goal of our research in cross-linguistic lexico-semantic similarity analysis at the global level of lexicons of whole languages. However as seen in (Evans and Levinson, 2009) the in-depth cross-linguistic analysis of some specific semantic concepts is interesting to study language acquisition. Numerous experimental studies of lexico-semantic typology have been carried out on small subsets of the lexicon (Vanhove, 2008; Koptjevskaja-Tamm, 2008; Levinson et al., 2003). We will also focus on a subset of the lexicon that was collected with the movie experiment: children and adults of French and Mandarin language were asked to describe the same 17 movies. Based on the sets of verbs produced in this experiment, we built the French an Mandarin synonymy subgraphs. Synonymy relations were extracted from entire synonymy graphs. We also built Mandarin-French translation graphs, both as a restrictions of the entire translation graph and as graphs based on more exhaustive, human annotated, translation data. This was feasible because the size of the considered data was reasonable. We will subsequently refer to these (sub)graphs as movie graphs.","The next section is devoted to describing the lexicographic and experimental resources on which the construction of the graphs is based. Section 3 describes specific linguistic issues we had to address to be able to compare Mandarin and French lexicons. Section 4 describes the construction and filtering of the graphs that model the lexicons of Mandarin and French. Section 5 describes the construction and filtering of graphs that model a sub-part of the lexicons. Section 6 evaluates the characteristics of the resulting complex networks. We detail in Section 7 how we plan to use these resources and eventually (Section 8) propose some remarks on the quality of these resources and whether it would be possible to improve it."]},{"title":"2 Available resources 2.1 Lexicographic resources for synonymy","paragraphs":["Our resource for French synonymy is Dicosyn1",", a compilation of synonymy relations extracted from seven dictionaries (Bailly, Benac, Du Chazaud, Guizot, Lafaye, Larousse and Robert): Dicosyn is a network of synonymy relations as they appear in these dictionaries. There is an edge r → s if r and s have the same part of speech and a synonymy relation r → s exists in at least 1 Dicosyn has been first produced at ATILF (Analyse et Traitement Informatique de la Langue Franca̧ise), before being corrected at CRISCO laboratory (http://elsap1.unicaen.fr/dicosyn.html). 820 Workshop on Model and Measurement of Meaning one dictionary. Dicosyn provides three graphs: one for nouns (DicoSyn.Noun), one for verbs (DicoSyn.Verb) and one for adjectives (DicoSyn.Adjective).","The resource we used to build the Mandarin synonym graph is the CilinCWN.verb, a graph of verbs extracted from CilinCWN, a fusion of the Chinese Wordnet (CWN) and the Chinese thesaurus TongYiCi CiLin (Cilin). The Chinese Wordnet is a lexical resource modelled on Princeton WordNet, with many novel linguistic considerations for Chinese. It was proposed and launched by (Huang et al., 2004), and, up to February 2010, it contained 10,533 lemmas with 30,898 senses, and 41,169 lexical semantic relations in total. Among them there are 28,815 synonyms. The Tongyici Cilin (Mei et al., 1984) is a Chinese synonym dictionary known as a thesaurus in the tradition of Roget’s Thesaurus in English. It contains about 70000 lexical items under 12 broad semantic classes marked from A to L. These broad classes are further divided into 94 subclasses, and 1,428 heads. But in our experiment, classes of A-E and L were removed, for they refer to non-verbal entities like human, physical object, time and space, features, etc. In order to compare with French graphs, data have been preprocessed to comply to the format of DicoSyn.Verb , described in the paragraph above."]},{"title":"2.2 Lexicographic resources for translation","paragraphs":["Translation resources of quality for Mandarin are not easily built and few are available. To be consistent with the methodology we used to build our synonymy graphs, we chose to rely on handmade dictionaries that are less noisy than corpus-based automatically aligned lists of translation pairs. However we had to face the issue that translation dictionaries typically not only give a list of translation words but may also give some explanations in a gloss. Since vertices of our graphs are lexemes, we only considered parts of the entries that consist in list of words. We used the StarDict2","dictionary which is freely available in a digital format and contains for each Mandarin word a list of French words that can be unambiguously isolated."]},{"title":"2.3 The movie experiment","paragraphs":["Lexical data in the form of lists of verbs in French and Mandarin have been produced based on the movie experiment. The movie experiment consisted in asking adults and children to describe the action performed in a movie (Magistry et al., 2009). Each verb they used was systematically registered in the list of verbs proposed for that particular movie. The same 17 movies were shown to French and Mandarin speaking children and adults. This data has been used to build the synonymy and translation movie graphs.","For each movie, all the proposed French verbs were paired with all the proposed Mandarin verbs for this movie. Three Taiwanese students of French have indicated whether these pairs could be translations of each others or not. In case of a French verb being translation of only one part of the Mandarin verb, that part was also noted by the students. For two movies (in which somebody tears off a newspaper, and in which somebody breaks a glass) the verb pairs have been annotated by the three students and verified by a Mandarin native speakers working in tandem with a French native speaker (Laurent Prévot and Tsyr-Huei Chiang), two members of the team working on the Franco-taiwanese ANR-NSC M3 joint project “Models and Measurement of meaning”. The word pairs extracted from the files of the fifteen other movies have been annotated by only one student and have not been verified. However, the verification and cross checking performed on the two special movies enables us to relatively trust the quality of the unverified translations. This experimental resource provides us with 133 French verbs and 399 Mandarin verbs linked by 1160 translations annotated as possible translations. The construction and exploitation of this translation resource is described in details in (Prévot et al., 2010). 2","http://StarDict.sourceforge.net/ PACLIC 24 Proceedings 821"]},{"title":"3 Linguistic issues arising from structural discrepancies between Mandarin and French lexicalization 3.1 Comparing action-result constructed Mandarin verbs to plain French verbs","paragraphs":["The cross-linguistic study of semantic associations between French and Mandarin will focus on verbs because the experimental resource is verb-oriented. Mandarin is well-known for its Serial Verbs Constructions (SVC) and Resultative-Verb Compounds (RVC) that have both been deeply studied in the Mandarin linguistics literature (Thompson, 1973). Since we tried to stay at a lexical level, we did not address SVC that are clearly syntactic constructions of multiple separated lexemes. However the RVC were an important issue that we had to face, because a large part of our data consists of RVC (around 50%). For instance, the movies used in the experimental part show a woman performing some action on an object that results in a change of state of the object. The native Mandarin speakers naturally produced a lot of Type III RVCs (as classified by (Chang, 2003). Type III RVCs are compound verbs of two parts (we call V 1 and V 2) where V 1 depicts an action that has been performed by an agent (typically in subject position) on a patient (typically in object position) and V 2 depicts the change of state of the patient. See (1) for an example where V 1(da) means to hit and V 2(po) means to break.","(1) ta da-po le yi ke qiqiu she hit-break Perf. one balloon A more detailed account of the issue of RVCs in the case of our project has been given in (Magistry et al., 2009). The main point is that RVCs are semantically compositional and productive, and it has been shown that even very young children can produce novel resultative constructions (Erbaugh, 1992). Therefore not all V 1 − V 2 compounds can be found in dictionaries which makes them difficult to align with French data.","French do not have this kind of productive action-result construction. French verbs are much more lexicalized and one verb can depict the action only (ex: “scier ”, to saw), the result only (ex: “casser ”, to break) or both. The semantics of French verbs also present complex interactions with flexional morphology and possible syntactic constructions enabling diathesis alternation that can not be covered here. Note that it is possible to syntactically build action-result constructions in French (ex: “couper en deux ”, to cut into two pieces) but our experimental data shows that this possibility is seldomly used by French native speakers whereas it constitutes a large part of the data produced by Mandarin native speakers.","Since our graphs are mostly based on available lexical resources, Mandarin RVCs are present in our graphs just as they are in dictionaries, following other lexicographers choices. Some typical combinations and highly frequent RVCs may enter the dictionaries (and may progressively loose the compositionality property), those are included in our graphs. The more compositional RVCs used in a productive fashion are more likely to be treated as two distinct dictionary entries (V 1 and V 2) and will be present as two vertices in our graphs. For experimental graphs, we also allowed ourselves to manually include experimentally recorded compounds into our graphs."]},{"title":"3.2 Homographs and homonyms in French and Mandarin","paragraphs":["Another issue comes from the ideographic property of Chinese writing. Lexicographically speaking, the prevailing groups of words in Chinese are homographs, which are usually defined as a group of words that share the same spelling (i.e., ideographic form), regardless of their pronunciation and meaning. If they are pronounced the same, they are also called homophones (and homonyms). For instance, da3 ren2 (“to beat ”) and yi1-da3 (“a dozen”); If they are pronounced differently, they are also called heteronyms, like huei4-yi4 (“meeting”) and kuai4-ji4 (accounting). Conversely, in dictionaries, one can find manypolysemes. A polyseme is a lemma that has several distinct meanings. The difference between homonyms and polysemes is thus subtle, that is, how 822 Workshop on Model and Measurement of Meaning they are treated as several different meanings (polysemes) within a single dictionary lemma, or treated as several separate lemmas. In Chinese Wordnet, the decision is made based on Chinese lexicological tradition, however, in this experiment, we take the translations of the various homographs as the same lemma: In order to build graphs from resources containing homographs, a simple approach consists in modelling all homographs as polysemes, that is, grouping all homographs as one single lemma, that will produce a single vertex. This single vertex then has for a label the common lemma of this set of homographs and for neighbours the unions of the synonyms of all these homographs. We call this simplifying approach the flattening approach."]},{"title":"4 Construction of synonymy and translation graphs from lexicographic resources","paragraphs":["In the following we present synonymy graphs for French and Mandarin.

From Cilin, words whose length were less than 4 were chosen, and then tagged with POS by Academia Sinica CKIP tool5",", the Chinese segmentation and tagging system. Figure 1 shows some of the results. Note that we only used CKIP to tag words and then choose the ones whose POS was “verb”, and not to separate words. Since there are some phrases in Cilin, CKIP’s segmentator would have been able to segment, from phrases, words of length equal to or greater than 4, but these words are not what was needed in this study, we disregarded them. Figure 1: Example of Cilin lexemes tagged with the CKIP tool. Lexemes followed by the tag (V C) are verbs.","Then we compute wi,j, the weight between every two verb pair (vi, vj), by counting their cooccurrences in synsets: the weight means how many senses of (vi and vj) are synonyms of each other (or variant or near-synonym) in CWN (and in Cilin). The weight is assigned to 1 when i = j to make the graph reflexive, and assigned to 0 if there are none of their senses have a synonymy relation. Note that a word without synonymy relation will have no weight with others and will be a lonely node without any edge in the graph. Words of this kind are thus discarded. In total, there are 3,499 verbs and 16,815 verb relations (weight is not 0) from CWN, and 12,145 verbs and 100,657 relations from Cilin. By merging them (sum the weight from CWN and Cilin), a Chinese synonymy graph with 13,439 verbs and 111,985 relations is produced. We then simplified the weight by setting every weight greater than zero to one.

Between the version we built in the beginning of July and the most recent version, the density of arcs has increased whereas the number of vertices has decreased by about 1000 verbs. The most recent version, called CilinCWN 20100823 is of better quality as the significantly better results of some experiments based on this resource show in (Desalle et al., 2010). In the July version of the Cilin-based graph, homographs were considered to be different verbs. In order to maintain consistency in our experiments we therefore had to flatten it as explained in section 3.2. Three graphs based on the Cilin and Chinese Word Net resource were built: • CilinCWN 20100703, in the beginning of July 2010, has 14307 vertices and 109562 edges • CilinCWN flat 20100703 has 14042 vertices and 109333 edges • CilinCWN 20100823, in the end of August 2010, has 13439 vertices and 111985 edges","The French synonymy graph is simply the DicoSyn.Verb resource described in 2.1.

Why would experts decide that two verbs can not be translated by each other when an official dictionary provides this translation ? This is partly due to the experimental protocol.

We called this graph fr movies fDS. It contains V = 64 verbs and E = 430 edges. The small number of vertices (64 out of 133 French verbs in the movie files) can be explained by the fact that most movie descriptions were actually verbal expressions such as “casser en mille morceaux ”, when often only the verb “casser ” could be found in DicoSyn.Verb. We notice here that the “en mille morceaux” phrase expresses the result of the action, quite similarly to what the V 2 part of Mandarin verbs does. As we will stress in the conclusion of this paper, this issue might justify a French verbal lexicon based on the V 1 − V 2 construction of Mandarin verbs.","We used the same method to build Mandarin movie synonymy graphs.

We have more vertices in this graph than in fr movies fDS, but 85 verbs out of 399 Mandarin verbs present in the movie files is still a small amount. This is due to the fact that verbs expressed by Mandarin children are often not fully correct, especially in their V 2 part, and that they consequently do not belong to the CilinCWN lexicon.

To solve this issue we have to use translation links. For each Mandarin synonymy cluster, we will define the set of French words that are the trace of this cluster via translation. We will then compare them to the synonymy clusters of French words. In parallel we will perform the same operation on the Mandarin side. We will produce two lists of pairs of concepts: French concepts vs. traces of Mandarin concepts, and Mandarin concepts vs. traces of French concepts. Then, for each French or Mandarin concept, we can find the trace of a (Mandarin or French) concept that has the maximal similarity. This similarity value is the “trace value of a concept on a target language, via translation”. Then, the mean trace value is a measure of the conceptual similarity between two languages8",".","These measures will first be applied to the entire verb lexicons of French and Mandarin. They will be based on the French to Mandarin translation bi-graph frzh StarDict fCC fDS, the French synonymy graph, filtered with the translation graph verticesDicosyn fSD and the Mandarin synonymy graph, filtered with the translation graph vertices CilinCWN 20100823 fSD. The same set of measures we will be performed on the 3 following movie graphs: the translation graph, built with annotated movie pairs, frzh movies annotated, the French movie-based synonymy graph fr movies fDS and the Mandarin movie-based synonymy graph zh movies fCC-20100823."]},{"title":"8 Conclusion","paragraphs":["Building resources to compare lexico-semantic concepts across languages is a very complex task, because from the very beginning issues on how to model lexicons are raised. Models not only have to be consistent across the various experiments but, more importantly in a cross-linguistic study, they have to be consistent across languages that do not necessarily have comparable lexicalizations.","One major issue we had to tackle was the decomposition of Mandarin verbs in two parts V 1 and V 2 as described in section 3.1. Most French verbs do merge in one single form the action 8 Note that the mean trace value is not symmetric. 828 Workshop on Model and Measurement of Meaning and the result description and therefore there is no V 1 − V 2 formalism for French verbs. For the movie graphs, we have modelled that a Mandarin verb is any V 1, V 2 or V 1 − V 2 that is the translation of a French verb. However we realised that many occurrences of French speakers did not belong as such to the lexicon formalised by DicoSyn.Verbs, despite being translatable by a Mandarin verb. Such expressions as “d échirer en deux” (tear into two pieces) are not part of the lexicon but do translate well into Mandarin. See section 5.2. Therefore, it seems that, instead of simplifying the V 1 − V 2 Mandarin structure into “verbs”, it would be interesting to build a French lexicon that takes the V 1 − V 2 structure into account. Another issue was raised by homographs as seen in section 3.2. We decided to flatten these homographs out because this is what is usually done in French where homographs that are not also homophones hardly exist, and therefore most homographs are actually polysemes, not homonyms.","We also have noticed that experimental results are very sensitive to which version of the Cilin-extracted synonymy graph is used. The latest version had about 1000 verbs less and 2000 edges more than the earliest, which led to significantly different results in (Desalleet al., 2010)’s work. We suspect therefore that the requirement for comparable density and number of vertices between the StarDict filtered French and Mandarin synonymy graphs is important. Some more work is thus necessary to meet this requirement. An idea would be to consider the frequencies of verbs in various corpuses in order to filter vertices, and to filter synonymy links according to their weights (see Section 4).","The sensitivity of experimental results to slight differences in the resources points to question-ing whether modelling lexicons with simple, binary synonymy links is a reliable enough approach to study semantic associations. Some answers to it were introduced in (Gaume et al., 2008) where authors propose to use proxemy and confluence as a way to abstract the semantic modelling of a lexicon from their fickle synonymy graph representation. Along this line we are currently investigating in (Gaillard et al., 2010) how the notion of near-synonymy (Edmonds and Hirst, 2002) could be grasped by proxemy approaches."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Albert, R. and A.-L.
