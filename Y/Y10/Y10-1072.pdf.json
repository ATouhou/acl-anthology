This work is based on a terminological ontology method proposed by Madsen et al. (2004; 2005). The main purpose is to bridge a semantic relation between domain specific terms in two languages by mapping two language-dependent terminological ontologies. To explain why this method is preferable from the view of the cognitive process in translation, the terminological ontology method is contrasted with a study made by De Groot (1997) in the area of bilingual memory research.

While a German might be explaining about the Doctor of Science (Habilitation) as their highest academic degree, a Japanese might be having the highest academic degree in Japan - Ph.D. level - in his mind. This imagined conversation shows a typical situation revealing a deep inherent misconception between the two parties since each of them has their own conceptual - and correct - understanding of the highest obtainable academic degree in their respective countries.","Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) is one of the most widespread machine translation approaches. However, when considering rare language-combinations, the lack of “direct” parallel corpora is a critical concern for successfully applying the SMT approach. In case of the rare language-combination: Danish and Japanese, it is possible to collect a reasonably sufficient amount of corpora between Danish and English as well as English and Japanese. However, the availability of bilingual corpora that directly link Danish and Japanese are very limited. Hence, a transitive translation technique using English as a pivot language is often employed in translation of rare language-combinations. A question is how well the transitive machine translation approaches can convey original conceptual meanings of Source Language (SL) words into Target Language (TL) translations in the transitive translation. When considering human translations between rare combinations of languages, human translators typically look up SL-English dictionaries to identify meanings of SL words and then use English-TL dictionaries to determine appropriate TL translations. In such situations, the problem of word sense ambiguation becomes critical. Since a lexical representation often carries several meanings, the transitive translation approach using English as pivot simply amplifies the probability of selecting an inappropriate sense in a TL. Thus the problem of polysemy becomes especially serious in the process of transitive translations. PACLIC 24 Proceedings 629 ","This present work is primarily based on a terminological ontology method (Madsen et al. 2004; 2005), a domain-specific ontology which is used in standardized terminology works such as ISO 704 (2000). Since the traditional study of terminology is widely described as the standardization of terminology, a concept is ideally referred to by a single term. In other words, one single term unambigously designates one single concept. Thus, the use of a terminological method is highly suitable for domain specific translations. The terminological ontology method is potentially useful for providing a precise map of the terms covering the concepts and their interrelations, as well as to contribute to the identification of equivalences between selected languages. By mapping the language-dependent terminological ontologies between selected languages, it will potentially be possible to identify an appropriate translation in a TL based on semantic-rich information. The Feature Specification (FS) approach used in the terminological ontology method has similarities to the Distributed Conceptual Feature (DCF) model, one of the bilingual memory models proposed by De Groot (1997). The similarities explain why the terminological ontology method is potentially useful for conveying original conceptual meanings of SL words into TL translations.","To outline the scope of this work, Chapter 2 addresses De Grootś DCF model based on the theory of bilingual memory, followed by the terminological ontology principles in Chapter 3. In Chapter 4, an example of the terminological ontology mapping that has been manually carried out is demonstrated. Chapter 5 discusses issues concerning the mapping algorithms followed by a consideration of evaluation methods. Finally, the conclusions follow in Chapter 6."]},{"title":"2 Distributed Conceptual Feature Model","paragraphs":["Sager (1990) contrasts a phenomenon that is widely known within translation theories as follows: when translating informative source texts, e.g. a manual or a textbook, and if there is no foreign language term that corresponds to the source definition, a translation equivalent is created. The validity of the translation equivalent is restricted to the context where it has been created until it becomes fully accepted as a term with its own definition. When the translation equivalence is fully accepted, it has become associated to a concept in a conceptual system that is expressed in the foreign language. This phenomenon is indeed well explained by the series of bilingual memory representation models. These consist of two layers: lexical representations and conceptual representations (Potter et al., 1984). The “word-association” model includes a direct connection between the lexical representations of the two languages, while only the SL lexical representation is connected to the layer of conceptual representations (Figure 1-a). On the contrary, in the “concept-mediation” model (Figure 1-b), the lexical representations of the two languages are connected through the layer of conceptual representation that is shared between them. Kroll (1994) has pointed out that the strength of connections among representations changes depending on the proficiency of the TL (Figure 1-c).  Figure 1: Bilingual memory models. 630 Student Papers","De Groot (1997) demonstrates effects of word concreteness on the translation performance through her psycholinguistic experiments. She redefines the bilingual memory models in order to explain the word concreteness effects. Concrete words enable two routes to the translation response: one along the direct connection between the lexical representations and the other, indirectly, via the conceptual representation (Figure 1-d). On the other hand, abstract words only permit translation along one route and that is the direct connection between the lexical representations both of which have their own language-specific conceptual representation (Figure 1-e). She elaborates on her theory that concrete words share more of the individual elements of conceptual features (DCFs) between the two lexical representations (in SL and TL) than abstract words do. Hence, the connections between an SL word and its translation into TL are strengthened via DCFs that are shared between them in the case of concrete words (Figure 1-f).","Based on the DCFs model, it can be assumed that, if there is a system which can enlist conceptual features distributed between the two lexical symbols in question, such a system may help translators to perform effective translations in situations where they cannot identify any candidate translation in a TL from very limited language resources. Thus the terminological ontology that can systematically extract conceptual features can be used for the purpose of domain specific translations."]},{"title":"3 Terminological Ontology Principles","paragraphs":["The backbone of terminological ontology is comprised of characteristics modeled as typed feature specifications (Carpenter, 1992). Feature specifications (FSs) consist of a feature dimension and a value, i.e. attribute-value pairs. Thus, a representation of a whole concept is a feature structure, i.e. a set of FSs corresponding to the unique set of characteristics, which constitutes that concept.","The terminological ontology is based on several principles. Most importantly, a concept automatically inherits all FSs of its superordinate concepts. For any given concept, a feature of a non-inherited characteristic may be a subdivision criterion for a superordinate concept. This clarification makes it much easier to identify subdivision criteria and for differentiating characteristics in practical terminology work. This means that the same feature attribute must always occur on sister concepts and their value can only appear on one of these sister concepts. Hence, a feature dimension (attribute) that comprises primary FSs must be chosen in such a way that each daughter concept has one and only one FS (value) specified in its mother concept. Hence, a concept must be distinguished from each of its nearest superordinate concepts as well as from each of its sister concepts by at least one FS (Madsen et al., 2004; 2005).","If terms and their conceptual features can systematically be enlisted in this way, it can potentially convey original conceptual meanings of SL terms into TL translations based on the hypothesis that FSs can play a role corresponding to DCFs. To achieve this, it is necessary to obtain a map between conceptual features of SL terms and of potential TL translation candidates. To experiment this hypothesis, two cultural dependent terminological ontologies that represent each conceptual system of SL and TL are semi-automatically developed and manually mapped in Chapter 4."]},{"title":"4 Experiment: Terminological Ontology Mapping (Manual Mapping) 4.1 Method","paragraphs":["Corpora describing the Japanese educational system have been identified from the “Multilingual Living Information Corpora 1 1 http://www.clair.or.jp/tagengorev/en/j/index.html ” site provided by the Council of Local Authorities for PACLIC 24 Proceedings 631  International Relations and from a pamphlet entitled “Higher Education in Japan","2","” published","by the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology. For the","Danish educational system, a web-site 3 ","published by the Danish Agency for International Education has been used as corpora. All corpora are officially translated in English so that it is possible to identify original expressions in SL from documents published by the respective authorities. Thus, all English translated terms and their original expressions are considered as official terms provided from reliable authorities for each country. The terms and their definitions describing the educational systems in each country are manually extracted from the English corpora. Based on these terms and their definitions, ontologies representing the educational system in each of the two countries are developed according to the aforementioned terminological ontology principle (Figure 2). Ontology Development   Figure 2: Terminological ontology – Japanese higher education The basic techniques used in the manual mapping procedure are the string-based matching, the graph-based matching, and the internal structure (feature structure)-based matching (Euzenat and Shvaiko, 2007). All of these three matching techniques are combined as shown in Figure 3. Ontology Mapping  Strings matching 100% match Partly match Common stringsUnique strings Graph based matching Feature structure matching Tresh hold 3 Based on 100 % matched nodes No match Based on matched nodes Match No match ","Figure 3: Ontology mapping algorithm 2 http://www.mext.go.jp/english/koutou/detail/1287370.htm 3 http://en.iu.dk/education-in-denmark/the-danish-education-system 632 Student Papers 1) String-based matching at the Lexical Representation (LR) level The simplest technique is to match strings at the LR level. The expected results are either 100% matching, partly-matching or no-matching. In case of the 100% matching, the terms in the two ontologies are considered as equivalent. For example, the Danish term “videregående uddannelse” is associated with the Japanese term “高等教育 koto kyoiku” via their English translation “higher education”. This relation indicates that these two terms form a “word-association” of the DCF model described in Chapter 3.","The partly-matching strings are categorized as two types: common strings and unique strings. An indicative example of the common strings is “school” that is commonly used in the education domain. These common strings do not provide any unique meaning of applicable terms. The threshold is set as three so that strings occurring more than three times at the LR level in one of the ontologies are considered as no matching strings. Terms containing uniquely matched strings which occur less than four times in one of the ontologies are enlisted as partly-matching terms.  2) Graph-based matching of the partly-matching terms in hierarchies below the 100 %","matched nodes The partly-matching terms identified in the string-based matching go through the graph-based matching process. The graph-based matching is based on the nodes that are categorized as the 100% matching terms and goes through from nodes situated at the lower part of the hierarchies to the upper part. For example, “university” and “higher education” are identified as 100 % matching pairs from the strings-based matching and the “university” is situated under the “higher education”. Hence the graph-based matching first tries to identify the partly-matching terms listed under “university” nodes in the ontologies. In this example, “master degree course (JP)” and “Candidatus and master program (DK)” as well as “doctor degree course” and “doctor of philosophy program” are registered under the \"university” nodes in the two ontologies. Hence, these are considered as corresponding pairs.  3) The internal structure (FSs) mapping of terms in the hierarchies below the matched nodes The next step is to map the internal structure (set of feature specifications) of terms in the hierarchies below the already matched nodes. For example, at the hierarchies under the nodes “higher education”, e.g. “specialized training college, specialist degree (JP)” and “academy profession degree program (DK)” are left behind. Presuming that these FSs play a similar role as DCFs described in Chapter 3, terms in the two ontologies (representing the SL- and TL concept system) having as many common FSs as possible can be assumed to be equivalent. Table 1 shows that e.g. the Japanese “specialist degree” is targeted for “high school graduates” whose age is “above 16 years”. It means that the Japanese FS2 and FS4 can logically match with the Danish FS1 “19 years old or above”. All other FSs besides the Japanese FS3 correspond with each other. Hence these two terms can be considered as corresponding translations.","Table 1: FSs mapping results LR FS 1 FS2 FS3 FS4 FS5 FS6 Specialist degree (JP) PATH: traditional academic GENERATION: 16 years old or above OBLIGATION : noncompulsory ELIGIBILIT Y: high school graduate PURPOSE: practical LENGTH OF EDUCATION: 2-3 years Academy profession degree program (DK) GENERATION: 19 years old or above CATEGORY: academic study LENGTH OF EDUCATION: 2 years PURPOSE: practical   PACLIC 24 Proceedings 633  The internal structure mapping can be repeated for terms in the hierarchies below the newly matched nodes. This process is repeated from the lower nodes to the top nodes of the hierarchies."]},{"title":"4.2 Results and evaluation","paragraphs":["In this experiment, in total 42 terms and 49 terms are registered on the Japanese- and Danish education system ontologies, respectively.

One critical point is the selection of subdividing dimensions and their values: How to select subdividing dimensions and their values that are commonly used for mapping the two ontologies. The more common names and characteristics of dimensions in the two ontologies are, the easier the mapping becomes. If considering the full automatic ontology development from text corpora, these issues should be carefully considered.","The ontology mapping has been manually performed in this experiment. A major challenge will be to identify a technique to automatically map FSs. At the current stage, the FS mapping involves human decisions in many ways. First of all, contexts of the subdividing dimensions and their values are inherently understood by humans. In order to automate the FS mapping, it at least has to employ the morphological matching technique for identifying corresponding strings in subdividing dimensions and their values. This means that the aforementioned problem concerning the selection of subdividing dimensions and values again becomes a critical issue. In addition, some complex situations involving human decision making have been identified in this experiment. For example, GENERATION “16 or above” implies “19 or above”. However, this cannot lead to the conclusion that these two values are corresponding. In the manual mapping, ELIGIBILITY “high-school graduate” can be an important clue to provide the fact of “3 years of education” from “16 years old”, which equals to “19 years or above”. In order to achieve semi-automatic or automatic matching algorithms, these kinds of issues should be dealt with in addition to the logical formalization of the procedures performed in this experiment. An obvious next step could be to implement semi-automatic FS mapping algorithms based on this procedure by employing already existing algorithms such as the Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) known as the concept lattice (Ganter and Wille, 1999)."]},{"title":"5.2 Evaluation Methods","paragraphs":["The evaluation method employed in this experiment involved only one evaluator assessing the translations obtained from the Google MT and from the ontology mapping. The first question is whether the comparison with the Google MT provides any meaningful results. Computational linguists and some psycholinguists may argue that frequency of word usage influences the translation performance. From this point of view, the results indicate that, for language combinations that have limited linguistic resources, the frequency approach, that is to say the statistical machine translation approach, may possess a disadvantage. Another critical issue is that only one evaluator was appointed for the evaluation. This may obviously not be sufficient  4 http://translate.google.com/# as of June 8th",", 2010 PACLIC 24 Proceedings 635  to convince about the validity of the results. The most important point of this project is whether the terminological ontology mapping conveys the original conceptual meanings of SL terms into TL translations compared with other translation approaches. This has not yet been proven by this single evaluation. Some psycholinguistic approaches, e.g. testing TL translation readers (for assessing whether a proposed translation evokes the original conceptual meaning), should be considered in future research.","In addition, objective and systematized evaluation methods should be developed in order to assess semi-automatic or automatic matching algorithms that are to be developed in the near future.
