Sindhi is a morphologically rich language. Morphological construction include inflections and derivations. Sindhi morphology becomes more complex due to primary and secondary word types which are further divided into simple, complex and compound words. Sindhi nouns are marked by number gender and case. Finite state transducers (FSTs) quite reasonably represent the inflectional morphology of Sindhi nouns. The paper investigates Sindhi noun inflection rules and defines equivalent computational rules to be used by FSTs; corresponding FSTs are also given. Keywords. Sindhi, morphology, noun inflections, two-level morphology, finite state morphology."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Morphology deals with word formation rules in a language. Word structures of a language are defined by its morphological constructions. Morphology defines that how smaller meaning bearing units called morphemes are combined to make larger meaning bearing units of a language called words. Morphology also deals with word formation by variations in already existing words. The morphological changes are mostly done by suffix addition, subtraction and replacement phenomenon. In few words morphology can be defined as syntax of word formation.","Models for computational analysis of morphology always remained challenge for computational linguists until early 1980’s when 4Ks* discovered the two level morphology (Kaplan, R. M. and M. Kay. 1981) the first general model for morphologically complex languages. This two level morphology represents a word at lexical level and surface level. Morphotactics or morpheme ordering model is used in between these two levels to incorporate morphological changes. These morphotactics are implemented as Finite State Transducers (FSTs).","Sindhi is one of the major languages of Pakistan and is spoken by approximately 40 million people(Sindhi Language Authority. 2009). Sindhi is an example of morphologically complex language. Nouns are marked by number, gender and case. Two level morphology can be used to model Sindhi noun inflections.","Subsequent sections discuss Finite State Morphology, Sindhi morphological constructions, Sindhi noun inflections and role of finite state transducers in their computation. Section 2 discusses Sindhi noun inflections in detail. In section 3 finite state transducers for different noun inflection types in Sindhi are presented. Conclusions are discussed in section 4 and finally references are given in section 5. IPA Sindhi transliteration along-with Arabic script is also given."]},{"title":"1.1 Finite State Morphology","paragraphs":["Finite state transducers play an important role in language processing applications (Beesley,  * Ronald M. Kaplin, Martin Kay, Lauri Karttunen and Kimmo Koskenniemi PACLIC 24 Proceedings 669  Kenneth R. and Lauri Karttunen, 2003) and computational studies of morphologically complex languages. Morphotactics (morpheme ordering rules) and orthographical rules (spelling rules) are represented by finite state transducers. Efficient morphological parsers can be implemented by combining these finite automata and computational lexicon (repository of words).","Finite state transducers convert/translate lexical level constructs to surface level words by applying morphotactics and orthographical rules. Their reversible nature makes reverse conversion/translation possible. This two level (lexical and surface) morphology plays crucial role in implementation of morphological analyzers for natural languages."]},{"title":"1.2 Morphological Construction in Sindhi","paragraphs":["Sindhi is an example of Indo-Aryan language with rich inflectional and derivational morphology (Mutee-U-Rahman. 2009). Sindhi morphological constructions include derivational and inflectional morphology with addition, subtraction and replacement methods. Sindhi words are divided into primary and secondary word types. Secondary words are further divided into compound and complex words. Following sections discuss Sindhi word types and their morphological construction in detail."," Sindhi Words. Sindhi words are divided into two types primary or simple words and secondary words (Jatoi Ali Nawaz. 1983). Primary words (also known as minimum free forms) are not further divisible (Khubchandani, Lachman M. 2003). For example ö9̀®̀ڻاڄ (knowledge) and qr̀sn وتسر (path or way) are examples of primary words.","Secondary words are divided into complex and compound words. Complex words are formed by combining affixes with primary words. For example primary word ö9̀®̀ڻاڄ when combined with prefix ®̀tڻا (negation) becomes a complex word ®̀ö9̀®̀ڻاڄٹا (layman). Same word when combined with suffix n9 وُا becomes ö9̀®n9وٹاڄ (scholar). Compound words are combinations of two or more simple words. Their prefixes and suffixes are actually free form morphemes. cYçf̀~hkn9ولٻگنھج (wild cat) which is formed by combining two free form morphemes cYçf̀̀گنھج(forest) and ~hkn9 ولٻ (cat); and gs̀çj∞̀h9 يڙڪٿھ (manacle) which is formed by gs̀ç̀ٿھ(hand) and j∞̀h9يڙڪ (ring) are examples of compound words. Words in Sindhi always end in a vowel (Sheikh Wahid Bakhash. 2006). These endings not only help in identifying the gender in case of nouns but change in them can cause a different word class or derivational morphology. Words can have following vowel endings."," Sindhi: َا آ ِا يِا ُا وُا وا وَا يا يَا IPA: ̀ 9̀ d d9 t t9 n n9 h h9 Morphological Construction in Sindhi. Sindhi is a polymorphemic language. Sindhi morphological constructions include derivational and inflectional forms. Sindhi derivations take place when word stem is combined with a grammatical morpheme usually resulting in a different class word. For example the adjective atjg","xn9 ويکب (hungry) is derived from noun atjg","̀کب (hunger) when suffix xn9 وي is added to the noun. Sindhi derivational morphology also takes place by diacritic or last vowel change. For example nouns are derived from verbs like noun onjg","̀ َکوپ (crop) is derived from verb onjg","d ِکوپ (sow) by changing of last vowel “d” to “”̀.","Sindhi inflectional morphology takes place by combining a word stem with a morpheme resulting in word of same class which performs same syntactic function as the original stem. Inflections are caused by change in gender, number case or tense. Sindhi nouns are marked by number, gender and case."]},{"title":"2 Sindhi Noun Inflections","paragraphs":["670 Student Papers Sindhi nouns are divided in two major categories Concrete Nouns and Abstract Nouns.

They represent morphotactics of Sindhi noun inflections quite reasonably and provide computational basis for automatic morphological processing of Sindhi nouns. Gender, number and case inflection rules and their corresponding FSTs given in section 3 can be further extended to complete morphological analyzers by incorporating Sindhi computational lexicon. Lexicon to surface level generations can be achieved by applying FSTs presented. Surface to lexicon level morphological parsing can also be achieved automatically once lexicon to surface level mapping is worked out and properly modeled by using inflection rules and FSTs. Reversible nature of FSTs makes it possible to execute the whole process of mapping lexicon to surface levels in reverse order. Therefore noun inflection FSTs discussed here are not only useful in inflected word formation but also in morphological analysis/parsing of Sindhi nouns. PACLIC 24 Proceedings 675  Table 8.
