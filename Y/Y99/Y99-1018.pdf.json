The lexical form suggested by Her seemed to provide a complete representation of the different syntactic behaviours of 4̀ht.' within a Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) account. However, when applying this representation in conjunction with the argument structure (a-structure) and the lexical mapping theory in LFG, this representation conflicts with the lexical mapping theory. This paper examines this problem and proposes a solution to the problem when dealing with the lexical representation of 1̀6t'. 1. INTRODUCTION","The Chinese word 'It' is an unusual lexical unit as it has two different linguistic behaviours (cf. Section 2). Due to this distinctive characteristic, the lexical representation of t̀k.' has been a frequently discussed subject. The Chinese word 'It' is frequently being mistaken as a preposition. However, as argued by Tan [9] and Her [7],"]},{"title":"'It'","paragraphs":["cannot be a preposition; it is indeed a verb. Tan [9] treated 'It' and its following noun phrase (NP) as a subordinate clause for making the meaning of a sentence more specific. However, Her argued that Tan's argument structure of 'It' is incomplete. There are some forms of l'-sentences that Tan's argument structure failed to describe. The lexical form of 'It' suggested by Her can adequately predict and explain the different syntactic behaviours of l̀bt' in Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) terms. However, a problem arises when applying lexical mapping theory defined in the LFG formalism to Her's lexical form.","In LFG, different levels of linguistic information is represented by different structures: constituent structure (c-structure), functional structure (f-structure), argument structure (a-structure) and semantic structure (s-structure) [2, 3, 6].

A-STRUCTURE AND LEXICAL MAPPING THEORY","paragraphs":["An a-structure shows the participants involved in an event structure in the form of thematic roles.

The function of an a-structure is to act as a link between lexical semantics and syntactic structures [3]. The lexical mapping theory formulates some constraints on how a-structure arguments are mapped onto the syntactic functions of the corresponding sentence [1, 4]. There are four kinds of syntactic functions identified in this theory: subject (SUBJ), object (OBJ), object° (0134) and oblique° (0BLo). Intuitively, as observed by Bresnan and Kanerva [1, 4], these syntactic functions can be distinguished from each other by the combination of the features [± r] and [± o]:","r--ri","SUBJ\\tOBJ\\tOBJ \\tr\\t","oBLeo where [± r] indicates whether a syntactic function is thematically restricted and [± o] indicates whether a syntactic function is objective. Similar to the syntactic functions, some thematic roles bear some of these features intrinsically [1, 4, 8]:","[—o] agent\\t[—r] theme\\t[—o] locative Additional features are assigned to the thematic roles according to default role classifications. The highest thematic role2 within an a-structure is generally assigned with the feature [-r] , and all other roles are assigned with [+r] apart from those which have already been classified as [-r] intrinsically (e.g. the thematic role 'theme). However, these classifications can only be applied after an a-structure has undergone all the necessary morpholexical operations. One example of the morpholexical operations is the passive operation. When an a-structure undergoes the passive operation (i.e. the corresponding sentence is expressed in the passive voice), the highest thematic role within the a-structure is suppressed. The next highest thematic role will then be assigned to the subject position of the resulting passive sentence. The mapping between each thematic role in an a-structure and the corresponding syntactic function is based on feature matching and the well-formedness conditions: the subject condition and function-argument bi-uniqueness [1, Page79]. (8) shows an example of the mapping between the a-structure (7) and the passive sentence \"The vase was broken by John.\":","(8) A-structure:\\t'break' <agent theme> 'by' <agent>","Intrinsic:\\t[-o]\\t[-r]\\t[-o]","Passive:\\t'is'\\t0","Default:\\t [+r]","Syntactic Functions:\\tSUBJ\\tOBLagent","NPs:\\t The vase\\tJohn"]},{"title":"4.

If a-structure is truly the link between lexical semantics and syntactic","structures, and the lexical mapping theory does govern the mapping between thematic roles and syntactic","functions, the mis-match should be caused by one of the following: 1. the NP following 'it' is not the agent of a Ìtt'-sentence, 2. in the lexical mapping theory, the thematic role 'agent' is either wrongly classified as [-o] intrin-","sically or it can also be classified as fi-o1 in some cases, or 3. the lexical form suggested by Her is, to a certain extent, wrong or overly generalised.","In the remainder of this section, we will investigate the cause of the mis-match by exploring each of the","above possibilities. 4.1 Is the NP following b̀ei' an agent?","The definition of agent we adopt in this paper follows the one postulated by GivOn [5, Page 88]:","The agent is always a conscious participant in an event, since he is a volitional initiator of","the change .. .","We therefore determine whether an NP is an agent by considering whether the participant of the event","represented by this NP is the conscious initiator of the event.

The NP ' is the conscious initiator of the 'punish' event described in (10). Thus the NP * ' serves as the agent of the sentence (10). The sentence (11) can be paraphrased as either \"Mary caused John to break his leg.\" or \"John's leg was broken by Mary.\". Although the ownership of the NP 'AC in (11) is not explicitly marked, the NP la! is understood as the leg of John (i.e. the subject of the sentence) instead of that of Mary (i.e. the NP before the second verb in the sentence). In this leg-breaking' event, Mary is understood as the person who caused John's leg to be broken. This means that Mary is the conscious initiator of this event. Thus, the NP \\t' in (11) is an agent.","The sentence (12) is not a conventional passive sentence (cf. Section 2).

Therefore, the NP is an agent. All of the NPs following 4̀A.' in (10), (11) and (12) indicate the conscious initiator of each of the events described. This suggests that the NP following 4̀A: in a 'lit' -sentence is indeed the agent of the event. 4.2 Is the thematic role 'agent' wrongly classified as non-objective? The intrinsic classification of thematic roles is based on the observation on the relationship between syntactic functions and the meaning of each thematic role. The thematic role 'agent' is classified as -172non-objective (i.e. [-o]) in the lexical mapping theory because it cannot appear as an object (both direct and indirect) in a sentence:","The intrinsic classifications are a distillation of pervasive cross-linguistic generalizations","about the unmarked grammatical encoding of semantic roles. Thus, cross-linguistically, the","agent is canonically NOT encoded as object: in syntactically accusative languages it is the","canonical subject, and in syntactically ergative languages it is a thematically restricted,","non-objective function ... [1, Page 77] If an agent were to be marked as an objective function (i.e. [+o]), it would not match with the classifications for subject because the subject function is classified as thematically non-restricted and non-objective (cf. Section 3). Furthermore, marking an agent as objective means that the thematic role 'agent' cannot appear as the subject of a sentence. This is in contradiction to the general syntactic behaviour of the thematic role 'agent' in most, if not all, languages.","The intrinsic classification of the thematic role 'agent' [-o] in the lexical mapping theory allows an agent to appear as a subject in a sentence. This syntactic behaviour of an agent is generally true in many languages. However, according to Her, there are other verbs in Chinese which have the same complement structure and control relations as those in (9), e.g. \\t',\\t' and","(13)̀\\t[7, Page 78, 3a]A I receive teacher\\tteach. I receive the teacher's teaching.","(14) -\\t [7, Page 78, 3b] I receive papa scold. I was scolded by papa.","(15) /Vt /*kJ 14: it\\t[7, Page 78, 3c] dish\\ttake-turns\\tyou wash. It's your turn to wash the dishes.","These verbs might have the complement structure and control relations suggested by Her, the NPs fol-","lowing them are not the agents of the events described by them. For instance, (13) described a 'receive'","event, where the participant who initiated this receiving action is"]},{"title":"A'.","paragraphs":["The object that underwent the receiving action is '**- fYP"]},{"title":"4-","paragraphs":["(meaning \"teacher's teaching\"). The agent of this 'receive' event is à,,. The NP OP in (13) is NOT the agent of this 'receive' event, but the agent of the 'teach' sub-event embedded in this sentence. Same applies to the sentences (14) and (15). This suggests that assigning the thematic role 'agent' to the object position of a sentence is also NOT common in Chinese. Therefore, assigning the feature [-o] to the thematic role 'agent' intrinsically seems to be the most suitable choice. 4.3 Is the lexical form suggested by Her wrong or overly generalised? As was discussed in the previous section, the thematic role 'agent' is seldom, or never, mapped with the syntactic function 'object'. Her's lexical form of '4fit' seems to ignore this property. Her dismissed the possibility of treating 1̀6t.' as a subject marker by pointing out that though a semantic agent is often being treated as the subject of a sentence, '4A.'-sentences are not [(3 S V]-type sentences. However, this does not support the argument that a semantic agent can appear in a sentence as an object. If the NP following Ìtt' is genuinely the object of a '̀-sentence, '4A.' should be a transitive verb. It is universal across languages that a transitive verb takes an object. However, as illustrated in Section 2 (3), a .̀'-sentence can be òbject'-less. To get over this problem, Her introduced a default assignment of a 'generic' value to '̀-sentences. If a '̀-sentence has an overt 'object', the generic value will be overridden by this overt 'object' ; otherwise, the 'object' position will be filled with this generic value. Although Her cited that the Chinese words\\tand -*kJ ' have the same control relation, to fill an object position with a default generic value is not common in Chinese and in other languages.","Her claimed that the verbs andf̀ig']' have the same control relations as Ìft'. This is not entirely correct. The NP following 't ft' can be omitted without affecting the grammatical correctness of a '̀-sentence. This does not apply to sentences with '4 , , , t4 ' and '4.gq '","(16) *\\t/441%1 it","dish\\ttake-turn\\twash. (17) ?\\t 7 o","dish\\tshould\\twash.","The dishes should be washed.","The omission of the NP following 'ist',V̀t ' and ̀3*M ' either causes the sentence to be ungrammatical","or changes the meaning of the sentence. This suggests that the assignment of a generic value to sentences","with these verbs is wrong. The object position of the sentences with the verbs gse ' and '41' can be left empty: (18) A"]},{"title":"a*","paragraphs":["0 [7, Page 78, 3a]","I\\treceive\\tteach.","I receive teaching. (19) if; 0\\t[7, Page 78, 3b]","I\\treceive scold.","1 was scolded.","This does not cause the sentence to be ungrammatical or the meaning of the sentence to change. The","same syntactic behaviour is found in the passive '#'-sentence (3). However, for the affective .̀'-","sentences (4) and (5), if the NP following 'lit' is not overt, they sound odd: (20) ?\\t T 0","cat bei escape TENSE MARKER. (21) ? it* #. tit\\tI\\t18","John bei break TENSE MARKER\\tvase.","? John has the vase broken.","Both sentences (20) and (21) are not readily understandable by average Chinese speakers. To improve","the readability of these sentences, an NP is required to be inserted after t̀t.' in each case. This raises the","question as to whether these sentences are grammatical. According to Her's lexical form of 'lit shown","in (9), if the NP after l̀ift: is not overt, its value is set to 'generic'. If it is appropriate to assign a generic","value to the affective l̀it'-sentences like (4) and (5), the sentences (20) and (21) should be acceptable.","However, (20) and (21) do not convey a sensible meaning and would more likely to be considered as","ill-formed by average native Chinese speakers. Another difference between the two kinds of '̀-sentences (i.e. the passive voice sentences (2) and","(3) versus the affective voice sentences (4) and (5)) is that if the NP following 'tit' is not overt, the","passive reading of a sentence does not necessarily require the presence of the verb 'It'. For example,","both (22) and (23) have similar passive meaning: (22) 4c- 456t 41 °","one QUANTIFIER book bei John give TENSE MARKER Mary.","Mary was given a book by John. (23)","A\\t 0","one QUANTIFIER book give TENSE MARKER Mary.","Mary was given a book.","For sentences like (23) in which it is clear that the subject of the sentence cannot be the agent of the","event, the omission of 'lit' do not affect their passive status. As for the sentences like (3) in which the","subject of the sentence can be the do-er of the action, the omission of Ìt.' means that these sentences","have both passive and active readings, e.g. : (24) $it I °\\t[7, Page 71,2b']","chicken eat TENSE MARKER.","The chicken ate. / The chicken was eaten.","This property is not shared by the affective '̀-sentences: (25) tt I\\tT","cat escape TENSE MARKER.

The Chinese word 'It' in a passive '̀-sentence serves two purposes.

The evidence of\\tserved as the auxiliary verb b̀e' is found in the passive '̀-sentence (3). As illustrated in Section 4.3, the sentence (24) has both passive and active reading. By introducing the word 4 4A.' in (24) to form (3), the active reading of the sentence is eliminated. This proves that 'lit' does act like the auxiliary verb 'be' in modifying the meaning of the sentence. The evidence of \\tserving as the marker for an oblique agent is shown in the difference between sentences (22) and (23). The sentence (23) shows an agent-less version of a passive À '-sentence.

We therefore proposed two different lexical forms for describing the two kinds of 4̀/t' -sentences.","The two lexical forms of 4̀k.' proposed above are much simpler than that suggested by Her and they successfully describe the different syntactic behaviours of the different kinds of 4̀it'-sentences. With these lexical forms, there is no need for the introduction of a generic value for filling the object position. As there are no complicated control relations in the proposed lexical forms, they are easier to be realised in computational terms than the one from Her. Another advantage of the lexical form (28) is that it adequately predicts the transformation undergone during the morpholexical operation p̀assive' in a Chinese sentence. This transformation conforms with that presented by Bresnan. While applying the lexical mapping theory onto this lexical form, it works well. The use of a-structure and the lexical mapping theory aids the transfer from English passive sentences to Chinese [10]. A lexical form which reflects the equivalence of Bresnan's universal passive transformation and the Chinese passive transformation facilitates this transfer process.","Although it is uncommon that a verb is assigned two different lexical forms and at the same time it is used as both a verb and an oblique marker, the syntactic behaviours of the Chinese word 4̀A.' does support these properties.
