This year, The 13 th Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation (PACLIC13) is hosted by National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan. It is to be held from February 10-11, 1999 at The Grand Hotel, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C. The Grand Hotel is known as one of the ten great hotels in the world. It is a major landmark, commanding a panoramic view of the city of Taipei. The Grand Hotel is a hallmark of Chinese culture and a showpiece for Chinese hospitality. It is the only true Chinese palace-styled hotel in the world. This is why we chose The Grand Hotel as the conference venue. We hope that all the participants will enjoy the experience of the Chinese culture and architecture and have a fruitful time while staying in Taipei for PACLIC13. The Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation is an annual gathering of scholars with a wide range of interests in theoretical and computational linguistics. For PACLIC 13, the topics of the papers comprise nearly all fields of linguistic studies including semantics, pragmatics, syntax, phonology, natural language processing, and computer applications. This year 48 full papers were submitted to the Program Committee of PACLIC 13 from all over the world. Basing our acceptance on the traditional \"family-atmosphere\" and to encourage more and more people to contribute the technical fruits of their efforts, we decided to accept 36 papers, 19 long- and 17- short papers. The majority of participants come from Pacific Asia region: 11 from Japan, 4 from Korea, 2 from USA, 2 from Hong Kong, I from Thailand, and 11 from Taiwan. Five paper presenters come from non-Pacific Asian areas including UK, Germany, and India. It is our great honor to be able to invite two key researchers to deliver speeches in their respective field of expertise. Prof. Christopher Manning from University of Sydny, Australia, will speak on \"Linguistics in an Age of Engineering.\" Dr. Chin-Hui Lee, who is","a Distinguished Member of Technical Staff and Head of the Dialogue Systems Research Iv Department, Bell Laboratories, will deliver his keynote speech on \" Spoken Language Systems-Technical Challenges for Speech and Natural Language Processing.\" We wish to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to the Ministry of Education, R.O.C., National Science Council, R.O.C., the research Center for Computer System Technology, National Cheng Kung University, and The Association for Computational Linguistics and Chinese Language Processing for their financial and logistic support. We would like to give thanks to the PACLIC13 co-chairs and technical program committee members, especially Professor Chu-Ren Huang for his enthusiastic assistance. We also wish to thank all our learned colleagues who submitted papers and who have come to Taipei to attend the conference. Finally, we extend our gratitude to all those who helped make this conference a success.
