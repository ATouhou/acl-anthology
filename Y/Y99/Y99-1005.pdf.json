The distinctive syntactic features for the contrast include the distribution of the grammatical functions, the cooccrrence restrictions with head nouns and head verbs, the compatibilities with the imperative and evaluative constructions, the aspect, and the transitivity. We conclude that the contrast is motivated by event structure properties. To describe a state-type event, the speaker could choose to focus on the inchoative stage or the homogeneous stage of the event. In addition, since VV compounding has the function of type-lifting an event to a referential term, or to refer to its generic properties, it is natural to predict that VV compounding is a predominant source for the verbs of indicating homogeneity."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["Many recent linguistic studies explored how lexical meaning predicts syntactic regularities (Levin 1993, Pustejovsky 1995). One important approach is to study the contrasts in near synonym pairs to identify the minimal semantic attributes that motivate the contrasts (Tsai et al 1998, Liu et al 1997 & 1998). In this current study, we extend the range of the study to a semantic field, which contains more than one synonym pairs. Thus we can attest to the primary status of the proposed semantic attributes by showing that the generalization can be extended to the other synonym pairs in the same semantic field. Tsai et al (1998) discussed the contrast between the synonym pair KUAILE \\tand GAOXING AR, and based on their findings we re-examine the contrast in a broader range, i.e. the verbs of emotion. We have four results from this study: 1) we find that the contrast is not specific to KUAILE and GAOXING, but to the whole semantic field of verbs of emotion; 2) we define the contrast more precisely; 3) we can trace the cause of the contrast; and 4) we can identify the influence of the compound structure. In this paper we will examine seven types of emotion verbs, i.e. happy, depressed, sad, regret, angry, afraid and worried. All the observations and statistics in this paper are based on \"Academia Sinica Balanced Corpus of Modern Mandarin Chinese\" (abbreviated as \"Sinica Corpus\" in the following texts), which is a tagged Mandarin corpus containing a total of five million words (CKIP 1995). We consider only the verbs with a frequency of over 40 in Sinica Corpus. The verbs under examination in the paper are listed in Table 1. There're totally 33 verbs. Four of them are monosyllabic and 29 of them are disyllabic.

Observations and generalization","paragraphs":["According to Tsai et al (1998), the verbs GAOXING \"to be happy\" and KUAILE \"to be glad\" differ in the following four aspects: 1) GAOXING takes a sentential object (7%1, while KUAILE cannot, 2) GAOXING takes the sentential-final particle LE (0.7%), while KUAILE cannot, 3) GAOXING never constitutes wish sentences but admits evaluational sentences (1.8%), while KUAILE occurs in wish sentences (2.2%) but never appears in evaluational sentences, and 4) GAOXING forms imperative sentences (1.1%), while KUAILE cannot. We check the same distinctions with other verbs of emotion and we are surprised to find that most of the observed contrasts above are shared by each subtype of the verbs of emotion. In addition, new distinctions are also added to the list through our thorough observations. According to our study of the seven subtypes of the verbs of emotion, five distinctive features are proposed to make a bipartite classification of the verbs of emotion. The first two features are our new discoveries and are most useful in distinguishing the two groups. a. the distribution of their various grammatical functions b. the cooccurrence restriction with the head they modify c. their appearances in imperative and evaluative constructions d. verbal aspect or AKTIONSART e. their transitivity According to the five criteria all the 29 disyllabic verbs in Table"]},{"title":"1","paragraphs":["could be divided into two groups.

One of the two groups dominate in each of the five grammatical representations, as shown in the following. Group A verbs: 1. Function mostly as a PREDICATE and seldom used as a noun or a nominal modifier; 2. Have strict cooccurrence restriction with the head when they are used as a nominal modifier or a post-verbal adjunct; 3. Often appear in imperative or evaluative constructions; 4. Often representing inchoative states; and 5. Often taking a cause event or a goal as their direct object. Generally speaking, SHENGQI is always an intransitive verbs, and the object can only be inserted to the verb, such as SHENG TA DE QI Group B verbs: 1. Are more likely to be a NOMINALIZED EVENT or a NOMINAL MODIFIER than Group A verbs and they are not as often used as a verb as Group A verbs; 2. Have wider range of cooccurrence restriction with the head when they are used as a nominal modifier or a post-verbal adjunct; 3. Seldom used in imperative or evaluative constructions; 4. Rarely co-occur with inchoative state; and 5. Seldom take a cause event or a goal as their direct object."]},{"title":"4.2 The semantic basis for the bipartite classification","paragraphs":["Take note that the 14 verbs we study form seven contrast pairs belonging to the same semantic field. If the same consistent contrasts differentiate all seven pairs, we may assume that there is a fundamental semantic motivation underlying all these contrasts. It will be highly unlikely if these five contrasts were each independently motivated and all seven contrast pairs have the identical distribution of all the semantic attributes involved. It is also important to note that each two verbs in a contrast pair differ minimally in semantics and are mutually substitutable in many contexts. We may understand the behavioral contrasts we observed better by rephrasing the question as follows: Why is Group A verbs chosen over Group B verbs (and vice versa) in construction X? In light of this question, we will be more likely to identify the inherent semantic distinction between the two groups and the bipartite contrast may turn out to be the result of semantically primary contrast. In anticipation of this interpretation we summarize and re-organize the contrast between the two groups as follows: Linguistic Instantiation Group A Group B Predicate Strong Weak Inchoative states Predominate Rare Transitivity Strong Weak Imperative or evaluative constructions Predominate Rare Adjuncts to non-transient activities Rare Predominate Adjuncts to nouns Weak Strong","PredominateNominalization Rare","Table 9: contrasts in linguistic distribution From the above contrast, we can see that all the distinctive linguistic instantiations are related to event structure properties. Generally speaking, Group A is preferred to indicate transition, while Group B is preferred for homogeneity. In particular, when we want to indicate a change of state, such as with the change-of-state LE, we usually use Group A verbs. When an object or cause is represented to focus on the transition to new state, again Group A verbs are preferred. When dissuasion is intended, Group A verbs are usually used in the imperative and evaluative constructions. -47-On the other side, Group B verbs are preferred to indicate continuous and homogeneous states. That's why only Group B verbs are used to modify non-transient verbs and ascribe attributes to nouns. That's also why it is Group B verbs are preferred as deverbal nouns, since a referential entity is regarded as a whole unit and thus homogeneous composition is implied."]},{"title":"5.

We argue that it's due to some semantic properties of VV compounds. Generally, VV compounds are distinguished from the SV, VO, AV and VR compounds by the compounding process which incorporates different semantic components to the event structure. In contrast to the other major structures of verb compounding, VV compounds 8 YIHAN could be viewed as a VO compound verb, but also an AN compound noun, because it could be interpreted as an abbreviation of the idiom: YICHUZHIHAN"]},{"title":"it42:11,6","paragraphs":["\"the regret of missing one pearl\", and thus be realized as a noun. If it's true, YIHAN is originally as a noun. As a verb of emotion, it is a denominal verb formed through abbreviation. 9 The inner structure of KUAIHUO is hard to decide. It might be VV (happy and vivid) or AV (live happily). -48-has an important characteristic. In all the other constructions, the V takes one more constituent to elaborate on the event to make it either more complete or more specific. In SV the subject is added to the event structure, in VO an object is incorporated into the event structure, in AV the manner of executing an action is described, and in VR the result of the action is clearly indicated. But a VV compound is leading to another direction. In VV, the concept of an event is \"diffused\" after combining two similar events, since speaker will extract the common attributes of the pair. It is a common morpho-lexical strategy in Mandarin to concatenate two antonyms or synonyms to form the concept of \"kind\" or \"property\". For example, the word DAXIAO )c/J\\, which is composed of DA \"big\" and MAO \"small\", means \"size\". Since the concept of an event is diffused or lifted to \"kind/property\", it's natural for the VV compounds to be chosen to indicate a homogeneous state, but awkward to indicate an inchoative state. That's why we usually select VV compounds to indicate a more referential context, such as a nominalized event or a nominal modifier. It's also a natural consequence that the VV verbs of emotion are seldom chosen to be used in imperative and evaluative constructions, since in both constructions transitional verbal characteristics are highlighted, which is contrary to the nature of a VV compound."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion","paragraphs":["In this paper we have illustrated a consistent contrast in seven types of the verbs of emotion and also propose a semantic interpretation to the contrast. Generally speaking, Group A verbs could be used to indicate inchoative states, and thus are mainly used as a predicate and could be used transitively and in imperative and evaluative constructions. On the contrary, Group B verbs can only indicate homogeneous states, and thus show higher tendency of nominalization and are used as powerful modifiers in being a nominal modifier or an adjunct. We have found that all VV compounds belong to the second group and proposed a semantic explanation for the distribution. In the process of composing an event structure, the VV compound is undergoing a process of merging two individual events and creates a fuzzy concept to contain both events, while the other compounds are undergoing a process of adding a component to the event structure and thus create a more concrete and precise concept. On the research of the regularities between word meaning and it's syntactic behaviors, it's very important to distinguish the construction meaning and the core meaning. We believe that the regularities we've extracted from the VV compounds in the semantic field of emotion exist in all Mandarin VV compounds. A preliminary study shows that all VV compounds in Sinica Corpus do have a higher tendency of nominalization. We will continue our research on VV compounds and expect more findings on the constructions meaning of compounds."]},{"title":"Acknowledgement","paragraphs":["Finally, we have to thank the CKIP group for establishing and maintaining the Sinica Corpus, for without it, all the findings and statistics in the paper couldn't be accomplished."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["CKIP. 1995.
