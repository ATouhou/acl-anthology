INTRODUCTION","paragraphs":["Knowledge representation of the verbal system has always been one of the core issues in both theoretical and computational linguistics. In the early generative paradigm, verbs are considered to be the structural head of the sentence since it subcategorizes its arguments and hence dictates the form of the sentence. Verb meanings are treated as general tendencies in selectional preferences, and the semantic details of individual verbs are largely neglected. Recent development in lexical research has shifted the focus to investigating the interdependency between verb meanings and syntactic behavior. Most lexical semanticists share a common assumption that the syntactic behavior of a verb, especially its argument expression, is determined by the meaning of the verb (cf. Levin, Song and Atkins 1996, Pustejovsky 1995, Levin 1993, Atkins and Levin 1991, Atkins et al. 1988, etc.). Levin (1993) tries to categorize English verbs into semantically distinct classes on the basis of their argument alternation patterns. Pustejovsky (1995)'s program on generative lexicon moves one step further in spelling out a multi-layered representational scheme for lexical information that includes Argument Structure, Event Structure, Qualia Structure, and Inheritance Structure. His goal is to fully represent the interaction of word meaning and its composition.","Another commonly shared belief among lexical semanticists is that the traditional 'sense enumerative lexicon', as Pustejovsky puts it, is inadequate to capture the real picture of natural language semantics. Specifically, such an approach cannot account for three lexically relevant phenomena: the creative use of words, the permeability of word senses, and the expression of multiple syntactic forms with a single word (Pustejovsky 1995: 39). It is argued that a more powerful compositional mechanism with predicative strength is needed to allow coercion of lexical meanings into more complicated or innovative senses.","In view of the fact that lexical knowledge involves more than just the listing of different senses or simple combination of word meanings, we would like to present in this paper an interesting case in Mandarin where a single verb gives rise to various contextualized meanings when combined with a complement NP. The issue under study is the transitive use of GAN () r̀ush' in the pattern of [GAN + NP], such as GAN gongche 'the bus' or GAN baogao 'a paper'. The appropriate interpretation of the pattern requires incorporation of semantic components beyond the purely lexically-specified information. It is proposed that to fully represent the semantics of the pattern, constructional inferences should be included in the knowledge representation of lexical information."]},{"title":"2. THE DATA","paragraphs":["The main body of data for the analysis comes from the Sinica Balanced Corpus of both written and spoken contemporary Mandarin, containing a total of 5 million word, developed by the CKIP group in Academia Sinica, Taiwan. The total number of occurrences of GAN in the corpus is 54, and the transitive use occupies 32 % of the data."]},{"title":"3. INITIAL OBSERVATIONS","paragraphs":["3.1 Temporal Reference in the Use of GAN","The characterization of GAN is highlighted when it is compared with its peer synonym ZHUI (M). We found that one typical use of GAN requires a nominal sense extension as well as a temporal reference. Compare the following examples, where ZHUI and GAN can both take b̀us' as its direct object but render completely different interpretations: (1) a. \\t \\t'chase the bus' ZHUI gongche chase bus 'rush to catch the bus' GAN gongche rush bus","Example (I a) is a prototypical instance of transitive predication where the verb ZHUI may take any movable, spatial-physical entity as its direct object, and the object itself is the goal for the action of chasing. On the other hand, (lb) represents a rather peculiar and semi-fixed pattern in the sense that the nouns GAN may take as direct object do not fulfill the typical Goal-role and the meaning associated with the pattern are highly specified. The NPs following GAN are nominals that invoke an event reading and are contextually associated with a time frame. Therefore, in (1 b), GAN gongche should not be interpreted as a simple event of spatial movement; instead, it describes \"an action of rushing in order to get to the bus stop by a certain TIME\". Such a contrast between the different roles played by the direct object NP is captured as follows: (2) Difference in the Semantic Role of the Direct Object NP","Role of the Direct Object NP ZHUI Spatial Goal GAN","\\t Temporal Target 3.2 Event-Evoking Nominals in the use of GAN","A further contrast between the use of ZHUI and GAN leads us to the conclusion that GAN not only requires a temporal reference, but it is followed only by nominals that evoke an event reading. Consider the following pair of examples where the verb is followed by a measured path: (3) a."]},{"title":"1.0.7 \\t","paragraphs":["ZHUI le liang-bai gongchi chase LE two-hundred meter c̀hased (someone) for two hundred meters'","b."]},{"title":"t","paragraphs":["y"]},{"title":"w ni.aRnmi**","paragraphs":["GAN le liang-bai gongchi de lu/*liang-bai gongchi rush LE two-hundred meter DE journey / two-hundred meter r̀ushed two-hundred meters to finish the journey.'","While it is perfectly fine to add a measured length (t̀wo hundred meters') with ZHUI, it is not allowed with GAN. But, when the measure is embedded as a modifier to describe the length of an undertaken journey as shown in (2b), it can then follow GAN. The reason why the reading of 'making a specific journey' is required with the use of GAN is, we suspect, that GAN has to be associated with some kind of an ACTIVITY, evoked or implicated by the complement NP. In other words, [GAN+NP] actually describes an under-specified EVENT that involves a temporally-framed activity. Only if a nominal is capable of evoking an event reading may it follow the verb GAN. This observation can be further supported by the fact that the utterance GAN le liang-bai \\t gongchi (n7Ij \\t"]},{"title":"n i.aR)","paragraphs":["'rushed two hundred meters' can actually be accepted if it refers to an activity that can be 'measured out' (Tenny 1992).

In the following sections, we will concentrate specifically on the semantic properties associated with the transitive use of GAN."]},{"title":"4.","paragraphs":["CONSTRUCTIONAL INFERENCES IN THE CASE OF GAN","As shown above, the verb GAN is rather restrictive in its argument selection with respect to the transitive pattern [GAN + NP]. In the corpus, there are two major types of NPs associated with the pattern, and each facilitates a unique interpretation of the construction. 4.1 Types of NPs in [GAN + NP]","The NPs following GAN can be either Animate or Inanimate. Animate NPs refer mostly to humans or animals, as shown in (4). Inanimate NPs can be further divided into four sub-groups, as shown in (5): (4) Animate NPs: GAN ren/wenzi/maque/niu/yang D̀rive away people/mosquitoes/sparrows/cows/sheep' (5) Inanimate NPs: a.

Lexically specified (overt) time expressions: GAN shijian/san-dian-ban/jindu R̀ush to save time/to get to the bank by 3:30/to catch up with projected progress' d. Artifacts to be produced by a deadline:"]},{"title":"C-ri/fifA/7\"/AN/14","paragraphs":["GAN baogao/zuoye/ke/yifu/huo R̀ush to finish writing a paper/writing homework/teaching classes/making clothes/manufacturing products'","The two types of NPs share the same surface form - [GAN + NP], but render quite different interpretations. 4.2 Interpretational Distinction","As discussed above, the construction [GAN + NP] describes a telic event, that is, the event is bounded with a target state. With Animate object-NPs, the verb GAN encodes a purposeful action that aims to 'move the object IN or OUT of a designated area'. In the example of GAN ren (j A ) , the agent is performing an action to drive 'people' out of a certain place; while in the example of GAN yang (nT.), it's more likely that the agent is driving the sheep into an area (e.g. the pen). The action of GAN results in a spatial movement or locational change on the part of the object-NP.","With Inanimate object-NPs, however, [GAN + NP] describes a bounded event whose interpretation is much more complicated. The interpretation reads like: 'to achieve a STATE by a certain TIME through engaging in an ACTIVITY'. It involves at least three meaning components: an ACTIVITY performed by the agent, a STATE associated with the object, and a TIME FRAME. In the example of GAN baogao (, ym i--, ), the underspecified activity is ẁriting a paper', the goal is to get the paper done, and the time frame is the deadline for submitting the paper. What's interesting is that all the information about the èllipsed' activity/goal/time is missing from the purely lexically-specified meaning of either the verb or the nominal. The interpretational distinction between the two types of [GAN + NP] can be captured as follows: (6) Animacy and Interpretational Difference in x [GAN + NP(y)]","Interpretation","With Animate NP Target State = (in-or-out (y, Loc))","With Inanimate NP Target State = (x reaches State (y) by Time (t)","through Activity (w)) 4.3 Other Salient Information with Inanimate NPs","Given the interpretational complexity in the pattern [GAN + Inanimate NP], more has to be said concerning the details of its semantic representation. We found that the semantics of the inanimate pattern should also include the following: • Presupposition: Normal pace of performing the activity is not enough (already being late","with respect to the TIME frame). • Manner: with accelerating pace • Telicity: The event is bounded with a projected endpoint (the target state). • Agent-control: The activity is completely under the agent's control.","This last feature captures the fact that the agent of GAN has to be the actor undertaking the implicated activity. For example, GAN yifu (nA)) cannot be taken as 'rushing someone to finish making the clothes', but can only be said of a dressmaker or tailor.","The issue here is that all the above semantic specificities and the information about the \"ellipsed\" activity/goal/time in the [GAN + Inanimate NP] pattern cannot be obtained directly from the lexicon. Only when combining the verb GAN with a potentially event-evoking inanimate nominal is the information automatically generated."]},{"title":"5. INFORMATION BEYOND THE VERB: EXPLANATORY FRAMEWORKS","paragraphs":["How can we explain and represent the fact that the construction [GAN + NP] contains more information than what is specified in the lexicon for the individual word. There are two ways of dealing with it. One is the construction-based approach, taking [GAN + NP] as a form-meaning pair. The other is the compositional approach that allows coercion of lexical information. 5.1 Construction-Based Approach","From the perspective of Construction Grammar (Goldberg 1995, Fillmore and Kay 1993), a c̀onstruction' can be viewed as a meaning-bearing unit, i.e. the syntactic configuration itself c̀ontributes semantic content above and beyond that contained in the constituent lexical items' (Jackendoff 1997:553). A construction (or constructional idiom) represents a form-meaning association, that functions, in a broader sense, just like a lexical item. The meaning of a construction is learnable in the same way word meanings are learned. Taking a semi-fixed VP pattern [GAN +NP] as a constructional idiom allows as to specify the unique semantic features associated with the pattern which go beyond the semantics of its constituent words.","Given the fact that two types of NPs may occur with GAN and each is associated with a peculiar interpretation, we may propose that there are two distinct Constructions:","(7)","a. Construction 1 Form: [GAN + Animate NP] Meaning: a spatially bounded event [to reach a Target State by causing the NP to move","In or Out of a designated space]. Example: nA,GAN-people'","b.

Instantiation: -\\tG̀AN-homework' (NP-Nominal Activity)","ACTIVITY [writing the homework] by TIME [deadline] -"]},{"title":"E, v#","paragraphs":["G̀AN-3:30' (NP-Time) ACTIVITY [rushing to the bank] by TIME [3:30]","Although the associated meanings are quite distinct, the construction is considered to be polysemous in the sense that there seems to be a conceptual link between the two senses. Sense 1 highlights a intended movement in space, which is utilized to describe the progression of event in time. This confirms the general cognitive principle that spatial movement usually provides the conceptual basis for expressing temporal or eventive processes (The Localist Hypothesis, Lyons 1977). 5.2 Compositional Approach: Qualia Structure","Pustejovsky (1995) proposed a generative, multi-leveled framework to represent lexical information. The four levels in the structured representation are Argument Structure (for the representation of adicity information for functional elements), Event Structure (for the representation of information related to Aktionsarten and event type, in the sense of Vendler 1967), Qualia Structure (for the representation of the defining attributes of an object), and Inheritance Structure (for the representation of the relation between the lexical item and others in the lexicon). Among the four levels, Qualia Structure is responsible for the relational force of a lexical item. It specifies four essential aspects of a word's meaning: • Constitutive: the relation between an object and its constituent parts; • Formal: that which distinguishes it within a larger domain; • Telic: its purpose and function; • Agentive: factors involved in its origin or 'bringing it about'.","As Pustejovsky (1995: 87-88) made it clear that Qualia Structure, as defined above, not only characterizes our knowledge of words, but also suggests interpretations of words in context. The English verb enjoy is used as an illustration. Consider the examples below:","(9) a. Mary enjoyed the movie last night. (watching) b. John quite enjoys his morning coffee. (drinking) The different contextual meanings of enjoy or the èllipsed' activities are supplied by information from the complement. More specifically, the Telic roles for movie and coffee project the activities of watching the movie and drinking coffee, respectively, to the interpretation of the VP. In other words, Qualia structure provides a compositional means for meaning coercion based on characterizations of the four different roles.","The analysis of English enjoy parallels the case of Mandarin GAN with Inanimate NPs in that [GAN + Inanimate NP] also involves an ellipsed activity whose information is provided by the object-NP. Through coercion of one of the qualia roles, the information about the Activity or Time Frame can be integrated into the interpretation of the verb phrase, as illustrated below:","(10) Qualia Representaion a. GAN gongche\\t\\t 'rush to catch the bus'","Bus [Telic = running on a fixed schedule b. GAN baogao \\t 'rush to finish the paper'","Paper [Agentive = writing]","What is interesting here is that Qualia Structure can also solve potential ambiguity problems in some cases. Take ntbR G̀AN-Ball Games' as an example, which allows two different interpretations, each with a different qualia role: (11) Two Different Interpretations with nt4 ‘GAN-Ball Games' ky-T EilAthR. GAN le san-chang bisai. a. 'Rush to play three games' b. 'Rush to watch three games.'","(12) Different Roles for th4 '(Ball) Games' a. [Telic = entertaining/watching] b. [Agentive = playing]","The distinction between Telic and Agentive role is also crucial in deriving the correct interpretation of [GAN + NP] where the NP is associated with verbs of creation, i.e. the NP comes into being through verbs of creation, such as (̀writng) a book/song' . In the examples below, only the Agentive interpretation is allowed:","(13) Agentive interpretation","a. nxt:","GAN shu","r̀ush to write/*read the book'","b.. na GAN ge r̀ush to write/*sing the song'","c. tym GAN xi r̀ush to produce/*watch the show' With the specified attributes or roles in the Qualia Structure, contextual meanings or information beyond individual lexical items can be facilitated through semantic coercion, without the cost of additional explanatory or representational mechanisms."]},{"title":"6.

The appropriate interpretation of the construction [GAN + NP] involves information beyond lexical semantic specification of its constituent words and thus requires additional mechanisms for semantic integration. To fully represent the information, two equally applicable approaches are suggested in this paper. The first is based on proposals of Construction Grammar, in which \"constructions\" are treated as lexical items which are uniquely associated with a given \"meaning\". In this view, [GAN + NP] will be listed in the lexicon as a meaning-bearing unit with all the information needed. The second approach is introduced in Pustejovsky (1995), where a Qualia Structure is used to specify four different meaning facets (Constitutive, Formal, Telic and Agentive attributes) for each lexical item, and contextual interpretation can be borne out through attribute coercion. As a pilot work on Mandarin lexical semantic research, this study has the following implications:","• Mandarin lexical semantic studies are advancing but are still in a primitive stage. More","comprehensive investigation is needed to identify a set of crucial semantic attributes as well","as compositional principles that have syntactic consequences.","• Constructional inferences as discussed above call for an unified and systematic treatment when dealing with semantic representation of Mandarin."]},{"title":"8.
