Email: r6142001@,ms.cc.ntu.edu.tw","ABSTRACT","This paper discusses the discourse behavior of Chinese causal connectives yinwei \"because- and suoyi \"so\" from the perspective of grammaticalization, and claims that the underlying motivation for such is coherence, which involves pragmatic and cognitive interpretation. We claim that the majority of yinwei and suoyi are used pragmatically, and they are grammaticalized. This grammaticalization of discourse connectives is motivated by \"collaboration.\" This paper explicitly identifies the semantic and pragmatic functions of yinwei and suoyi. Our findings support that conversation is a collaborative process, and shov1/4 that interlocutors collaborate not only on phrasal or sentential level, but on discourse-level as well.","1. Introduction","Pragmatic approaches to connectives are prevalent in the linguistic literature [2][13]115]. We believe that Chinese causal connectives yinwei \"because\" and suoyi \"so\" perform pragmatic functions in discourse. and are involved in the maintenance of coherence. The usage of causal connectives deserves investigation. and those pragmatic functions of discourse connectives also need further classification.","Our first hypothesis is that yinwei and suoyi are grammaticalized and used pragmatically. We suggest that connectives are often used to achieve discourse coherence. Semantically, ..yinwei and suoyi convex causal relation, but besides semantic function, they also perform pragmatic functions of coherence_ That is. one can use yinwei and suoyi to link two clauses or discourse units that have no causal relationship. This paper will also demonstrate that discourse connectives play an important role in the turn-taking behavior. Interlocutors use connectives to take, yield or hold one's turn. Our second hypothesis is that this grammaticalization of discourse connectives is motivated by \"collaboration.\" This paper investigates the collaboration on discourse coherence via the use of connectives, and aims to claim that collaboration occurs on discourse-level. It is conversants' intention to collaborate that results in those pragmatic functions of connectives, and then the grammaticalization. We examine Chinese causal connectives. and discuss their collaborative usage in terms of form and type of discourse.","2. Literature Review 2.1 Discourse connectives and coherence","Kurdish connective veca \"so,\" French connective parce que \"because,\" and English connective so and because have been discussed [2]1131[15]. These discourse connectives have more than one uses in conversations, and the difference between their semantic and pragmatic functions is also recognized. But their pragmatic functions need further investigation and classification. Chinese causal connectives yinwei and suoyi has also been investigated [16]. Some discourse functions are mentioned, but the usage is not observed in depth. Some causal clause extensions to others' turns are noticed, but is not discussed further.","Coherence-based approach to discourse is argued not to be an adequate framework for the analysis of discourse connectives [13][15], but coherence should not be defined so narrowly. Though coherence is a semantic concept when it was first used, it can involve pragmatic and cognitive notions under a broader definition [ l et]. Coherence can be defined from the perspective of processing [1 ], and be treated as a cognitive phenomenon in the mind [8]. 2.2 Collaboration","Coates [6] holds that when multiple interlocutors talk, \"often their contributions relate back to an earlier contribution they had made, rather than to a contiguous contribution from another speaker. - But from the perspective of collaboration, this traditional point-of-view is not an adequate description of conversation. Collaboration is first discussed on NP-level [3]. Then, the discussion of collaboration is augmented to sentence-level [4]. Continuation is also mentioned [17], where the structure of the prior turn is potentially complete, but another participant elects to build onto that sentence frame in a subsequent turn. Thus, continuation indicates the discourse-level collaboration; however, it is not examined in depth.","3. Data & Methodology","The corpus comprises over 2 hours of two-party conversational discourse, including 49'01 - of face-to-face natural conversation and 78'09\" of radio interview. All data were divided into intonation units and transcribed under the convention of Du Bois et al. [7]. In this study, 8104 intonation units were observed.","Yinwei \"because\" and suoyi \"so\" are used as a pair, conveying the semantic relation of causality. The typical form of the pair is \"yinwei suoyi ...\" In this case, we treat yinwei as preposing in the pair and suoyi as postposing. Throughout this paper, we use the term \"prepose\" and -postpose\" to refer to the position of yinwei and suoyi. According to most grammar books of Chinese (ex.[12]), yinwei and suoyi occur as a pair with a preposing yinwei and a postposing suoyi. But in conversations, yinwei and suoyi can occur independently, and the positions of yinwei and suoyi are not fixed. In our data. we recognize six t ypes of causal connective pairs, and each pair of yinwei and suoyi was counted as one token:","A. yinwei suoyi\\tC.\\tyinwei\\tE. suoyi","B. 0 suoyi\\tD. yinwei 0 ...\\tF:\\tyinwei 4. Findings","4.1 Classification That connectives have both semantic and pragmatic meaning is not a new idea [9]. The pragmatic","usage can be further classified according to their functions. Besides, the turn-taking behavior is closely","related to discourse connectives, and can be a parameter of further classification of pragmatic usage. too.","4. 1 . 1 Semantic function Semantically, yinwei and suoyi introduce a cause or a consequence both in local or global scope [151.","While the local relation is between two adjacent clauses, the global relation is between a clause and a large","discourse unit or two discourse units.

This function is actually owing to two discourse pressure: 1) the maintenance of coherence, and 2) the rule-governed behavior of turn-taking. The speaker may simply use the connective to make his turn sound coherent. The connective may also be used when the speaker has nothing to say but is obliged to talk because of the rule-governed turn-taking behavior.","(9) <job>","345.\\t..\\tzong yao zuo dian shi.1","(=>","346.A: ...(1)suoyi,_\\t* Turn Justification","347.\\t..\\tkeshi wo juede--","\"B: Anyway, you have to do something.","A: So, but I feel...\" 4.2 Distribution Table 1: The distribution of yinwei in conversation","Prepose Postpose Total Causal 26 (53.1%) 23 (46.9%) 49","[60.5%] [14.2%] [23.9%] Further 10(9.3%) 98 (90.7%) 108 Explanation [23.3%] [60.5%] [52.7%] Topic 5 (83.3%) 1 (16.7%) 6 Initiator [11.6%] [0.6%] [2.9%] Floor 2 (7.4%) 25 (92.6%) 27 Holding [4.7%] [15.4%] [13.2%] Floor Taking 0 (--) 6 (100%) 6","[--] [3.7%] [2.9%] Turn 0 (--) 9 (100%) 9 Justification [--] [5.6%] [4.4%] Total 43 (21%) 162 (79%) 205 Table 2: The distribution of suoyi in conversation","Prepose Postpose- Total Consequential 0 (--) 33 (100%) 33","[--] [20.4%] [19.8%] Further 1 (1.4%) 70 (98.6%) 71 Explanation [20%] [43.2%] [42.5 %] Topic Initiator 3 (60%) 2 (40%) 5","[60%] [1.2%] [3%] Floor Holding 0 (--) 16 (100%) 16","[--] [9.9%] [9.6%1 Floor Taking 1 (5%) 19 (95%) 20","[20%] [11.7%] 112%j Turn 0 (--) 22 (100%) 22 Justification [--] [13.6%] [13.2%1 Total 5 (3%) 162 (97%) 167","Table and 2 deal with yinwei and suoyi in terms of their positions and functions.

This demonstrates that unlike what grammar books predict, postposing is the preferred position for yinwei in conversations. The preposing position mostly performs semantic function. since 60.5% of preposing yinwei expresses causality. On the other hand. more than 85% of postposing yinwei performs pragmatic functions. There is no significantly preferred position for semantic function, while postposing is the preferred position for pragmatic functions. except Topic Initiator. Only 23.9% of yinwei is used semantically, so we can conclude that pragmatic functions are quite prevalent in conversations. Among these functions. Further Explanation seems to be the dominant one. 1","n Table 2, we find that 97% of suoyi is postposed. The postposing position of suoyi is overwhelmingl\\ preferred, since this is its basic position in the pair. However, suoyi is sometimes preposed. and this position only performs pragmatic functions, especially Topic Initiator. Like yinwei. the usage of pragmatic functions obviously outnumbers the semantic use, and Further Explanation is the most frequent one.","Table 3: The distribution of yinwei and suoyi in conversation","yinwei suoyi Total\\t1","Causal/Consequential 49 (59.8%) 33 (40.2%) I 82","Further Explanation 108 (60.3%) 71 (39.7%) 179","Topic Initiator 6 (54.5%) 5 (45.5%) 11","Floor Holding 27 (62 8%) 16 (37.2%)","i","i 43","Floor Taking 6 (23.1%) 20 (76.9%) 26","Turn Justification 9 (29%) 22 (7 1 %) 31","Total 205 (55.1%) 167 (44.9%) 372","Table 3 compares each functions specific association with yinwei and suoyi. Further Explanation and Floor Holding tend to be associated with yinwei, while Floor Taking and Turn Justification tend to be performed with suoyi. We claim that this preference is not an arbitrary strategy. This phenomenon reflects different internal properties of yinwei and suoyi on discourse level. Since Floor Taking and Turn Justification involve initiating or even taking over a turn, it is probably that suoyi is more \"active' . in the discourse than yinwei. Suoyi usually positively takes the turn, while yinwei merely negativel y holds the turn.","Table 4 sheds light on the interaction between forms and functions. For instance. example (7) will be placed in the form 2 ( 0 ... suoyi...) with pragmatic uses ̀. It is obvious that the forms 5 and 6 (suoyi ... and suoyi... yinwei...) with preposing suoyi never have the semantic use, while the forms 2 and 3 mostly perform pragmatic functions. Besides, the semantic function seems not to be associated with an y particular Table I, 2 and 3 do not deal with yinwei and suoyi as a pair but independently. That is. in the pair of","suoyi , yinwei is counted once and suoyi is counted once independently. Each occurrence of yinwei or Away/ is counted according to the number of functions performed. For example. if a token of yinwei performs both the functions of Further Explanation and Floor Holding, it will be counted twice in Table 1 -- once as the former function and once as the latter. Similarly, if a token of suoyi performs three functions, it will be counted three times in Table 2. In Table 1, 2 and 4. the round brackets represent column percentage, and the square ones represent row percentage. 2 Because the suoyi in example (7) performs two pragmatic functions, it is counted twice in Table 4. since Table 4 is the table of function distribution. And that is why the total number of causal connective pairs is different in Table 4 and Table 5. Table 5 is the table of form distribution, and each occurrence of the pair is counted as one token, regardless how many functions it may perform. Since one pair ma y have more than one timctions„ it is reasonable that the total number in Table 4 outnumbers that in Table 5. -115-","Table 5: Form distribution Form","\\toccurrence 1\\tyinwei...suoyi\\t18 2\\t"]},{"title":"0","paragraphs":["...suovi...\\t109 3 i\\t0 ...yinwei...\\t135 4 yinwei... 0 ...\\t24 5\\tSU op „\\t2","6\\tsuoyi...yinwei...\\t2","290Total\\ti i 6.2 37.6 46 8 0 7 0.7 100 form. but pragmatic functions do incline to be associated with the forms 2 and 3.

We argue that the underlyiniy, principle of such usage is coherence. Using a causal connective may positively relate an utterance back to die prior discourse, making the current contribution more coherent. Yinwei and suoyi are used to express not only the semantic meaning of causality, but also some discourse-level meaning. Since yinwei and .s://01,1 do not only convey the lexical meaning, they are used pragmatically and grammaticalized in the sense of Heine et al.[10]. Our result also supports Hopper's claim [11] that grammar is emergent but never specific.","5. Collaboration","This section attempts to investigate the collaboration of interlocutors in terms the use of discourse","connectives. Interlocutors collaborate in many ways: actually, developing the conversation itself is","collaboration.

Conclusion","This paper discusses conversational collaboration in terms of the use of Chinese causal connectives yinwei and suoyi. It is shown that type of discourse affects the collaboration of interlocutors. In less casual conversations, such as radio interview. speakers more frequently use causal connectives collaboratively. Our findings support that conversation is a collaborative process In and show that interlocutors collaborate on discourse-level. Using a connective to continue others' contributions is a positive indicator of collaboration. since an overt connective helps maintain the coherence. Observing the usage of yinwei and .vuoyi in conversational discourse, we find that yinwei and suoyi are preferred to occur independently in the postposing position of the pair. Besides the semantic function of causality. they also perform many pragmatic functions, such as Further Explanation, Topic Initiator. Floor Holding, Floor . Taking and Turn Justification. According to our corpus, the pragmatic use of yinwei and suoyi outnumbers their semantic use with the percentage of almost 80 0/O. The underlying principle of such pragmatic usage is to maintain the coherence of discourse. Since the majority of yinwei and suoyi are used pragmaticall y. we conclude that they are grammaticalized.","Reference: jll Beargrande, Robert de. (1980) Text, Discourse. and Process. In Freedle.
