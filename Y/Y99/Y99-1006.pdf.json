By studying Chinese data, the difference between the topic \"English-style\", which is co-referential with some (overt or covert) element in the comment, and the topic \"Chinese-style\", which is related to the comment by a relation of aboutness, is quite striking.' Both types of topic are exemplified in (1) and (2) respectively.","(1) [Zhe ben xiaoshuoji Zhangsan kanwan\\tle\\tel. this CL novel\\tZhangsan read finish Perf (This novel, Zhangsan has finished.)","(2) Neike shu, yezi\\tda. that tree leaves big (That tree, the leaves are big.)","In (1) there is an empty trace, interpreted as a zero anaphor that is bound by the topic. By contrast, there is no such syntactic position inside the comment associated with the topic in (2). Instead, topic and comment are related with each other pragmatically. Therefore, the topic in (2) is considered by some scholars to be \"base-generated\" in front of the sentence, and to have an \"aboutness\"-relation to the remaining sentence (e.g. [5]). However, a definition of \"aboutness\" is still not given. A pure syntactic definition of topic as an extraposition fails in the face of examples *The author is grateful to Manfred Pinkal for numerous fruitful discussions and for his encouragement. A special debt of gratitude to Claire Gardent and Johan Bos for their constructive comments. 'This dichotomy originated with [3]. Chinese-style topic constructions are also widespread in other topic-prominent languages such as Japanese, Korean, Lahu and Lisu ([5]). such as (2) while the relational approach advocated in [10] leaves open how to characterize the relation between topic and comment in (2). Furthermore, the semantics of the Chinese-style topic construction remains unexplored.","In this paper, we propose a uniform semantic framework for interpreting the TCS in Chinese. We assume that the topic constituents bind anaphors inside the comments, such as pro-forms and implicit anaphora. Because the comments contain unresolved anaphors, they are semantically incomplete or underspecified. The semantic interpretation of TCS is given by anaphora resolution. In the absence of a direct anaphoric relation as in (2), a bridging inference is triggered. The proposed interpretation will be modelled in a discourse semantic framework by extending Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) with topic-comment articulations. We will show that this approach can also capture multiple-topic constructions and topic chains.","The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 gives a brief review of related approaches. It shows that to capture the topic-comment relations we have to take a closer look at the semantic properties of the TCS. Section 3 discusses how bridging works to account for the semantical relations in the TCS. Section 4 presents a DRT-based framework of topic-comment structure, which is applied to some examples of linking and bridging as well as to some dangling topic constructions involving ellipsis in section 5. We extend our framework to topic chains in section 6 and to multiple-topic constructions in section 7. Section 8 concludes with pointers for future research."]},{"title":"2 A BRIEF REVIEW","paragraphs":["In this section we start by discussing the syntactic approach of [8] which considers topicalized sentences as derivation from a more basic structure. We show that such a reanalysis cannot capture the great variety of topic-comment relations. Furthermore we argue that the relational approach of [10] which relate the pragmatic function and the syntactic properties of topic fails to specify the semantic relationship of the Chinese-style topic to the comment.","The Derivation Approach of [8] considers the TCS as a grammatical device invoked to fulfill certain discourse functions. Shi's claim is that all topics are related to a structural position inside the comment. The comment itself is thus an open clause with a gap, namely, a position filled by an empty category or a resumptive pronoun, which is co-referential with the topic. That is, he attempts to define the concept of aboutness syntactically. The major supporting argument of [8] is that subject and object are not the only positions which the topic can relate to. The oblique object of adjunct adverbial PPs for example, often serves as the position bound by the topic as illustrated in (3). (3) can be seen as derived from (4).","(3) Zhe jian shiqing ni bu neng guang mafan yi ge ren. this CL matter you not can only bother one CL person (For this matter, you cannot only bother one person.)","(4) Ni wei zhe jian shiqing, bu neng guang mafan yi ge yen. you for this CL matter not can only bother one CL person (You cannot only bother one person for this matter.)","The derivation approach attempts to show that Chinese-style topic constructions are derived from some basic sentence structure via syntactic operations like movement and deletion. However, such a claim is not always supported by the data. As (5) shows, there is not always a more basic sentence from which to derive the TCS. Although (5) can be paraphrased as (6), (6) is not to be considered as the basic form that (5) is derived from, because (5) sounds more natural than (6).","(5) Hua, Mali zui xihuan meiguihua. flower Mary most like \\trose (Concerning flower, Mary likes roses the most.)","(6) Suoyou de\\thua\\tzhong Mali zui xihuan meiguihua. all\\tMOD flower among Mary most like \\trose (Among all flowers, Mary likes roses the most.)","Moreover, in the interpretation of (7), it is the teacher Wang who cannot come. By contrast, (8) is ambiguous as either teacher Wang or his daughter can be understood as not being able to come. The \"re-interpretation\" approach fails to account for this difference.","(7) Wanglaoshil , nuer2\\tbing le,\\tel bu neng lai. teacher Wang daughter ill ASP \\tnot can come (As for teacher Wang, his daughter is ill, (he) cannot come.)","(8) Wanglaoshii de\\tnuer2\\tbing le,\\tel/e2 bu neng lai. teacher Wang MOD daughter ill ASP\\tnot can come (The daughter of teacher Wang is ill, (he/she) cannot come.)","The Relational Approach of [10] generalizes the TCS with gap (1) and without gap (2), and define the topic as the element X in [siX[s...Y...]], where X is a major category and Y, possibly empty, is related to X.","The related constituent (empty category or lexical item) in the comment is interpreted as a pro-form whose antecedent is the topic. (1) is then interpreted as as for this novel, Zhangsan has finished it. This interpretation obviously corresponds to our intuition. However, [10] do not explore how to apply the topic definition to (2). In (2) there is a non-empty lexical item relating to the topic, but in an indirect way. The present approach originates from the underlying assumption of [10]. We give a more precise semantic analysis of TCS and propose that the semantics of TCS involve an anaphoric relation which must be resolved during comprehension."]},{"title":"3 TCS, BRIDGING, AND ANAPHORA","paragraphs":["The relations between topic and comment, which are pragmatically defined as \"aboutness\", appear semantically in great variety. In (2) the leaves are part of the tree introduced as topic. In (9) the topic gives the place where the speaker grew something. In (10) the female students whom Peter gave books to belong to the students mentioned in the topic.","(9) Nei ge huayuan, women yiging zhongshang e le. that CL garden we\\talready grow\\tASP (That garden, we already grew.)","(10) Zhexie xuesheng, Bide gei le\\tmeige nusheng\\tyi ben shu. these students Peter give ASP every female students a CL book (These students, Peter gave every female students a book.)","Nevertheless, these examples have in common that each topic has a bridging relation to an element inside the comment. These bridging relations are an essential part of the sentential content in the sense that without this information, the lack of connection between topic and comment would make the sentences incoherent and therefore incomprehensible. To capture the semantic of TCS, we have to build a bridge between topic and comment.","Bridging is defined in [1] as \"an inference that two objects or events that are introduced in a text are related in a particular way that isn't explicitly stated.\" The most investigated bridging relation is triggered by functional anaphora which appear in a context where no actual antecedents are present, but the network of discourse referents that are previously established provides the right -53-antecedent. In TCS, however, bridging originally arises out of a coherence constraint on the TCS, as it checks to see if a comment can be attached to a topic preceding it. Semantically this means that there is an anaphor inside the comment which is anaphoric to the topic. Precisely, the topic gives an antecedent which should be picked up in the comment. The English-style topics have a direct anaphoric relation to the comment while the Chinese-style topics have an indirect reference to the comment. Bridging occurs if no explicit anaphor is present inside the comment.","We adopt the view of [2] who consider bridging as a possibility for anaphora resolution. Anaphora resolution can take place in three different ways: linking to an accessible 2 suitable antecedent in discourse, bridging to an accessible antecedent with accommodated material or accommodating the anaphoric information into the discourse. Linking is prefered to bridging, and bridging to accommodation. To handle functional anaphora, [2] develop a theory of bridging by extending [7]'s work with lexical knowledge. The strategy is to include more lexical information represented as qualia structure ([6]) in the discourse, so that functional anaphora can link to objects of this additional information. Qualia information is normally not accessible and does not affect the truth-conditions of discourse. If necessary, it is put forward to the surface by a process called coercive accommodation, and is then available for anaphora resolution.","Lexical knowledge is also utilised to meet the coherence constraints imposed by the TCS. As mentioned above inside TCS, bridging can be triggered by the coherence constraint, as this requires that some element u of the comment relates in some way B to the topic. B can be linking or bridging. In the second case, the lexical information about u is involved in the interpretation. (2), for example, can be interpreted as a comment to the topic that tree if one can infer that (i) leaves are part of some bigger plant, (ii) the leaves which are big are part of x, and (iii) x is identical with that tree. (i) is implied in lexical knowledge of leaves. (ii) results from accommodating (i) into the comment. (iii) is the anaphora resolution of x. In section 4, we show how the semantics of TCS can be computed in a discourse semantic framework."]},{"title":"4 DISCOURSE SEMANTICS OF TCS","paragraphs":["In this section we present a semantic analysis of TCS in a version of DRT. In TCS, a topic constituent outscopes the whole sentence or a sequence of sentences. It is however anaphorically related by anaphora to the subsequent sentences. So the semantic representation of TCS must give an account of this semantic effect. The representational framework DRT seems to be an appropriate formalism because the discourse information of discourse referents is processed in a dynamic way. To interpret the TCS, we extend DRT with topic-comment articulations. After a brief description of how DRT works and how anaphora is handled in DRT, we show how a DRT approach can be used to capture the TCS. 4.1 Discourse Representation Structures In DRT sentential meaning is interpreted with respect to the context in which the sentence is embedded. The discourse information is represented in the form of a discourse representation structure (DRS) built algorithmically on the basis of the syntactic analysis. A DRS K consists of a set of discourse referents (DR) UK = {x, y,z,...,X, Y, Z, _1 3 and a set of conditions about these DRs CK. DRS-Construction processes in a dynamic way in that the current sentence is added to the DRS constructed for the previous discourse thus yielding a new DRS as a context for the interpretation of subsequent sentences. To represent anaphoric information, a new DR is introduced. As condition this DR has to be linked with some accessible DR. [2] introduce a special type of DRSs called a-DRSs to mark anaphoric information. The a-operator quantifies over a DR which should be bound by a DR established before. DRSs that contain a-DRSs are unresolved DRSs. a-DRS resolution results from linking the a-DR to an accessible and suitable DR in the 2 Accessibility is defined in [4]. 3 Upper letters represent plural DRs. DRS of the previous discourse, or from building a bridge between the a-DRS and an accessible DR in the previous DRS by accommodating related lexical information.","DRSs with no unresolved a-DRSs are proper DRSs. Proper DRSs can be interpreted in a certain model: they are true with respect to that model if they can be embedded in it ([4]). In this paper we will not discuss the model theory in more detail. Rather we will concentrate on the DRS construction and resolution process. 4.2 DRS- Construction of TCS The DRS-construction of TCS is implemented in two steps: firstly, topic and comment are translated into a TC-DRS. Secondly, the TC-DRS is resolved, yielding an anaphoric relation with the topic discourse referents (T-DR), i.e. the discourse referent for the topic contituent, as antecedent. The algorithm for DRS-construction of TCS can be illustrated in the following diagram. Topic-Comment Structure 41-TC-DRS 41, DRS","A TC-DRS is a DRS segmented for topic-comment articulation. It is defined as a DRS with a separate part for T-DRS and C-DRS, i.e. temporary DRSs4 representing the topic and comment information respectively. T-DRS and C-DRS can only occur in a TC-DRS simultaneously. The vocabulary of TC-DRS is the same as defined in standard DRS ([4]) except that T-DR are written as variables with a t-superscript, e.g. xt , yt . In what follows, we define the syntax of T-DRS, C-DRS and TC-DRS. Definition: Syntax of Topic DRS (T-DRS) A DRS K =< U, C > is a T-DRS, if U contains exactly one topic discourse referent, or C contains an a-DRS whose a-DR is a topic discourse referent. Definition: Syntax of Comment DRS (C-DRS) K is a C-DRS, iff K is a simple DRS or a TC-DRS. Definition: Syntax of Topic-Comment segmented DRS (TC-DRS) K\\tU, C, KT , KG > is a TC-DRS, if U is a set of discourse referents, C is a set of DRS-conditions, KT is a T-DRS and KC is a C-DRS. 4.2.1 TC-DRS Construction The construction of T-DRS and C-DRS is according to [4] and [2], except for the t-marking of T-DR. Assuming that the syntactic tree of a TCS S' is","4Temporary DRSs are represented by dotted boxes. Proper DRSs may not contain any temporary DRSs as these are not assigned any semantics and should be resolved by discourse information. S' TOPIC then the translation rule of TCS into a TC-DRS is formulated as below: Translation Rule for TC-DRS:","a. Translate TOPIC into a T-DRS KT , where the DR introduced by the topic is a T-DR. b. Translate S into a C-DRS KC. c. The current DRS K =< U, C > is updated to a TC-DRS =< U, C, KT , KG >. 4.2.2 TC-DRS Resolution By the resolution of TC-DRS, two cases are to be distinguished: in the first case the C-DRS contains an explicit anaphor (represented as a-DRS) relating to the T-DR and a direct linking is allowed; in the second case, the anaphor relating to the T-DR should be accommodated by bridging inference. If it succeeds in one of these ways, a normal DRS results. Otherwise, an error message is returned.

Firstly, we concentrate on the linking relation involved in explicit anaphors. Secondly, we discuss bridging inferences. After that, we give examples of topic-comment relations resulting from domain restriction of quantification. In addition, we briefly take up TCS involving other constructions. 5.1 TCS with Explicit Anaphoric Relation Explicit anaphoric relations between topic and comment can involve pronouns or definite descriptions. The syntactic tree of (1) is shown in (Ha). It is translated into TC-DRS in two steps: firstly, TOPIC is translated into a T-DRS K r and then S into a C-DRS KG (lib). The empty pronoun in the object position introduces an a-DRS. Because the T-DR xt is a suitable antecedent for the a-DR z, we get the resolved DRS (11c). (11) a. C.

As shown in (14a), there is neither a pronoun nor a definite description which introduces an a-DRS in K C . So bridging is necessery to justify the TCS. Specifically, the background knowledge that leaves are part of some plant, and tree is a plant supports the bridge. (14a) is then updated to (14b). (14c) results from TC-DRS resolution.","(9) is an other example of such dangling topics. As shown in (15a), the comment clause contains an empty pronoun, but it is not coindexed with the topic. In the natural interpretation we grew some plants in the garden, rather than the garden itself. The bridging is given by the background knowledge that plants are grown in a field such as a garden. (9) means that that garden, we already grew something in it. So the empty pronoun is interpreted as an anaphoric element relating to the topic by bridging, as shown in (15b). 5.3 Domain of Quantification Besides explicit anaphoric relations involving pronouns and definite descriptions, and implicit anaphoric relations provided by bridging, there is another kind of topic-comment relations given by quantificational domains. It is generally assumed that the domain of quantification depends on the context ([9]). It can be seen as an implicit argument of a quantifier since it is usually not uttered literally, but will be instantiated by the context information. In TCS, the domain of quantification is activated to be bound by the topic. In (10), the domain of the all-quantifier every inside the comment is restricted by the topic, i.e. Peter did not give every female student in the world a book, but every female student belonging to the student group given in the topic. We consider the restriction relation between topic and comment as an anphoric binding in the sense, that the quantifier generates a domain variable to be bound by the topic, as shown in (16a). The domain variable Z is resolved in (16b) by being linked to the T-DR X.","KT L..1- \\tXt -1 students(XJ _"]},{"title":"rI-","paragraphs":["u = peter* femal_student(y) y EZ a(Z)","--+ book(v) gave(u, y, NT) KG (16 a. b.

The topics seem to be a dangling one. In this section, we take a closer look at these examples, and argue that the comment clauses in these constructions are elliptical, so that the relating elements inside the comment are missing on the surface. By ellipsis resolution we can obtain the anaphoric relation between topic and comment.","Taking the famous firefighter example (17a). It is understood as about that fire, fortunately the fire brigade came quickly, otherwise the fire would cause an unpleasant consequence. Well, the second part of the comment is elliptical in (17a), but every native speaker can get it. The explanation is the language usage of Chinese to avoid expressing any catastrophe clearly. The adverb xingkui (fortunately) is the key word of this sentence. Because the connective adverbs xingkui...buran (fortunately...otherwise) work in pair, in the case that the second adverb is omitted together with the clause it ushers in, the missing part is recoverable in an appropriate context or situation. But if the adverb xingkui (fortunately) is missing, as in (17b), the sentence has an other meaning. This difference can be shown more clearly in (18) resembling (17). While (18a) is fine, (18b) is not acceptable because the topic without the adverb xingkui (fortunately) becomes a real dangling topic. (17)\\ta.

In the case that the second part is not uttered explicitly, the adverb fortunately implies the would-be condition, and its consequence is reduced to a non-specified event which the speaker does not like, and which relates somehow to the topic at the beginning of the sentences.

We argue that the semantic relation between topic and comment results from anaphora resolution. This is achieved by linking or brigding. Bridging can be seen as a repair mechanism if linking fails to meet the coherence constraint on TCS that the comment has to relate to the topic. In this way, the relation between topic and comment can be computed uniformly, as the English-style topic and the Chinese-style topic are treated as two ways of anaphor resolution.","There are some points of future research suggested by the approach presented here. The first point is that we have only considered the TCS with an NP as topic. But the syntactic category of topic is not limited to NP; VP or S can serve for topic as well ([10]). We plan to work out the semantics for TCS with non-NP topics. The second point is that the presented approach can be easily extended to topic chains ([11]). In topic chains, the topic-comment relations interact with the discourse relations between the comment clauses. We intend to investigate the discourse relations inside TCS, and to extend our analysis to capture the interaction of discourse structure with the topic-comment articulation."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["[1] N.
