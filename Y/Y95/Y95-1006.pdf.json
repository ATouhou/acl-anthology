Simulations were performed using a three-layer back-propagation neural net with various combination of inputs. The inputs are (1) semantic classes of the constituent characters, (2) Entropy of the characters and (3) semantic strength[1] of the characters. Our simulations show that we can obtain the meaning class of a bisyllabic word from the meaning classes of its two constituent characters to an accuracy of 81 % by taking the semantic classes and semantic strength of the characters as input. This research establishes the dependency between the meaning class of a Chinese compound word and that of its two constituent characters."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["The processing of the meaning of a word is a difficult job. In all existing text books on semantics[2-4], only descriptive treatments are provided for explaning the meaning of a word. There have been some attempts to break meaning into more fundamental units (Chapter 6 of [2]) but without much success. The main obstacle is that we are still unable to quantify meaning. As there is no proper representation of meaning, it is also difficult to process meaning.","In some of our earlier papers [5-7], we have proposed a scheme to quantify the change in the meaning when a bisyllabic Chinese compound word is built from two Chinese characters. We take the meaning of a word as one of the meaning class given in a dictionary Figure 1 Semantic Distance of meaning classes:\\triq X it-33 ifa \\t [8]. This dictionary classifies 70,000 Chinese words into \\t \\tCharactersBetween Words and Ch 49 12 major, 94 medium and 1428 minor classes. A triangular figure is used to represent the change in meaning during a word formation process(See Figure 1). In Figure 1, W is the word, Ca, Cb are the characters forming the word, Owa, 6wb , Oab are the so-called semantic distances between the word and the characters and between the two characters.

In [5], we derive a parameter called semantic strength to do such a prediction. The semantic strengths for the characters, a and b are computed as: Sa = 4 - Owa Sb = 4 - Owb As a character will normally combine with a large number of other characters to form words, there are many values of Sa and Sb. We can therefore calculate the overall semantic strength by averaging all the Sa and Sb. This is: 50 n ESi","S = i=1 n We can consider s one of the basic semantic attribute of a character. We computed s for all characters and use it to predict the meaning of the word. In [5]. It was found that when sa > sb , the word formed ( W= ab) will take a meaning class that is closer the meaning of the first character. This prediction is followed for 73.8% of the total cases. It is therefore obvious that the meanings of the characters, in one way or another, determine the meaning of the words that they form.","In this paper, we will like to further investigate into the various other factors that determine the meaning of the compound words. These include: (i) meaning classes of the characters, (ii) entropy values of characters, and (iii) semantic strength of characters. The simulations is performed on a three-layer back propagation neural net (BPNN). BPNN is being selected as it has the ability of producing fairly complicated functional parameters between its input and output neurons.","The following sections of this paper cover: In Section 2, we give a brief description on the BPNN that is built for the prediction of meaning of bisyllabic words. In Section 3, we present the results obtained for various sets of input. The training and testing if the BPNN is given in Section 4 and In Section 5, we present our conclusion and some proposals for further research in this area."]},{"title":"2. A Three Layer Back Propagation Neural Net For Simulation","paragraphs":["The general structure of a 3 layer BPNN is shown in Figure 2. The number of neurons at the input layer depends on the type of simulation it is running(See Table 3). For example, there are 12 major semantic classes for each Chinese character. The total number of input neurons will be 24(as there are 2 characters). When a character belongs to semantic class A is presented at the input, the first neuron will be set to a value 1 and the other 11 neurons are all set to 0.

During training, this is set to 1 when Ow. > öwb and to 0 when otherwise. At the testing stage, we will set Owa > Owb if the final output is greater than 0.5 and Ow, < Owb if it is smaller than 0.5. These results of the BPNN simulations are shown in Table 3.","Table 3 Results of BPNN simulations","Type of Simulation No of","class/","value No Input Neurons No of Hidden Neurons Predi ction In-sider Predi citon Outsider Semantic Class, Major 12 24 12 0.65 0.65 Semantic Class, medium 94 188 12 0.70 0.70 Entropy 1 2 2 0.59 0.59 Strength 1 2 2 0.67 0.67 Semantic Class, Major + Entropy 13 26 12 0.61 0.61 Semantic Class, Medium + Entropy 95 190 12 0.72 0.72 Semantic, Major+Strength 13 26 12 0.67 0.67 Semantic Class, Medium+Strength 95 206 12 0.81 0.81 Entropy+Strength 2 4 2 0.65 0.65 Selection of sample size One problem with neuron net simulation is that if too few samples are presented for the training, the systems (through the adjustment of the link weightages) eventually memorize the whoe sample and there is no generalization at all. As a result, the predictability of the system will be greatly deteriorated. To prevent this, we have to select a sample size that is several times larger that the number of connections in the BPNN system. In this research, the largest net we build is for the simulation of medium semantic classes and strength as input. There are 190 inputs. The total number of connections in the BPNN system will be 190x12x1=2280. We thus select 5,000 samples from the dictionary for the training and testing. This same set of 5,000 samples provides input and output 52 data for the so-called insider testing. Another 5,000 samples are again selected from the dictionary to test the predictability of the BPNN. This is the so-called outsider testing. During an insider testing, the system performance is tested with data that used to derive the system parameter. The same set of data is used for training and testing. This provide an internal consistency checking. For outsider testing, the system is tested using data that are used in the training. The outsider testing provide more objective assessment to the system. 3. Training and Testing Data","The words and word classes used this research are directly derived from the FA5C-ifiliA4510 which contains 39,554 bisyballic words. Inside, 27,279 words or 69% are the biased type. We select them according to the criterion that Owa<>Owb . If Owa= 6wb , there is no bias of the meaning class.","We found that for most of the time, there are more than one meaning class associated to each word and characters. There has to be a way of disambiguity. We adopt a simplest approach for this job. This is the so-called closest meaning class approach. In this apart, we compare three sets of meaning classes, { M1 w , M2w, ...Mnw} , {M1 a, M2a, ...Mpa }, {M1 b , M2b, Mqb } , where M1 w is the first meaning class of word w and M1 a, Ml b are the first meaning class of character a and b correspondingly. There are altogether npq possible ways of paring them up. For all possible pairings, we compute the semantic distances, i.e., O wa and awb and select the one with minimum value of Owa and Owb.. This approach, though basically an ah hoc approach that based on intuition, works well for at least 90% of the time. 4 Discussion of the Results First, we compare the prediction power between the semantic major class and the medium class. There are almost 8 times more input in medium class simulation. The prediction power is also higher, whether it is applied alone or combined with strength or entropy. So, it is obvious that a more detailed sernnatic classification helps the predicition of the semantic class of the word formed.","Next, we look at the comparative merit of entropy and strength. It is obvious that strength has a much higher prediction power.","Combining the above two observations, we come to a conclusion that the best prediction could be obtained by feeding in the semantic medium class and strength value to the BPNN. The best result achieved so far is 81% of correct prediction.","This result is of important significance in the study of semantics for the following reasons: 53","(i) We have firmly established a functional relationship between the meaning of a words and those of its constituent characters. We should have a 50% success rate only if there is no functional dependency between the two. It looks a common sense from our every day's experience that the meaning of a word should be related to the meanings of its characters. But this is the first time that we establish a mathematical (functional) relationship in between the two. It thus open up a new channel for more research to be performed along this direction.","(ii) The way that the words are classified has a direct impact on the predictability of the BPNN. A more detailed classification helps improving the hit rate of the prediction. There is an overall increase of 5-10% hit rate when we increase the number of classes from 12 to 94. If the way of classification plays a significant role in the predictability of the meaning of the words formed, then we should do more study on the classification (and also representation) of meaning. 5. Conclusion","We simulate the prediction of meaning of a word using a three layer back propagation neural net. It is found that, using 94 semantic classes and a strength value, we can predict the meaning of a word with an accuracy of 81%. This finding is of significance as it has established the strong evidence that the meaning of a word can be predicted from the meanings of its constituent characters.","There are also some inadequacy in this research.","First, the current work focuses on the direction of movement of the meaning. We can only predict whether a word has a meaning closer to its first or second character. In the subsequent works, we are going to study how to predict the actual semantic class of a word.","Another research direction is to refine the meaning classes of the",". This dictionary, as it is composed for the use of human language translation, may not have arranged all words in the best way suitable to our semantic processing. Also, as our simulation shows a strong correlation between the way that the words and characters are semantically classified and the accuracy of the prediction. More research should thus be conducted to look for an even better classification scheme for word senses.
