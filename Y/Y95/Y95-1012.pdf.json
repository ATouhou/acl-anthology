Among others, the clitic analysis of adjectival ha- leads to a unified account of light predicate constructions. I. Introduction \"Clitics\" are grammatical units which have some properties of inflectional morphology and some of independent words. The existence of clitics is widely attested in the languages of the world ([1]). Even though Korean has many \"little words\" which show clitic-like properties, not enough attention has been paid to the possibility that these units might actually be clitics. They have usually been analyzed as various types of simple affixes. However, it is clear that they have some properties of independent words, at least from a syntactic point of view. In this paper, I will show that there are many little words in Korean that should be analyzed as clitics: some (nominal and verbal) particles, the copula i- ("]},{"title":"`","paragraphs":["to be'), the \"adjectival\""]},{"title":"ha- ( `","paragraphs":["to do/be'), and others.

Clitics: Theoretical Background Clitics are those elements which have some properties of affixes and words. However, they are different from affixes and words. [2] and [3] provide some criteria for distinguishing clitics from inflectional affixes, and [4] provides some tests/criteria to distinguish clitics from (independent) words. When contrasted with independent words, clitics have some of the properties of affixes (especially inflectional affixes), and when contrasted with clitics, words have some of the properties of"]},{"title":"syntactic","paragraphs":["phrases.
