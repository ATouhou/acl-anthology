Consequently, icey/teisang/tenun need to be used in order to express the inner negation of pelsse/imi. We will argue that whether a time-relationship adverb can combine with negation or not is determined by the grammaticalization pathway it has taken and that explanatory principles of grammaticalization determine the distribution of time-relationship adverbs in individual languages.","In the next section, we introduce the notion of grammaticalization and two of its basic principles. 3\\tGrammaticalization 3.1 What is Grammaticalization ? Grammaticalization (also called grammaticization) is a process in which a lexical unit or structure assumes a grammatical function. 4 It has been studied from both historical and synchronic perspectives. In the former perspective, grammaticalization is a subset of linguistic changes; in the latter perspective, it is seen as \"primarily a syntactic, discourse pragmatic phenomenon, to be studied from the point of view of fluid patterns of language\"(Hopper and Traugott 1993: 2). 4 For detailed explorations into the mechanisms of grammaticalization, see Bybee et al. (1994) and Heine et al. (1991). 350","A typical example of grammaticalization is the development of an auxiliary be going to from a progressive form of the movement verb go in construction with a purposive infinitival complement. As pointed out by Hopper and Traugott (1993:2-4), this example illustrates morpho-syntactic and semantic-pragmatic consequences of grammaticalization, such as pragmatic inference, reanalysis, phonological reduction, and abstraction of meaning:","(7) a. John is going to marry Mary.","b. John is going to like Bill.","c. John is gonna like Bill. Grammaticalization begins in a very local context such as (7a), in which go co-occurs with a non-finite purposive complement, meaning something like John is leaving/ traveling to marry Bill. The change in meaning is triggered by a pragmatic inference: if John is leaving in order to marry, the marriage will be in the future. As this inference is conventionalized, [John is going [to marry Mary]] is reanalyzed as [John [is going to] marry Mary] . This reanalysis also affects the verb immediately following be going to. Consequently, the verbs which were originally incompatible with a purposive meaning become possible, as in (7b). As the expression be going to starts to be used quite often, it begins to be felt as one word, as evidenced by its phonological reduction in (7c). In this process, the original meaning of go has been mostly lost, and more abstract and subjective meanings have been added. 3.2 Constraints on Grammaticalization","Grammaticalization does not proceed randomly and can be constrained in several ways. Hopper (1991) proposes five principles of grammaticalization and one of them, namely Persistence can be interpreted as a constraint on grammaticalization. It is defined as in (8):","(8) Persistence. \"When a form undergoes grammaticization from a lexical to a grammatical","function, so long as it is grammatically viable some traces of its original lexical meanings","tend to adhere to it, and details of its lexical history may be reflected in constraints on its","grammatical distribution.\" (Hopper (1991:22)) An illustration of this principle is the development of accusative markers in West African languages. In Gä, for instance, an accusative marker derived from a verb meaning 'take' is prevented from marking an object if the co-occurring verb has an effective meaning as in lay an egg, or if the object of the verb is experienced rather than affected as in see the girl.","This principle closely correlates with another principle of grammaticalization, i.e. Layering, which is defined in (9):","(9) Layering. \"Within a broad functional domain, new layers are continually emerging. As this","happens, the older layers are not necessarily discarded, but may remain to coexist with and","interact with the newer layers.\"\\t (Hopper (1991:22)) When two or more units are available serving similar functions due to the principle of Layering, it is often the case that each unit has some uniqueness derived from \"its lexical history,\" as predicted by the principle of Persistence. The differing lexical histories of the units in a grammatical domain may correlate with the differences in syntactic function and/or pragmatic inference (implicature) among the units in question.","We will argue that such correlation between the lexical sources of grammaticalized items and their syntactic/pragmatic behaviors is observable in the systems of time-relationship adverbs in Japanese and Korean, and that the differing conditioning factors of the correlation are responsible for the emergence of the differing systems.","In the next section we will observe how these principles interact to produce different adverbial systems in Japanese and Korean. 4\\tGrammaticalization of Time-relationship Adverbs We propose that the difference between Japanese and Korean time-relationship adverbs is caused by the differential grammaticalization pathway of the adverbs in each language. The highly abstract nature of temporal concepts encoded by time-relationship adverbs (as contrasted with spatial concepts, for 351"]},{"title":"•","paragraphs":["instance) makes it plausible to hypothesize that they developed from lexical units with more concrete meaning, and are subject to the constraints reflecting their lexical origin.","The principle of Persistence predicts that the original meaning of the grammaticalized words or phrases constrain the distribution of these adverbs. More precisely, if the original words or phrases have the lexical meaning expressing concrete situations, the adverbs grammaticalized from them are likely to be excluded from the context incompatible with their original meaning. On the other hand, if the original lexical meaning of these words or phrases is highly abstract, the adverbs grammaticalized from them are likely to have less distributional restrictions. We will look into the origin of each time-relationship adverb and see how the constraints on grammaticalization contribute to the formation of different adverbial systems in Japanese and Korean.","In Japanese, mada (\"still, (not) yet\") and moo (\"already, (not) anymore\") both evolved from words related to time concept. Marla was originally imada. Imada is composed of ima \"now\" plus a particle da, which had the meaning equivalent to \"even.\" Mack, then, originally had the meaning of \"even now\" or \"up to now\" and was already in use in both affirmative and negative sentences from around the tenth century (Nihon Daiziten Kankookai (ed.) 1972, vol. 18: 361). Moo is considered to have derived from an old Japanese noun ma, which also had the meaning of \"now\" (Nihon Daiziten Kankookai (ed.) 1972, vol.19: 240).","In Korean, it is safe to assume that acik, (\"still, (not) yet\") is derived from a word expressing time concept in the light of native speakers' judgments and the meaning of the phrase acik kkaci \"until now\". The origin of. imi (\"already\") is still not entirely clear, but according to Oosaka Gaikokugodaigaku Tyoosengo Kenkyusitsu (1986: 1574), pelsse (\"already\") is derived from an adjective ppaluta, which means \"fast\". key (\"(not) anymore\") can also be used as a temporal noun meaning \"now\". This nominal use is presumably the origin of its adverbial use, as we saw in the cases of mada and moo in Japanese. Teisang and tenun (\"(not) anymore\") are both evidently related to \"amount\". Te in both words means \"more\" and Tsang means \"more than\". Thus, teisang originally means \"more than more\" and tenun is the topicalized form of te.","We argue that pelsse cannot fall within the scope of clausal negation because its original meaning, which is related to concrete situations, is incompatible with the irrealis meanings encoded by negative sentences. 5 On the other hand, time-relationship adverbs derived from more abstract concepts such as time or amount are free of such semantic restrictions on their distribution. This is the case with mada and moo in Japanese, and ajik. icey, teisang and tenun in Korean, which are- also derived from an abstract concept of amount, cannot occur in affirmative sentences because of the principle of Layering: there is nothing in their original meaning that prohibits their use in affirmative sentences, but the existence of pelsse forces them into negative sentences.","5 It is not unusual for a lexical item to be restricted in distribution in its grammaticalized use:","(i) Akanboo-ga {(a) umareru/(b) umareta) -tokoro -wo mini-itta","baby-Nom be born: Pres/be born: Past- place -Acc see-go :Past","(a) '(We) went to see a baby as she was born.' (less common) '(We) went to see","the place where babies were born.'","(b) (We) went to see the place where a baby had been born.' In (i), the Japanese noun tokoro (> 'place'), can be interpreted as grammaticalized complementizer when the tense of the co-occurring verb is non-past and ensures simultaneous interpretation, as in (a). However, this c̀omplementizer' interpretation is not available when the tense of the co-occurring verb is past, as in (b). From this perspective of grammaticalization, it is thus not surprising to find a time-relationship adverb like Korean pelsse, which shows co-occcurrence restrictions with negative operator, even if its etymologically related adjective ppaluta is not inherently incompatible with negation, a point which puzzled an anonymous reviewer."]},{"title":"352","paragraphs":["5 English and German 5.1 English6","In English, already, still, yet and anymore serve the function of relating two points of time and thus","expressing continuity or change of events or states. Already and still are usually used in affirmative","sentences and normally do not lie within the scope of clausal negation. (10) a. I already like him. ['I have by this time come to like him.']","b. I still like him.. I continue to like him I","c. *He can't already drive.","d. ?He can't still drive.\\t(Quirk et a1.1985: 580)","Still can precede negation, but already cannot occur in negative sentences even if it precedes negation: (11) a. I still haven't spoken to him.","b. * I already haven't spoken to\\t(Quirk et al. 1985: 580)","On the other hand, yet and anymore usually fall within the scope of clausal negation: (12) a.

Still and yet share the meaning of \"continuation\", whereas already and anymore","share the meaning of \"change\". We can summarize the distribution of the four English time-relationship","adverbs as follows:","(13)\\touter neg.","already •\\t ̂not yet inner neg. not anymore\\tstill","The time-relationship adverb still originated from the adjective still, which means \"not moving\" (Terasawa ed. (1997:1351). In OED 2, the first attested example of the adjective still was in Beowulf, and the manner adverb still, which means \"at rest, motionless\" began to be used around 1000 A.D., mostly with certain verbs such as stand, sit, or lie. The time-relationship adverb still appeared around the sixteenth century.","Already evolved from the adjective phrase all ready with the meaning \"quite ready or prepared\". This adverb appeared in the fourteenth century and began to be written as one word in the fifteenth century (OED2).","Still and already have one property in common with respect to their origins: both of their original units expressed the meaning describing observable situations. In the case of still, we can check whether something is moving or at rest simply by looking at the object. In the case of already, whether someone or something is ready is also observable.","The origin of yet is less transparent. In the light of the meaning of the related German word yetzt \"now,\" or the meaning of a set phrase as yet \"up to the present time,\" we can assume that the adverb yet was derived from a word with the meaning of \"now.\" Yet was already used as a time-relationship adverb in Old English. The use of yet in this sense in affirmative sentences is labeled dialectal or archaic in OED2 and Quirk et al. (1985).","Anymore, which is sometimes written as any more, evidently derived from the phrase any more. In Old and Middle English, only more was used to serve this function, just like mehr in German. Anymore, written as one word, began to be used around the seventeenth century. But even in nineteenth century texts, we can still find sentences in which more was used alone as a time-relationship adverb (OED2). 6 For detailed analyses of English time-relationship adverbs, see Horn(1970), Ota(1980), and van der Auwera(1993)."]},{"title":"353","paragraphs":["Yet and anymore also share a property with respect to their origins. The original lexical meanings of yet and anymore, which respectively encode time and amount, are more abstract and less situation-bound compared to the original meanings of still and already. Similar to Japanese and Korean, the English adverbs grammaticalized from words with more lexical content tend to be more severely restricted to those sentences that are semantically compatible with their original lexical meanings. 5.2 German'","In German, noch, schon, and mehr are used as time-relationship adverbs:","(14) a. Sie wohnt noch bier.","she lives still here","\"She still lives here.\" b. Er ist noch nicht zuruck.","he is still Neg back","\"He is not back yet.\" c. Er hat schon gegessen.","he has already eaten","\"He has already eaten.\" d. Ich bin nicht mehr jung.","I am Neg more young","\"I am not young anymore.\"","As is clear from (14a,b), noch, which corresponds to still and yet in English, can be used both in","affirmative and negative sentences. Schon, which corresponds to already, can be used only in","affirmative sentences as in (14c). In negative sentences, mehr, which serves the function of anymore, is","used. We can summarize the distribution as in (15), which is the same diagram given in Läbner (1989:","172): (15)","\\t outer neg. \\t schon","\\t \\t"]},{"title":"̂","paragraphs":["noch-nicht inner neg. \\t nicht-mehr\\tnoch"]},{"title":"•\\t","paragraphs":["^","According to Kunimatsu et al. (1998), noch was derived from nu, which means \"now\", and schon was ultimately derived from schon, which means \"beautiful\". Mehr is evidently a cognate word of more. In German, too, the time-relationship adverb originating from a word describing concrete situations (i.e. schon) can occur only in affirmative sentences and those derived from abstract concepts such as time or amount (i.e. noch and mehr) can occur in negative sentences. What distinguishes German from English is that the principle of Layering is at work only in the left line of inner-negation relation. In the right line of inner-negation, noch can occur both in affirmative and negative sentences. The left domain in German is therefore like that of English, and the right domain is like that of Japanese. But the principles governing the distribution of these adverbs are the same throughout these three languages. 6 Grammaticalization and Semantic Typology We have seen above that two principles constraining grammaticalization, i.e. Persistence and Layering are responsible for the manner in which time-relationship adverbs are distributed in Japanese, Korean, English and German.","Our next question is, then, whether there is some systematic correlation between the typological profile of a language and the manner in which grammaticalization is manifested and constrained therein."]},{"title":"7","paragraphs":["For the detailed analysis of German time-relationship adverbs, see LObner (1989)."]},{"title":"354","paragraphs":["Crucially relevant in this respect is a theory of Comparative Semantic Typology proposed by Hawkins (1986). Based on a detailed comparison of morpho-syntactic and semantic structures in English and German, Hawkins argued that the two languages show a systematic contrast in terms of form-meaning correspondence. Specifically, English consistently tends toward greater surface structural ambiguity, whereas German shows a more rigid one-to-one form-meaning correspondence. One of the co-authors extended Hawkins' insights to morpho-syntactic structures in Japanese and Korean and presented a hypothesis that the contrast between Japanese and Korean parallels that between English and German (Hone 1998, Hone and Kang 2000, Horie and Sassa 2000). That is, Japanese tends toward greater surface structural ambiguity and polyfimctionality than Korean, which shows a more rigid one-to-one form-meaning correspondence. This contrast is manifested in such grammatical domains as case-marking particles, complementizers, tense-aspect systems, and inflectional forms of predicates. We shall argue that this contrast in overall semantic typology between Japanese and Korean is also reflected in the emergence of differing systems in the domain of time-relationship adverbs.","The greater versus lesser polyfunctionality of grammaticalized morphemes is at least partially manifested by the contrast between Japanese time-relationship adverbs and their Korean counterparts. The former consist of two adverbs mada and moo, which respectively cover two semantic poles (see Figure in (3)) contrasting in terms of affirmation or negation. In contrast, the Korean time-relationship adverbs exhibit a lesser degree of polyfun.ctionality in that only two of the four semantic poles are covered in a similar manner by the adverb acik (see Figure in (6)).","The contrast between English time-relationship adverbs and their German counterparts apparently contradicts the overall semantic typological difference proposed by Hawkins (1986). That is, in this particular grammatical domain, English appears to exhibit a lesser degree of polyfunctionality than does German in that the four semantic poles are respectively encoded by four different adverbs (see Figure in (13)). As shown in (15), German shows a distributional pattern similar to Korean (cf. (6)) in that two of the four semantic poles are covered by the adverb noch.","How can we account for these apparently contradictory distributions between English and German? It may be simply that English has its own idiosyncratic preference for specific coding of the relevant temporal notions in this particular domain of grammar. However, we conjecture that a different kind of cognitive principle underlies the distributional difference between English and German. As extensively discussed by Dwight Bolinger (e.g. Bolinger 1977), English is known to exhibit a variety of semantic oppositions by employing different grammatical morphemes such as to-infinitive and bare infinitive or to-infinitive and gerund, as illustrated in (16) and (17):","(16) a. I saw John be obnoxious. (\"percept\")","b. I saw John to be obnoxious. (\"concept\")","(17) a. He started to behave obnoxiously. (\"potentiality\")","b. He started behaving obnoxiously. (\"reification\") While English encodes various semantic oppositions by means of contrastive pairs of forms as in (16) and (17), such tendency is less prominent in German. We argue that such tendency toward maximal coding of semantic oppositions accounts for the fact that the four semantic poles are coded by different time-relationship adverbs in English. 7\\tConclusion We have argued that two principles constraining grammaticalization, i.e. Persistence and Layering, are responsible for the manner in which time-relationship adverbs are distributed in Japanese, Korean, English and German. The adverbs originating from words or phrases which describes concrete situations can be used almost exclusively in affirmative sentences because their original lexical meanings are incompatible with \"irrealis\" situations (e.g. \"non-occurrence of expected change\" or \"termination of some activity or state\") encoded by negative sentences. This accounts for the distributional restrictions imposed on pelsse in Korean, still and already in English, and schon in German. On the other hand, the adverbs evolving from words or phrases expressing more abstract concepts like \"time\" or \"amount\" are"]},{"title":"355","paragraphs":["not inherently restricted in distribution. If there are no other adverbs to compete with them in a given language, these adverbs are free to occur both in affirmative and negative sentences. This is the case with mada and moo in Japanese, acik(to) in Korean and noch in German. But if there are other adverbs being used that derive from situation-bound words or phrases, the principle of Layering comes into play and the adverbs derived from abstract concepts are consequently restricted to negative sentences. This is the case with icey, teisang, and tenun in Korean, yet and anymore in English, and mehr in German. Thus the principles of Persistence and Layering together can explain the apparently different distributions of time-relationship adverbs in these four languages.","We have also suggested that the overall semantic typology of a given language in the sense of Hawkins (1986) closely correlates with the degree of polyfunctionality manifested by the time-relationship adverbs in that language, as in the case of Japanese and Korean. We have further hinted the possibility that a different kind of cognitive principle, i.e. tendency toward maximal coding of semantic oppositions, may be operative in this particular domain of grammar in languages like English.","Further cross-linguistic investigation into the grammaticalization patterns in different domains of grammar and their correlation with the overall semantic typology/cognitive principles is next on our agenda.
