The system was developed based on DGT organization profile with description of its six divisions instead of a corpus of recorded and transcribed call-routing dialogs. An acoustic module and an information retrieval module were built specifically for this task. The construction of IR module was based on term extraction and thesaurus discovery processes. By integrating acoustic and IR module, the system achieves satisfactory performance and provides a promising approach to call routing. Simulation results indicated that the proposed algorithm outperforms standard classification methods. A working system based on the proposed approach has been implemented and experimental results are presented. 1\\tIntroduction We proposed an end-to-end system for operator assisted call routing. The system was designed based on the idea that a telephone operator is capable to capture the intent of caller's inquiry but the operators may not be familiar or kept up to date with all the business of the organization. Therefore, he or she can then operate the call router via a speech interface. The system transforms the natural speech, matches the information related to directory, and finally determines the routing destination. The output is then displayed on the screen for the operator to carry out the actual routing action. The goal is to assist the operator in selecting the desired destination that matches caller' s intension. This will expedite operator's response since there is no need to search a printed directory or enter the query in Chinese text.","Numerous previous works on call routing has been reported (Riccardi et. al., 1997; Lee et al., 1998; Chu-Carroll and Carpenter, 1999). Most approaches in the literature require a corpus of routed calls to train a routing matrix or language model. Such corpora of dialog are sometimes difficult to obtain due to the concerns over invasion of privacy right. In addition to the acoustic module, a call router also needs to classify caller' s request according to routing destination. This task of classification is similar to text categorization (Lewis et al., 1996) in IR or topic identification (McDonough et al., 1994) in speech research. When a corpus of calls is available, researchers tend to adopt a vector space model, under which terms in the corpus is weighted statistically and treated as independent. Many systems adopted a form-based approach that is commonly used in spoken understanding system (Seneff, Glass, and Goddeau, 1991; Lamel, 1998; Chu-Carroll, 1999; Papineni, Roukos, and Ward, 1999). A form consists of a set of keywords all (or most) of which need to be present in the caller' s request in order for the destination to be activated. This idea amounts to formulating an AND query of many independent keywords.","There are problems with adopting a form-based approach. Firstly, the acoustic module produces incorrect output, which may cause the IR module to fail. If we set the precision of the acoustic output too high, there could be insufficient information for the IR module to produce a destination. On the other hand, if the precision is set low for better recall, there could be too much noise causing the IR module to produce more than one destination. The second problem is manual effect needed to construct forms for each destination each time a new call router is built. Furthermore, one needs to provide 271 synonyms to these independent keywords in the form. Otherwise, the system will be very fragile when faced with alternative ways of expressing the same routing request.","To cope with the problems mentioned above, we design the proposed call router with the following considerations: • Tighter integration of acoustic and IR module. • Automatic construction of forms. • Automatic discovery of similar words.","By integrating acoustic and IR module, the system achieves satisfactory performance and provides a promising approach to call routing. To easy the burden of developing forms for destination and ensure consistency and coverage, we develop an automatic algorithm to extract keywords based on the description of destinations as well as a corpus of news. A collection of forms can be generated semi-automatically for a specific routing task. An application developer is allowed to fine tune them in this framework. 2 System Overview A block diagram of the system is shown in Figure 1. The speech query goes through speech recognizer and transforms into a keyword lattice. Then, call-routing classification is applied to generate a set of destination hypotheses with corresponding scores to be described latter. The score are then compared with a predefined threshold. If more than one candidate destination pass the threshold, a disambiguation module should be invoked. On the contrary, if none of candidates passes the threshold, the request is rejected. system developer domain\\t"]},{"title":"N '......-","paragraphs":["'\"••••n-.----\"\"","knowledge,\\tterm extraction &","4,,\\tterms, -","form generation\\tforms,","news corpora","frequencies","keyword \\t","speech\\t","lattice","query"]},{"title":"4114 •\\t","paragraphs":["operator","speech recognition routing information call-type classification Figure 1: System Block Diagram.","To get a better understanding of the DGT call routing task, collection of domain knowledge about how a operator transfer a call to the desired destination is very important. To avoid imposing on privacy of callers, no actual dialogue between a caller and a human operator has been collected. The system was developed based on DGT organization profile with description of its six divisions.

After field study of operators' routing task, we roughly classified the calls into three classes, destination name, activity, and indirect request in a way similar to Chu-Carroll and Carpenter (1999). We also know that most calls can be classified according to destination name or activity. Hence, we focus on the classes of destination name and activity.","In the DGT call routing task, there are six routing destinations, including General Planning Department, Public Telecommunications Department, Dedicated Telecommunications Department, Radio and TV Broadcast Technology Department, Radio Wave Regulatory Department, and Legal Office. The organization profile of DGT describes the main responsibilities of its six departments. The mission of GPD and PTD is showed in Tables 1 and 2 respectively. Table 1: Mission of the General Planning Department (GPD).","1 Drafting\\tand\\tsupervising\\tover\\tthe implementation of telecommunications policies.","2 Planning, promotion and supervision over the administration and cooperation of international telecommunications."]},{"title":"3","paragraphs":["Supervision over radio communication policies and technical R&D.","4 Planning for the telecommunication related\\tbusinesses\\tand telecommunication tariffs policies.","5 Planning, operation and maintenance of the computerized information system in DGT.

For instance, the destination GPD can be represented by a number of forms representing its missions as follows:"]},{"title":"273","paragraphs":["FORM: GPD-1 FORM: GPD-2 FORM: GPD-3 FORM: GPD-4 FORM: GPD-5 1 Telecom 2 Strategy . 3 Drafting Supervising Implementation 1 International 2 Telecom 3 planning Promotion Supervision 1 Radio\\t. 2 Communication 3 Supervision 1 Telecom 2 Tariff 3 Planning Promotion Supervision 1 Information 2 System 3 Planning Operation Maintenance","Each form can be viewed as representing a Boolean requirement for activation of the destination. The logical relation between slots in a form is represented by the AND operator and the relation between various admissible values in a slot is represented by the OR operator. For instance, to activate GPD via FORM GPD-1, all three slots have to be mentioned by the caller. For each slot, at least one of the values has to be mentioned.","In total, there are 95 forms constructed and 157 terms extracted from DGT profile. The wording in the profile is very formal. On the contrary, the caller tended to use informal, colloquial expressions and jargons when it comes to communication related products and services. For instance, the profile uniformly uses \"cellular phones,\" while the caller tends to use \"mobile phone\" or \"da-ge-da\" for the same telecommunication device. 3 Automatic Identification of Keywords and Similar Words To easy the burden of developing forms for destinations and ensure consistency and coverage, we develop an automatic algorithm to extract keywords from the description text of destinations and a corpus of newspaper articles. A collection of forms can be generated semi-automatically for a specific routing task. An application developer is allowed to fine tune them in this framework.","The first step to the problem of topic classification is word and concept extraction. Although a domain expert can complete the step manually, it is labor-intensive and can be done easily only for small application. The manual approach does not scale up to a large task. For this reason, we proposed an automatic key-phrase detection and synonym extraction method. This step will produce a number of forms with keywords representing each destination. In order to broaden the coverage of these forms, each keyword is augmented with a set of similar words. Taking advantage of work in finding similar word for word sense disambiguation, we proposed a procedure for discovery of similar words to the original keywords."]},{"title":"274","paragraphs":["3.1 Keyword Extraction The important keywords exhibit distinctive linguistic properties at the discourse level. Justeson and Katz (1995) pointed out domain-specific terms in a text could be characterized as noun phrases that appear more than once. This recurrence property is one of discourse phenomena called lexical cohesion. Reiteration includes identity of reference via repetition of the same, words or the use of hypemyms, hyponyms, and synonyms. Due to the lack of a suitable thesaurus, we consider identical recurring words only. With this in mind, we gather the statistics of destination descriptions as well as a newspaper corpus for identification of keywords. For each term t in the destination description r we compute the following 0' 1.4 = Term frequency of t in routing destination description r, tf d,t = Term frequency of t in document d in the newspaper corpus, atf t = Average value of tf across documents containing t in the newspaper corpus, df = Document frequency (number of documents containing t in the newspaper corpus), w d,t = tf d,t log (N/df), N = Number of documents in in the newspaper corpus, aw d,t = Average value of w d,t across documents containing t in the newspaper corpus. We use the following formula to rank and extract terms from each destination description: tf r,t xatf txaw d,t The quality of extracted keywords rivals that of keyword picked by expert. Extracted keywords tend to cover the topic of destination better by providing more important terms. 3.2 Discovery of Similar Words As mentioned above, we used the organization profile to develop the call router. One of the problems with this approach is the difference between user' s colloquial vocabulary and written formal style of the material to develop the routing algorithm. In order to bridge the gap, we used an English thesaurus and bilingual dictionary to find synonyms related to the domain of telecommunication regulation. The words appearing in the organization profile written in English were extracted. Sets of English synonyms of those words were obtained in the thesaurus, Longman Lexicon of Contemporary English. Based on class-based probabilistic translation model (Brown et al. 1988), we experimented with a new approach to find compatible and appropriate translations for a group of synonymous words. Those sets (Table 3) of translations were subsequently used to expand keywords for more robust call routing.","Under the statistical machine translation model (Brown et al. 1988), translation probability P(CIE) is the probability an English word E is translated into a Chinese word C. We extended the basic definition of P(CIE) to include the consideration of translation probability for a class of words. For this, we tie together the probability P(CIE) for a set of word E in a class K and form the class-based translation probability P(C)K). P(CIK) = the probability of translating any word E in class K into C","To overcome the problem of data sparseness, we used a linear combination of probabilities in terms of n Chinese characters U1 and n-1 character bigram B, in C to approximate P(CIK). \\tEj 1 K)E\\tp(Bp(uilK)+ 2 n - 2 BiinC","p (C I -1= 2n u iinC where n is the number of characters in C.

The difficulties of call-type classification are due to insufficient or ambiguous information provided by the operators. Moreover, even when users give an exact and unambiguous speech utterance, the correct routing destination may still be difficult to obtain due to imperfect speech recognition. Therefore, it is necessary to include a ranking function to measure how close user's request is to one of the destination.","The similarity P(D Q) between the query Q and the form, i.e. destination, D is formulated by combining the acoustic likelihood scores of all matching terms within-form provided by the HMM keyword spotter and information retrieval relevance score of form D to query Q provided by document retrieval formula (Chen, Jiang, and Gey, 2001). In our experiments, two scoring functions SF1 and SF2 as well as their corresponding weighting factors X i and X2 were incorporated into Eq. (1) to tune the likelihood function of P(D Q). The ranking function can be formulated as following: P(D Q) = Alx SF1(AcousticScore) + 22x SF 2(IRScore) \\t(1) where SF1 and SF2 are the scoring functions of AcousticScore and IRScore respectively. Although, a discriminating optimization framework (Chiang, Lin, and Su, 1996) has been proposed in finding the suitable weights to integrate the two different scores.

The system has been tailored to recognize not only keywords and their synonyms, but also fluent query speech. It has been greatly facilitated by the concerted operators, and really put on field trial currently. The understanding module has been subjected to speech and text input. We tested the system in two ways: short query and long query. In the short query experiment, the operator uttered only a sequence of telegraphic key phrases. In the long query experiment, the operator was allowed to utter spontaneous inquiries, which might at times be ungrammatical.","As we mentioned above, we ignored the call type of indirect request in our experiments. We recorded 127 utterances with 91 short queries and 36 long queries. Some query examples are given in the following:"]},{"title":"277","paragraphs":["• *Kit* ° (Licensing operation.) • 044-1M: ° (First class licence.) • tit:NM-Vito (Telecom equipment inspection.) • V 40,41-k4-§-41,1144 ° (Please transfer me to General Planning Department.) • A 1- titi444011-t_411 11 ° (Department in charge of telecom coding and planning.) • -t- 4to 'PPP *tit #\\t4it ?

In the first experiment, we set X2 to zero, which means ignoring IR score in Eq. (1). In the second experiment, we set X to zero ignoring acoustic score in Eq. (1). The third experiment, both acoustic and IR scores were used. No matter for short or long queries, which has an effective error reduction, as shown in Table 4. Evidently, the framework of integrating acoustic and IR score help to achieve a high correct routing rate.

However, top 2 does increase the accuracy rate. That means a disambiguation dialogue module definitely will enhance the performance of a call router.","In order to know the upper bound performance of the destination routing, we also experimented with text input. The results are shown in Table 5. Clearly, as shown in Table 5, there is still some room for improvement with acoustic module, since for top 1 20-30% errors are due to imperfect speech recognition. It can be explained by that we employ a generic ASR engine without any fine-tune, so there are a lot of non-relevant keywords included in the candidate set of speech recognition. For example, the words \"VX(television)\" and \"Val(corliputer)\" are easily to accompany the word \" it (telecom)\""]},{"title":"278","paragraphs":["which is embedded in the query example \"department in charge of telecom coding and planning\" shown above. Thus, With the objective of detecting possibly erroneous keywords due to the results of ASR, we undertake a research on developing a speech recognizer with not just only a keyword spotting capability to recognize keywords embedded in a utterance, but also with a keyword verification technique (Rahim et al., 1995; Kawahara et al., 1998; Lee et al., 1998) to reject keywords that have low confidence scores. 6\\tConclusion In conclusion, we have described the operator assisted call router for DGT in Taiwan. We have exploited the statistical methods for extraction of keywords and similar words in order to build a broad coverage and robust form for linking callers' request and destination. An effective way of integrating acoustic score and information retrieval score to classify call routing destination is also described. The preliminary evaluation showed that the approach was quite effective in routing calls in face of speech noise. The approach needs only minimal information and does not require a large call routing corpus. The system proved to be quite useful in providing one-shot question answering service to operators. We are currently developing a keyword verification technique to reduce false alarm rate and an additional dialogue module to facilitate the communication between the operator and the system for better performance.
