The proposed semantics makes use of Herburger's three key ideas: events as basic entities, decomposition of predicates into subatomic formulas, and separation of backgrounded and foregrounded information."]},{"title":"1 Emphatic particles","paragraphs":["Japanese emphatic particles I will take up in this paper correspond to English adverbs only, even, and also, among others, of which only could be arguably a determiner when it occurs in prenominal position. Japanese has three kinds of postnominal particles constituting noun phrases: kaku zyosi case particles (ga, o, ni, etc.), huku zyosi supplementary particles (dake 'only', made 'as far as', bakari 'only', etc.), and kakari zyosi lead-in particles (wa 'TOPIC', mo 'also', sae 'even', sika 'except', etc.). In the recent Japanese linguistics literature, supplementary and lead-in particles are grouped together to form a class known as toritate zyosi particles for taking up (entities). This appellation of the new class is taken to mean that such particles mark different modes of conceptualization of the entity taken up for predication (Miyazima and Nitta, 1995: 278). Semantically, they all have to do with focus, as some of their semantic counterparts in English suggest. In this paper, I will refer to the class of toritate zyosi as emphatic particles (EP, henceforth).","The main concern of this paper is to suggest a systematic way to capture the meanings of Japanese EPs based on the treatment of focus and quantification by Herburger (2000). I will show a DRT semantics of EPs, which uses thematic roles as predicates and is many-sorted in the sense of having variables for events as well as those for individuals. This semantic treatment is an attempt to reveal the role played by focus in the overall workings of Japanese post-nominal particle affixation systems, and not just that of EP affixation."]},{"title":"2 Internally- vs. externally-induced focus","paragraphs":["The word focus is used in two different, but unifiable senses in semantics. In one sense, it is what explains question-answer congruence as shown in (1) (1) a. Who did John introduce to Sue? b. John introduced [Bill] F to Sue. c. #John introduced Bill to [SuelF. In the other sense, focus is the locus of the scope of certain adverbs and adverbial expressions (focus-sensitive operators) such as only, even, and also."]},{"title":"113","paragraphs":["(2) a. John only introduced [Bill] F to Sue. b. John only introduced Bill to [Sue]F.","In alternative semantics theories of focus, as proposed by Rooth (1985, 1992, etc.), the two senses of focus can be uniformly characterized by means of focus semantic values and association with focus. The focus semantic value of a sentence like (lb) is a set of alternative propositions such as (3) which might equally well serve as the answer to the question if things were differently arranged. (3) {"]},{"title":"{John","paragraphs":["introduced John to Sue.}, {John introduced Bill to Sue.}, {John introduced Mike to Sue.}, ...1","Association with focus captures the felicity of (1b) given (la), as opposed to the infelicity of (lc), which has a different set of alternative propositions {p = II John introduced Bill to 411141 E D} which does not correspond to (la), or the focus semantic value of (1b). Basically, the process of association with focus consists of the identification of a contextually constrained set of alternative propositions given a sentence containing a focus operator (e.g. (3) in a more contextually constrained form) and the confirmation of the proposition corresponding to the given sentence as a (non-unique) member of the set.","Although the two senses of focus can thus be treated uniformly, I will call the sense involved in question-answer congruence externally induced because the focus is not licensed by an explicit focus-sensitive operator, and that involved in sentences containing focus-sensitive operators like only internally induced. Since EPs in Japanese mostly correspond to focus-sensitive operators, their semantics should benefit from taking account of the concept of internally induced focus. Moreover, we will see the semantics of some EPs should best be given in conjunction with that of the case particle ga, and possibly that of o. 3 EPs and domain selection As we saw in (1) and (2), association with focus in English is typically determined by the locus of focus accent in the sentence. 1 By contrast, in the case of Japanese EPs, association with focus is dictated by the constituent structure in which they occur rather than focus accents. Since EPs are directly attached to the nominal to be focused, cancellation of focus effects due to special contextualization is not possible.","(4) a. kome-o\\tsaibai-suru hitotati-wa kome-dake-o \\ttabe-ru rice-ACC grow-PRESpeople-TOP rice-ONLY-ACC eat-PRES P̀eople who grow rice only eat rice.

It is not possible for (4b) to get the same interpretation as for (4a) by any contextualization. However, Japanese EPs do need an adequate theory of domain selection. In any alternative semantics theory of focus, the focus semantic value of a clause containing a focus operator such as (3) needs to be meaningfully restricted as pointed out by Schwarzschild (cf. Kadmon(2000, p. 307)). 2 A very conservative measure proposed in Ishikawa( 2001) uses the concept of directly comparable proposition (DCP, henceforth). The DCP of a clause with an EP is an F-structure representation of LFG which is derived from the F-structure of the clause by replacing the PRED value of the focused grammatical function (i.e., the scope of the EP) by a variable X constrained to be the comparable elements of the PRED value as shown in (5c), where the set of three feature-value pairs stands for the semantic contribution of the EP which induced the DCP.

Since F-structure is essentially a syntactic representation, the derived F-structures used for the representation of DCPs are mainly concerned with explaining the cooccurrence restrictions of EPs within a clause. As a result, the semantics of EPs is indicated only in terms of the combination of the values for four features: type, self, edge and polarity. This lack of modeltheoretic semantics for DCPs makes it difficult for this theory to do justice to the role played by focus in the workings of EPs, which can be seen in the fact that domain selection has no place in the theory because it is fixed. Although EPs are directly attached to their scope, so to speak, the actual focus can be wider than the immediate constituent they form a part of. Consider (6) in a context where Taro was supposed to finish several chores besides writing a letter in the morning. 2","paragraphs":["The problem is that the definition of focus semantic value allows unwanted propositons to be in the set of alternatives.","(i)Sue is [bold]F = {ii X (s)ii g : g assignment function} Since IlAx[beautifu/(m)]}il is also a member of D<e,t >, the set of alternatives will include such propositon as 'Mary is beautiful' as well as 'Sue is beautiful', etc. (Kadmon, p. 307) c."]},{"title":"115","paragraphs":["(6) Taro-wa asa\\ttegami-dake kai-ta Taro-TOP morning letter-ONLY write-PAST T̀aro only wrote the letter in the morning. ' (6) can have both VP focus (the intended interpretation here) and N focus (comparing the letter with the other things to be written). This kind of ambiguity in focus scope clearly points to a more flexible treatment of the scope of EPs. We will address this problem by providing a Davidsonian semantics for Japanese EPs. 4 Structured Davidsonian decomposition Herburger (2000) treats the problem of focus in connection with its interaction with negation, adverbial quantifiers, determiners and only and even. For the semantic representation, she proposes a many-sorted predicate logic notation, which she call structured Davidsonian decomposition (SDD, henceforth). The SDD of a clause with a focus is a logical form containing both event and individual variables (thus, Davidsonian) in which the predicate of the clause is decomposed into logical predicates corresponding to the original predicate and its associated thematic roles (cf. Parsons (1990)). But it is different from a simple Davidsonian decomposition in that it is structured into the backgrounded information and foregrounded information of the clause. (7a b) have (8 a & b) as their SDDs (Herburger's (1) and (12)). (7) a. ROSALIA wrote a poem. b. Rosalia wrote A POEM.","(8) a.

C in C(e) stands for the context of utterance. Besides certain possible considerations of quantification discussed in Schein (1993), the overlap between the background part and the foreground part is largely due to the procedure of deriving SDDs from LFs. As far as the semantics of focus is concerned, there is no strong reason why we should retain such overlapping information in the semantic representation of focused clauses.","Another problem with Herburger's SDD notation is that the SDD derivation procedure needs to be augmented with translation rules, which are called equivalences, such as in (9) in the case of only and even. This suggests that SDDs might not be amenable to direct modeltheoretic interpretation as hinted by Herburger (2000, p.19).
