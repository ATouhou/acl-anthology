Our method use hierarchical information in the part-of-speech system and statistical information in the corpus to generate a category set. The statistical information is based on the context of occurrence of categories. First, we specify the format of given information. Then, we describe an algorithm to generate a proper categorization. Finally, we present the results of our experiments in applying this method. We obtaind a moderately proper categorization and found several candidates for improvement. 1 Introduction In natural language processing, it is important to categorize words or morphemes properly. A proper categorization depends on, among other things, the kind of processing task, the domain of target corpus, and the size of the corpus. When categorization is too general, we can not use characters of individual categories. Because the characters of categories hide each other. On the contrary, when categorization is too specific, we can not use the characters of categories also. Because a low frequency of a category decreases the reliability of characters of the category.","Past researches have proposed categorizations and tagsets for differnt purposes: morphological analysis, syntactic analysis or information extraction, etc. While some of the categorizations are made by hand using linguistic knowledge, others are created from annotated corpora automatically or semiautomatically. Several researches have forcused on methods of modifing the existing categorization in order to improve the accuracy of their task with respect to their purpose (Brants, 1995). Criteria of categorizations in these researches are the accuracies of their tasks. Other researches have proposed an criteria of categorizations of words based on linguistic quality and not processing quality (Dejean, 2000).","We propose here a method to decide a proper categorization of morphemes, giving a hierarchical part-of-speech system and a corpus tagged using this part-of-speech system. In other words, our method forcuses on reducing an existing category set using hierarchical information of part-of-speech system and statistical information of the corpus. We recursively subdivide the categories using topdown approach with subdivision score. The subdivision score, which indicates how significant it is to subivide a category, is based on difference between the context of the category and that of its parent category.","We explain structure of given information, which consist of a part-of-speech system and a tagged corpus, and a generating category set in Section 2. Section 3 explains the method of generating a category set. Section 4 shows experiments that are performed in order to test the generating algorithm. In the next section, we disscuss the result of the experiments."]},{"title":"217 2 Given Information and Generated Category Set 2.1","paragraphs":["Hierarchical Part-of-Speech System The part-of-speech system we use in this research is a tree structure specified by a triplet U = (VM , Vp, P), where VM is a set of the leaf part-of-speech categories of this tree structure. Vp is a set of the part-of-speech categories occupying the intermediate (or non-leaf) nodes including the root node p. In other words, each element of VM is one of the most specific categories in the part-of-speech system. For instance, p-N-NO, p-N-PN-NT and p-SYM are elements of VM , while p-N, p-N-PN and p are elements of Vp 1 . A hyphen stands for a parent-child relationship in these category names.","The parent-child relationship between the nodes of a tree structure is defined by the parent function P : VM U Vp -4 Vp. A category P(x) is more general than a category x. For instance, P(p-N-PN) = p-N and P(p-SYM) = p. The parent of the root node is undefined.","Given a parent function P, the children function C is defined as follows : C (x) = {y IP(y) = x} . C(x) is a set of all children of a category x. 2.2 Tagged Corpus The tagged corpus we use in this research is tagged with the part-of-speech system described in Section 2.1. The corpus is tagged with the most specific categories. In other words, each word in the original corpus is replaced with the leaf category of the part-of-speech system. 2.3 Category Set Our objective is to generate a category set G from a part-of-speech system U and a tagged corpus, which is a subset of the category set of U; that is, G C VM U Vp . Figure 1 shows a hierarchical part-of-speech system U and a category set G. In this figure, a circle stands for category and a line stands for the parent-child relationship between categories.","Since an input tagged corpus consists of leaf categories, all leaf categories must be replaced by corresponding categories that are elements of category set G. We put requirements on G, in order to ensure that all leaf categories have its ancestor category in G.","We recursively define a function as follows: 6U,G (x) { x,\\tx E G Su (P(x)), otherwise This equation means that (5U'G (X) is an ancestor of x and it is an element of G. We require that the generated category set G must satisfy the following two requirements: (1) 6U'G (X) is defined for all x E VM , (2) P(x) sg' G for all x E G. 2.4 Environment of a Category We quantify the context of occurrence in a corpus H with a category set G by the terms pH\\t (x; z) and plIR ' u'G (x; z) as follows: PL\\t(X; Z) PHR'\" (X ; Z) fGrl'U (x z) fGILU (z) II,U f G (Z • X)","f GH'u CO • 1 N, NO, PN, RG, NT and SYM stand for noun, number, propernoun, region, nation and symbol, respectively. 218 In these equations,"]},{"title":"f","paragraphs":["G","li 'u (x) is the frequency of the category x in the corpus obtained by replacing","each morpheme by its nearest ancestor category that is an element of G2.

It also means that, if we use such subcorpora, the generated category set has little noise.","However, comparing with the results from the whole corpus, we notice some differences. As Table 2, Table 3 and Table 4 show, some categories that are subdivided early with the whole corpus are subdivided later in case of subcorpora. For example, p-ADJ","4 ,","which is subdivided second with the whole corpus, is subdivided at t = 22 with the s01 corpus. We conjecture that the category corresponding to adjectives is subdivided later because of the low frequency of the adjectives. A category has a low subdivision score if its children categories do not occur uniformly, although the frequency of the category may be high.","Once a certain category is subdivided, the subdivision scores of its children categories tend to be larger than the subdivision scores of its sibling categories. For example, in Table 2, because the category p-v is subdivided early, its children categories are subdivided in succeeding steps. In the part-of-speech system we use, the category p-v has many descendant categories. The number of leaf categories which are descendant of p-v is 361. It is more than half of 509, which is the total number of leaf categories. As a result, category p-ADJ","is subdivided later. In fact, when the category corresponding to verbs were subdivided, the maximum subdivision shot up, as shown in Figure 3 and Table 3. 5.2 Proper Value for the Threshold of Subdivision Score It is difficult to estimate a proper value for the threshold of the subdivision score ET, because the maximum subdivision score often shoots up.","If we set ET = 2, the algorithm terminates at t = 8, (GI = 83 with the whole corpus. But the largest subdivision score appears at t = 16. If we set ET = 1.2 in order to call the largest subdivision score, the algorithm terminates at t = 34, IGI = 249.

But this work lacks an objective evaluation of the aptness of a category set. We have to find a measure of aptness and evaluate the algorithm by this measure.

Then, we have to compare our method to other existing methods.","We think we have to perform more experiments with other data.

Then, we ran experiments to test the generating algorithm. As a result, we obtained a moderately proper categorization, and found several candidates for improvement.
