Personal name identification in Chinese involves many different issues that are not found in similar tasks in English. Despite extensive research in the issue in recent years (Wang et al. 1992, Song et al. 1993, Sun et al. 1995), many NLP applications still suffer from the weakness of current available performance.","The paper has four sections: Section 1 illustrates some IT applications in which Chinese personal name identification plays important roles, to promote an appreciation of the significance of the research. Section 2 introduces the structure of Chinese personal names, and Section 3 discusses the relevant processing strategies. Lastly, we will highlight the significant differences of Chinese personal names between Beijing and Hong Kong in Section 4, showing the added difficulty caused by variations in different Chinese communities. 2\\tThe Role of Automatic Identification of Personal Names in IT Applications 2.1 Information Retrieval (IR) * This research is supported in part by the National Basic Research Scheme of China, under grant no. G199803050 and by Language Information Sciences Research Centre, City University of Hong Kong. 28 IR systems, including search engine on WWW, retrieval system of digital library, text mining etc., search and retrieve the requested information from large bodies of data stored in electronic form. With the advent of the Internet, search engine techniques have become most widely influential. However; the effectiveness of current systems is not satisfactory especially for retrieving Chinese web sites/pages. We have examined how personal names interfere with the correct retrieval of relevant results in Sinai, a popular Chinese search engine, and Google [Big5 Chinese] 2. For instance, suppose we want to get some information about \"EN:\" (lieutenant general) from WWW, and enter that word as a query to. Sina, then some of the \"relevant\" web pages will be returned, as in (1)—(4):"]},{"title":"(1)Mitigt4111 (2)AiktiS","paragraphs":["tl"]},{"title":"i","paragraphs":["."]},{"title":".f","paragraphs":["r"]},{"title":"1A-1","paragraphs":["1"]},{"title":"-SAMP","paragraphs":["I"]},{"title":"T","paragraphs":["I"]},{"title":"Xti (0.10 (3)ISIRMVVIIMR40fig143/C.P32a10N","paragraphs":["(4) irtiFIVVE\\tUM4INITIgitPirlArt -** ° (Sina) (Sina) (Google [Big5 Chinese]) (Google [Big5 Chinese]) These webpages are actually irrelevant to \"lieutenant general\" although the string \"414\" is embedded. The string \"4:1\" in the two sentences cannot be analyzed as the word meaning \"lieutenant general\". In (1) and (2), the character \"4\" is the given name, and 1:\" an adverb by itself meaning \"will\" for referring to the future. In (3) and (4), \"11:1:\" forms the two-character given name. The misinterpretation would have been avoided if the search engine could detect the presence of proper names and segment the words accordingly. 2.2 Text-to-Speech Conversion (TTS) The text-to-speech conversion system accepts textual input and generates the corresponding speech signal. It finds applications in mail reading over the phone, generating spoken prompts in voice response systems, human-machine interface and so on. Lucent Technologies hosts a web site called Bell Labs Mandarin Text-to-Speech Synthesis 3 which allows the user to input text and outputs the corresponding speech. We tested sentences containing characters that are pronounced differently when it functions as a surname and as a character with other meaning. Any incorrect pronunciation will suggest that the system fails to differentiate personal names from other content words.

The character \"X\" acquires different tones in different contexts. It is pronounced as hual (a morpheme meaning China) or hua4 (surname). The character \" \" is another potential trap. It is pronounced as ceng2 (an adverb meaning \"once\") or zeng4 (surname). 1 Sina Search Engine website: http://www.sina.com.cn 2 Google [Big5 Chinese] website : http://www.google.com/intl/zh-TW/ 3 Bell Lab TTS website: http://www.bell-labs.Com/project/tts/rnandarin-gb.html 29 (6) ‘2.:4"]},{"title":"1:11*ARJ#111 TfliAPP,","paragraphs":["hua4 zengl hua2 \"Hua Guo-Feng is the former premier of the People's Republic of China.\" The system correctly differentiates the two occurrences of \"*\" and pronounces the characters correctly. However, it misinterprets \" {-1\" as a surname and pronounces \" \" as zengl . Apparently, the conversion system has not been able to identify personal name reliably and made errors in generating the correct speech output. 2.3 Machine Translation (MT) System MT application is another important NLP application. The rise of the Internet gives rise to a great demand for translating web pages on the fly from a foreign language into the native language. Although MT systems are far from perfect, many free web-based MT systems have already been capable of doing reasonably good translation. We select the popular Transtar website4 in Mainland China for testing. It offers Chinese-to-English Machine Translation. The MT system translates (7a) and (8a) as (7b) and (8b) accordingly. (7) a."]},{"title":"R, Z-51§5/1\\*Pdailgr1'mrif","paragraphs":["b. \"I see that Deng Xiao-Ping greets with Jiang Zemin.\" (8) a."]},{"title":"IMII5\\t°","paragraphs":["b. \"I see week star Chi open together study friend greet.\" At first glance, (7a) and (8a) are identical in syntactic and semantic structures, except the personal names. However, while (7b) is a good translation, (8b) is completely incomprehensible. An examination of (7b) and (8b) shows that the major difference lies in the system's failure to identify the two personal names in (8). It is likely that the two paramount political figures' names in (7a) are registered in the system's lexicon and the information can be called up in processing. It makes it possible to parse the Chinese string and to generate the English translation. In contrast, the names' in (6b) are relatively less well-known in Mainland China and are not in the system' s lexicon, resulting in the brute-force translation of"]},{"title":"\"ji9\"","paragraphs":["to \"week\", \"*\" to \"star\","]},{"title":"\"a\"","paragraphs":["to \"Chi\"(\",\" is a bound morpheme and the system simply output its ronianization of the character),"]},{"title":"\"3K\"","paragraphs":["to \"open\", \"s\" to \"study\", \"SC to \"friend\" respectively. 3\\tProcessing Chinese Personal Names: Challenges and Strategy 3.1 Structure Of Chinese Personal Names The basic structure of modem Chinese personal names is largely similar across different communities. The frequent length is 2 or 3 characters. The maximum can be as long as 6 characters. Table 1 shows the possible structures of Chinese personal name. Chinese personal name begins with the surname which can be one-character (as in (a) and (b)) or two-character (as in (c) or (d)). It is followed by the given name which can be one-character (as in (a) and (c)) or two-character (as in (b) or (d)). A unique structure exists in some Chinese communities such as Hong Kong: the name of a married female may be preceded by her husband's surname, as in (e) and (f). Such usage occurs in formal occasions or writing of formal register. 4 Transtar Website: http://www.transtar.com.cn/ 5 They are famous movie star and singer in Hong Kong. 30","Full Name Husband's Surname","Surname Given Name Length H1 (H2) S 1 (S2) + G1 (G2) a. \\t\\t1111= 111= b.

Possible variations of Chinese personal names 3.2 Challenges Several characteristics make it difficult for computers to recognize Chinese personal names. Unlike capitalization of personal names in English, there is no explicit marking for personal names in Chinese. Other problems include: (1) Chinese texts do not have explicit word boundaries; (2) the character set for surname and given name are strictly a subset of Chinese character set that forms common Chinese words; (3) some characters in personal names may be mono-syllabic words; (4) some multi-syllabic words can be involved in Chinese personal names starting at every possible position. All of these factors introduce a lot of potential ambiguities in Chinese personal name identification.","The situation becomes even more complicated regarding the fact that some polysyllabic common words are also possible in names, e.g. \"OBJJ\" (\"*JJ\"= dynasty), \"%WU\" (\"Mir = victory) and 44 \\t","(\"","\\t"]},{"title":"=","paragraphs":["serious(ly)). In these cases, the algorithm may easily mistake names as common","words and produce irrecoverable errors.

So another interpretation seems to be reasonable if larger context (perhaps the structure of the whole sentence) is referred to: (10) • Meanwhile, Yan Su pointed out the mistake of Zhang Yi, hoping he could correct it. 3.3 Basic Strategies Chinese personal names are so elusive that locating them in running texts usually relies on a combination of techniques and knowledge to achieve satisfactory recall and precision rate. In the following, several identification strategies will be outlined. They are broadly divided into two types, namely, inherent characteristics of personal names and contextual information of texts."]},{"title":"31","paragraphs":["3.3.1 Inherent Characteristics of Personal Names Probability Certain combinations of characters are more likely to form a name.

It achieves 95.0% recall and 87.6% precision in open test for Chinese personal name identification. 4\\tGeographical Differences of Chinese Personal Names Generally speaking, different Chinese communities may share similar convention of naming, but we do find divergence in specific personal name structure and choice of characters. In this section, we will compare personal name data drawn from Beijing and Hong Kong. The statistical findings not only bear sociolinguistic interest about divergence of difference Chinese communities but also present essential cues to accurate personal name identification in texts from different Chinese communities. The knowledge derived can be applied to devise better techniques and customize identification algorithms for different Chinese texts. 4.1 Data Two databases of Chinese personal names are collected from Beijing and Hong Kong. The Beijing database is drawn from a name list of a county in Beijing. The database that contains 125,033 names is representative of names in Mainland China because the county population is composed of migrants from 32 different provinces of China. The Hong Kong database contains 11,358 names. They are student and staff names taken from Registrar's Office, City University of Hong Kong. 4.2 Findings 4.2.1 Distribution of Surnames The Chinese surname consists of one or two characters. Single-character surnames are predominant, accounting for over 99% in both databases. Beijing (%) HK (%) Single-Char. Surname 99.92 99.56 Double-Char. Surname 0.08 0.44 Table 2. Distribution of single- and double-character surnames The frequency of the surnames is ranked. Table 3 shows that the ranking of the top ten surnames in the two databases are quite different. The most striking difference is that the most frequent surname .1. (Wang) in Beijing is ranked as 14th in the Hong Kong.
