Although the verb ha- 'do' normally takes an event type argument, it takes some substantival nouns such as paiolin 'violin', umsikcem 'restaurant', and so on. A substantival noun undergoes type shifting, because the governing verb ha- 'do' coerces an entity type noun to an event reading, taking missing information from the qualia of the entity type noun. In addition, some nouns like ppallay 'launch-3e are dot objects. The verb taking a dot object selects a proper type between multiple subtypes of the dot object. Type pumping operation makes that selection possible. 1. Introduction Much of the current research on sure 'do' in Japanese and ha- 'do' in Korean has been focused on its light verb function when it combines with verbal nouns since Grimshaw & Mester (1988). Although many papers have tried to uncover the nature of the Korean verb ha- 'do', they still have difficulty in defining the lexical semantic property of this verb. Recent studies of the verb ha- including Jun (2001), Im & Lee (2001) touch on the issues of substantival nouns with ha- 'do'. In this paper, we account for how the verb ha- ' do' is directly combined with substnatival nouns or complex type nouns. Specifically, we first list the nouns used together with the verb ha- 'do' in chapter 2. The nouns are classified into verbal nouns, substantival nouns, and dot objects. In chapter 4, we accounted for the combination of the verb ha-d̀o' with substantival nouns or complex type nouns. A substantival noun undergoes a type shifting operation by type coercion of the governing verb ha- 'do'. Type pumping operation makes possible that ha- selects a proper type out of multiple types of a dot object. Our explanation is based on the Generative Lexicon (GL) Theory (Pustejovsky, 1995, 2001). 2. Data In Chapter 2, we classify the kinds of nouns that combine with the verb ha- 'do'. Verbal nouns constitute the light verb construction with ha- 'do'. A verbal noun, basically, assigns thematic roles to its arguments. The words in (1) are typical verbal nouns."]},{"title":"103","paragraphs":["(1) kensel c̀onstruction', phagoy 'destruction', ceycak 'production' , Secondly, a substantival noun such as paiolin 'violin' can be a complement of the verb ha- 'do' as in (2): (2) John-un paiolin-ul\\tha-n-ta J-TOP violin-ACC do-PRES J̀ohn plays the violin' Although ha- 'do' normally takes an event type noun as its argument, some kinds of substantival nouns combine with ha- 'do' naturally. We present a part of group of substantival nouns combining with the verb ha- do' in (3):","(3) a. yencwu 'play': cheyllo 'cello', phiano 'piano', tulem d̀rum',... b. chakyong 'wearing': mokkeli 'necklace', phalcci 'bracelet', meylppang suspenders',... c. wunyeng 'management': pyengwon 'hospital', kakey s̀tore', kongcang f̀actory', d. wuncen driving' : thayksi\\t,... e. hupyen smoking': tampay cigarette', aphyen ' opium' ,... f. umyong drinking' : khephi coffee', swul alcoholic drink', kholla c̀oke',... In the above, we listed two kinds of nouns combining with the verb ha- 'do'. But there are nouns belonging to neither verbal nouns nor substantival ones. It is not easy to explain the properties of those nouns, because of their ambiguities'. The sentences in (4) show the polysemy of the noun ppallay 'laundry' with different predicates. (4) a. onul-un\\tppallay-ka\\tnemwu manh-ta today-TOP laundry-NOM too\\tmuch-DEC T̀oday, I have too much laundry' b. na-nun ppallay-lul\\timi\\tkkutnay-ss-ta I-TOP washing-ACC already finish-PAST-DEC Ì have already finished washing' In (4a), ppallay 'laundry' is an entity type noun denoting the clothes that need washing. But ppallay ẁashing clothes' is an event type noun meaning a washing activity. We give an explanation of how those nouns combine with ha- 'do' and what the meaning of those is. The words in (5) have ambiguities because those belong to multiple types on ontology. 1 These nouns are different from the nouns such as paiolin violin'. Paiolin 'violin' has no ambiguity intrinsically. The types of the nouns are coerced by the governing verb only when governed by it. While, the noun such as ppallay 'laundry' is ambiguous in itself."]},{"title":"104","paragraphs":["(5) ppallay 'laundry', swukcey 'homework' , sayngkak 'thought', mal 'language', iyaki t̀alk', hakmwun 'science', poko 'report', . • • In this paper, we confine our research to an analysis of the nouns in (3) and (5). In consequence, our argument will be a trial to explain why and how the nouns combine with the verb ha- 'do'. We show the frame of GL theory as an introduction to our argument. 3. Generative Lexicon Theory 3.1 Lexical Semantic Structure The idea of GL is that polysemy comes by the logical inference from a basic meaning of a word. The lexical semantic structure designed by Pustejovsky (1995) consists of event structure, argument structure and qualia structure. For example, the lexical semantic structure of the English verb build is like the following in (6)2: (6) build EVENT STR = El = el : process E2 = e2: state HEAD = el ARGSTR = ARG1 = x = animate_ind ARG2 = y = artifact D-ARG1 = z = material FORMAL = mass QUALIA = createicp FORMAL = exist (e2, y) AGENTIVE = build_act (el, x, z) Qualia structure represents semantic or conceptual information of words. In other words, qualia structure of a word is the mode of explaining that and gives the relational force of a lexical item. That includes formal, constitutive, telic and agentive quale. 2","Event structure characterizes basic event type of a lexical item and internal, subeventual structure. Argument structure specifies the number and type of arguments that a lexical item carries. Default arguments allow us to consider conceptual participants of an event represented by a verb."]},{"title":"105","paragraphs":["(7) Qualia Structure a. CONSTITUTIVE: the relation between an object and its constituent parts; b. FORMAL: that which distinguishes it witin a larger domain; c. TELIC: its purpose and function d. AGENTIVE: factors involved in it origin or \"bringing it about\" (Pustejovsky, 1995) In the next section, we argue about the ontology and types of words based on Pustejovsky (2000). 3.2 Ontology and Types of Nouns Pustejovsky (2000) suggests a ranking of types, pointing out the defect of Montague's flat typing model. He distinguishes between natural (simple) types and functional types, and then motivates the use of complex types (dot objects) to model objects with multiple and interdependent denotations. (8) a. NATURAL TYPES: Predication from the domain of substance, e.g., the qualia FORMAL or CONST. b. FUNCTIONAL TYPES: Predication includes reference to either AGENTIVE or TELIC qualia c. COMPLEX TYPES: Cartesian type formed by Dot Object Construction. According to him, the upper concept lattice is structured into three domains: entities, qualities, and events. Each domain is itself structured by a type ordering relation, from simpler to more complex types. Natural types are grounded types and Functional types combine qualia-based information from AGENTIVE and TELIC modes of explanation with a ground type. Book is a typical complex type noun. Book is a physical object but includes information. Pustejovsky (1995, 2000) call this noun a dot object. (9) a. John stole every book in that library. b. John read every book in that library. \\t(Asher & Pustejovsky, 2000) In (9), the verb steal selects the physical object type of the noun book and read selects the information interpretation. In the next chapter, we will discuss about dependent type nouns such as paiolin v̀ioln' and dot objects such as ppallay 'laundry', based on these theoritical concepts. 4. The Generative Mechanism of Polysemy Asher & Pustejovsky (2000) introduces two different operations in order to explain polysemy. They explain a dot object by type pumping operation. On the other hand, a dependent type noun which does not have a proper type required by its governing verb undergoes type shifting by type coercion. We suggest that these operations allow the nouns in (3) and (5) to combine with the verb ha- 'do'. 106 4.1 Argument Type of the Verb ha-The nouns in (3) are entity type ones. Is it possible for entity type nouns to combine with the verb had̀o'? The transitive verb ha- takes an event type argument as its complement as in (10): (10) a. *John-un son-ul\\tha-ye\\tna-lul pwulu-ess-ta J-TOP\\thand-ACC do-ending I-ACC call-PAST-DEC J̀ohn called me doing the hand (literally)' b. John-un soncis-ul\\tha-ye\\tna-lul\\tpwulu-ess-ta J-TOP hand signal-ACC do-ending I-ACC call-PAST-DEC J̀ohn beckoned to me' In the above examples, the verb ha- cannot combine with an entity type noun son 'hand'. ha- can combine with only soncis 'hand signal' meaning an act. The following question and answers show that the verb ha- takes only event type arguments. (11) Q: ne mwue-ha-ni? You what-do-INTR ẁhat are you doing? A: a. na, pap\\tmek-e I boiled rice eat-DEC Ì'm eating a meal' b. na, pang chengso ha-e I room cleaning do-DEC Ì'm cleaning the room' c. *na, chayksang ha-e I desk\\tdo-DEC Ì'm doing a desk' In (11), only expressions denoting events can be an answer to the question. In conclusion, the verb ha-takes an event type noun as its complement argument. In 4.2, we explain the compound of the dependent type noun like paiolin 'violin' and ha-. 4.2 Dependent Type Nouns and Type Coercion Im & Lee (2001) notes a superficial type conflict in the construction of SNs plus the verb ha- 'do'. Substantival nouns are entity type nouns but ha- 'do' takes an event type noun as its complement argument. But the verb ha- d̀o' takes an entity type complement in (12a):"]},{"title":"107","paragraphs":["(12) a. John-un\\tpaiolin-ul\\tha-n-ta. J-NOM violin-ACC do-PRES-DEC J̀ohn plays the violin' b. Who's doing the food for your party? Both paiolin 'violin' and food in (12) are entity type nouns but combine with the verb taking an event type argument such as ha- 'do' in Korean and do in English. Then, the meaning of paiolin 'violin is an activity 'playing the violin' in (12a). While, in other light verb constructions, ha- 'do' does not combine directly with a substantival noun as in (13). (13) a. *cekkwun-i tosi-lul ha-ess-ta the army-NOM city-ACC do-PAST-DEC *̀The army did a city' b. cekkwun-i tosi-lul phagoy-lul ha-ess-ta the army-NOM city-ACC destruction-ACC do-PAST-DEC T̀he army destructed a city' The verbal noun phagoy 'destruction' in (13b) is a verbal noun in the light verb construction. tosi c̀ity' is an argument of the verbal noun phagoy 'destruction'. In (13a), the entity type noun tosi 'city' cannot combine directly with the light verb ha- 'do' without the verbal noun phagoy 'destruction'. If so, how is it possible that a substantival noun like paiolin 'violin' combine with ha- 'do' as in (12)? Pustejovsky (1995, 2000) explain the combination of the entity type noun with the verb begin by type coercion. (14) a. Mary began reading a book. b. Mary began a book. The verb begin coerces type of the argument book to an event function introducing the event reading of the NP a book because, otherwise, there is a type error in that combination. In this way, the verb had̀o' in Korean and do in English coerces the type of their arguments to an event type, when they are combined with special entity type nouns. The type coercion is based on the qualia structure of the arguments. The verb ha- 'do' coerces its argument to event type, taking missing information for the correct interpretation from the qualia structure. The noun paiolin 'violin' in (12a) is interpreted as paiolin yencwu 'playing the violin'. This interpretation is from the telic quale of the noun paiolin v̀iolin' in its qualia structure as in (15)."]},{"title":"108","paragraphs":["(15) paiolin 'violin' QUALIA = musical_instrument_lcp FORMAL = x: physobj TELIC\\t= play (e, w, x) AGENTIVE = make_act (e', v, x) In sum, we can represent the type coercion to event description on the noun paiolin 'violin' from the governing verb ha- 'do' in (12a), as follows: (16) S [human] John\\tcoercion [event] •\\tV XxXe[play(e, x, violin)]","I paiolin(-0","\\t ha-There are limited kinds of nouns whose type changes by type coercion based on their telic quale. These nouns must get specification on ha-combinability in the lexicon to block overgenration of substantive N plus ha-. The [SN + ha- 'do] construction constitutes an individual-level predicate for business or profession, as major or habit (in a secondary telic quale) when type shifting is based on the telic quale of the substantive nominal. Observe: (17) ce-nun\\tswul-un\\tmot-ha-pnita I -TOP alcohoic drink-TOP cannot-do-DEC Ì cannot/don't drink' The substantive nominals involved in this construction are necessarily nonspecific generic (Note that a nominal involved in such a stage-level aspectual predicate as in (14b) is necessarily specific). But the construction can be changed into the stage-level predication by quantizing the nominal or adding time adverbials, as follows:"]},{"title":"109","paragraphs":["(18) wuli maykcwu\\than-can\\tha-ca. we\\tbeer\\tone-glass do L̀et's drink a glass of beer' Nouns such as pap 'boiled rice' are coerced into an event type of such agentive quale as c̀ook act' instead of their telic quale as 'eat'. (19) ecey-nun\\tnay-ka pap-ul\\tha-ess-ta. Yesterday-TOP I-NOM boiled rice-ACC do-PAST-DEC Ỳesterday, I cooked rice' Type coercion on substantive nouns based on an agentive quale introduces a stage-level predication of making/preparing, not an individual-level one. This exactly applies to (12b) in English. Their event readings are dependent on their unique qualia roles. In sum, a dependent type noun undergoes type shifting from an entity type to an event type by type coercion of governing verb ha- 'do'. Type coercion is based on the qualia structure of the noun. If it requires telic quale information, the combination of the noun and ha- is an individual-level predicate. Otherwise, it is likely to be a stage-level predicate. If so, how can we explain the combination of the complex type noun such as ppallay 'laundry' with ha-? In the next secion, we show disambiguation of a complex type noun. 4.3 Complex Type Nouns and Type Pumping A noun such as ppallay 'laundry' is a dot object with multiple meanings. Dot objects have complex types and the two subtypes of a dot object are mutually interdependent. So, we cannot have one without the other. This mutual dependency makes copredication possible. Let's see sentences in the following; (20) ppallay-ka acwu manh-ass-ciman, seythakki tekpwun-ey lsikan-maney kkutnay-ss-ta laundry-NOM very much-PAST-but washing machine help lhour-in\\tfinish-PAST-DEC t̀he laundry was very much, but I finished washing in one hour thanks to a washer' The verbal noun ppallay in Korean is able to be copredicated corresponding to both laundry and washing in English. We cannot imagine laundering without laundry. ppallay as laundry is an entity type noun and one denoting laundering is an event type noun. (21) a. ppallay-ka\\tcec-ese\\tnemwu mwukep-ess-ta laundry-NOM wet-ending too\\theavy-PAST-DEC 1 10 L̀aundry was too heavy, for it was wet' b. Yumi-nun halwucongil ppallay-lul\\tha-ess-ta. Yumi-TOP all day\\twashing-ACC do-PAST-DEC Ỳumi did washing all day long' The noun ppallay in (21a) is an entity type noun but ppallay in (21b) is an event type noun. These complex type nouns get their process and result/pre-act nominal readings through the type pumping (projection) process as in (22)3: (22) a. Yumi-nun halwucongil cipan ppallay-lul ha-ess-ta Ỳumi did her family laundry all day long' b. ha-̀do'(0(E i (ppallay: process -physobj)))(Yumi) ha--̀do'(e(ppallay: process))(Yumi) ha-̀do' (ppallay: event)(Yumi) (0: subtype coercion operator,"]},{"title":"E:","paragraphs":["type pumping operator) Because the verb ha- 'do' takes an event type argument, ha- selects an event reading out of the two types; entity type and event type.

In (1), benz is one of kinds of cars made by a company in Germany. When the verb drive combines with benz, benz is interpreted as a car. It is possible through subtype coercion operation.","(2) 0 [benz S car]: benz 14 car Thanks to subtype coercion, we have no difficulty in interpreting proper meaning of the sentence in (1)."]},{"title":"111","paragraphs":["b. kukes-un cham cinpwuhan mal-ita. That-TOP very stereotyped expression-DEC T̀hat is a very stereotyped expression' In (24a) mal 'saying' means an activity expressing or conveying someone's thought or feeling etc. And its type is an event. But mal in (24b) is an abstract entity type noun similar to phyohyen èxpression'. The noun mal in Korean is a complex type noun4. In sum, nouns such as ppallay l̀aundry' and mal 'speech' are dot objects having a complex type. The verb combining with those selects a proper type out of multiple types by type pumping operation. 5. Conclusion We can thus solve the puzzle of why certain substantival nouns take ha- 'do' as their main verb and this direction will shed new light on the same crosslinguistic phenomenon. This is possible by means of the systematic lexical semantic specification of their qualia structures and a generative operation device – type coercion – provided by the Generative Lexicon Theory. Also, we gave an account of the combination of nouns such as ppallay 'laundry' and the verb ha- 'do'. Based on Asher & Pustejovsky (2000), we treat nouns such as ppallay 'laundry' as a kind of dot object, because those have multiple types in themselves. The verb ha- selects an event type interpretation between two subtypes of a dot object through type pumping operation. Bibliography Asher, N & Pustejovsky, J. 2000.
