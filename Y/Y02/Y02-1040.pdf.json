The intended situations in (2) should be realized in Japanese with a V-V compound or a V-te-V compound, such as arui-te-iku g̀o by walking' and hasi-tte-iku 'go by running'. In Korean, as in Japanese, we should use compound verbs. We will call V -te-V compounds in Japanese TE-compounds, to distinguish them from V-V compounds. 3' 4 * I would like to express my deep gratitude to Prof. Chungmin Lee for kindly giving me advice. My special thanks also go to the following people: Takafumi Maekawa, who kindly read an earlier version of this paper, and gave me criticism, and Shoji Takata, with whom I had lengthy discussions on the data presented here.","Abbreviations: TOP topic, NOM nominative, ACC accusative, GOAL goal, LOC location, PAST past tense form, PRES present tense form 2 Some Japanese native speakers might judge (la,b) as acceptable, especially when the action is done with a purpose.

It is not clear at this point whether the difference in forms affect the semantics of these complex verbs or not. 4 It should be noted here that V-teiku also has an aspectual use, which describes a gradual change. As an example, consider (ii). -Deiku is an allophonic variant of –teiku. 421","(3) Japanese: a. Taro wa\\tgakko-ni\\tarui -te -i-tta","Taro TOP school-GOAL walk-TE-go-PAST 'Taro walked to school' b.

In the present paper, our focus will be mainly placed on Japanese data, but we would like to mention Korean data, when our theory is considered to be extended to them.","Another question posed in this present paper is how TE compounds are represented in the lexicon. V-te-iku cannot be simply analyzed into [V + iku], for the compound verb is not fully compositional in meaning. We will, thus, investigate what kind of relation holds between V and V-teikuliku. Special emphasis is placed on the event structures of these verbs, based on the observations of the aspectual properties of these verbs.","The organization of this paper is as follows: In the next section, we will observe the aspectual difference between (1) and (3), and show that this difference yields the grammatical contrast between them. In section 3, we turn our attention to the compositional mechanism of V -te-iku, and show that also in Japanese, a generative lexical operation co-composition (Pustejovsky 1995a, 1995b) is available at morphological level. In the latter half of this section, we will argue the syntactic realizations of the arguments. Section 4 will be the conclusion. 2. The Event Structures of Aruku vs. Arui-te-iku 2.1 The Licenser of –ni Recall first the contrast between Japanese and English which was noted in section 1. As is often noted, in English, the attachment of the GOAL expression changes the aspectual value of the event (cf. Tenny 1994). Consider the following. (4) a. John walked {for 30 minutes /din 30 minutes} .","b. John walked to school f*for 30 minutes/in 30 minutes). In (4a), the event described by the verb walk co-occurs with a durative adverb but not with a time-bounded adverb, which implies that the event (or verb) is atelic. On the other hand, in (4b), only the time-bounded adverb can modify the event, suggesting that it is telic. Pustejovsky (1995a) regards this aspectual alternation as a functional mapping of to phrase (i.e. co-composition, in his terminology). As we have already (ii) Hito -ga\\ttsugitsugini sin-deiku people-NOM successively die-TEIKU-PRES","P̀eople are successively dying.'","The present article will not discuss this aspectual use of V-teiku."]},{"title":"422","paragraphs":["observed in section 1, the Japanese –ni phrase clearly does not have this function, given the semantics of walk and aruku are the same. Rather, as we discuss in this paper, -ni phrase must be licensed by some semantic component in the sentence.","The idea that –ni is licensed by some element could be spelled out as the statement that it is an argument of a predicate. Nakau (1999) actually stands in this position.' His argument goes on by comparing –ni with –de 'at/in', clarifying the difference between them. 6 The first difference between –ni and –de is that –ni does not go with action verbs when they do not take it as an argument, while –de co-occurs with action verbs (5) a.

On the other hand, in (5b), the verb yomu 'read' does not take as its argument a GOAL expression, therefore –ni phrase is not allowed, while –de phrase, being a non-argument, felicitously marks the location.","However, when it comes to an intransitive verbs, the argumenthood of –ni phrase is not easily maintained, for intransitive verbs usually take only one argument, which is realized as a subject. ?Vi phrase can co-occur with intransitive verbs, as shown in the next examples.

The crucial point of his argument lies in that –ni needs to construct some predication relationship within VP, while –de is a real adjunct. 6 In Korean, they have counterparts for –ni and –de, which show the similar contrast (Lee 1999).

To answer this","question, let us consider the event structure of the verbs observed above. Pustejovsky (1995a, 1995b) proposes that at the level of event structure_ t here are","at least three types of events; transition, process, and state. Transition is composed of","the other two types of events; process and state. Furthermore, the event structure has","specifications of the order of sub-events and headedness, which provides a way of","indicating a type of foregrounding and backgrounding of event arguments.","Headedness is annotated by * in the event structure. Following the sub-eventual analysis presented by Pustejovsky (1995a, 1995b), the","verbs in (5)-(9) are roughly represented as follows:","(10) a. oku:\\tb. suwaru:","T e)\\tT(e) c. yomu:\\td. iru, aru:","P(el*)\\tS(e2) P(el)\\tS(e2*)\\te\\te T is an abbreviation for transition, P for process, and S for state.

The difference between Achievement and Accomplishment is represented by the headedness.","Based on the. above typology of events, the contexts where –ni phrase is licensed are (10a,b,d).

Event Composition of Compound/Compositional Verbs In this section, we would like to turn our eyes to theoretical issues that TE compounds in Japanese raise. First, we will discuss the way and the level of the composition of V which is a morphological combination of V and iku. We investigate further in the next subsection the aspectual property of V, iku, and V -te-iku, and propose the mechanism of the composition. Specifically, our theoretical question is whether the generative mechanism co-composition (Pustejovsky 1995a,b) is also available in Japanese or not. In section 3.2, we discuss the issue on the relation between argument realization at the surface level and event structure (i.e. aspectual nature of predicates). 3.1 Event Composition – Co-composition in Japanese Pustejovsky(1995a, b) proposes a generative mechanism 'co-composition' which is described as follows: (18) Co-composition: where multiple elements within a phrase behave as functors,","generating new non-lexicalized senses for the words in composition.","(Pustejovsky 1995b: 61) This generative operation on lexicon explains the well-known aspectual contrast in (4a,b), repeated as (19) here, without enumerating further a lexical meaning of walk.' (19) a. John walked {for 30 minutes/ y in 30 minutes}","b. John walked to school {*for 30 minutes/in 30 minutes} The shift in aspect in (19b) is brought about by the prepositional phrase, to school, which serves as a function that takes as its input the walking event and returning as its output a telic event. Note that the meaning of walk itself remains the same in either cases","We have already noted that in Japanese, the postpositional phrase –ni does not have this functional property. However, we have a morphological mechanism to achieve the similar effect. We will discuss how this morphological compounding of verbs affects the event composition, and whether we can analyze Japanese TE compounds as an instance of co-composition.","First. we would like to observe the aspectual nature of iku, and arui-te-iku a little further. In the preceding sections, we have observed that the difference between","8 For other approaches to this topic, see Talmy (1985) and Levin and Rapoport (1988)."]},{"title":"426","paragraphs":["aruku and iku / arui-te-iku lies in the fact that aruku is atelic, while iku and arui-te-iku are both relic. It is clear that aruku is an Activity verb, which has only a process component in event structure. However, iku and arui-te-iku need some clarification.","In Japanese, we have an aspectual form V–teiru, which is ambiguous in at least two ways: a progressive process and a resultant state. 9 –Teiru is attached to action verbs, forming V -teiru (present tense form) or V -teita (past tense form). Whether a V–teiru form means a progressive or a resultant state depends on whether the verb's meaning includes a subject's activity/motion or change. If a verb contains a subject's activity in its meaning, V -teini specifies that the activity is in progress. On the other hand, when a verb describes a subject's change of state/location, it designates a resultant state of the change. Below are some examples.° The examples in (20) are of a progressive processes, and those in (21) show the states which result from the preceding changes. (20) a.

Thus, one might claim that the reading in (22a) is a process of change of location.

It is often pointed out that Vendler also utilizes the 'length' of activity to distinguish Accomplishment and Achievement (cf. Bach(1981), Tenny(1994)).

This is captured in the event structure of the verb by putting the head on the left hand event. In this composite structure, we can intuitively state that aruku specifies the action of x, which makes x go to some location. In other words, aruku specifies the activity part of iku. Since the walking event (el) should temporally overlap the going event (e2), the left hand event is actually a composition of the two events. Their relation is represented as o (el, e2).

Thus, our conclusion to the question whether Japanese has a mechanism co-composition or not is positive. 3.2 Argument Structure In Japanese, not only the aspectual class of predicates but also the realization of their arguments at argument structural level is closely related to the meaning of –teiru. Typically, Accomplishments are realized as transitive verbs, Achievements as unaccusative verbs, and Activities as either transitive or unergative verbs. 16' 17 Given this generalization, we find that for iku and arui-te-iku, this is not true. We have observed that iku and arui-te-iku are, at least in one sense, Accomplishment. However, the y are both realized as intransitive verbs. How should we reconcile this discrepancy'?","Kageyama (1993) argues that verbs like iku 'go', kuru 'come', deru 'come/go out', or agaru 'climb up', contain a subject's intentional act to the subject itself, and that this action makes the subject move and takes him to another location. In his analysis, these verbs have a representation like 'x DO [x GO]' at the Lexical Conceptual Structure. Since the two xs are the same, they are realized as one argument in argument structure (and syntax). In light of his insight, we can formalize the lexical structure of iku as follows(cf. Pustejovsky 1995b): (28)\\tiku: \\t Following Pustejovsky (1995b) on the mapping principle between event structure and syntactic realization, we assume that the arguments in the headed event must be realized. As shown in 3.1, since in iku, the headedness is not specified, we have two options to disambiguate this : If the event is right-headed, the arguments in e2(i.e. 1 and 3) are realized. If the event is left-headed, the arguments in el (i.e. two"]},{"title":"Ds)","paragraphs":["should be realized. Note that at the level of argument structure and qualia structure, the el is represented as a transitive event where an individual let himself go by acting on himself. This is determined by the verb's lexical meaning, that is, the fact that the actor and the acted individual are the same is not accidental. Thus, we assume that a lexical realization rule operates on this structure, which says that the two individuals 16 In Japanese, as in English, unaccusativity holds at 'deep' level, not at 'surface' level (cf. Kageyama (1993)). 1 For the issues in liking relation between aspectual structure and argument structure/syntax, see also Grimshaw (1990). For Korean, Lee et al. (1999) argues that the case alternation of Korean transitive motion verbs is determined by headedness in event structure."]},{"title":"430","paragraphs":["3 ARG1 = ARG2 = D-ARGI = ARGSTR = location_"]},{"title":"),","paragraphs":["walk (el, 0)1 1• nn • n • 2 : ind : ind","[ FORMAL = at (e3,QUALIA =","AGENTIVE = go_act (e2,2n • n • n are realized as one argument in syntax. As a result, iku always surfaces as an intransitive verb.","The analysis presented here is consistent with Kageyama(1993)'s observation on unaccusative verbs. Kageyama (1993) notes that a numeral quantificational adverb takusan 'many/much' modifies only elements under V' (i.e. a verb itself or its sister). Given this generalization, together with the assumption that an unaccusative subject is generated as an internal argument of a predicate, the subject of an unaccusative verb can be modified by takusan.","\\t(29) a. Takusan\\tason-da\\t [unergative]","many/much play-PAST 'Someone played a lot of hours'","b. Takusan\\tkowasi-ta\\t [transitive]","many/much break-PAST 'Someone broke many things'","c. Takusan\\tsin-da\\t [unaccusative]","many/much die-PAST\\t'Many people died'","d. Takusan\\ti-tta","many/much go-PAST\\t'Many people went (to somewhere)' In (29d), takusan modifies the quantity of people who went somewhere, which suggests that iku is an unaccusative verb. Recall that in Japanese, unaccusative verbs are usually Achievement in their aspectual property. This is consonant with the right-headed structure, but shows apparent discrepancy when it is left-headed. However, if we assume that iku in Accomplishment use is in fact a transitive verb, we can explain, with Kageyama(1993), that the internal argument, which is the same individual as the external one, is responsible for the modification of takusan.","The same reasoning can be applied to arui-te-iku. It has the following lexical specification: (30) \\t As in the case of iku, it also shows unaccusative-like behavior. Consider the following: \\t","(31) a. Takusan\\tarui-te- i-tta many/much walk-TE-go-PAST M̀any people walked to somewhere' \\t","b. Takusan\\thasi-tte-i-tta","many/much run-TE-go-PAST","M̀any people ran to somewhere' Here, takusan modifies the quantity of the subjects, in this case, the number of people walking or running is the matter. In the composite structure in (30), the head is on the process part, which implies that the TE compound verb should be realized as a transitive verb. However, the two arguments are the same, as we have argued above, the two arguments are surfaced as one syntactic element."]},{"title":"431","paragraphs":["4. Conclusion In this paper, we have shown the following: (a) A Japanese GOAL expression -ni does not function in the same way as English to/into. It should be licensed by a state component. (b) The contrast between aruku and arui-te-iku with regard to the acceptability of -ni phrase lies in the fact that only the latter has a state component in its meaning. (c) Arui-te-iku is considered an instance of co-composition. However, the operation is not a phrasal, but a morphological in Japanese. (d) The discrepancy between argument structure and aspectual nature of arui-te-iku and iku is resolved by the assumption that they are transitive at a lexical level, but realized as an intransitive at surface level, because their external and internal arguments are identical.
