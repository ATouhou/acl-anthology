Three Issues We will start with the discussion by looking at the following sentences. (1) a. Kono kohii wa atu-sugiru. this coffee Top hot excessively 92 T̀his coffee is too hot.' (2) a.

(4) Kono hon wa omottayorimo\\tmuzukasi-sugiru this book Top than I thought it to be tough excessively \"This book is tougher to read than I thought'. The sentence in (1) shows that the modifier sugiru 'excessively' is placed not before but after the modifiees atui tot' . The sentence in (2a) demonstrates that sugiru modifies an implicit adjunct much in (2a). This becomes clearer if we compare the Japanese example with the English counterpart, which has much as is shown in sentence (5) below. The sentence in (3) shows that sugiru modifies the non-adjacent modifiee hayaku èarly' , which is placed not after the modifier sugiru but before it. One of the issues to be discussed\\tis a view point\\tor a criterion by which an action or a property of something or someone is judged to be in an excessive degree,\\tbeyond\\twhat is right , desired or needed (s.v. too Pocket Oxford Dictionary 5th edition). The sentence in (4) exemplifies this. In view of these data, there are three main issues to be discussed. The intrinsic nature of these data will become clear if we compare these with the following English data'. 1 Korean neomu 'too' is very much like English in that neomu precedes manhi 'much' and it cannot be omitted. (i)Taroo eoje suleul neomu manhi masyeossda. T̀aro drank too much sake yesterday. ' In Chinese there are three expressions roughly equivalent to sugiru: (tai....le, guoyu, and guoduo /guofen,/guotou) (ii)a. Tailang zuotian hejiu he de tai duo le. b. Tailang zuotian hejiu he guotou le. (iii)a. Huazi ba toufa jie de tai duan le."]},{"title":"93","paragraphs":["(5) Taro drank sake too much yesterday. (6) He arrived at a station too early. The sentence in (5) demonstrates that the adjunct much cannot be omitted, while in the Japanese counterparts (cf. sentence (2a) above) this kind of adjuncts are not necessary, or even redundant as is shown in (2b) above. The sentence in (6) shows that the modifier too is put just before the modifiee early so that the adjacency relation holds between the modifier-modifiee. The first question to be discussed is how to formalize what we call implicit adjuncts in Japanese. The second issue to be addressed is how to formalize the non-adjacent\\tmodifier-modifiee\\trelation\\tin\\tJapanese,\\twhich\\tis\\tquite different from English and Korean counterparts as shown in footnote 1. \\tThe last issue we should discuss is a \"criterion\" by which something or someone is judged to be too tough,\\ttoo\\tearly,\\ttoo\\thot,\\ttoo\\tclever\\tor\\twhatever.\\tIs\\tit\\tright to always ascribe the judgement to a speaker of the sentence in question ?

T̀aro scolded her daughter too harshly. c. Tailang yanhui canjia de tai duo le. Taro went to parties too often.' In either case the rule of adjacency is observed, although the modifiee intervenes between tai and le as is shown in sentence c). There is no cases where the non-adjacency relation between a modifier and a modifiee is observed. It is interesting to note that in Chinese there seems to be implicit adjuncts as well See sentence (iiic). The sentence can mean that Taro came to a party too often without any explicit adjuncts like frequently.

Enrichment of a Lexicon The\\tsecond\\tstrategy\\twe are\\tgoing to\\tadopt,\\twhich\\tis\\tclosely related to the\\tfirst one, is to enrich the information contained in verbs. To put our conclusion first, we assert that any verb stores several implicit adjuncts and that when it is followed by sugiru one of the implicit adjuncts is activated and it becomes explicit. For example, we consider that nomu 'drink' has\\tseveral\\tadjuncts\\tstored\\tin\\tit:\\tadjuncts\\tof\\tquantity,\\ttime\\tpoint, place, time length, degree and so forth. When the verb is followed by 95 sugiru, one of these implictly stored adjuncts is activated and becomes explicit. (9) Taro wa kinou\\tsake o nomi- sugi\\tta. Taroo Top yesterday sake Acc drink excessively Past Taro drank too much sake yesterday. As\\tis\\tclear\\tfrom\\tthe\\tEnglish\\ttranslation,\\tthe\\tadjunct\\tof quantity much, which is not explicit in the Japanese sentence, become activated when the verb nomu 'drink' is followed by sugiru. There is another piece of evidence that supports the notion of implicit adjunct. (10) Taroo wa kinou\\tsake o takusan Taroo Nom. yesterday wine Obj. much nomi- sugi\\tta. drink excessively Past Taroo drank too much sake yesterday. When we add takusan m̀uch' in English to the sentence (6), most Japanese speakers judge that it is redundant as shown in the sentence (10). This means that the sentence already contains the implicit adjunct takusan m̀uch in it. There are four cases in which an implicit adjunct is activated when combined with sugiru."]},{"title":"A.

The sentence in (10) is the case in point. The sentence has the reading Taro drank too much sake yesterday as it is, without any help from a context or an additional word like takusan m̀uch', as was mentioned above. This means that the implicit adjunct of quantity much\\tamong\\tothers\\thas\\ta\\tpriority\\twith\\trespect\\tto\\tsugiru, though other adjuncts like those of a degree, time point, time span, place, frequency\\tand\\tso\\tforth\\tcan\\tbe\\ta\\tpossible\\tcandidate with respect to this lexical item.

Formalizations In this section we will try to formalize our Japanese data on sugiru based\\ton\\tthe\\tbasic\\tframework\\tadopted\\tin\\tSag\\tand\\tWasow (1999). The basic framework consists of the following several proposals. 1. Unification based grammar 2. Context-free grammar 3. Unification of syntactic and semantic components 4. Syntactic categories : head, complement and adjunct 5. Adoption of situational semantics 6. Composition of meaning 7. Modifier as a head 3.1. Modifications We will adopt the following basic framework adopted by Sag-Wasow (1999) and make the following three modifications to describe our data. We will treat sugiru as a modifier, hence it is a head and it has the following complements. 1. Adjectives: atsu-sugiru 'too hot' 2. Verbs: nomi-sugiru drink too much' The syntactic bracketing of yukkurito nomi-sugiru 'drink too slowly' should be ( ( yukkurito nomu) sugiru) and ( too ( drink slowly) ), with an adverb slowly and a verb drink forming a verb phrase drink slowly. By Head Feature Convention the meaning of sugiru as a head is carried over to the top of the sentence."]},{"title":"98","paragraphs":["3.2. Viewpoint as an Intentional Notion As is pointed out in Nakamura (1997), a property or action of someone or something being an excessive degree, frequency and so forth is judged by a speaker as a default value but sometimes the judgement is given by a subject of a sentence as the following example shows. (14) Taroo-wa osake-o sukosi nomi-sugita to hansei sita. Taro-Top sake-Acc a little drink too much reflected T̀aro regretted that he drank too much.' If we introduce such an intentional notion as a viewpoint, the issue can be handled nicely. As an extensional default value it has a speaker as extension but it can be a subject given another index. 3.3. Non-adjacency Problem We will begin by looking at the following example. (15) Taroo-wa eki-ni hayaku tuki-sugi ta. Taroo-Top station to early arrive excessively Past Taro arrived at a station too early.' As was pointed out, there is no adjacency relationship between a modifier and modifiee in the case of sugiru. But the syntactic non-adjacency problem can be handled successfully if sugiru is treated as a verb phrase modifier and is given such type as < <e,t>, <e, t>>. The bracketing of the phrase hayaku tuki-sugiru should be ( hayaku tuki) sugiru)). This corresponds to English ( too ( arrive early)), not (( too early) (arrive)). A verb phrase should be given a type <e,t>. As long as function-argument relationship holds between hayaku and tuku, modifier-modifiee relationship also holds at no matter how distant places the two elements occur syntactically. Below is shown the syntactic diagram of .hayaku eki ni tukisugiru meaning 'arrive at a station too early'. Sugiru is treated as a head and a preceding verb phrase hayaku ekini tuku 'arrive at a station early' is treated as a modifiee. [ HEAD [2] MOD [1] shows this relationship. On the left is a tree diagram of hayaku ekini tuku and on the right is a tree diagram of atu-sugiru.

The following is both syntactic and semantic information of sugiru.

Thus, COMPS <\\t> means that the complement position is saturated. 2. RELN (PASS, EXCEED A DESIRABLE DEGREE OF, TIME SPAN, etc....)"]},{"title":"100","paragraphs":["RELATION abbreviated as RELN bears a substantial part of semantic information. Closely following the criticism against Sense Enumeration Lexicon advocated by Pustejovsky (1995), we do not distinguish the verbal meaning 'pass' between the intensifier meaning of sugiru (e.g. toori-sugiru pass' tabe-sugiru 'eat too much' tataki-sugiru lap too frequently'). As shown above, we will store such various meanings of sugiru under the single item of sugiru. 3. VIEW POINT SPEAKER/ NON-SPEAKER: As an extensional default value it has a speaker as extension but can be a subject of a sentence if given another index. Below is shown a diagram of sake o nomu which has IMPLICIT ADJUNCT as semantic information: IMPLICIT ADJUNCT [QUANTITY, PLACE, TIMEPOINT< TIME SPAN, FREQWUENCY, etc. ] means that the bold faced implicit adjunct QUANTITY has a priority among several possible implicit adjuncts.

RESIDUAL PROBLEMS So far we have discussed mainly on the problems of implicit adjuncts stored in \"verbs\" in our lexicon. It is highly possible that the kinds of implicit adjuncts stored in a verb vary from a verb to a verb and that an adjunct given a priority status also differs from a verb to averb. An indefiniteness of a subject noun phrases slightly touched upon discussing the sentence in (13) also poses an intriguing issue yet to be solved. This may also be related to the problem of quantification over events.
