In this paper I propose that the neutralization effect at surface is not a result of a phonological process at an intermediate level in serial derivation, but due to a constraint requiring the integrity of the morphological constituent: EDGE-INTEGRITY. It is argued that this is not reducible to an alignment constraint, but a genuine faithfulness constraint on the edge of a morphological constituent. The putative opacity related with the coda neutralization is shown to be an epiphenomenon arising from the ambisyllabic representation of a consonant at a morphological juncture, satisfying both EDGE-INTEGRITY and syllabic conditions. Consonant Copy in the Jeju dialect provides further evidence for EDGE-INTEGRITY, the only difference being that the conflict between syllabic conditions and EDGE-INTEGRITY is resolved by insertion of a copied consonant. 1\\tIntroduction Syllable structure is regulated by several different constraints. One of them is a purely prosodic requirement, and the asymmetry between onsets and codas in the syllable is well known in that respect: syllables require onsets while they permit codas at most (Ito 1986, 1989, McCarthy and Prince 1993a, Blevins 1995 and references therein). All else being equal, the best syllable structure for a given sequence N i CV2/, is (la) with the intervocalic consonant in the onset of 62.","(1)\\tNiCV2/","a.\\t","al a2\\t","b.\\tal\\t02\\tC.\\t"]},{"title":"al","paragraphs":["0'2","I\\t/\\t \\\\tI\\t \\ / 1 V1.

Everything else being equal, no evaluation yields (lc) as optimal. If syllable structure conditions dominate the morphological integrity, (la) is optimal structure. If the ranking is reversed such that the morphological structure takes a priority over the syllable well-formedness conditions, (lb) is optimal. The representation itself is more complex than the other two, too.","However, (1c) satisfies both sets of constraints to a certain degree: the intervocalic consonant serves as an onset of a2 : (lc) fares better than (lb) with regard to ONSET requirement. It also respects morphological structure and its integrity by being linked with the morpheme with which it is affiliated: the structure (lc) satisfies morphological integrity better than (la) in this sense.","In this paper I present a case study in which the ambisyllabic structure in (lc) is forcefully chosen at the cost of simple representation to satisfy both sets of requirements: the so-called overapplication of Coda Neutralization in Korean. I will show that the conflicting constraints on syllable structure from prosody and morphology are resolved by finding a compromise. In the optimality theoretic 135 analysis, it will be shown that the ambisyllabic structure in (1c) also provides us with a means to avoid the problem of phonological opacity, which arises from the interaction of phonological processes and the so-called resyllabification. I will propose a constraint, EDGE-INTEGRITY as a critical constraint regulating morphological requirements of integrity at the edges of morphological constituents. Its crucial role will be further supported by the analysis of Consonant Copy in the Jeju dialect in Korean. 2\\tOverapplication of Coda Neutralization in Korean and EDGE-INTEGRITY This section analyses the overapplication of Coda Neutralization in Korean as empirical evidence for the edge-integrity of morphological units. In 2.1 Coda Neutralization is illustrated, and a primary optimality theoretic analysis is presented. In 2.2, the overapplication of Coda Neutralization is presented and the putative opacity problem in optimality theory is raised. In 2.3, EDGE-INTEGRITY is proposed as a crucial morphology-prosody interface constraint motivating the ambisyllabic structure in (1c), and an analysis of the overapplication problem as a result of a constraint interaction is presented. 2.1 Coda Neutralization As a general background of Korean phonology, consonant and vowel inventories are illustrated in (2) and (3). Plosives show three-way contrast of laryngeal features: aspirated, tense, and plain. The coronal fricative /s/ shows two-way phonation contrast: plain vs. tense. The only liquid /1/ shows an allophonic variation, such that it is realized as lateral [1] in the coda position and [1] everywhere else.","(2) Korean Consonant Inventory","labial alveolar\\tpalatal\\tvelar glottal","dental","plosives\\tplain\\tp\\tt\\tc\\tk \\t tense\\tp'\\tt'\\tc'\\tk' \\t","aspirated\\tph\\tth ch\\tkh fricatives plain\\ts\\t h \\t","tense\\ts' nasal\\tm\\tn\\t0 liquid\\t1(r) glide\\tw\\t•","J","(3) Korean Vowel Inventory","Front\\t Back unrounded\\trounded\\tunrounded\\trounded high mid e (4)) low a The maximal syllable is (C)(G)V(C), where G stands for a glide /y/ or /w/.

What is responsible for this restricted distribution of consonants in the coda position is a feature changing process, Coda I Interestingly, there are restrictions on the word initial consonant in Korean: there is no word that begins with [0]. [1] is not allowed word initially and alternates with [n]. The sequences of [ni] and [ny] are not allowed initially such that they alternate with [i] and [y] respectively. Since they cannot be reduced as syllable initial conditions, and do not have any bearings in the proposed analysis, I will leave the issue here. 136 Neutralization, as in (5) following Sohn (1995). Simply put, obstruents lose their laryngeal feature contrast, and continuants /s, ss, c, Ch, 11/ lose their continuancy and become the coronal [t] in the coda position.

When a stem is followed by a consonant initial suffix, the stem final consonant is realized as neutralized in the coda and loses its continuant and laryngeal feature, as in (6a) and (6c).

Suppose that we have a Coda Neutralization rule as in (19). Given a form as in (20a), syllabification applies within a word in (20b), putting the word final consonant in the coda position, and the Coda Neutralization rule applies. At the next stage in (20c), resyllabification applies and the neutralized C is realized in the onset of the following vowel. Notice that the derivation is opaque (Kiparsky 1971): at surface, a neutralized segment appears in an environment that does not trigger neutralization. In a derivational model, the opacity comes from the intermediate stage of derivation, which is (20b).","The phonological opacity poses a serious problem in any non-derivation theory of phonology, including optimality theory. Considering that Optimality theory is a model subscribing to a parallel, non-derivational evaluation of constraints, there is no way to refer to the intermediate representation like (20b), in which the consonant in question appears in the coda position. To accommodate this problem, there have been several proposals in Optimality Theory, ranging from a proposal for a serial evaluation of constraints based on levels or derivational stages, local conjunction of constraints, to Sympathy analysis (116 and Mester 1997, McCarthy 1998). 2.3 EDGE-INTEGRITY and the Overapplication of Coda Neutralization The right conceptualisation of the overapplication of Coda Neutralization is that it comes from an interaction of two orthogonal constraints: one is a strong requirement from the morphological component to keep the morphological integrity of a morphological unit as transparently as possible in prosodic structure. The other is syllable well-formedness constraints. In a sequence/VC+V/, a morpheme dominating the C claims the consonant's morphological affiliation by keeping it at the edge of a prosodic unit. On the other hand, a strong prosodic condition, ONSET obscures this by relocating it in the onset of another morphological unit. The overapplication is a compromise to satisfy both requirements.","The problem is that we do not have a way to satisfy these double requirements with the constraints proposed so far. Tableau (21) shows the problem clearly. If ONSET dominates STEML/R, the candidate (a) is the winner. If STEML dominates ONSET, (b) is optimal. Considering that the candidates (c-d) violate IDENT-IO additionally, no ranking will choose either of them as a winner. There is nothing forcing the overapplication effect."]},{"title":"140","paragraphs":["It is clear from (21) that the requirement of morphological integrity cannot be reduced to alignment constraints.

EDGE-INTEGRITY is a constraint regulating segments at the edges. This captures the robust generalization that the segments at the edges of a morphological unit are protected: they are immune to phonological processes, such as epenthesis (Kang to appear). EDGE-INTEGRITY allows us to capture this by imposing a more strict faithfulness requirement on the segments at the edges.","The constraint evaluates a segment and its affiliation: it is violated if an initial or final segment of a MCat is not affiliated with a corresponding PCat's edge. Thus, the configuration in (23a) violates EDGE-INTEGRITY on two counts, since the morpheme final segment C is not affiliated with PCat i and v2, the initial segment of Mcat2, is not in the initial position of PCat 2 . The structure in (23b) does not violate EDGE-INTEGRITY at all, while (24c) violates EDGE-INTEGRITY on one count due to V2. Crucially, however, the ambisyllabic representation in (23c) fares better than (23a) with regard to EDGE-INTEGRITY, since the final C of MCat i is linked to the PCatl at the right edge, although the linking is not exclusive.","(23) N 1 C+V2/ (+ stands for a morphological boundary) a.

Crucially, the double linking of the ambisyllabic consonant in (25c) disrupts relevant prosodic edges and constitutes a violation of any relevant alignment constraint. On the other hand, it does not violate EDGE-INTEGRITY, at least at the right edge. As long as the consonant is affiliated with the morphological constituent through prosodic structure, it satisfies EDGE-INTEGRITY. Being a faithfulness constraint on the edge segments, it does not care about crisp or exclusive linking. The crucial difference of EDGE-INTEGRITY vs. STEmL/R towards the ambisyllabic structure comes from that of a faithfulness constraint vs. an alignment constraint.","To sum up, I have shown that overapplication of Coda Neutralization in Korean is well accounted for in an optimality theoretic framework without recourse to neither any serial derivation nor any 11 [ and ] represent morphological word boundaries. 12 Since epenthesis of a consonant is not an option to satisfy ONsET, I assume that DEP-I0 is undominated in this case."]},{"title":"142","paragraphs":["special mechanisms such as Sympathy, using a richer representation.

The representation makes all the relevant information transparent and available at surface.

The effect of the strong requirement to mark a morphological constituency transparently in prosodic structure is also evidenced from other processes. In this section I present the Consonant Copy in the Jeju dialect in Korean, as another piece of empirical evidence for the crucial role of EDGE-INTEGRITY. 3.1 Data The Jeju dialect in Korean shows a peculiar phonological process, the Consonant Copy, by which a morpheme/word final consonant is optionally copied and doubled when preceding a vowel initial word. The Consonant Copy applies between prefix-stem in (26), across words in compounds as in (27) and in phrases as in (28).

The fact that copied obstruents are tense is due to the tensification of an obstruent following another obstruent. 14 The variation is due to another phonological process: n-Epenthesis, by which an [n] is inserted preceding a high vocoid [i/y] after a consonant final word (Han 1994, Sohn 1995, Hong 1997). This process occurs in other dialects of Korean in general.

First, there is no restriction on the quality of the copied consonant or the following vowel: it applies as long as the prosodic environment is met. Second, it is evident from the examples in (26)-(28) that the consonant copy applies at the prosodic word juncture: the prosodic word final consonant is copied in the initial position of the following prosodic word.

Often the right edge of a morphological unit is disrupted due to a purely phonological requirement, ONSET. When this is satisfied by a copied segment, the crisp alignment requirement at the right edge emerges. 4\\tConclusion In this paper, I have shown that the so-called overapplication of Coda Neutralization and the Consonant Copy in the Jeju dialect in Korean are motivated by a morphology-prosody requirement to keep the integrity of morphological structure, EDGE-INTEGRITY as well as syllabic well-formedness constraints. Especially I showed that ambisyllabic representation is forcefully chosen as a compromise at the cost of a simple structure when both sets of constraints are sufficiently high ranked. I proposed that this is a case of morphologically driven ambisyllabicity. The putative problem of phonological opacity involved with Coda Neutralization was analysed as a surface effect coming from the interaction of the general edge-marking requirement and ONSET, without recourse to any special mechanism or derivation, using the ambisyllabic structure. Consonant Copy in Jeju dialect is presented as further supporting evidence for EDGE-INTEGRITY. The analysis of the consonant copy further shows that the relevance of crisp alignment requirements independent from EDGE-INTEGRITY. In particular the role of the right edge of a morphological constituent and its corresponding prosodic constituent is shown to be critical.","In the proposed analysis, EDGE-INTEGRITY plays a crucial role. It is proposed as a faithful requirement on the segments at the edges of a morphological constituent. The basic intuition is that edges of a morphological constituent are prominent, and EDGE-INTEGRITY achieves this by matching them up with the edges of prosodic structure. Its role is not restricted in syllable structure but extended to epenthesis (Kang to appear). This is one of many ways of expressing the prominence of edges of morphological units in phonology: in other word, it is one facet of phonology at the service of"]},{"title":"145","paragraphs":["morphology, by preserving morphological structure and expressing it in phonology as transparently as possible."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["My thanks go to Abby Cohn, John Whitman, and Draga Zec for their advice and help with the general idea and the preparation of this paper.
