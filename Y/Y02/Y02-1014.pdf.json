In this paper, we describe an alignment technique for extracting transfer mapping from the parallel corpus. During building our system and data collection, we observe that there are three types of translation approaches can be used. We especially focuses on Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese text lexical translation and a method for extracting transfer mappings for machine translation. 1\\tIntroduction Aligned parallel corpora have proved very useful in many tasks, including statistical machine translation (Brown et al., 1993; Wu and Ng, 1995, Chen et al., 1997; Moore, 2001) and word sense disambiguation (Chang et al., 1996; Chen and Chang, 1998).","Traditional and Simplified Chinese are two Chinese writing systems that used by Chinese-speaking communities. Since their typefaces are different, foreigners always view these two languages as a family of cognate languages. Aside from differences in typeface, their encoding schemas are also different. For the conversion of text, special utilities or tools are required for mapping the correspondence between the two schemas. At present, the methods used to undertake this mapping are far from perfect. In general, a table-conversion method is used to translate between Traditional and Simplified Chinese text. There are several problems with this method. First, correspondences between Big5 (Traditional Chinese) and GB2312 (Simplified Chinese) code schemas are not one-to-one. Thus, this method can cause mismatches in character translation. Second, the unit of processing should be words instead of morphemes since the meaning of a morpheme can be very ambiguous. Third, conventional language usage is also quite different between Traditional and Simplified Chinese. To tackle these difficulties, it thus seems wise to acquire a set of word mappings between Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese from parallel corpora automatically.","This paper discusses the issues mentioned above, and especially focuses on Traditional and Simplified Chinese text lexical translation and a method for building a synonym thesaurus meaning-translation. The character set standards used in this paper are Big5 code for Traditional Chinese and GB2312 code for Simplified Chinese; nevertheless, these issues are code-independent. Simply categorized, there are three methods for Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese conversion and translation, each of which satisfies different purposes. These include code schema conversion, word translation, and semantic translation, all of which are described in the present paper. 2\\tMotivation As the Internet and World Wide Web become increasingly popular, text documents in electronic form are becoming ever more abundant. Therefore, there is a rapidly developing demand for the translation of text between Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese. In addition, there are vast numbers of Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese texts in electronic form that require an automatic"]},{"title":"147","paragraphs":["conversion system for translation. Although several utilities and automatic conversion systems have been designed (Chang, 1998), they are far from perfect and many issues remain unsolved. Indeed, manual correction is typically required when these systems are used. Since the volume of documents is growing rapidly, however, manual correction is not a feasible long-term solution. There is thus an urgent need for a reliable automatic conversion system to deal with Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese texts. 3\\tObservation In the process of building our system and collecting data, we observe that there are three types of translation approaches can be used. These include code schema conversion, word translation, and semantic translation. 3.1 Code Schema Conversion is not enough While there are many encoding schema for Chinese character set, we have focused on Big5 and GB2312 because they are most commonly used. Table 1 illustrate how \"4\" and \"5C\", which have the same typeface and meaning in both Traditional and Simplified Chinese, are encoded differently in Big5 and GB2312. Many Traditional and Simplified Chinese characters can be conversed simply apply to this approach which building a kind of code conversion table. It is the easiest approach for Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese translation. We find out there is many off-the-shelf utilities can help us. For example, Emurasoft (www.emurasoft.com) provides software named EmEditor, which can converse various Chinese code schema. The Microsoft® Word 2000 Traditional Chinese edition, which built-in a Traditional Chinese and. Simplified Chinese conversion function. These software can do this kind of work well.","Table 1 The sample of Character Coding between Traditional and Simplified Chinese.","Chinese Character Big5 Character Set Code GB2312 Character Set Code Eri OxA4A4 OxD6D0","OxA4E5 OxCEC4","Unfortunately, using the code conversion table approach cannot satisfy all translation requirements. Table 2 is a sample of code conversion between Big5 and GB. We can observe that there is a one-to-many relationship between GB and Big5, especially when converting from GB to Big5. Table 3 shows that after word combination, translating from Simplified Chinese into Traditional Chinese only using the code conversion table approach will lead to lexeme mismatches. In Table 3, the translation of","./aao-yao)\" to \".,(1ao-yao)\" is correct.

Also, \"151ft(hi-shu)\" and \"J-1,(ji-hu)\" are not translated correctly.

For instance, in Example 1, \"aktr is the name for Microsoft® in Chinese, but this term is followed by another character that leads to incorrect word division and a resulting mismatch. The sentence marked with an asterisk in Example 1 illustrates this issue. The following is a detailed description of the process by which the mismatch occurs.

The connections satisfying each condition are given the same probability value determined by maximal likelihood estimation (MLE). For instance, if there are k connections in a sample of n candidates (s, 1). such that Sim(s, t) h1 then all these candidates are given the same MLE value for LTP, i.e. t(s, = t1= k/n. Equation (Eq. 2) sums up the above discussion: t(s,t) = tl if Sim(s ,t) if h1 > Sim(s, t) -̂h2, t3 if h > Sim(s,t) ̂h3 ,2 t4 if Sim(s,t) < h3.

To this end, we define dislocation, dis for the connection (s i, t3) of the i th and j th words in S and T, to denote I - j' )-(i - )1 where i' is the position of a word s' sharing the minimum syntactic structure with s, and s' translates into t' , the j' th word in T.

A general description of the materials used in the experiments follows. Finally, the success rates are quantitatively evaluated. 5.1 The Experimental Setup We collect over 5,000 article-pairs (Traditional-Simplified Chinese pair) from news website (http://news.pchome.com.tw/) to form a small parallel corpus. The news topic we focus on Information Technique news. The experimental results obtained from the proposed algorithms are presented in this Section. The training data were used primarily to determine MLE estimates for the cases of LTP and DP. The test sentences were randomly chosen from unseen data from the same domain. 5.2 Performance Evaluation Our experiment was designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented algorithm. We used human evaluators. According to the experimental results, over 90% of the source words in test sets are connected to a target and over 90% are correct connections.
