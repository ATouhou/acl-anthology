The past 100 years was the time in which we have witnessed so many wars and so much strife among nations. One of the main causes of these tragedies was and still is language differences we use, not to mention the differences of race and not religions. A vital force bringing peace to the world is mutual understanding through the language we employ. Therefore, we cannot overemphasize the importance of language study since it is through language that we can help to create and achieve peace in the world.","Within the realm of language study, we have tremendous progress in terms of theoretical precision, clarity, insightfulness and wide-range applicability during these several decades. The Chomskyian revolution and the progress of computer science, for example, have been greatly instrumental in this respect. But on the other hand, we have experienced a great gap between several branches of language study. Even within theoretical linguistics, for example, it is quite difficult to achieve a mutual and full understanding of the goals of linguistic study. There has been, therefore, a crying need to fill the gap between the numerous areas of language researches. The annual Pacific conference has been a great help in fostering and deepening the much needed mutual understanding among the diversified language study.","This time we received 61 papers from 12 countries. The main contribution is from Asia: China, Hong Kong, India, Korea, Taiwan and Japan. The other countries include Bulgaria, Finland, France, Germany, Russia, the UK, the USA. From this list of countries we notice that the conference has established an international recognition among the various fields of language study.","Out of 61 papers we have carefully selected 42 papers. The acceptance rate is around 69 %. To be fair as far as possible, we asked at least two referees for each paper who are specialized in respective field. The topics of the contributed papers comprise almost all the fields of linguistics and their related branches: syntax (including LFG, HPSG and OT), (logical) semantics, phonetics, discourse analysis, socio-linguistics, information theory, and computer related topics.","A short history of this yearly conference would be interesting to some of the readers of the proceedings. It was on the occasion of the First Seoul International Conference on Linguistics, which was held in Seoul in the summer of 1981, that the idea of having a joint conference was seriously discussed by the Korean and Japanese linguists. The first conference was held in the winter of 1982, sponsored by the Linguistic Society of Korea, at Ehwa Women's University, Seoul. Thereafter a conference took place every two years with Korea and Japan alternating as the host nation. When we look back at the several volumes published up until 1994, we can modestly claim that the papers which appeared there reflected the state of the art. It is interesting to notice that the linguistic papers were written mainly in the framework of Montagovian semantics or GPSG and HPSG or LFG with a few exceptions of GB oriented papers. This means that the conferences have provided, especially for Japanese researchers, a good chance for publishing papers written in non-Chomskyian frameworks. The year 1994, when the conference was held in Kyoto, the Ancient Capital of Japan, was a memorable year for the present form of our conference, since it is this year that the two traditions of the Pacific Asia Conference on Formal and Computational Linguistics (PACFoCoL), which is a formal name for Korean-Japan Joint Conference on Formal Linguistics, and the Asian Conference on Language, Information and Computation (ACLIC) , merged together into a single joint conference. The first was held in Hong Kong in 1995 with a valuable addition of computational linguistics and its related field. This has been instrumental in widening the involvement from computer scientists. It was at this Hong Kong conference that the referee system was introduced, while preserving a family-like atmosphere at the same time. This has been a significant step towards improving the scholastic standard of PACLIC.","In the present conference, we are fortunate enough to be able to invite a keynote speaker, Professor Masayoshi Shibatani, who is a distinguished linguist known all over the world, who will speak on the theme of Language Typology and the Comparison of Languages.","We would like to take this opportunity to express our deep gratitude to The Japan-Korea Cultural Foundation and The Acom Company for their generous financial support, without which it would be almost impossible to stage this conference to a great success. Last but not least we would like to express our sincere thanks to The Institute of Language Teaching of Waseda University and Waseda University Media Network Center for their co-operation.","Akira Ikeya Conference Chair, PA CLIC 14 11"]},{"title":"COMMITTEE MEMBERS","paragraphs":["CONFERENCE CHAIR Akira Ikeya Toyo Gakuen University, Japan ADVISORY COMMITTEE Chu-Ren Huang Chungmin Lee Lin-Shan Lee Young-Here Lee Kim Teng Lua Byung-Soo Park Benjamin, K.
