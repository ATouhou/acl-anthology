But there is an additional pragmatic content: The speaker expresses social distance concerning the addressee. This is expressed by the honorific pronouns Sie and vows in German and French. In the Japanese example it is expressed by the following attributes: 'See [Wahlster1997] for further reference. • The honorific prefix go in front of tsugoo • The honorific adjective yoroshii • The honorific copula deshoo A Japanese utterance with the same semantic content in \\tfor example — a family context could be:","(4\\(4) itsu\\tjikan\\t_ga\\taru when\\ttime\\tNOM\\thave\\tQUE","Information about honorification is - on the one hand - necessary for the description of syntactic phenomena like honorific agreement or relative sentences and - on the other hand - necessary for correct translation. In order to understand the whole meaning of the Japanese utterances it is important to represent the different honorific attributes in the analysis structure. The information can be used to resolve zero pronominalization and topicalized structures. It is even more important for the adequate generation of the Japanese utterances. In other investigations on zero pronoun resolution in task-oriented dialogues (cf. [Siege11997]) we calculated that 23.9% of the zero pronominals can be solved using lexical pragmatic restrictions about honorification."]},{"title":"2 Honorific Forms in Japanese","paragraphs":["Honorifics in Japanese express the social relation of familiarity or distance between speaker, addressee and third persons. Consider the situation where the speaker asks if s/he returned a book to the addressee, 'did I return the book to you?'. In a familiar context (s)he would say: (5) hon book AKK kaeshita returned QUE","In a more formal situation with more social distance between speaker and addressee the utterance would be:","(6) hgoontonok\\tNgdm\\to-kaeshi-shimashita hon-returned-hon\\tka","QUE The book as belonging to the addressee is prefixed by the honorific go. The predicate gets the 'humble' extension shimashita and the question is expressed by ka.","The social relationships that can be expressed are threefold: The first one is the relation between speaker and addressee, in the above example expressed by no and ka. The second one is the relation between the speaker and the subject of the utterance, in the above example expressed by the verbal form. The third one is the relation between the speaker and other arguments in the sentence. In the above example, book (hon) gets the honorific go prefix, because it is a book belonging to the addressee being honored by the speaker.","Familiarity or distance between speaker and addressee can be expressed by verbal endings and/or the lexical choice of self-referring pronouns. Verbal endings encoding a relation of distance between speaker and addressee can be, for example, -masu, -mashita or -n-deshoo-ka. Those encoding a familiar relation can be, for example, -ru, -ta or -no. The choice of self-referring pronouns also depends on the gender of the speaker. A self-referring pronoun uttered by a woman in a familiar context could be watashi, a self-referring pronoun uttered by a woman in a distant context could be watakushi. Parallel the appropriate self-referring pronoun for a man in a familiar context would be boku, one in a distant context would be watashi. I will call the relationship of honorifics concerning the relation between speaker and addressee -290- (8) (9) AHON and give it a polarity [—AHON] for the plain form in a family context and [H-AHON] for the expressions in a context of social distance.","The social relation between the speaker and a subject that is not referring to the speaker is expressed by the lexical choice of verbs, by the expression o- VERB-ni-naru, by the honorific prefix o/go at nouns referring to entities belonging to the subject and by the lexical choice of pronominals. I will call this relation between speaker and subject SHON. A relation of distance between speaker and subject (where the subject is the addressee or a third person) can be \\tfor example \\texpressed by the verb irassharu (to go), while in a familiar situation the verb iku with the same semantic content is used. This is expressed by [+SHON] and [—SHON], respectively. Possible referring expressions for the second and third person can be, for example, sochira and X-san in relations of distance and kimi or X-kun in relations of familiarity.","The third relation is the one between speaker and objects in the sentence (other than subject). I will call this relation OHON. It is expressed by the lexical choice of these entities and by the honorific prefixes o and go."]},{"title":"3 Interaction of Different Kinds of Honorification in Japanese","paragraphs":["The relationship of the speaker and the addressee can be one of three possible constellations: 1. The addressee is the subject of the utterance. 2. The speaker is the subject of the utterance. 3. A third person is the subject of the utterance.","When the addressee is the referent of the sentence subject, the relationships AHON and SHON must have the same polarity. In these cases, in a sentence with AHON there must also be SHON. In the situation, where the speaker is the subject of the utterance, (s)he uses humble forms of the verbs (a matter of lexical choice), if the AHON relation is a distant one. An example is mairu (to go). In this case, both relationships (SHON and AHON) are concerned. In many cases utterances contain multiple honorification as can be seen in the following example: (7) watakushi\\t"]},{"title":"Aim\\t","paragraphs":["o-denwa\\titashi-mashi-ta telephone\\tdo(hon)-hon-Past","The verbal stem itashi expresses subject honorification, the verbal ending mashi and the pronoun watakushi express addressee honorification.","Japanese honorification undergoes different kinds of restrictions. The first kind to mention is called. 'pragmatic agreement' by [Pollard and Sag1994]. There must be agreement between the SHON honorification of the subject and the verb, as the following examples show: watashi\\tja\\tsensei\\tni\\to-denwa I\\tNOMprofessor\\tDAT\\ttelephone","itashi-mashi-ta do(humble-shon)-ahon-Past *sensei","Afid M\\twatashi\\tni\\to-denwa","professor\\t I\\tDAT\\ttelephone","itashi-mashi-ta","do(humble-shoe)-ahon-Past —291-- (10) sensei\\t watashi\\tni\\to-denwa professor\\tNgaM\\tI\\tDAT\\ttelephone","nasai-mashi-ta do(honorific-shon)-ahon-Past","The pronoun watashi can be used with a humble verb form, but not the honorific noun sensei.

For the sociolinguistic viewpoint see for example [Ide1986], [Coulmas1987], [Hori1986], [Hill et a/.1986] and [Hanaoka McGloin1976]. The authors state that honorification is an expression of the social distance or 'perceived distance' ([Hill et a/.1986]) between speaker and addressee and the belonging to a social group ([Coulmas1987]). They investigate the relation between gender and the use of honorificational expressions ([Hori1986]). Examples for a grammatical investigation of Japanese honorification are [Ikeya1983], [Kuno1973], [Harada1976] and [Hori1992]. [Hori1986] uses honorification for a definition of 'subject' in Japanese. [Kuno1973] classifies honorification concerning style and honorification concerning respect. In our approach, these classes are AHON and SHON, respectively. He shows that there are differences of grade in various expressions of honorification. [Harada1976] gives a classification of honorificational forms that at first sight seems complementary to ours. It can be seen in figure 1. A closer look shows that the difference is only a question of naming. Haradas 'Subject honorifics' is [-I-SHON] in our approach, the 'Object honorifics' is [-SHON] and the 'Performative honorifics' would correspond to our [+AHON]. What we call [OHON], turns into [SHON], if the entity is used as a subject in the utterance. [Ikeya1983] gives a GPSG account for honorification, where [+SHON] and [-SHON] (called OHON in his approach) are head features, with the head feature principle accounting for the agreement restrictions on subject honorification. [Gunji1987] also gives examples for syntactic restrictions on honorification and introduces HON as a head feature.","The machine translational viewpoint is shown by [Dohsaka1990]. Dohsaka describes, how information about honorification can be used in the machine translation system to resolve zero pronominal references to human entities. He builds up a model of social relations during processing the dialogue, where the pragmatic relations honorification, speaker's point of view and territory of information is on the one hand —292— Holorifics","Propositional\\tPerformative","honorifics\\thonorifics 1\\t1","Subject\\tObject","honorifics\\thonorifics o-hanasi ni nar-u,etc.\\to-hanasi su-ru,etc.\\thanasi-mas-u,etc. Figure 1: Classification of honorifics by Harada extracted from the dialogue and on the other hand restricts the interpretation of zero pronominals in the dialogue. This approach shows that the extraction of information about honorification from the dialogue is urgently needed for the interpretation of zero pronominals."]},{"title":"5 Japanese Honorification in HPSG","paragraphs":["[Pollard and Sag1994] analyze honorification as a pragmatic fact. They describe the problem as 'pragmatic agreement' and introduce a relation owe — honour in the BACKGR feature: {BACKGR RELAT ION owe — honour HONORER\\t1 HONORED\\t2 POLARITY\\t1/0 }","Still, the approach lacks for the fact that there are different kinds of honorification as we described above. It describes only subject honorification. [Green1997] elaborates the CONTEXT feature and introduces information about social ranking of the participants. We would, though, propose to leave the inference of the social relations to other components of, e.g., a machine translation system. The reason is that all necessary information is not always directly accessible in the analysis procedure. An example is given by [Coulmasl987]: The secretary in a company is asked by an employee, when the boss comes back. He or she would answer: \\t raishuu\\tkaette\\tirasshaimasu next week\\tcome back\\tSHON If the same secretary would be asked by a customer, the answer would be: \\t (16) raishuu\\tkaette\\tmairimasu next week\\tcome back\\t-SHON","In this example, we would represent the fact that the secretary honors the boss in the first example, but not in the second one. The interpretation of the complex social relations must be left to a module that has access to the information about the actual social relations of the participants in the context.","To account for the fact that Japanese honorification has more dimensions, we propose the following CONTEXT feature structure: (15) —293-- C — INDS","[1]","[ SPEAKER [2] ADDRESSEE [3] {BACKGR _","obj — honor — rel HONORER [2] HONORED [1] POLARITY + _} CONTENT1INDEX CONTEXT","SPEAKER [1] L ADDRESSEE [2]","{- addr – honor – rel\\t- subj – honor – rel HONORER\\t[1]\\tHONORER HONORED\\t[2] '\\tHONORED POLARITY\\t+I–\\tL POLARITY_","obj – honor – rel [1] HONORER [3] HONORED +/– _ POLARITY C – INDS BACKGR","The C-INDS contain indices for speaker and addressee, as proposed by [Pollard and Sag1994]. The value of BACKGR is a difference list that sums up the occuring honorificational relations in the utterance. Each occuring relation gets classified into addr-honor-rel, subj-honor-rel and obj-honor-rel. The HONORER is co-indexed with the speaker in all cases here. This must be different in cases of indirect speech that we will describe later. The HONORED value is co-indexed with the addressee in C-INDS in the addr-honor-rel case, with the subject's CONTENT.INDEX value in the subj-honor-rel case and with the CONTENT.INDEX value of the argument that introduces the relation in the obj-honor-rel case.","The relations all get a value of POLARITY, to account for the fact that there can be forms that are honorific, humble or neutral. A negative SHON polarity, e.g., reflects the situation where the speaker or a third person that socially belongs to the innner circle of the speaker is the subject of the utterance. [McGloin1987] describes this situation sociolinguistically as \"positive politeness\", because it expresses social closeness.","The question is: how does the information enter into the BACKGR? Let us start with the obj-honor-rel. This relation is encoded in the nouns that express honorification. The entry for o-uchiawase, e.g., contains:","A verb that has restrictions on the honorification of its subject, contains the following in its lexical entry:","CONTENTIKEY.ARG — 1\\t[1] SPEAKER [2] 1 ADDRESSEE [3] C — INDS { BACKGR","subj — honor — rel HONORER\\t[2] HONORED [1] POLARITY\\t+ _} CONTEXT","If it happens to be the case that an entity with an obj-honor-rel in its BACKGR becomes the subject of the sentence, the mother node must get the subj-honor-rel from the predicate, identified with the index of that entity. It is, though, necessary to prove the honorificational restrictions on predicate and subject. Since this is a syntactic process, we decided on representing honorification on the syntactic level, too. [Gunji1987} gives reasons for the syntactic approach. He describes in his JPSG-account of Japanese syntax honorification as a kind of agreement: \"Since Japanese does not have syntactic agreement phenomena such as number, person,etc., the honorification system is more or less a counterpart.\" He introduces the feature HON as a head-feature (with values +/-), underlying the head feature principle. This accounts for the fact that the value of the HON-feature passes from the head to the mother node. Gunji's HON, though, is only a representation of subject honorification. Honorification concerning the addressee or objects is not considered. The values of SHUN can be either plus or minus, but neutral forms also exist.","Therefore we expanded the syntactic part of the representation of honorification. The lexical entries get a HEAD feature called FORMAL: [FORMAL AHON"]},{"title":"+I-11","paragraphs":["SHON +","Only the connection of representing honorification on the syntactic and contextual level makes it possible to account for all phenomena. The pure syntactic representation cannot account for the representation of honorificational relations between speaker and addressee, for OHON and for multiple honorifications, while the pure contextual representation cannot account for the syntactic restrictions on subjects and relative sentences. The CONTEXT level gives information about felicity of an utterance, while the CAT level gives information about syntactical correctness of an utterance. For honorification in Japanese, we need both. With the fundamental concept of HPSG, the sign, it is possible to incorporate both levels of linguistic analysis.","Being a HEAD feature, the value of FORMAL is passed up from head daugthers to mother daughters. A honorific noun therefore contains the value SY NSEMI LOCAL1 CAT I HEAD FORMAL' SHONpius, as well as a verb with subject honorification. For Japanese, we set up the principle of subject honorification: In a honorific lexical structure, the FORM ALISHON value of the HEAD is identical to the FORM ALISHON value of the subject's HEAD and the polarity of the subj-honor-rel in BACKGR. The values of the subject's CONTENTIINDEX and the HONORED of the sub j-honor-rel in BACKGR are identical.","This principle accounts for the compatibility of the information on the syntactic (CAT) and contextual (CONTEXT) levels. While the agreement of subject and verb is checked on the syntactic level, the contextual level gets the information on subject honorification and links it to the semantic entities.","Honorification concerning the addressee inside the sentence is seen as a purely syntactic restriction. As non-addressee-honorific and addressee-honorific verbs may combine, it is not useful to introduce the relation into the context during processing the sentence. The syntactic restriction is needed for relative 2 See also [Ikeya1983]. sentences, as shown above. At the top-most node (utterance-type in our grammar of spoken language), the addr-honor-rel is introduced into the CONTEXT' BACKGR. Its polarity is co-indexed with the value of HEAD – DTRISYNSE11/11LOCALICATIHEADI FORMAL1AHON. The HONORER is co-indexed with the speaker, the HONORED is co-indexed with the addressee. Also here it can be seen that it is meaningful to represent the honorification on both levels. Inside the sentence, it is a purely syntactic relation, but outside, it is a contextual relation.","While the syntactic information goes up the tree via the head feature principle, the contextual information underlies different principles. The HPSG principle of contextual consistency ([Pollard and Sag1994],p.333) says: \"The CONTEXT (BACKGR value of a given phrase is the union of the CONTEXT (BACKGR values of the daughters.\"","This must be modified for our approach, since the head-subject rule takes the CONTEXT (BACKGR value of its head daughter. It can be hold for all structures besides the head-subject rule and the utterance rule, as shown before. Let us take an example for multiple honorification, 7, that shall be repeated here as 17:","(17) watakushi\\tqa\\to-denwa\\titashi-mashi-ta INOM\\ttelephone\\tdo(hon)-hon-Past","The self-referring pronoun watakushi introduces an obj-honor-rel with POLARITY minus, where HONORER and HONORED are co-indexed with the speaker and the CONTENTIINDEX. This is passed up the tree in the head-complement structure of watakushi ga. At the same time, the values of HEAD1FORM AL are introduced: AHON plus and SHON minus. As particles are assumed to be heads (see [Siegell999]), they must take their SHON value from their objects (which is defined in the lexical type of particles).","The honorific form o-denwa itashi-mashi-ta introduces a subj-honor-rel in the context with POLARITY minus. The HONORED is co-indexed with the subject's CONTENT1INDEX. The HEAD( FORMAL values are the same as the ones of watakushi. The principle of subject honorification sets up the restrictions for the predicate's subject. As this is found in watakushi ga, the HEAD1FORM AL values are unified and the subj-honor-rel is introduced. The utterance-rule introduces an addr-honor-rel with POLARITY plus, since the value of HEAD(FORMAL(AHON is plus.","This was an example of the special case where the speaker is the subject. Another example with the addressee being the subject is:","(18) anata you NOM o-denwa telephone AKK kudasai-mashi-ta do(shon)-ahon-Past","All three types of honorificational relations are introduced here: subject honorification by the addressee-refering pronoun anata, object honorification by the honorific noun o- denwa and addressee honorification by the -mashita ending of the verb.

An effect for the machine translation system is that lexical pragmatic restrictions for zero pronominals can be directly accounted for in the analysis.
