Employing the features allows the further specification of combinatory restrictions in natural languages. I show also that by assigning higher-order categories to words, such irregular expressions as \"ago\" and \"last\" and controversial constructions such as the formal subject \"it,\" \"tom\" constniction and subject raising can be analyzed only through the rule of functional application. Flat categories are assigned to Japanese verbs for their \"scrambling' nature. These are demonstrated on a parser working on Web pages. 1. Classical Categorial Grammar In classical categorial grammar, categories are defined as follows. (1)\\ta. Any primitive category is a category. b. IfA and B are categories, then AB and B\\A are categories. The rule (1b) is recursively applied. In categorial grammar, two or three primitive categories are usually employed. I show a list of categories using the three primitive categories, N, NP, and S."]},{"title":"category\\ttraditional name\\texpression","paragraphs":["NP\\S (=IV)\\tIntransitive Verb\\tJohn walks NP/N\\tDeterminer\\tthe dog (NP\\S) /NP\\trfransitive Verb\\tJohn loyea Mary N/N (=A)\\tAdjective\\thig dog IV/IV\\tAuxiliary Verb\\tgan walk A/A\\tAdverb\\tvery big IV\\IV (=ADP)\\tAdverb\\twalk slowly ADP/ADP\\tAdverb\\tvery slowly S/S\\tAdverb\\tprobably he walks ADP/NP\\tPreposition\\ta letter"]},{"title":"frail","paragraphs":["John TV/NP\\tPreposition\\trun in the park (SAS)/S\\tConjunction\\tMary walks if John walks S/S\\tConjunction\\tMary knows if John walks Two expressions are concatenated by the functional application rule.","(2) Functional Application : a.

All the expressions in the grammar are generated by the rule of functional application. 2. Categorial Grammar reinforced with features Here, I present a version of Categorial Grammar reinforced with two kinds of features including features subcategorizing nouns and noun phrases, features subcategorizing sentences, directional features of \"f---\" and \"--p\" and other operational features for negation, copying, adding and deleting. These features will be shown and explained along with extended categories. Now, the basic categories are defined as sets of subcategorizing features, and there are two groups of basic categories, noun phrase categories and sentential categories. 2.1 nouns and noun phrases Unlike many versions of Categorial Grammar, the categories N and NP are basically the same and merely differentiated by the presence of the features \"p\" and \"d\". All nouns and noun phrases has the feature \"N.\" (\"N' hereafter refers to a feature, not a category.) The features are noted as follows. feature\\texpressions having the feature"]},{"title":"N\\t","paragraphs":["all nouns and noun phrases p\\tall nouns and noun phrases that can be a subject or an object d\\tall nouns and noun phrases with determiners, pronouns and proper nouns sg\\t(third person) singular nouns The following are examples of noun phrase categories and expressions.

All sentential categories have the feature \"S\" as one of its members. S","\\t all sentences q \\tquestion The following are expressions of categories of sentence. No lexical items have a sentential category. (S present)\\tHe walks, They love dogs (S q present)\\twhether he walks, who she loves 2.3 verbs All categories but noun phrases and sentences are derived from basic categories and they are categories of functional type. They take an expression of some category and give an expression of another category. They are functions from a set of categories to another set of categories. Derived categories can contain operational features. Intransitive verbs or verb phrases take a noun phrase on its left side and give a category of sentence. Therefore, they are functions from categories of noun phrase to categories of sentence. The intransitive verb runs has a category that combines with a singular noun phrase to give a category of sentence with present tense. runs\\tN p sg)(S present) The first parenthesized part in the category, \"(<---- N sg p)\" expresses the condition of the category runs takes as its argument. It requires that the argument come on the left side, and that it have the features \"N,\" \"p,\" and \"sg.\" Note that more than one category can satisfy the condition. The category \"(N sg p d)\" as well as the category \"(N sg p)\" satisfies the requirement. When the condition is satisfied, runs gives the sentential category \"(S present)\". he \\t runs (N sg p d)","\\t (<— N p sg)(S present) (S present","Contrastively, walk has a slightly different category. The operational feature \"—\" expresses the negative requirement that the input category should not have the specified subcategorizing feature which follows \"—.\" The rule of functional application is extended as categories are. It consists of two processes, the checking or matching process for argument or input categories, and the yielding process for output categories. This operational feature operates in the checking process. \"(<---- N p —sg)\" can be satisfied by \"(N p)\" and \"(N p d)\" as its input category. walk\\tN p —sg)(S present)","A transitive verb of English takes a noun phrase or a sentence or other expressions on the right side and gives a category of intransitive verb. loves","\\t (—> N p)\\tN p sg)(S present)) know","\\t (—> S)\\tN p —sg) (S present)) he loves dogs is given a category of sentence as (3) shows.","(3)\\the\\t loves","\\t dogs (NPdsg)","\\t (---* N ((4— N p sgXS present)) (S present) 2.4 adjectives and determiners Adjectives look for nouns on the right side and give the same category as the nouns. The category of an adjective is expressed as follows. N —d) good The operational feature \"@\" means that the input category should copied and pasted as the output category. Determiners are like adjectives but they add some subcategorizing features to the output category. The operational feature \"+\" is ignored and does not wok in the process of checking the input category, but it adds the subcategorizing feature following it to the output category.

How something behaves can be explained by what internal structure it has. How and whether A and B combine can be explained by their internal structures. This \"decomposing\" tactic can successfully give proper categories to irregular expressions such as ago and next. The expression ago is usually classified as an adverb but behaves more like a preposition but it takes the noun phrase not on the right but left hand. The category of ago is like that of an ordinary preposition except that the directional feature is not \"-*\" but \" 4-\" for the object noun phrase.

Web-based CG Parser I developed a web-based parser employing the Categorial Grammar discussed above using DHTML and VBScript. It is accessible at http://www.izavc.tohoku-galcuin..acjp/—futoduto.html. The parser on the web page, after your selecting words by double-click and clicking the \"parse\" button, displays the parsing tree. Unlike many other grammars, Categorial Grammar, with its simple but firm combination principle called functional application, can be easily coded. Checking process of the input category and the calculation of the output process are the main parts of the scripting. The scripting of the parsing process itself is the simplest that can show the efficiency and effectiveness of the grammar. No hierarchic relations among subcategorizing features are assumed in the program. Anyone can add words and categories and test the parsing.","REFERENCES Montague, Richard, 1973, \"The Proper Treatment of Quantification in Ordinary English,\" Approaches to Natural Language pp.221-242, ed. by J.
