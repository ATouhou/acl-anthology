Compare Sachi wa nihon ye kaerimashita (Sachi wa to Japan returned) with Sachi ga nihon ye kaerimashita which in some cases (more cases than with ẁa') suggests that Sachi is unique in her returning, or at least that Sachi makes up a complete list of (relevant) people who have returned. This may be seen more easily if the predicate is one which demands uniqueness.

Only individual preferences were noted, hence, in this paper, a sentence may be said to be 'better' than another with little further qualification. Further qualification was not given by subjects of the survey mainly because they were not confident to do so. Translations are for the most part literal but neither stylised nor complete for that would be to beg the question. Gabbay san ga ichiban yatsu hito desu2 is preferred. Furthermore, not only is dare ga sonno use wo iimashita, ka? (Who wa such a lie told?) a much better formed question than the ẁa' form but to either, the response Jitsuo ga iimashita (Jitsuo ga told [it]) is better formed than Jitsuo wa iimashita, ). Unagi-Bun: to say Watashi wa piza (I wa pizza) can be acceptable, maybe meaning 'I want a pizza', whereas the -a' form Watashi ga piza is apparently less useable. Use of g̀a', if not meaning that one is identical with a pizza seems acceptable more in cases where a question 'Dare ga piza.' is asked. :3. Wa has a sense of making a comparison that it would appear ga lacks. Kore wa shiroi keredomo are wa kuroi (This wa white but that wa black) or with conjunction Kore wa shirokute are wa, kuroi (This wa white[ing]'3 that wa black) a comparison is welcomed. With the use of ga however the first was said to be very strange and Kore ga shirokute are ga kuroi was said to sound like what teacher might say to a student of Japanese who had failed to understand the difference between s̀hiroi' and k̀uroi'. The g̀a' form of Motosan wa shinda (Mr Moto wa (lied) seems slightly preferred. But the ẁa' form is likely to be expected to continue: keredomo Osakisan wa [mada] ikite iru ( ... but Osakisan wa [still] alive) It is assumed here that this type of comparison is brought on by a mechanism based on meaning of wa rather than one based on the meaning of the predicate. Here is a different class of comparison that is assumed here brought on by the meaning of the predicate: 'Also: Yoshiko ga inottomo uruwa,shii onna (Ia etc.. The gerund beini,g used where English uses 'and'. In English too, e.g. 'Peter running lane","walked'.

(Yuji running is but hurrying is not) The thought being that it is wa that seems best for such sentences. 4. Kingyo ga iru (Goldfish ga is, i.e. there is a goldfish) which seems a little preferred to its ‘wa' form Of the . wa,' form was said strange, but acceptable if continued by something like keredomo inu wa nai' ( • • • but dog wa not.

Further, it seems that ga, is for the most part not used with a negative. ano hito wa nihonjin ja nai (that person wa Japanese is not) being held in much preference to its ẁa' form."]},{"title":"2 Proposed solution","paragraphs":["2.1 Philosophical basis The most inaccessible term within the following philosophical basis is the term 'thought'. The logical counterpart of the term 'thought' in this paper is the term 'topic' or 'world'. tfse of ẁorld' here is distinct from use in theories of necessity.","At any point in a conversation a speaker has a variety of thoughts available to him. Sentences are intended to convey thoughts and to Illanipulate the thoughts of interlocutors. It is left open in this paper how the intentions of a speaker relate to the meanings of his words. However, sometimes the intent of the speaker is strongly linked with the meaning.","We take a use of wa as the speaker intending or meaning to emphasise the predicate. We take a use of ga as the speaker intending to emphasise the subject. In order to model this we read a sentence like A wa B as something like: (1) Any thought involving A must be a thought involving B. We read a sentence like A ga B as: (2) Any thought involving B must be a thought involving A. Conditions on what thoughts the interlocutor may have will vary the affect of such an instruction. Our logic shall model this by means of a modal logic where the possible worlds (or topics) are meant to represent thoughts relevant to the context. 2.2 Basic semantics Let\\tbe first order language containing no n 1-ary function symbols, an existence predicate and the symbols q and 0, we define a context to be the triplet C = (TV, L, V) where Definition 2.1 1. W is a set of worlds.","2. L is a mapping from 1/V into the powerset of r. Let 1„„ denote the subset of ,C assigns to .","3. A is a set of functions that assigns to each world a valuation. Let f u, be the valuation assigned to w, then for every n-ary predicate symbol P of 1,, f,(P) is a set of n-tuples of constants in L.","Intuitively a context is a set of topics (thoughts) relevant to the conversation. Each topic contains relevant constants (people) and predicates. W is the set of topics, L says who and what predicate is relevant to each topic, and V says what is the case in each topic. Definition 2.2 An assignment a, on a context C, is a mapping from the variables and constants off, into the set of constants of L such that If constant a is in 1, of a w E 147 E C (i.e. is relevant at w), then a(a) is also in G.","says to what each variable and constant refers. For the most part it is as if we use, say,","Yuukisan's name to represent Yuukisaii, in this case the name Ỳuuki' is assigned itself. We define when a formula of is satisfied by an assignment a at a world w. Definition 2.3","1. P(x i ...x„) is satisfied by a at w when all predicate and constant symbols of P(x1 are in 1„, and (a(x i ) ...a(x„)) is an n-tuple\\tassigns to P","2. --a is satisfied by a at w when all predicate and constant symbols of a are in i„, and Ka (x i ) ...a(x„)) is not an n-tuple\\tassigns to P","3. - V /3 is satisfied by a at 'w when all predicate and constant symbols of a and /3 are in 1„, and either a is satisfied at w or q is satisfied at w 4. Similar definitions may easily be derived for the other truth functional connectives.","5. q a is satisfied by a at w when all predicate and constant symbols of a are in 1„, and a is satisfied at every world in W.","6. A:ra is satisfied by a at 1L when all predicate and constant symbols of a are in 1„ and Axa is satisfied by some a' at w such that a' is x-alternate to a.","7. If a and b are constants then a = b is satisfied by a at w when a(a) and a(b) are in 1, and a(a) = a(b).","We shall use a notion of truth that is different from the 'satisfied at every world' notion. Our notion of truth is defined as follows: Definition 2.4","1. a is true in (W, L, V) when a is satisfied at all w E W that contain all the constant and predicate symbols appearing in a and there is such a w E W.","2. a is false in (W, L, V) when n is not satisfied at all w E W that contain all the constant and predicate symbols appearing in (v and there is such a w E W. A sentence is true if it is satisfied in every topic (world) where it is relevant (all its constants and predicate symbols are part of that world). 2.3 Simple subject-predicate sentences using wa and ga First we define new operators into our language. Definition 2.5","• If p is a formula containing x as a free variable then q p a is satisfied by a at 'w when w satisfies ]..c(p and a is satisfied at every world in W that satisfies Ax p.","• If a is a constant then q a a is satisfied by a at w when w satisfies az, = a and a is satisfied at every world in W that satisfies ]x = a. For example if a is a name then q a cv is satisfied at w when (-1, is satisfied in every topic at which a is relevant. Definition 2.6","• 'A wa F' will translate as ]?1E1,(p, where a is the appropriate formalisation of the clause .4 and p is an appropriate formalisation of the clause F (where the free variable u is used, where necessary, as a marker for the subject) .","• A ga F will translate as 3u q ,,,u = a, where is an appropriate formalisation of the clause F.","We now try to formalise some aspect of the context. The intuition is that, in conversation, some thoughts (topics) should not be broken down any further, these characterise the context. For example an 'ordering food' context is characterised by the waiter being unable to break down any further a thought involving a customer and his order, nor should he think of the customer ordering something different (once the order has been placed).","Definition 2.7 A set of formulas\\trepresent a singular concept when there is some topic w such that 1.

We can say that ǹi' here is forcing ẁatashi' not to be singular, instead we must consider ẁatashi' plus some extra constants, then 'Ili; forces further predication to be on only these extra constants (e.g. that one of them is a house). Thus we can read ẁatashi ni wa ie ga aril, In every watashi-topic 4 there exists a house where the ni' forces the house and the ẁatashi' to be distinct. Now, since we are dealing with whether watashi' is singular or not we must use ẁa'. 2.5 Semantic Results We will now look the predictions this theory makes on the truth conditions of some sentences. 1.\\t• ẁatashi wa piza' formalises as ]u q watashi[piza(u)].","• If ]u q wataslii[Piza(u)] is satisfied at w then there is a u which satisfies, in every world where ẁatashi' is relevant, p̀iza(u)'. 4 1n every topic in which ẁatashi' is relevant. That is, every world w where ẁatashi' is in","• If we assume that ẁatashi' represents a singular concept then we obtain the result that ẁatashi' is a pizza. However suppose ẁatashi' is not singular, say if we are in a restaurant and the context demands that every person be considered with respect to what he ordered. The claim is that the notion of singular topics formalises the effect context can have on such sentences.","• It follows that there is an object u in w which satisfies p̀iza( t)' in every world where ẁatashi' is relevant. In particular it satisfies it at w.","• Note that since ẁatashi' is not singular it need not be . watashi' that satisfies p̀iza(u)' in every workl where ẁatashi' is relevant. In the case of ẁatashi' not being singular watashi wa piza' means something like 'I have something to do with a pizza'. We can say (but we need not) that the idiom demands that watashi,b} be singular where b is something distinct (and maybe even owned by) ẁatashi'.","2.\\t• ẁatashi ga piza' is formalised as ]uopiza[u\\twatashi]","] uo piza[ u = watashi] is satisfied at w then there is a it which satisfies, in• every world where ]xpiza(x) is satisfied, 'a = watashi'.","• Assume that p̀iza,' is singular. So, by the definition of singular topic, ẁatashi' satisfies p̀iza,(x)'. Also it follows that ẁatashi' satisfies 'piza(x)' in every world where ẁatashi' is relevant (from Def 2.7). • Therefore particular ẁatashi' satisfies p̀iza()' in w.","• Thus we obtain the peculiar meaning that I am identical with a pizza. If Aza' is not singular then the result is much the same as for ẁatashi wa piza'.","• Where neither ẁatashi' nor p̀iza' are singular there is little difference, given by this semantics, between wa and ga. We would characterise the context of ordering in a restaurant by {piza(x), person (x)} as singular and maybe also {x watashi, = food} (here, 'food' is a constant, but we can (10 it differently), depending on what the context is precisely.","• We analyse the contextual effect of a question like 'what do you want?' as forcing the person (the 'you') to be no longer singular (as he cannot be now considered aside from the order). This means that ẁatashi wa piza' is a better answer, for p̀iza' may be singular thus making ẁatashi ga piza' peculiar. We analyse the contextual effect of a question like 'what do you want?' as forcing 'piza' to be no longer singular (not, each person as the question is not directed at any particular person). This means that ẁatashi wa piza' is a better answer, for ẁatashi' may be singular thus making ẁatashi ga piza' peculiar. The uniqueness (or complete list) sense of g̀a' may be seen by the following example. To guarantee that k̀ore wa shiroi' (this is white) predicates s̀hiroi(x)' of k̀ore', k̀ore' must be singular. But then if someone says 'are ga shiroi' (that is white), from our analysis of g̀a' this forces 'are' to be in all s̀hiroi(x)' topics, notably in the singular topic of k̀ore' (thus forcing the identity k̀ore = are'). Thus 'x ga A' will contradict any 'y wa A' where y is singular and y x is already established. So if what is in question is not what has been (lone by members of a group as a whole, but what has been done separately by each member then the analysis of this is to make each member represent singular concepts (topics). But in this case S̀achs ga nihon ni kaerimashita . has a uniqueness (complete list) sense. which is captured as above by the theory. S̀ochi wa nihon ni ka,erimashita' does not have this reading so easily, neither does our theory so easily provide it.",":3.\\t• ẁatashi ni wa ie ga aru' is formalised as ] u q watashi P it I:1 arufr) ie (111)] • Suppose it is true, then it is satisfied at a world W where all the appropriate predicate","and constant symbols are relevant.","• Then there is a u which satisfies, in every world where ẁatashi' is relevant,RLutilaruwie","• A world w' satisfies 'ati °arti(x) [ie(u)]' when there is a u such that in every world where ]xaru(x), [ie(u)].

The form which appears to be brought on by the meaning of the predicate Yujisan wa tatte iru keredomo suwatte nai and another which appears to be brought on by the meaning of wo Kore wa shiroi keredomo are wa kuroi Cases of the first type have been accounted for above: two predicates which are incompatible or unexpected to hold of the same object may not be allowed into the singular topic of a particular individual. Thus s̀uwaru(x)' and t̀atsu(.0' may no both be allowed into","nless, perhaps, the conversation is about fictional and non-fictional houses, then 'aril' should not be singular. Yujisan's singular topic. The point being that Yujisan's singular topic is only important if we use wa, this explains why such a comparative sentence uses wa. As to a case of the second type, it seems that this is brought On 1)y something in the meaning of wa that requires a comparative reading. Notice that k̀ore wa, shiroi' formalises aS","]uo kore[shiroi ( u)], which means that there must be something that is white in every topic that is 'this' (kore). We have shown above what conditions there must be to force the predication of s̀hiroi(x)' on k̀ore'. However there is nothing to stop the predication of s̀hiroi(x)' anything else that appears in a kore-topic. The logic deliberately leaves it open that any other object in a topic in which k̀ore' is relevant gets predicated as being white. Now, therein lies the comparison. The sentence ]u p k„,[shiroi(u)] leaves it ambiguous as to what exactly satisfies shiroi(u). So, in order to remove the ambiguity, we must add another clause that rules out the valuation of shiroi ('a) to any other object that is relevant in a kore-topic. Thus we feel the need for a k̀eredomo are wa shiroi ja nai' or k̀eredomo are wa kuroi' (if 'are' is relevant). With ga, as seen above, a phenomena similar to the comparison of the first type gives us the uniqueness that is implied by ga. Further, notice that a formalisation of m̀aiku ga riko' is ]acl riko [u maiku], but there can be only one m̀aiku\" so there is no ambiguity in its satisfaction. Thus, in general, we do not so easily find a comparative reading of sentences that use ga.","2. With the exception of sentences implying non-existence like k̀ami ga nai' it seems that, in general, sentences using go do not take the negative. A sentence like Sono Eikokujin wa wakaranakatta (That Englishman wa didn't understand) is better that Sono Eikokujin ga wakaranakatta. The first means simply that the Englishman does not understand, but the second seems useable only if a number of people are known to understand except one and we wish to know who. 6 Even in that scenario the sentence is strange. To see why this is consider the formalisation of the two. The first formalises to\\tn-0 - U –EikokujinH wakatta ( u )], this is then operates as per normal. However the negation of the second sentence would be 31tO wakattaH(U Eikokujin)]. It is the subject that ga emphasises and so it is the subject that is negated. The logic can be said to demand this if we stipulate that that particular type of negation negates within the scope of the modal operator (not external to the modal operator). For ]Uril","wakattaH("]},{"title":"=","paragraphs":["Eikokujin)] to hold there must be an object that is distinct from the Englishman in every topic where someone has understood.

Some negations may be external to the operator so we may have \"-d3u n i ru [11 = Eikokujin], which states simply that the Englishman does not exist.
