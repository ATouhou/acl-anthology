Recently Set Combinatory Categorial Grammar, a direct descendent of Combinatory Categorial Grammar was proposed to treat local scrambling adequately. In this paper, we briefly sketch Set Combinatory Categorial Grammar analyses of various Korean syntactic phenomena including coordination, extraction and multiple nominative construction. 1. INTRODUCTION We briefly introduce CCG (Combinatory Categorial Grammar) and Set-CCG (Set Combinatory Categorial Grammar), a direct descendent of the former. 1.1 Combinatory Categorial Grammar CCG, introduced by [1] as a generalisation of the Categorial Grammars (CG) of [2] and [6] is a lexicalised formalism which is mildly context-sensitive [21]. The mildly context-sensitive generative power of CCG enables it to provide adequate description of syntactic phenomena including crossing dependencies in some languages that are known to be beyond the coverage of context-free grammars [16]. For syntactic derivation, CCG utilises a system of rules which is based on the combinators of [9]. These combinators are composition (B), type-raising (T), and substitution (S). CCG's view of surface structure is quite different from that of conventional grammar formalisms. Surface structures in CCG do not exhibit traditional notions of constituency or dominance and command. All the fragments that arise under coordination and related constructions are considered as surface constituents. This flexible view of surface structure provides lucid descriptions not only for bounded dependencies but also for various sorts of unbounded dependencies that occur when the complements are displaced under coordination, relativisation, etc. Thus, it is as a theory of multiple unbounded dependency and coordinate structure that CCG has most to offer as a theory of grammar [20]. Extensive introductions and discussions of the linguistic properties and motivations of the CCG formalism together with analyses of many constructions in English, German and Dutch are presented in [18, 19, 20].","*I would like to express many thanks to Jason Baldridge for helpful suggestions and discussions. All remaining mistakes and errors are mine. 1.2 Local Scrambling and Set-CCG CG and CCG were originally developed for configurational languages in which the order of constituents is mostly fixed and functions of constituents are realised according to their position in sentences. Nonconfigurational languages including Korean exhibit local scrambling as shown in (1).1","(1) a. Hwanho-ka\\twuyu-lul masi-nta. Hwanho-NOM milk-ACC drink-DECL Ilwanho drinks milk.'","b. wuyu-lul Hwanho-ka\\tmasi-nta. milk-ACC Hwanho-NOM drink-DECL Ilwanho drinks milk.' Typical solutions for local scrambling in CCG are extensive use of type-raising and crossing composition rules, and assignment of additional lexical categories for predicates which allow scrambling. The defects of these two approaches were presented in [3]. [10] proposed Multiset-CCG which is an extension of CCG. Sets are incorporated into the rules and categories of CCG in order to allow flexibility for handling scrambled word orders directly with single lexical categories. However Multiset-CCG achieves higher power than CCG and other mildly context-sensitive formalisms. [5] proposed Set-CCG, a direct descendent of CCG. Set-CCG also accepts scrambled orders with single lexical categories by incorporating sets into the categories and rules of CCG. However, the directional specifications of lexical categories and rules are retained. This allows Set-CCG to maintain the same generative capacity of CCG. The strong equivalence of CCG and Set-CCG are proved in [5]. We adopt Set-CCG for analysis of Korean throughout this study.2 2. PREVIOUS WORK [17] applied an extended version of pure Categorial Grammar to analysis of Korean. The notion of sets and unspecified directionality similar to those of [10] was introduced to handle the relative free word order. Some principles on rule application were also suggested. This work, however, cannot provide descriptions of coordinate constructions and other complex constructions involving the unconventional constituents. [15] and [7] incorporated sets into lexical categories, but directionality was retained. However, these studies lack format account for this extension. [7] used type-raising to treat case marking in Korean. [8] and [13] adopted Multiset-CCG for analysis of Korean, and coordination and quantifier floating were described. [14] adopted Set-CCG for description of Korean and showed analyses on various syntactic phenomena including coordination, relativisation, and clefting. 3. CASE MARKING AND PREDICATE CONJUGATION We will first look at the treatments of case marking and predicate conjugation in Korean within the framework of CCG. 1 The underlying assumption is that only the scrambling of complements are allowed and they cannot be placed after the predicate. It is true that sentences in which complements or adverbials are placed after the predicates of the sentences exist in Korean. However it is very rare phenomenon, and we will focus on predicate-final sentences. We can cover this matter if we adopt Multiset-CCG. 2 Set-CCG has been successfully applied to the analyses of various syntactic phenomena in Tagalog, Toba Batak [4] and Greek [11]. 3.1 Case Marking In Korean, the grammatical case of a noun is marked by case particles as shown in (1). We treat NOMINATIVE and ACCUSATIVE particles as functions that take left adjacent nouns as their arguments and return case-marked noun phrases. These category assignments are shown in (2).","(2) a. -ka, -kkeyse NOMINATIVE := N P NOM\\{N} b. -lul, -ul ACCUSATIVE := NPACC\\{N} We assign different categories for the particles traditionally classified as adverbial case particles since noun phrases with these particles often used as adverbials. These particles take left adjacent nouns as their arguments and return adverbials. Category assignments for typical adverbial case particles are shown in (3).","(3) a. -eY := ( S LOCI GOALITIME...I{S}A{N} b. -eykey, -kkey := (S DA T"]},{"title":"I","paragraphs":["{S}NN} C. -lo := ( 51 iNsTIG0AL...1{S}A{N} (4) shows a derivation of a complex noun phrase in which a case particle is attached to a noun modified by two determiners.3","(4) a. ku say cip-ese the new house-LOC àt the new house'","b.\\tku\\tsay cip\\t","—ese N {N} N {N} N (S L oc I {S}\\{N} N"]},{"title":"N","paragraphs":["SLoc/{S} 3.2 Predicate Conjugation The existence of predicate ending is another distinctive property of Korean. Predicate endings mark various grammatical features including tense, aspect, honorification, mood, etc. They are classified into two subgroups, pre-final endings and final endings, according to their positions.

LOCAL SCRAMBLING AND WORD ORDER PREFERENCE As pointed out in Section 1.2, local scrambling is a very common phenomenon in Korean. Scrambled sentences are derived without difficulties in Set-CCG as shown in (7).4","(7) a. ecey\\tHwanho-ka\\tcangnankam-ul pakuni-ey neh-ess-ta. yesterday Hwanho-NOM toy-ACC\\tbasket-LOC put-PAST-DECL H̀wanho put his toys into the basket yesterday.'","b. pakuni-ey cangnankam-ul ecey\\tHwanho-ka\\tneh-ess-ta. basket-LOC toy-ACC\\tyesterday Hwanho-NOM put-PAST-DECL Ilwanho put his toys into the basket yesterday.'

Word order preference seems to be dependent on predicates' characteristics as shown in (9).","(9) a. nampi-ey mul-i\\tkkulh-nunta. pot-LOC water-NOM boil-DECL Ẁater is boiling in a pot.' \\t","b. na-hanthe ton-i\\tsayngki-ess-ta. I-DAT money-NOM occur-PAST-DECL Ì happened to get some money.' Word order preference can be encoded in the categories of predicates if we interpret the set in Set-CCG as an ordered set.5 5. COORDINATION AND EXTRACTION One of the merits of CCG is the relatively simple treatment of unbounded dependencies that occur under coordination and extraction. This section shows CCG analyses of coordination and extraction in Korean. 4From now on, derivations of case marking and predicate conjugation are not shown unless needed. 5 [11] deals with this matter in his analysis of Greek. 5.1 Coordination A coordinate construction is formed by conjoining two or more sentences with a coordinate conjunctive ending -ko. (10a,b) are typical examples of coordination in Korean. Note that the PAST tense marking ending -ess- is dropped in (10b).6","(10) a.

Consider the following examples in (12a). The object of the second clause is gapped in this coordinate sentence. Derivation of this sentence is trivial as shown in (12b).","(12) a.

MULTIPLE NOMINATIVE CONSTRUCTION There have been many efforts to describe so-called multiple nominative construction in Korean. (22a) is a typical double nominative sentence. This sentence is widely regarded as related to (22b).","(22) a. Hwanho-ka\\telkwul-i yeyppu-ta. Hwanho-NOM face-NOM pretty-DECL Ilwanho's face is pretty.'","b. Hwanho-uy elkwul-i yeyppu-ta. Hwanho-POS face-NOM pretty-DECL Ilwanho's face is pretty.' It is also well-known that there exist certain types of semantic/pragmatic relations between multiple nominative noun phrases, and this construction can be formed only with a particular kind of predicates. The essence of our categorial description of multiple nominative construction is treating nominative noun phrases except the first one as functions that take left adjacent noun phrase as their arguments.

CONCLUSION We presented a Set-CCG analyses on various syntactic phenomena in Korean in this paper. It was proved that Set-CCG can provide not only adequate descriptions for Korean syntax but also precise predictions for many linguistic constraints. We also showed that if we can assign proper lexical categories, complex syntactic constructions including coordination, relativisation, clefting, and multiple nominative constructions can be derived easily by applying relatively simple and small number of combinatory rules. A closer look of the linguistic features of individual lexical items like this approach will benefit the better understanding of Korean syntax. 8. REFERENCES","[1] Anthony Ades and Mark Steedman.
