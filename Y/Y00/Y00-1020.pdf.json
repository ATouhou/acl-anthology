It inherits desirable formal properties of 4-valued logic, and further realizes a certain kind of default reasoning and truth maintenance system with a simple, lucid LK-style calculus without esoteric, exotic 4-valued operations in [6, 7, 2, 3] etc."]},{"title":"1 Preliminaries","paragraphs":["The logical method provides a basic tool to capture the human knowledge and human reasoning. But the traditional 2-valued logic has certain defects in formulating them. I.e., it cannot treat the incomplete or contradictory information which often appears in the human epistemic state. Furthermore, the 2-valued logic is not paraconsistent, i.e., from the contradiction, all statements are derived.","In order to avoid such faults, [5, 1] propose the 4-valued logic. It is based on a very simple idea that the traditional two truth values 'true' and 'false' are treated independently so that the following four truth values are assumed in the 4-valued logic':","(1) i) T (true): A is true. ii) F (false): A is false. iii) B (both): A is both true and false. iv) N (none): A is neither true nor false.","The new truth values B and N represent the contradictory and the incomplete information respectively, i.e. the knowledge states that the traditional 2-valued logic cannot treat because it assumes the following relations between 'true' and 'false'","(2) A is true .#> A is not false, A is false 4 A is not true so that B and N are impossible at all.","Although the introduction of B and N enables the 4-valued logic to treat the contradictory and the incomplete knowledge state, it is also true that such states tend to change to the contradiciton- and incompleteness-free states, i.e. to T or F. In this sense, T and F in the traditional 2-valued logic are the final ideal states which the human knowledge state with contradiction and incompleteness aims at. In order to treat these tendencies, several logical systems have been developed which are classified to the following two types: \\t (3) i) N\\tT or F: default logic, circumscription, negation as failure etc. \\t ii) B\\tT or F: truth maintenance system etc.","In this paper, I present a 4-valued logical system called the situational 4-valued logic S4Val. S4Val can describe the knowledge state and the reasoning with contradictory and incomplete information. Further it can formulate — not all but — some interesting types of the default logic and the truth maintenance system.","In the following, I present the language, the semantics, and the proof theory of S4Val, and then the above-mentioned non-monotonic reasoning. 'The idea stems from [11]."]},{"title":"2 Language of S4Val","paragraphs":["The language of S4Val is the same as the ordinary first-order logic, and its formulas are expressed by speak(h, e), (A A B) D C, Vx(P(x) V 3y--,Q(x,y)) etc. Var, Const, Func, Term, Fred, LC, Q, Form denote the set of variables, constants, function symbols, terms, predicate symbols, logical connectives, quantifiers, and formulas of S4Val, respectively. Funcn , Predn represent the set of n-ary function symbols and predicate symbols, respectively.","A, B, C E Form, and t, u E Term. Then ArB1 means that B may occur in A, and A[B/C] represents the result of uniformly substituting B for C in A. A ixl and trx1 mean that x may appear free in A and t. A[u x] and t[u/x] represent the result of uniformly substituting u for the free occurences of x in A and t.","The number of logical connectives and quantifiers in a formula A is called the length of A, and denoted by Len(A)."]},{"title":"3 Semantics of S4Va1","paragraphs":["3.1 Model of S4Val Definition 1 A model M of S4Val is defined as follows: M = (D, 7F, f, v) D: non-empty set of individuals (domain) 7r+ : Predn Pow(Dn)","7r .17 - : Predn -4 Pow(Dn) f : Funcn (D n D) (n > 0) v : Var\\tD (variable assignment) Definition 2 Let v be a variable assignment, and (x, do) E v.

But the interpretation function 7 of predicate symbols are splitted into 7r + and 7r - which give a predicate symbol its positive and negative domain respectively, i.e. the domains which return T and F respectively if the n-tuple of individuals which the arguments of the predicate denote belongs to the respective domains.","Based on Definition 1, terms and formulas are interpreted with respect to a model as follows:","Definition 3 Let M (D, 7r, f , v) be a model of S4Val.

Then the truth value of A with respect","to M is defined as follows: i) The truth value of A with respect to M is T: MW- A, and MI5-A. ii) The truth value of A with respect to M is F:\\t- A, and MK A. iii) The truth value of A with respect to M is B:\\tA, and MK A. iv) The truth value of A with respect to M is N: MV ± A, and MA. Here, MV + A, and MIO - A represent the negation of +A, and MK - A respectively. But in S4Val, there are no relations as in (2) between M + A., MH- A. and their negated forms, which enables S4Val to express the four trui,h values. 3.3 Direct Interpretation of Formulas Now, the truth values can be directly assigned to formulas of S4Val too. For this, we introduce the bilattice FOUR of [14 The bilattice itself is defined as follows [12, p.270]:","Definition 6 A bilattice is a sextuple (B, A, V, 0, El), (--,) such that i) (B, A,"]},{"title":"v),","paragraphs":["(B, ®, ) are both complete lattices, and","ii) For any a E B,\\ta = a.","iii) is a lattice homomorphism from (B, A, V) to (B, V, A) and from (B, ®, ED) to itself.

The partial orders in respective axes are represented by < t and <k. A, ® and v, ® are infimum and supremum operation with respect to < t and <k.

Theorem 3i-vi) are all proved using the truth values B or N, i.e. the truth values which the traditional 2-valued logic lacks. 3.6 Inference Relation with Constraints For practical purposes, it is often useful to pose some constraints on the inference relation which are classified to the following two types:","(4) i) axioms. ii) inferential rules.","(5) i) japanese(taro). ii) japanese(a)\\tkind(a).

But from\\tA, and\\tA D B, it does not always follow that 1-= B, as is proved by Theorem 3.iv). 3.7 Bilattice DEFAULT and Non-monotonic Reasoning [12] proposes a bilattice called DEFAULT which is depicted as Figure 2: Bo \\t Bo A No t No t Figure 2: DEFAULT \\t Figure 3: DEFAULT Here, the truth values T, F, B, N of FOUR are indexed so that DEFAULT consists of 7 elements Bo, Fo, To, B1, F1 , T 1 , No. The elements B 1 , F 1 , T 1 , N0 are considered as a refinement of N in FOUR. Conversely, FOUR is considered as a special case of DEFAULT with no refinement of No. The intention of DEFAULT is the following: If we assign T 1 to the formula (6) bird(tweety), (6) is true by default. But if we also give (6) Fo after that, T 1 is overrided by Fo, and the truth value of (6) is now Fo, which means that we can capture a certain type of default reasoning by means of DEFAULT.","Furthermore, assume that (6) has the truth value B 1 at the beginning, and then it is given the truth value To. Then it means that DEFAULT can capture a certain kind of truth maintenance system.2","We can generalize DEFAULT to bilattices with further refinements of No. Figure 3 is an example for it. We also call it DEFAULT. As is seen from Figure 3, DEFAULT bilattices constitute a stratification. I.e., a DEFAULT bilattice contains a smaller DEFAULT bilattice until it reaches FOUR. So they belong to the class of the stratified bilattices of [12, p.285] so that the above-mentioned types of non-monotonic reasoning amount to a case of reasoning using stratified bilattices.","Below, I define some terms concerning the stratification. 2 As to the default logic and the truth maintenance system, cf. [14, 10] etc. —200— Definition 12 Let E be a DEFAULT bilattice, and Ex = {y E E I x y}. If Ex is also a DEFAULT (including FOUR), x is called a splitting point of E.","The number Dgr(E) of the splitting points in E is called the degree (of stratification) of E.","Str(E x ) Dgr(E) Dgr(E x ) is called the stratum number of Ex . Ex is called the Str(Ex )-th stratum of E.","S4Vald with the degree d is the collection of S4Val d (0 < s < d - 1) with the stratum number s. (d is omitted in obvious cases.) Here, in Figure 3, EB° = E. So Str(E) = 0. Further, Str(E B1 ) = 1, and Str(E B2 ) = 2.","Now, the semantic interpretation on FOUR must be altered to the stratum specific one which consists of the introduction of the stratum number. But the change is minimal, and we only need to add the subscript s of the stratum number to the symbols defined for the above stratum-number-free semantics: e.g., M3, Is , S4Val3 . Further, the collection of M3 (0 < s < d - 1) in DEFAULT with the degree d is denoted by Md = (D, 7r, f, v) d (also without d in obvious cases).","Now, the stratum number s stems from the relativization of 7 with respect to s in the model M3 = (D, 73 , f, v) such that 7:9E Predn Pow(Dn)","7r:\\t_",": Predn -4 Pow(Dn) D, f, v remain unchanged. So, the correspondence with the stratum number s to the definitions and theorems in 3.1-3.5 hold with 7r 3 instead of 7r. Likewise, T, F, B are replaced by T 3 , F3 , B 3 , respectively. But notice that N is replaced by No. I.e., if a formula is N in all strata, it is finally N, i.e. No.","The interpretation with the stratum number gives a formula stratum specific truth values. But now, what is the truth value of a formula with respect to such an interpretation? It is given by the following definition:","Definition 13 The truth value of a formula A with respect to DEFAULT with the degree d is given by f, v, A).

A usual default theory would derive either (23i) or (23ii), but not both, and it depends on the order of applying the default rules (16ii) and (22ii) which one is derived. In this case, some preferential order among the default rules is generally assumed. But in this paper, such an order is not assumed on a stratum, and the contradiction is accepted - thanks to the 4-valued method - without serious theoretical problems. Instead, the hierarcy among the stratums represents the preferential order here.","Further notice that Algorithm 1 contains the procedure V S A. Because of the semi-decidability of the first-order logic, it is in general undecidable. But in SLK4, the proper axioms are restricted to clauses.
