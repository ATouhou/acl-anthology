According to Ford (1993 & 1994) and Wang (1996), temporal and conditional clauses in both English and Chinese tend to occur in the initial position (preposed) while causal ones tend to occur in the final position (postposed). It is assumed that the initial adverbial clauses form pivotal points in the development of talk and present explicit background for material that follows; on the other hand, final adverbial clauses which might result from the interactional need only complete a unit of information without creating discourse-level links or shifts. Though the functions of the information sequences of adverbial clauses in Chinese spoken discourse have been well established in Wang's (1996) dissertation, there're still problems unsolved: what are the differences among the various expressions of adverbial connectors in Chinese under the same category of adverbial clauses in English? For example, we have at least three expressions representing when-clause: dang (de shihou) vs. zai...de shihou vs. ...de shihou and ificlause: ruguo...,jiaru...,...de hua for each. Materials are based on 15 texts (aobut 150-minute spoken discourse data) with 200 temporal and conditional clauses in total (113 vs. 87). This paper found significant differences in distribution among these adverbial connectors under the same category of adverbial clauses, argueing that such linguistic performances in spoken discourse are possibly due to their lexical semantic differences and further result in their different discourse functions."]},{"title":"0. Introduction","paragraphs":["Relations between positions as preposed (initial) and postposed and discourse functions of temporal, conditional, and causal adverbials have been done quite a few. The distribution is that temporal and conditional clauses tend to occur before their modified material (preposed/ initial), while causal clauses are more likely to occur after the modifiee (postposed/final). About the functions of initial temporal adverbials in Chinese discourse, Wang (1996) suggests that their functions are mainly \"introducing and shifting time reference and/or offering a contrast\". The so-called time reference is \"a domain of talk which requires management and attention on the part of conversational participants that it can be generic or specific\" (Ford, 1993). And thus it can be shifted from generic to specific, or from specific to generic. The other function of initial temporal clause is it can relate to what precedes it and produce a frame for what follows through contrast. Initial conditional clauses, as proposed by Ford and Thompson (1986), may fall into five types with functions as exploring options, providing polite requests, illustrating, contrasting, and assuming. Haiman (1978) has argued that conditionals have a correlation with topics: \"Conditionals, like topics, are given, which constitute the frame of reference with respect to which the main clause is either true or felicitous.\" Thus the function of initial conditional clauses can be thought as \"creating backgrounds for subsequent utterances and presenting a piece of information as given\" (Wang, 1996). Another similar interpretation is from Huang (1996): the Chinese initial conditional clauses have a discourse organizational function since they serve to break the discourse into significant units and to frame the event in the following clause. Following an ending intonation, postposed adverbial clauses stand for independent units in their own right (Ford, 1993: 102). The Mandarin data suggest that adverbial clauses after recipients have provided some sign of disbelief, lack of understanding or other trouble; often arrise in the context of self-editing and the negotiation of understanding between conversationalists (Wang, 1996). This paper proceeds as follows. In section 1, I'll offer the overall distribution of Chinese temporal and conditional connectors in different positins as preposed and postposed according to the 15 texts in my corpus. I'll list all the adverbial connectors found in my data and argue that even representing the same adverbial category, these adverbials are not at equal status in \"frequency\". That is, take when-clause for example, although there're three possible expressions as dang ...(de shihou) vs. zai...de shihou vs. ...de shihou, their frequencies in Chinese spoken discourse are significantly different. After-adverbials as zhihou/yihou are much more frequently used in my corpus than before-adverbials as zhiqian/yiqian. Similar to the situation of when-clause, if-adverbials such as ruguo ... vs. jiaru... vs. ...dehua are very different in frequency. Sections 2&3 will give examples of adverbial connectors mentioned above and more detailed discussion on their discourse functions in preposed and postposed positions respectively. And in the final part of this paper, I'll draw a brief conclusion and offer a semantic study on these adverbial connectors to explain how they differ in the performance of distribution and discourse function. 1. Classifications and Distribution Consistent with what Wang (1996) had already observed that both temporal and conditional tend to occur initially (91% & 87%), the figures in table 1 add a strong support to such tendency (97% & 88%): Table 1. Distribution of temporal and conditonal clauses by position in my data position/type Temporal Conditional Total Initial 110 (97%) 77 (88%) 187 (93%) Final 3 (3%) 10 (12%) 13 (7%) Total 113 87 200 Table 2& 3 show the distribution of all the temporal and conditional connectors found in my data so far. Note that for temporal ones, the expression (X)...de shihou (here X can be dang or zai) is almost the only possible one in when-clause except dan... without de shihou; after-adverbials (29%) are more frequently used than before-adverbials. For conditional ones, ruguo... (47%) is the most productive adverbial connector in if-clause and ...de hua is the second one (34%). Note that we have also combination as ruguo ...de hua (13%). This means that they are not in complementary distribution. So ruguo... & ...de hua are the strongest predictors in conditional clauses (47%+34%+13%=94%). Table 2.

Initial Temporal and Conditional Clauses This section focuses on clauses which are in initial positions (preposed). Under this category two sub-sections are divided as temporal (sec. 2.1) and conditional (sec.2.2). 2.1 Examples and functions of initial temporal clauses It is generally agreed that the general functions of initial temporal clauses are introducing and shifting time reference, and/or offering a contrast. In the following sections, I'll give some examples of them and explain how they funciton in discourse. When-clause, before-clause, and after-clause will be mentioned respectively. In when-clause, we have shihou, zai ...de shihou, and ...de shihou. We also have zhi qian/yi qian in before-clause and zhi hou/yi hou in after-clause. I will not distinguish zhi and yi in this paper. 2.1.1 when-clause As was shown in Table2, the expression (X) ...de shihou (X can be either dang or zai) always makes a successful prediction when there's a when-clause. de is a complicated case in Chinese for it can be a relative marker in relative clause, genitive marker preceded by NPs, or even particle in the final position of a sentence. shihou represents a spot or period of time. de plus shihou has become a fixed expression used in when-clause. Now consider example (1). Speaker E is complaining about his brother's bad habbit. He first introduces a generic time reference by saying \"when he is going to sleep at night\" and then continues to describe what the bad habbit is like: (1) ...,OWWM ...de shihou","E: <F erqie\\tta you\\thuai\\txiguan\\tF>,","and\\t3Sg. Poss.\\tbad\\thabbit Ànd he has a bad habbit:'"]},{"title":"4\\t","paragraphs":["ta wanshang\\tshuei\\tde shihou, 3Sg. night\\tsleep ẁhen he is going to sleep at night,' ta-de\\tyinxiang huoshi\\tdianshi kan-zhe la, 3Sg.-Poss. stereo\\tor\\ttelevision watch h̀is stereo (open) or (he) was watching television,' jiou ren shuei-le yihou\\tna-ge\\tdongxi\\thaishi\\tkaizhe.","3Sg. asleep\\tafter\\tthat\\tthing\\tstill\\topen T̀hose are still in use even after (he) fell asleep.' In addition to generic time reference introducing, (X) ...de shihou can also function as time framing from generic to specific. Speaker C in (2) describes how her colleagues depreciate her question. She first makes a \"pre\" keshi 'but' as a projection and then sets a time frame \"when I went to ask\" as a background to go on her speech. In (3), the speaker emphasizes it is during her very \"specific\" period of time that someone helps her. Note that dang and zai here can be deleted without violating grammaticality or acceptability. Once they are used, sometimes they can replace each other but sometimes they cannot. (2) a... 119,MIX dang ...de shihou","C:\\tkeshi keshi dang\\tuo qiu wen\\tde shihou, but\\tbut\\t1Sg. go ask B̀ut, but when I went to ask,' tamen\\tdou juede\\tshuo, 3P1.\\tall\\tfeel\\tsay àll of them felt/thought that,' zhe\\tjian\\tshi\\tzheme\\tjiandan, this\\tQuan.\\tthing/event\\tso\\tsimple t̀his is so simple,' ni\\tdou\\tbu\\tzhidou\\ta. 2Sg.\\teven\\tNeg.\\tknow Ỳou didn't even know that?' •• (3) A. .. g9/711X zai... de shihou","4 H: zai uo zuei\\tdichao\\tde shihou,","1Sg. most\\tdown ẁhen I was in my most difficult time,' shi to\\tpeizhe\\tuo de. be 3Sg.\\taccompany\\t1Sg. Ìt is he who accompanies me.' 2.1.2 before- after -clauses The syntactic position of before-after adverbial connectors in Chinese is different from the one in English: they occur after the subordinate clause rather than the first position of a sentence. Similar case can also be found in Japanese: maeni 'before' vs. atode 'after'. Such syntactic difference in position, in my opinion, is very important (I'll explain it in section 4). Note that although adverbials like zhiqian/yiqian 'before', zhihou/yihou 'after' in Chinese have to be preceded by subordinate clauses when there's a before-after clause, they can occur independently as pure time adverbs through the process of metaphorical extension to form certain fixed semantics. For example, similar to \"before\" in English, yiqian in initial position means 'in the past'; zhiqian in the same position may either mean 'in the past' or b̀efore certain event'; this certain event is not spoken superficially (or I shall say that this is out of sentence domain but is known/specific to both speakers and hearers through discourse). yihou and zhihou in initial position are the counterparts ofyiqian and zhiqian and thus have similar behaviors. Though there're slight differences between zhiqian and yiqian, zhihou and yihou, I do not make a distinction here because of the limitation of this paper. Now let's see the following examples of before-after-clauses. (4) is from the text which talks about the influences that viagra may bring to the relation or interaction between two sexes in society. Thus it is not difficult to understand why speaker B in (4) makes a before-clause: she not only sets a time frame but also makes a successful topic continuation. This is interesting to see that though this is a temporal adverbial clause, its function is correspondent to what Haiman (1978) has argued: conditionals have a correlation with topics. (5) is a prototypical after-clause in Chinese: shifting time reference from generic to specific. (4) ..., 'eifigati zhiqian/yiqian","B: • • keshi\\tzai uo-men nage-- but\\t1P1.\\t(pause filler) B̀ut when we--'","4\\tweiergan yao\\tjinkou\\tzhiqian oh, viagra\\tbe going to\\timport\\tbefore b̀efore the viagra is being imported,' zai.. uo-men guojia\\tye zuo guo bantu\\tde yianjiou ma. in\\t1P1.-Gen. country too do Perf. indigenous\\tRel. research (̀we) also had done our indigenous research in our country.' (5) ...

Examples and functions of initial conditional clauses: if-clause Like initial temporal clauses, the functions of initial conditional clauses are also about framing and backgrounding: the former deals with time, and the later deals with hypotheticality and condition. Basically, there're two main expressions of conditional clauses: ruguo..., and ...de hua (the two connectors together occupy 94 % of conditional clauses). In general, if-clauses also prefer to occur in sentence initial position (88%). Here I'll only give examples of ruguo\\truguo ...de hua, ...de hua and ignore other adverbial connectors. In (6), speaker A is doing a hypotheticality that if he cannot get up immediately, the recipient can wake him up again. (6) og... ruguo","4 A: .. zheyang miande uo\\tuo ruguo-- like this\\tin case\\t1 Sg.\\t1 Sg. if L̀ike this, in case that I.. if I--' tuo\\thenjiou\\tbu\\tqilai, put off\\tlong while\\tNeg.\\tget up p̀ut it off for a long while (and) didn't get up,' ni hai keyi zai\\tba\\tuo\\twa-qi-lai. 2P1. still can again\\tmake\\t1Sg.\\twake up ỳou can try to wake me up again.' Example (7) is the combination of ruguo ...& ...de hua. Either one of them can be deleted without influencing the fluency or the semantic interpretation. Such combination is interpreted in this paper that ruguo 'if is a main adverbial connector, ...de hua acts as a supplement. I would like to say that ruguo is more with respect to hypotheticality and ... de hua is more to do with conditioning. The two cognitive representations are of course not excluded but highly correlated. That is why this expression can be found in Chinese discourse with not few cases. (7)"]},{"title":"og","paragraphs":["..nclif ruguo ...de hua","4 B:\\truguo\\truguo\\tbijiao\\tchili\\tde hua if\\tif\\tmore\\texhausting Ìf it is more exhausting (to you),' jiou xie\\tshi mian\\tjiou hao\\tle. then write\\tten pages\\tthen all right t̀hen writing only ten pages will be all right.' E: • • de hua is more complicated than ruguo. In (8A), the function of de hua can be interpreted as either offering a hypotheticality or posing a possible condition for the following prediction. This will not make any difference if we replace de hua by adding ruguo in the initial position of this sentence: ruguo ni zai zheyang xiaqiu (de hua). However, consider the example (8B) I made. It is with no doubt that we can have NP preceding de hua as a topic introducing which is comprehended as \"for NP\". But this usage will never be allowed for ruguo no matter it is following or preceding a NP. This discrepancy leads me to believe while de hua is a neutral expression, ruguo is more with respect to \"kinesis\" and \"agency\", and this idea happens to support my previous claim that ruguo is a marker of hypotheticality dealing with certain \"event\", de hua has less degree of hypotheticality but has more to do with conditioning and if it is after ruguo, it can be taken as a supplement.

Final Temporal and Conditional Clauses By Wang's (1996) explanation, the functions of final adverbial clauses are self-editing and the negotiation of understanding between interlocutors. Huang (1995) claims that these self-editing PCEs (Post Completion Extension) are \"produced possibly as a strategy to forestall interactional trouble, or to structure information\". While there're 12% conditional clauses occuring in final position, only 3% temporal clauses occur in final position. Such discrepancy occurs because, in my opinion, we seldom have problems or disagreements on \"time\" reference. The time flow may change with the change of information flow, and they always match to each other. However, it is \"time\" that temporal clauses deal with, and so we'll have very little chance to use temporal clauses as a strategy ro forestall interactional troubles. On the other hand, conditional clauses can be related to persons or any kind of events, and thus they are more likely to be taken as a post completion extension. In this section I would like to show how these adverbials behave and function in final position. 3. 1. Example and functions of final temporal clauses: when-clause Speaker H in (9) adds a temporal clause just after posing a question with a falling tone. He narrows the time span by saying zai nake shihou 'at that moment' and then does a selfrepair by saying gang fenshou de shihou to make the time reference more specific. It is not only setting a time reference like other temporal clauses in initial position always do but also forestalling a possible interactional trouble.

Examples and functions of final conditional clauses: if-clause In example (10), speaker E is complaining about his brother's girl friend who washes her clothes even in his house. V then says hai-hao la 'that's not so bad actually' in order to soothe E. However, E seems not satisfied with V's reaction. V realizes it and then immediately adds a conditional clause to weaken his argument and further to avoid any oral disagreement.\\tThe postposed conditional clause is produced across different speakers: speaker V makes a post completion for speaker E. Of course, we also have examples of final conditional clauses accomplished within the same speaker's turn. (11) is the case. Again, similar to what has been mentioned in (9), final conditional clauses may also have functions of framing and self-editing. Speaker A asks a question first and restricts it as \"for-one-person\" case. Feeling inappropriate, he then adds more detailed description to enhance the recipient's understanding. (10) \\t\\truguo...","A) E: (Hx)\\tranhou yifu..\\ttongtong zai zhebian xi.","then\\tclothes\\tall\\tat\\there\\twash Ànd then the clothes, (she) washes them all over here.'","V: ...hai-hou\\tla. not so bad Ìt is not so bad actually.'","E: (H)\\tgao-bu-chingchu.","make-Neg.-clear (̀She) didn't quite get it.'"]},{"title":"4","paragraphs":["V: .. ruguo\\tmet -you–..\\tyian-zhong\\tganrao-dao\\tni. if\\tNeg.\\tseriously\\tdisturb\\t2Sg.

Discussion This paper tempts to study how the temporal and conditional adverbial connectors are distributed in frequency and functioned in preposed vs. postposed positions, arguing that these differences we found so far do not come up with no reasons but have a lot to do with lexical semantics. First, by checking 113 temporal and 87 conditional clauses, it is concluded that temporal clauses always occur in sentence initial position (97%), and conditional clauses also have a high tendency to occur initially (88%), showing a modifiermodified sequence. In section 2, we see how the connectors under temporal and conditional clauses are distributed in Chinese discourse. When there's a when-clause, the expression (X)...de shihou (here X can be dang or zai) is almost the only possible one except dan... without de shihou. After-adverbials are more frequently used than before-adverbials. For conditional clauses, ruguo & ...de hua will be the strongest predictors (94%). In section 3, we see how these adverbial connectors behave and function in discourse. The general functions of initial temporal clauses are setting or shifting time reference, and the ones of initial conditional clauses are creating backgrounds for subsequent utterances—framing. Temporal clauses deal with time, and conditional clauses deal with hypotheticality. On the other hand, the postposed adverbial clauses function very differently from preposed ones. Generally speaking, they are post-completion-extensions, functioning as self-editing for interactional needs. Now, turn to the question posed in this paper: if now we are convinced that we have more than three expressions representing when- and if- clauses for each and only some of them are the preferred/predominant ones, how do these discrepancies come from? Note that the conditional connectors listed in table 3 by my data, I have to confess, do not include all the possibilities in Chinese. That is, unlike English, Chinese has abundant conditional adverbial connectors, and even there is a slight distinction between \"colloquial\" and \"literary\" usages. (It is so complicated that I cannot make it explicit in this paper.) Also recall that we have much more after-clasues than before-clauses. The following discussion is thus divided into three parts and focuses on lexical study: dan and zai for when-clause; ruguo and de hua for if-clause plus a preliminary study on conditioanl adverbials jiaru, jiashe, wanyi; zhiqian/yiqian vs. zhihou/yihou for before-after clause. A. when-clause: Now return to examples (2) & (3) and exame the grammaticality if we replace dang with zai and zai with clang: it is absolutely not acceptable/grammatical in (i) but in (ii), though not as good as the original sentence, it is still acceptable. In addition, if we delete dang and zai in both examples and leave de shihou only, it is still perfect in (ii) but not so appropriate for (i). These slight differences, in my opinion, might due to the features within the lexicon. Table 4 is my assumption toward the expression de shihou, dang, and zai on their occurrences with the ideas of time shift, time span, and characteristics of verbs which they correlate. Here I would like to suggest that the expression ...de shihou is the underlying representation of when-clause in Chinese spoken discourse. dang and zai are used only when the speaker tempts to narrow the time span and thus makes a time shift from generic to specific. dang can be taken as a spot in time span and more related to \"event\", and thus it will be perfect when it is used in (i) and still acceptable in (ii). zai is used to define a certain period of time and more related to \"state\", and thus it is not acceptable in (i).","i) ** keshi .. keshi zai\\tuo qiu wen\\tde shihou, but\\tbut\\t1Sg. go ask Tut, but when I went to ask,'","ii) ?\\tdang\\tuo zuei\\tdichao\\tde shihou,","1Sg. most\\tdown ẁhen I was in my most difficult time,'","Table 4. dang, zai, and de shihou","Adverbials time span time shift related verbal features","dang...

Here I would like to give an introduction to other possible conditional adverbial connectors found in my corpus. ruguo, jiaru, jiashe, wanyi will be examed in the following sentences to see their degree of grammaticality/acceptability. The expression in bold is the preferred one. (12) in English is a counter-factual sentence (though there's no syntactic representation of counter-factual in Chinese, it is obtained through discourse). Here jiaru is the perfect use while ruguo is comparatively inappropriate but still acceptable. Speaker in (13) is making a presupposition to continue his following reasoning, and here jiashe will be the best choice. Again, ruguo and jiaru are not good in this example but weakly acceptable. wanyi is definitely not allowed in both (12) & (13) but perfect in (14). This might due to its lexical semantics for it can only be used when something bad or unfortunate happened. Table 5 is a brief conclusion of these adverbials.","(12) jiaru/?ruguo/*jiashe/*wanyi\\tuo shi yi-zhi\\tniao, uo jiou neng fei le. if\\t 1 Sg. be one-Quan. bird 1 Sg. then can fly Ìf I were a bird, I could fly.'","(13) jiashe/?ruguo/?jiaru/*wanyi X dengyu Y, uomen\\tkeyi shuo, if\\t X\\tequal\\tY\\t1P1.\\tcan say Ìf X equals to Y, then we can say...'","(14) wanyi/ruguo/jiaru/*fiashe chushi\\tle,\\tni gankuai bao-jin. if\\tsth.bad happened\\t2Sg. quickly call the police Ìf something unfortunate happened, just call the police as quickyly as possible.'

(de hua) hypotheticality used only when there's","something bad or unfortunate C. before-after-clause: It is generally agreed that basically, zhiqian/yiqian & zhihou/yihou in before- & after-clauses are both temporal adverbial connectors, functioning as shifting time reference from generic to specific. However, we do find their large discrepancy in frequency. Here I would not like to talk about if this is universal or language specific but just offer some possible solutions to this issue in Chinese discourse. Look the following comparison first: Time Flow:\\tEvent A Event B English: 1) before-clause: before B, A/ A before B (A is a main clause) 2) after-clause: after A, B/ B after A\\t(B is a main clause) Chinese: 1) before-clause: B zhiqian/yiqian, A / ?*A, B zhiqian/yiqian (A is a main clause) 2) after-clause: A zhihou/yihou, B / ?*B, A zhihou/yihou (B is a main clause) The expression marked by ?* is only used in Chinese as a supplement and is rarely used (I didn't find any example in my data). Thus this usage does not fit prototypical adverbial clause. Such difference from English results from their differences in syntactic category and position: they cannot be prepositions and must occur after the adverbial clause. Consider the notion of time flow: it is more natural if we mention A first then B by sequence; the inversion of time sequence is not so natural but serves the function of topic continuity. In English, it can have two representations: \"A before B\" or \"after A, B\" to fit this time sequence. However, there's only one device in Chinese \"A zhihou/yihou, B\" and that's why we have much more after-clauses in discourse superficially. Reference Wang, Yu-Fang. 1996.
