A psycholinguistic measurement (semantic differential [Osgood, 1952]). paradigmatic relation: how the words are associated with each other. Similarity between words can be defined by either a syntagmatic or a paradigmatic relation.","Syntagmatic similarity is based on co-occurrence data extracted from corpora [Church and Hanks, 1990], definitions in dictionaries [Wilks etal., 1989], and so on. Paradigmatic similarity is based on association data extracted from thesauri [Morris and Hirst, 1991], psychological experiments [Osgood, 1952], and so on.","This paper concentrates on paradigmatic similarity, because a paradigmatic relation can be established both inside a sentence and across sentence boundaries, while syntagmatic relations can be seen mainly inside a sentence -- like syntax deals with sentence structure. The rest of this section focuses on two related works on measuring paradigmatic similarity -- a psycholinguistic approach and a thesaurus-based approach. 2.1 A Psycholinguistic Approach Psycholinguists have been proposed methods for measuring similarity. One of the pioneering works is 'semantic differential' [Osgood, 1952] which analyses meaning of words into a range of different dimensions with the opposed adjectives at both ends (see Figure 1), and locates the words in the semantic space.","Recent works on knowledge representation are somewhat related to Osgood's semantic differential. Most of them describe meaning of words using special symbols like microfeatures [Waltz and Pollack, 1985; Hendler, 1989] that correspond to the semantic dimensions.","However, the following problems arise from the semantic differential procedure as measurement of meaning. The procedure is not based on the denotative meaning of a word, but only on the connotative emotions attached to the word; it is difficult to choose the relevant dimensions, i.e. the dimensions required for the sufficient semantic space. 2.2 A Thesaurus-based Approach Morris and Hirst [1991] used Roget's thesaurus as knowledge base for determining whether or not two words are semantically related. For example, the semantic relation of truck/car and drive/car are captured in the following way: 1. truck E vehicle B car (both are included in the vehicle class), 2. drive E journey ~ vehicle B car Oourney refersto vehicle).","This method can capture Mmost all types of semantic relations (except emotional and situational relation), such as paraphrasing by superordinate (ex. cat/pet), systematic relation (ex. north/east), and non-systematic relation (ex. theatre/fi]~).","However, thesauri provide neither information about semantic difference between words juxtaposed in a category, nor about strength of the semantic relation between words -- both are to be dealt in this paper. The reason is that thesauri axe designed to help writers find relevant words, not to provide the meaning of words.","3 Paradigme: A Field for Measuring Similarity We analyse word meaning in terms of the semantic space defined by a semantic network, called Paradigme. Paradigme is systematically constructed from Gloss~me, a subset of an English dictionary. 3.1 Gloss~me -- A Closed Subsystem of","English A dictionary is a closed paraphrasing system of natural language. Each of its headwords is defined by a phrase which is composed of the headwords and their derivations. A dictionary, viewed as a whole, looks like a tangled network of words.","We adopted Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE) [1987] as such a closed system of English. LDOCE has a unique feature that each of its 56,000 headwords is defined by using the words in Longman Defining Vocabulary (hereafter, LDV) and their derivations. LDV consists of 2,851 words (as the headwords in LDOCE) based on the survey of restricted vocabulary [West, 1953].","We made a reduced version of LDOCE, called Glossdme. Gloss~me has every entry of LDOCE whose headword is included in LDV. Thus, LDVis defined by Gloss~me, and Glossdme is composed of ...... LDV.

So, LDV has a potential for covering all the concepts commonly found in the world.","This implies the completeness of LDV as dimensions of the semantic space. Osgood's semantic differential procedure [1952] used 50 adjective dimensions; our semantic measurement uses 2,851 dimensions with completeness and objectivity.","Our method can be applied to construct a semantic network from an ordinary dictionary whose 237 defining vocabulary is not restricted.

Lack of the connotational and extensional knowledge causes some unexpected results of measuring the similarity. For example, consider the following similarity: ~(tree,"]},{"title":"leaf)","paragraphs":["= 0.008693.","This is due to the nature of the dictionary definitions- they only indicate sufficient conditions of the headword.

Let us consider the following definition of lift:","llft v 1 to bring from a lower to a higher level; raise 2 (of movable parts) to be able to be lifted 3 --- Anyone can imagine that something is moving upward. But, such a movement can not be represented in the activated pattern produced from the phrase. The meaning of a phrase, sentence, or text should be represented as pattern changing in time, though what we need is static and paradigmatic relation.","This paradox also arises in measuring the similarity between texts and the text coherence. As we have seen in Section 5, there is a difference between the similarity of texts and the similarity of word lists, and also between the coherence of a text and cohesiveness of a word list.","However, so far as the similarity between words is concerned, we assume that activated patterns on"]},{"title":"Paradigme","paragraphs":["will approximate the meaning of words, like a still picture can express a story."]},{"title":"7 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We described measurement of semantic similarity between words.

It can be applied to computing the similarity between texts, and measuring the cohesiveness of a text which suggests coherence of the text, as we have seen in Section 5. And, we are now applying it to text segmentation [Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Youmans, 1991], i.e. to capture the shifts of coherent scenes in a story.","In future research, we intend to deal with syntagmatic relations between words.
