Initially, this research was for the larger part confined to the classical categorial calculi of Ajdukiewicz [1935] and Bar-Hillel [1953], and, in particular, the Lambek cMculus L [Lambek, 1958], [Moortgat, 1988] and some of its close relatives.","Although it turned out to be easily applicable to fairly large sets of linguistic data, one couldn't realistically expect the Lambek calculus to be able to account for all aspects of grammar. The reason for this is the diversity of the constructions found in natural language. The Lambek calculus is good at reflecting surface phrase structure, but runs into problems when other linguistic phenomena are to be described. Consequently, recent work in categorial grammar has shown a trend towards diversification of the ways in which the linguistic algebra is structured, with an accompanying ramification of proof theory.","One of the main innovations of the past few years has been the introduction of unary type connectives, usually termed"]},{"title":"modalities,","paragraphs":["that are used to reflect certain special features linguistic entities may possess.

For example, Moortgat & Morrill [1992] present an account of dependency structure in terms of headed prosodic trees, using a calculus that possesses two product operators instead of just one. On the basis of this, Moortgat [1992] sketches a landscape of substructural logics parametrized by properties such as commutativity, associativity and dependency. He then goes on to show how structural modalities can be used to locally enhance or constrain the possibilities of type combination. Morrill [1992] has a non-associative prosodic calculus, and uses a structural modality to reintroduce associativity at certain points.","The picture that emerges is the following. Instead of the single product operator of L, one considers a range of different product operators, reflecting different modes of linguistic structuring. This results in a landscape of substructural logics, which are ultimately to be combined into a single system. Specific linguistic phenomena are given an account in terms of type constructors that are specially tailored for their description. On certain occasions it is necessary for entities to 'escape' the rules of the type constructor that governs their behaviour. This is achieved by means of structural modalities, which license controlled travel through the substructural landscape.","Venema [1993a] proves a completeness theorem, with respect to the mentioned algebraic interpretation, for the Lambek calculus extended with a permutation modality. He modifies the proof system by introducing a type constant Q which refers explicitily to the subalgebra Lo. This proof system is adapted to cover a whole range of substructural logics in [Venema, 1993b]. However, the semantics given in that paper, which is adopted from Dogen [1988; 1989], differs in several respects from the one discussed above. Most importantly, models are required to possess a partial order with a well-behaved interaction with the product operation. In the remainder of this paper we will give a fairly general definition of the notion of a resource-preserving logic. The proof theory of these logics is based on that of Venema, while their semantics, with respect to which a completeness theorem will be established, is similar to that of Hepple and Morrill."]},{"title":"2 Resource-preserving logics with structural modalities","paragraphs":["2.1 Syntax","The languages of the logics that will be considered","here are specified by the following parameters: t~ Three finite, disjoint index sets Z, J and/C;","A finite set B of basic types.","Given these, we define the following sets of expres-","sions:","The set of binary type connectives","c = {/i, \\0~z;","Two sets of unary type connectives","M~ = {Aj}je.~ and M v = {~Tk}~¢Jc; ~, The set of type constants"]},{"title":"q = {Qj}j~ u {Qk}kE~;","paragraphs":["The set of types T, being the inductive closure","of B U Q under C U Mz~ U M e;","The set of structural connectives SC = {oi}iez;","The set of slructures S, being the inductive clo-","sure of T under SC;","c, The set of sequents {F b A I r • S,A • T}.

Modalities/Xj are those whose structural rules only apply when all types involved are prefixed with them, whereas only a single type prefixed with XTk needs to be involved in order for the accompanying structural rules to be applicable. 2.2 Equational specifications We will use equational specifications to describe the structural behaviour of connectives and modalities, as well as the algebraic structures in which these are interpreted. To start with, we recall several important definitions and results. 378","A signature E is a collection of function symbols, each of which has a fixed arity. Let V be a countably infinite set of variables. The term algebra T(E, 1)) is defined as the inductive closure of l; under ~. An equational specification is a pair (~,,~) where ~ is a signature and E is a set of equations s = t of terms s,t E T(~,12). A ~-algebra .4 is a set A together with functions F A : A\" --* A for all n-ary function symbols F E ~. A E-algebra .4 is a model for a set of equations E over T(~, N), written as .4 ~ £, if every equation of ~ holds in A. A (E, g)-algebra is a ~-algebra that is a model for £.","Let E be an equational specification.

An equational specification is resource-preserving if all of its member equations are. Note that this definition encompasses the important cases of commutativity and associativity. On the other hand, well-known rules such as weakening and contraction can't be modelled by resource-preserving equations. Not only do they fail to be resource-preserving in the strict sense introduced here, but also they are one-way rules that would have to be described by means of rewrite rules rather than equations. 2.3 Resource-preserving logics A resource-preserving logic is determined by the following:","Instantiation of the language parameters B, Z,",",7 and"]},{"title":"K;","paragraphs":["t, An equational specification E over the signature"]},{"title":"{+~}iEz;","paragraphs":["Two sets of indices {ij}j¢,7, {ik}~er C_ Z;","t> Two sets of equational specifications {Ej}jej","and {Ek}ke/c, where Et is specified over the sig-","nature {+i, } (I E ,7 U K).

However, the third case can't he done in the Lambek calculus, since we have no way of referring to gaps occuring inside larger constituents; we only have access to the periphery. This can be handled by adding a permutation modality VP and assigning to who the type REL/(S/VP NP) to who. This single type assignment works for all three cases. For the third sentence, this is worked out in Figure 1.","As a second example, consider the following noun phrase: the man at the desk For the nouns and the determiner we make the usual type assignments:","the : NP/N man, desk : N From a prosodic point of view, at should be assigned type (N\\N)/NP. However, semantically at combines not just with the noun it modifies, but with the entire noun phrase headed by that noun. Moortgat & Morrill [1992] show how both these desiderata can be fulfilled. First, the type assignment to at is lifted to ((NP/(N\\N))\\NP)/NP in order to force the required semantic combination. This is not the end of the story, because due to the non-associativity of the prosodic algebra we still can't derive a type NP for the man at the desk. To enable this, they add a structural modality VA to the type assignment for at to make it ((NP/VA (N\\N))\\NP)/NP, after which things work out nicely, as is shown by the derivation in Figure 2. 2.6 Cut-elimination and the subformula"]},{"title":"property","paragraphs":["Before turning to the semantics of/~ we will prove the Cut-elimination theorem and subformula property for it, since the latter is essential for the completeness proof, and a corollary to the former. 380","As we remarked earlier, our proof rules are adapted from [Venema, 1993b]. Therefore, we can refer the reader to that paper for most of the Cut-elimination proof. The only notable difference be-tween both systems lies in the structural rules they allow. Note that resource-preservation implies that for any [E(j)]-inference we have the following two simple but important properties (where the complexity of a type is defined as the number of connectives occurring in it):","1. Each type occurring in r occurs also in A, and","vice versa; 2. The complexity of r equals that of A. Therefore, in the case of an [C(0]-inference, we can always move [Cut] upwards like this is done in Venema's paper, and thus obtain an application of [Cut] of lower degree. Hence, [Cut] is eliminable from £.","The subformula property says that any provable sequent has a proof in which only subformulas of that sequent occur. Under the proviso that Qj is considered a subtype of AiA, and QI, of wkA, the subformula property follows from Cut-elimination, since in each inference rule other than [Cut], the premises are made up of subformulas of the conclusion.","Let £. be the logic obtained from £ by adding a set of product connectives {*i}iez to the language, and the following inference rules to the proof system: roiAI-A [,~L] rFh AFB [.~a] r.i A P A roi A F A*i B","Like £, the system £, enjoys Cut-elimination and the subformula property. Note that this implies that if an £-sequent is/:.-derivable, then it is £-derivable. This property will be used several times in the course of the completeness proof.","Now consider a naive top-down 2 proof search strategy. At every step, we have a finite choice of possible applications of an inference rule, and every such application either removes a connective occurence, thus diminishing the complexity of the sequent to he proved, or rewrites the sequent's antecedent to a term of equal complexity. Therefore, if we make sure that a search path is relinquished whenever a sequent reappears on it (which prevents the procedure from entering into an infinite loop), the proof search tree will be finite. This implies that the calculus is decidable. 2.7 Semantics The basis for any model of £ is a (E, C)-algebra ,4, where I] = {+i}iex and the product operation in-terpreting oi is denoted as \"i. We say that 3 C ,4 is an Fd-subalgebra of ,4 if it is closed under .~j, and","2Note that we use the term top-down in the usual sense, i.e. for a proof search procedure that works back from the goal to the axioms.

It is complete if the converse holds, i.e. if all generally valid sequents are derivable. 2.8 Soundness and completeness As usual, the soundness proof boils down to a straightforward induction on the length of a derivation, and we omit it.","For completeness, we start by defining the canonical model .A4.

It remains to be seen whether his approach also works in the present setting.","Although we've tried to give a liberal definition of what constitutes a resource-preserving logic, some choices had to be made in order to keep things manageable.
