We will show that the attribute evaluation order is such that instead of the special-purpose parsing and generation algorithms introduced for M-grammars in Appelo et al.(1987), also Earley-like context-free parsing and ordinary generation strategies can be used. Furthermore, it is illustrated that the attribute grammar approach gives an insight into the weak generative capacity of M-grammars and into the computational complexity of the parsing and generation process.

The original Rosetta grammar formalism, called M-grammars, was a computational variant of Montague grammar. The formalism was introduced in Landsbergen(1981). Whereas rules in Montague grammar operate on strings, M-grammar rules (M-rules) operate on labelled ordered trees, called S-trees. The nodes of S-trees are labelled with syntactic categories and attribute-value pairs. Because of the reversibility of M-rules, it is possible\" to define two algorithms: M-Parser and M-Generator . The M-Parser algorithm starts with a surface: structure in the form of an S-tree and breaks it down into basic expressions by recursive application of reversed M-rules. The result of the M-Parser algorithm is a syntactic derivation tree which reflects the history of the analysis process. The leaves of the derivation tree are names of basic expressions. The M-Generator algorithm generates a set of S-trees by bottom-up application of M-rules, the names of which are mentioned in a syntactic derivation tree. Analogous to Montague Grammar, with each M-rule a rule is associated which expresses its meaning. This allows for the transformation of a syntactic derivation tree into a semantic derivation tree by replacing the name of each M-rule by the name of the corresponding meaning rule. In Landsbergen (1982) it was shown that the formalism is very well fit to be :used in an interlingual machine translation system in which semantic derivation trees make up the interlingua. In the analysis part of the translation system an S-tree of the source language is mapped onto a set of semantic derivation trees. Next, each semantic derivation tree is mapped onto a set of S-trees of the target language. In order to guarantee that for a sentence which can be analysed by means of the source language grammar a translation can always be generated using the target language grammar, source and target grammars in the Rosetta system are attuned. Grammars, attuned in the way described in Landsbergen (1982), are called isomorphic. Appelo et al.(1987) introduces some extensions of the formalism, which make it possible to assign more structure to an M-grammar. The new formalism was called controlled M-grammars. In this new approach a grammar consists of ~ set of subgrammars. Each of the subgrammars contains a set of M-rules and a regular expression over the alphabet of rule names. The set of M-rules is subdivided into meaningful rules and transformations. Transformations have no semantic relevance and will therefore not occur in a derivation tree. The regular expression can be looked at as a prescription of the order in which the rules of the subgrammar have to be applied. Because of these changes in the formalism, new versions of the M-Parser and M-Generator algorithm were introduced which were able to deal with subgrammars. These algorithms, however, are complex and result in a rather cumbersome implementation. In this paper we will show that they can be replaced by normal context-free parse and generation algorithms if we interpret an M-grammar as the specification of an attribute grammar (Knuth (1968), Deransart et al.(1988)). M-grammars as attribute grammars The control expression which is used in the definition of a Rosetta subgrammar specifies a regular language over the alphabet of rule names. Another way to define such a language is by means of a regular grammar. Let control expression cei of subgrammar i define the regular language £(i). Then we can construct a minimal regular grammar rgi which defines the same language. The grammar rgi will have the following form: • A set of non-terminals Ni = {~/ ..... I/M' }","• A set of terminals Ei. Ei is the smMlest set such that there is a terminal f EEi for e~u:h M-rule r . • Start symbol I ° • 210 -","• A set of production rules P~ containing the following type of rules:","- I~ \"* ~I~, where f E El"]},{"title":"_ _.","paragraphs":["We will use the regular grammar defined above as a starting point for the construction of an attributed subgrammar. An elegant view of attribute grammars can be found in Hemerik (1984). Hemerik defines an attribute grammar as a context free grammar with parametrized non-terminals and production rules. In general, non. terminals may have a number of parameters, attributes - associated with them. Production rules of an attribute grammar are pairs (rule form, rule condition). From a rule form, production rules can be obtained by means of substitution of values for the attribute variables that satisfy the rule condition. In the grammars presented in this paper, non-terminals have only one attribute of type S-tree. The attribute grammar rules that are used throughout this paper also have a very restricted form.

For each subgrammar rgi, (1 < i < M) we will construct an attributed subgrammar agi. Each constructed attributed subgrammar agi will have a start symbol J'T/. First, however, we define two new attributed subgrammars that have no direct relation with a subgrammar of a given M-grammar: the start subgrammar and the terminal subgrammar.

Next, in the second stage, the attributes ate calculated. However, measure conditions on the attributes are necessary to guarantee termination of the parse process. These measure conditions are constraints on the size (according to a Certain measure) of the attribute values that occur in each cycle of the underlying context free grammar. The generative interpretation of amg X can be used in a straight-forward language generator which generates all corresponding elements of £(X) for a given value of the designated attribute.

The precise form of the termination conditions, however, is not imposed by the M-grammar formalism.

In order to get an idea of the weak generative capacity of the formalism, we assume, for the moment, the weakest condition that guarantees termination. It can be shown that each deterministic Turing Machine can be implemented by means of an amg such that the language defined by the TM is the output language of that amg. Not all grammars that can be constructed in this way satify the termination condition, however. The termination condition is only satisfied by Turing Machines that halt on all inputs, which is exactly the class of machines that define the set of all recursive languages. Consequently, the output languages that can be defined by amg's or M-grammars, in principle, are the languages that can be recognized by deterministic Taring Machines in finite time.

The M-grammax formalism clearly belongs to the category of linguistic tools. By strengthening the termination conditions it is possible to restrict the class of output languages that can be defined by an amg. For instance, the class of output languages can be restricted to the languages that are recognizable by a deterministic TM in 2 c\" time a if we assume that the termination conditions imposed on an amg are the weakest conditions that satisfy the constralnts formulated in Rounds (1973).

The strings - 213, of the language defined by an samg are prefix representations of semantic derivation trees. The language defined by an samg is called the set of strings which are well-]ormed with respect to X. Let us repeat here what it means for two M-grammars to be isomorphic: \"...Two grammars are isomorphic iff each semantic derivation tree which is welbformed with respect to one grammar is also well-formed with respect to the other grammar...\" (Landsbergen (1987)). We can reformulate the original definition of isomorphic M-grammars in ~. very elegant way for samg's: Definition: Two samg's X~ and X2 are isomorphic iff they are equivalent, that is iff £(XI) = £(X2) This definition says that writing isomorphic grammars comes down to writing two attribute grammars which define the same language. From formal language theory (e.g. Hopcroft and Ullman (1979)) we know that there is no algorithm that can test an arbitrary p~ir of context-free grammars G1 and G2 to determine whether £(G~) = £(G2). It can also be shown that samg's can define any recursive language. Consequently, checking the equivalence of two arbitrary samg's will be an un. decidable problem. Rosetta grammars that are used for translation purposes, however, are not arbitrary samg's: they are not created completely independently. The strategy followed in Rosetta to accomplish the definition of equivalent grammars, that is, grammars that define identical languages, is to attune two samg's to each other. This grammar attuning strategy is extensively described in Appelo et al.(1987), Landsbergen (1982) and Landsbergen (1987) for ordinary M-grammars. Here, we will show what the attuning strategy means in the context of samg's, together with a few extensions. The attuning measures below must not be looked at as the weakest possible conditions that guarantee isomorphy. The list merely is an enumeration of conditions which together should help to establish isomorphy. If two samg's Xa and X2 have to be isomorphic, the following measures are proposed:",", The production rules of both samg's must be consistent. ;. If both grammars have a production rule ii~ Which the name of the meaning rule m appears, then the right-hand side of the rules should contain the same number of non terminals, since m is a function with a fixed number of arguments, independent of the grammar it is used in.",", The terminal sets o] both samg's should be ~uaP. In the context of the ordin~y M-grammar formalism this condition is formulated as: - for each basic expression in one M-grammar there has to be at least one basic expression in the other M-grammar with the same meaning (which comes","aThis condition is equivalent to the attuning measures described in Appelo et al. (1987), Landsbergen (1982)and Landsbergen(1987). down to the condition that the terminal set of the terminal subgrammars should be identical) - for each meaningful rule in one M-grammar there has to be at least one meaningful rule in the other M-graanmar which has the same meaning.","• The underlying contezt Jree grammars oJ both samg's should be equivalent. Equivalence of the underlying context free grammars can be established by putting an equivalenee condition on the underlying grammar of corresponding subgrammars of the samg's in question. Suppose that for each subgrammar of an samg • X1 a subgrammar of another samg 3(2 would exist that performs the same linguistic task and vice versa. Such an ideal situation could be expressed by a relation g on the sets of subgrammars of both samg's. Let i and j be subgrammars of the samg's X1 and Xa respectively, such that (i, j) E g, then the underlying grammars 4 Bi and B i have to be constructed in such a way that they define the same language. ( Notice that Bi and B i are regular grammars.) More formally: v(i,i) e g: c(B,) = ~(oi). ~ The three attuning conditions above guarantee that the underlying context free grammars of two attuned samg's are equivalent. However, the language defined by an samg is a subset of the language defined by its underlying grammar. The rule conditions determine which elements are in the subset and which are not. Because of the great expressive power of M-rules, the attuning measures place no effective restrictions on the kind of languages an samg can define. Hence, it can be proved that: Theorem: The question whether two attuned samg's are isomorphic is undecidable. Because of the equivalence between samg's and M-grammars this also applies to arbitrary attuned M-gr~nmars. Future research is needed to find extensions for the attuning measures in a way that guarantees isom0tphy if grammar writers adhere to the attuning condil~ions. The extensions will probably include restrictions on the form of the underlying grammar and on the expressive power of M-rules. Also formal attuning measures between M-rules or sets of M-rules of different grammars are conceivable.","4Because we are dealing with a subgrammar, the non-terminal S is discarded from the production rules of the underlying grammar.","SThis attuning measure sketches an ideal sittmtion.

Conclusions In thib paper we presented the interpretation of an M-grammar as a specification of an attribute grammar. We showed that the resulting attribute grammar is reversible and that it can be used in ordinary context free recognition and generation algorithms. The generation algorithm is to be used in the analysis phase of Rosetta, whereas the recognition algorithm should be used in the generation phase. With respect to the weak generative capacity it has been concluded that the set of languages that can be generated and recognized depends on the termination conditions that are imposed on the grammar. If the weakest termination condition is assumed, the set of languages that can be defined by an M-grammar is equivalent to the set of languages that can be recognized by a deterministic Turin8 Machine in finite time. Using more realistic termination conditions, the computational complexity of the recognition and generation problem can still be classified as NP-hard and, consequently, as computationally intractable. Finally, it was concluded that the question whether two attuned M-grammars are isomorphic, is undecidable.
