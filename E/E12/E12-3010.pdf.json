In this study we quantify and compare the occurrence of this phenomenon in these two languages. Next, we evaluate null subjects’ translation into French, a “non pro-drop” language. We use the Europarl corpus to evaluate two MT systems on their performance regarding null subject translation: Its-2, a rule-based system developed at LATL, and a statistical system built using the Moses toolkit. Then we add a rule-based preprocessor and a statistical post-editor to the Its-2 translation pipeline. A second evaluation of the improved Its-2 system shows an average increase of 15.46% in correct pro-drop translations for Italian-French and 12.80% for Spanish-French."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Romance languages are characterized by some morphological and syntactical similarities. Italian and Spanish, the two languages we are interested in here, share the null subject parameter, also called the pro-drop parameter, among other characteristics. The null subject parameter refers to whether the subject of a sentence is overtly expressed or not (Haegeman, 1994). In other words, due to their rich morphology, Italian and Spanish allow non lexically-realized subject pronouns (also called null subjects, zero pronouns or pro-drop).1","From a monolingual point of view, regarding Spanish, previous work by Ferrández and Peral","1","Henceforth, the terms will be used indiscriminately. (2000) has shown that 46% of verbs in their test corpus had their subjects omitted. Continuation of this work by Rello and Ilisei (2009) has found that in a corpus of 2,606 sentences, there were 1,042 sentences without overtly expressed pronouns, which represents an average of 0.54 null subjects per sentence. As for Italian, many analyses are available from a descriptive and theoretical perspective (Rizzi, 1986; Cardinaletti, 1994, among others), but to the best of our knowledge, there are no corpus studies about the extent this phenomenon has.2","Moreover, althought null elements have been largely treated within the context of Anaphora Resolution (AR) (Mitkov, 2002; Le Nagard and Koehn, 2010), the problem of translating from and into a pro-drop language has only been dealt with indirectly within the specific context of MT, as Gojun (2010) points out.","We address three goals in this paper: i) to compare the occurrence of a same syntactic feature in Italian and Spanish, ii) to evaluate the translation of null subjects into French, that is, a “non pro-drop” language; and, iii) to improve the translation of null subjects in a rule-based MT system. Next sections follow the above scheme."]},{"title":"2 Null subjects in source corpora","paragraphs":["We worked with the Europarl corpus (Koehn, 2005) in order to have a parallel comparative corpus for Italian and Spanish. From this corpus, we manually analyzed 1,000 sentences in both languages.

We then counted the occurrences of verbs with pro-drop and classified them in two categories: personal pro-drop3","and impersonal pro-drop4",", obtaining a total amount of 1,041 pro-drop in Italian and 1,312 in Spanish.

It has 4.92% more personal pro-drop and 5.83% more impersonal pro-drop than Italian. The contrast of personal pro-drop is due to a syntactic difference between the two languages. In Spanish, sentences like (1a.) make use of two pro-drop pronouns while the same syntactic structure uses a pro-drop pronoun and an infinitive clause in Italian (1b.), hence, the presence of more personal pro-drop in Spanish.","(1) a. ES pro le pido (1.sg) que pro intervenga (3.sg) con el prestigio de su cargo.","b. IT pro le chiedo (1.sg) di intervenire (inf.) con il prestigio della sua carica. I ask you to intervene with the prestige of your position.","The difference of impersonal pro-drop, on the other hand, is due to the Spanish use of an impersonal construction (2a.) with the “ se” particle. Spanish follows the schema “ se + finite verb + non-finite verb”; Italian follows the schema “finite verb + essere (to be) + past participle” (2b.). We considered this construction formed by one more verb in Italian than in Spanish as shown in examples (2a.) and (2b.). This also explains the difference in the total amount of verbs (Table 1).","(2) a. ES Se podrá corregir. b.

(2010) on the Live Memories corpus for Italian and by Recasens and Martı́ (2010) on the Spanish AnCora-Co corpus (Table 2). Note that in both of these studies, they were interested in co-reference links, hence they did not annotate impersonal pronouns, claiming they are rare.

We tested two systems: Its-2 (Wehrli et al., 2009), a rule-based MT system developed at the LATL; and a statistical system built using the Moses toolkit out of the box (Koehn et al., 2007). The latter was trained on 55,000 sentence pairs from the Europarl corpus and tuned on 2,000 additional sentence pairs, and includes a 3-gram language model.","Tables 3 and 4 show percentages of correct, incorrect and missing translations of personal and impersonal null subjects calculated on the basis of the number of personal and impersonal pro-drop found in the corpus.","We considered the translation correct when the null pronoun is translated by an overt pronoun with the correct gender, person and number features in French; otherwise, we considered it incorrect. Missing translation refers to cases where the null pronoun is not generated at all in the target language.","We chose these criteria because they allow us to evaluate the single phenomenon of null subject 82","Its-2","Pair Pro-drop Correct Incorrect Missing personal 66.34% 3.49% 30.15%","IT→FR impersonal 16.78% 18.97% 64.23% average 46.78% 9.6% 43.61% personal 55.79% 3.50% 40.70%","ES→FR impersonal 29.29% 11.40% 59.29% average 44.28% 6.93% 48.78% Table 3: Percentages of correct, incorrect and missing translation of zero-pronouns obtained by Its-2.

For the same reason, human evaluation metrics based on adequacy and fluency were not suitable either (Koehn and Monz, 2006).","Moses generally outperforms Its-2 (Tables 3 and 4). Results for the two systems demonstrate that instances of personal pro-drop are better translated than impersonal pro-drop for the two languages. Since rates of missing pronouns translations are considerable, especially for Its-2, results also indicate that both systems have problems resolving non-expressed pronouns for their generation in French. A detailed description for each system follows. 3.1 Results – Its-2 Its-2 obtains better results for IT→FR personal pro-drop (66.34%) than for ES→FR (55.79%), but worse for impersonal pro-drop translation (16.78% and 29.29% respectively, Table 3).","For IT→FR translation in particular, Its-2 usually translates an Italian personal pro-drop with an overt pronoun of incorrect gender in French. In fact, it tends to translate a female personal pro-drop with a masculine overt pronoun. This problem is closely related with that of AR: as the system does not have any module for AR, it cannot detect the gender of the antecedent, rendering the correct translation infeasible.","The number of correct translation of impersonal pro-drop is very low for both pairs. ES→FR reached 29.29%, while IT→FR only 16.78% (Table 3). The reason for these percentages is a regular mistranslation or a missing translation. As for the mistranslation, in the case of Spanish, Its-2 translates the “ se” pronoun in impersonal sentences by the French sequence qui est-ce que (who) (3). We attribute this behaviour to a lack of generation rules.","(3) ES Por consiguiente, mi grupo solicita que se suprima este punto del dı́a. FR Par conséquent, mon groupe sollicite qu’on supprime ce point de l’agenda. ITS-2 * Par conséquent, mon groupe sollicite qui est-ce que supprime ce point du jour. Therefore, my group ask to delete this point from the agenda. 83","With respects to missing pronouns in the target language (Table 3), percentages are quite high in both translation pairs (43.61% and 48.78% average missing pronouns respectively), especially with impersonal pro-drop. Let us take the exemple of ES→FR translation (59.29% missing pronouns): Its-2 never generates the French expletive pronouns “ ce, c’, ca̧” (it) (4a.). For IT→FR translation (64.23% missing pronouns), it almost never generates the French pronoun “ il” (it) for the impersonal 3rd person pro-drop pronoun in Italian (4b.).","However, if the system generates the pronoun, it is likely to be a first or a second person singular pronoun (“ je, tu” – I, you) in French, increasing then the percentages of incorrectly translated impersonal pro-drop.","(4) a. ES No es pedir demasiado. FR Ce n’est pas trop demander. ITS-2 * Pas est demander trop. It is not too much to ask.","b. IT È vero che [. . . ]. FR Il est vrai que [. . . ]. ITS-2 * Vrai que [. . . ]. It is true that [. . . ]. 3.2 Results – Moses Moses produces the highest percentage of correct translations for both personal and impersonal pro-drop, particularly in ES→FR (72.64% and 54.56% respectively, Table 4).","When translating personal pro-drop from Italian, sometimes the system generates infinitive forms instead of finite verbs (5).","(5) IT Naturalmente accettiamo questo emendamento. FR Bien sûr, nous acceptons cet amendement. MOSES Bien sûr accepter cet amendement. Of course, we accept this amendment.","When translating impersonal pro-drop from Italian, it performs worse (44.76%) because it tends not to generate the expletive pronoun (6).","Furthermore, for both source languages, Moses translates the impersonal pro-drop usually corre-","(6) IT Vorrei, come mi è stato chiesto da alcuni colleghi, osservare un minuto di silenzio.

Two new components were added to the translation pipeline: a rule-based preprocessor, and a statistical post-editor. This section presents them in detail, along with the resources they rely on. 4.1 Rule-based preprocessing Preprocessing of input data is a very common task in natural language processing. Statistical systems often benefit from linguistic preprocessing 84 to deal with rich morphology and long distance reordering issues (Sadat and Habash, 2006; Habash, 2007). In our case, the idea behind this first component is to help the translation process of a rule-based system by reducing the amount of zero pronouns in the source document5",", ensuring that subject pronouns get properly transferred to the target language.","In order to assess the effect of this approach, we implemented a rule-based preprocessor taking as input a document in Italian or Spanish and return-ing as output the same document with dropped subject pronouns restored. It relies on two resources: a list of personal and impersonal verbs, and a part-of-speech tagging of the source document. We first present these two resources before describing the approach in more detail. List of personal and impersonal verbs","This list simply contains surface forms of verbs. For our experiment, these forms were extracted from a subset of the Europarl corpus, where pro-drop verbs were manually annotated as taking a personal pronoun or an impersonal pronoun. This limits the coverage, but ensures domain-specific verb usage. Part-of-speech tagging of the source document","Its-2, being a transfer-based system, relies on a parser to construct the syntactic structure of the source language and, from there, it transfers the syntactic structure onto the target language. Its-2 uses Fips (Wehrli, 2007), a multilingual parser also developed at LATL. Apart from the projec-tion of syntactic structures, Fips produces part-of-speech tagging. Outline of the approach","These are the steps followed by the preprocessor: 1. Read a part-of-speech tagged sentence.","2. Whenever a verb with no subject is encountered, check if it is a personal verb or an impersonal verb.","5","In Italian and Spanish, even if a native speaker would not use subject pronouns in a given sentence, the same sentence with overtly expressed subject pronouns is grammatical. There might be a pragmatic difference, as pronouns are used in these languages when emphasis or contrast is desired (Haegeman, 1994).","3. If it is a personal verb, generate the appropriate pronoun before the verb (the masculine form is generated for the third person); if it is an impersonal verb, do not generate any pronoun.","4. Check the sentence for reordering according to syntactic rules of the target language (e.g. move the generated pronoun before a pro-clitic already preceding the verb).","An example of preprocessed sentences is given in Figure 1. 4.2 Statistical post-editing Since the work of Simard et al. (2007a), statistical post-editing (SPE) has become a very popular technique in the domain of hybrid MT. The idea is to train a statistical phrase-based system in order to improve the output of a rule-based system. The statistical post-editing component is trained on a corpus comprising machine translated sentences on the source side (translations produced by the underlying rule-based system), and their corresponding reference translations on the target side. In a sense, SPE “translates” from imperfect target language to target language. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations have shown that SPE can achieve significant improvements over the output of the underlying rule-based system (Simard et al., 2007b; Schwenk et al., 2009).","We decided to incorporate a post-editing component in order to assess if this approach can specifically address the issue of dropped subject pronouns. We first present the training corpus before describing the approach in more detail. Training corpus","To train the translation model, we translated a subset of the Europarl corpus using Its-2. The translations were then aligned with corresponding reference translations, resulting in a parallel corpus for each language pair, composed of 976 sentences for IT→FR and 1,005 sentences for ES→FR. We opted for machine translations also on the target side, rather than human reference translations, in order to ascertain if a parallel corpus produced in such a way, with significantly lesser cost and time requirements, could be an effective alternative for specific natural language processing tasks. 85 Source in Italian pro La ringrazio, onorevole Segni, pro lo farò volentieri. Preprocessed Io la ringrazio , onorevole Segni , io lo farò volentieri .","I thank you, Mr. Segni, I will do it willingly.

Preprocessed Todo ello, de conformidad con los principios que nosotros siempre hemos","apoyado.","All this, according to the principles we have always supported. Figure 1: Output of the preprocessor: the pronoun in the first sentence is generated before the procliticlo, and the pronoun in the second sentence is generated before the adverb “ siempre” (always).","We reused the language model trained for the Moses experiment of Section 3. Outline of the approach","We trained the SPE component using the Moses toolkit out of the box. With this setup, the final translation in French of a source sentence in Italian or Spanish can be obtained in two simple steps: 1. Translate a sentence using Its-2.","2. Give the translated sentence as input to the SPE component; the output of the SPE component is the final translation.","An example of post-edited translations is given in Figure 2.","4.3 Combination of preprocessing and post-editing The two components described in the previous sections can be used separately, or combined together as the first and last elements of the same translation pipeline. With respect to the generation of pronouns, error analysis showed that the setup producing the best translations was in-deed the combination of preprocessing and post-editing, which was therefore used in the full post-evaluation described in the next section. The example in Figure 3 illustrates progressive improvements (with respect to the generation of pronouns) achieved by using preprocessing and post-editing over the baseline Its-2 translation."]},{"title":"5 Post-evaluation","paragraphs":["After adding the two components, we manually re-evaluated the translations of the same 1,000 sentences. Table 5 show percentages of correct, incorrect and missing translation of null subjects in a comparative way: the first columns show percentages obtained by the baseline Its-2 system6 while the second columns show percentages obtained by the improved system.","Results show higher percentages of correct pro-drop translation for both language pairs, with an average increase of 15.46% for IT→FR, and 12.80% for ES→FR. Specifically, percentages of personal pro-drop translation for both pairs increased almost the same rate: 13.18% for IT→FR; 13.34% for ES→FR. It was not the case for impersonal pro-drop, where rates of the first pair augmented (18.98%), while the latter decreased (12.11%).","We explain this behaviour to a particular difficulty encountered when translating from Spanish, a language that largely prefers subjunctive mood clauses to other structures such as infinitive clauses. The problem arises because subjunctive tenses have a less distinctive morphology, with the same conjugation for the first and third person singular (9).","(9) ES pro le pido (1.sg) que pro estudie (3.sg) un borrador de carta.

As it is a rule-base system, some problems as the subject pronoun mistranslation in subordinated sentences can be fixed by means of more specific rules and heuristics. Besides, an approach based on binding theory (Büring, 2005) could be effective as deep syntactic information is available, even though limited. For example, binding theory does not contain any formalization on gender, reason why a specific statistical component could be a more ideal op-tion in order to tackle aspects such as masculine/feminine pronouns.","Secondly, an overt pronoun cannot be restored from a finite impersonal verb without making the sentence ungrammatical; therefore, our approach is not useful for treating impersonal sentences. As a consequence, we think that an annotation of the empty category, as done by Chung and Gildea (2010), could provide better results.","Also, in order to correctly render the meaning of a preprocessed sentence, we plan to mark restored subject pronouns in such a way that the information about their absence/presence in the original text is preserved as a feature in parsing and translation.","Finally, we would like to use a larger corpus to train the SPE component and compare the effects of utilizing machine translations on the target side versus human reference translations. Besides, we would like to further explore variations on the plain SPE technique, for example, by injecting Moses translation of sentences being translated into the phrase-table of the post-editor (Chen and Eisele, 2010)."]},{"title":"7 Conclusion","paragraphs":["In this paper we measured and compared the occurrence of one syntactic feature – the null subject parameter – in Italian and Spanish. We also evaluated its translation into a “non pro-drop” language, that is, French, obtaining better results for personal pro-drop than for impersonal pro-drop, for both Its-2 and Moses, the two MT systems we tested.","We then improved the rule-based system using a rule-based preprocessor to restore pro-drop as overt pronouns and a statistical post-editor to correct the translation. Results obtained from the second evaluation showed an improvement in the translation of both sorts of pronouns. In particular, the system now generates more pronouns in French than before, confirming the advantage of using a combination of preprocessing and post-editing with rule-based machine translation."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This work has been supported in part by the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant No 100015-130634)."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Daniel Büring. 2005.
