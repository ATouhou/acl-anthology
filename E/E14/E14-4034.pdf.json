In order to consistently train a translation model, we perform hierarchical phrase-based decoding on training data to find derivations between the source and target sentences. This is done by synchronous parsing the given sentence pairs. After extracting k-best derivations, we reestimate the translation model probabilities based on collected rule counts. We show the effectiveness of our procedure on the IWSLT German→English and English→French translation tasks. Our results show improvements of up to 1.6 points BLEU."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["In state of the art statistical machine translation systems, the translation model is estimated by following heuristic: Given bilingual training data, a word alignment is trained with tools such as GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) or fast align (Dyer et al., 2013). Then, all valid translation pairs are extracted and the translation probabilities are computed as relative frequencies (Koehn et al., 2003).","However, this extraction method causes several problems. First, this approach does not consider, whether a translation pair is extracted from a likely alignment or not. Further, during the extraction process, models employed in decoding are not considered.","For phrase-based translation, a successful approach addressing these issues is presented in (Wuebker et al., 2010). By applying a phrase-based decoder on the source sentences of the training data and constraining the translations to the corresponding target sentences, k-best segmentations are produced. Then, the phrases used for these segmentations are extracted and counted. Based on the counts, the translation model probabilities are recomputed. To avoid over-fitting, leave-one-out is applied.","However, for hierarchical phrase-based translation an equivalent approach is still missing.","In this paper, we present a simple and effective approach for consistent reestimation of the translation model probabilities in a hierarchical phrase-based translation setup. Using a heuristically extracted translation model as starting point, the training data are parsed bilingually. From the resulting hypergraphs, we extract k-best derivations and the rules applied in each derivation. This is done with a top-down k-best parsing algorithm. Finally, the translation model probabilities are re-computed based on the counts of the extracted rules. In our procedure, we employ leave-one-out to avoid over-fitting. Further, we consider all models which are used in translation to ensure a consistent training.","Experimental results are presented on the German→English and English→French IWSLT shared machine translation task (Cettolo et al., 2013). We are able to gain improvements of up to 1.6% BLEU absolute and 1.4% TER over a competitive baseline. On all tasks and test sets, the improvements are statistically significant with at least 99% confidence.","The paper is structured as follow. First, we revise the state of the art hierarchical phrase-based extraction and translation process. In Section 3, we propose our training procedure. Finally, experimental results are given in Section 4 and we conclude with Section 5."]},{"title":"2 Hierarchical Phrase-based Translation","paragraphs":["In hierarchical phrase-based translation (Chiang, 2005), discontinuous phrases with “gaps” are allowed. The translation model is formalized as a synchronous context-free grammar (SCFG) 174 and consists of bilingual rules, which are based on bilingual standard phrases and discontinuous phrases. Each bilingual rule rewrites a generic non-terminal X into a pair of strings f̃ and ẽ with both terminals and non-terminals in both languages X → ⟨ f̃ , ẽ⟩. (1) In a standard hierarchical phrase-based translation setup, obtaining these rules is based on a heuristic extraction from automatically word-aligned bilingual training data. Just like in the phrase-based approach, all bilingual rules of a sentence pair are extracted given an alignment. The standard phrases are stored as lexical rules in the rule set. In addition, whenever a phrase contains a sub-phrase, this sub-phrase is replaced by a generic non-terminal X. With these hierarchical phrases we can define the hierarchical rules in the SCFG. The rule probabilities which are in general defined as relative frequencies are computed based on the joint counts C(X → ⟨ f̃ , ẽ⟩) of a bilingual rule X → ⟨ f̃ , ẽ⟩","pH ( f̃ |ẽ) = C(X → ⟨ f̃ , ẽ⟩) ∑ f̃′ C(X → ⟨ f̃ ′",", ẽ⟩) . (2)","The translation probabilities are computed in source-to-target as well as in target-to-source direction. In the translation processes, these probabilities are integrated in the log-linear combination among other models such as a language model, word lexicon models, word and phrase penalty and binary features marking hierarchical phrases, glue rule and rules with non-terminals at the boundaries.","The translation process of hierarchical phrase-based approach can be considered as parsing problem. Given an input sentence in the source language, this sentence is parsed using the source language part of the SCFG. In this work, we perform this step with a modified version of the CYK+ algorithm (Chappelier and Rajman, 1998). The out-put of this algorithm is a hypergraph, which represents all possible derivations of the input sentence. A derivation represents an application of rules from the grammar to generate the given input sentence. Using the the associated target part of the applied rule, for each derivation a translation can be constructed. In a second step, the language model score is incorporated. Given the hypergraph, this is done with the cube pruning algorithm presented in (Chiang, 2007)."]},{"title":"3 Translation Model Training","paragraphs":["We propose following pipeline for consistent hierarchical phrase-based training: First we train a word alignment, from which the baseline translation model is extracted as described in the previous section. The log-linear parameter weights are tuned with MERT (Och, 2003) on a development set to produce the baseline system. Next, we perform decoding on the training data. As the translations are constrained to the given target sentences, we name this step forced decoding in the following. Details are given in the next subsection. Given the counts CF D(X → ⟨ f̃ , ẽ⟩) of the rules, which have been applied in the forced decoding step, the translation probabilities pF D( f̃ |ẽ) for the translation model are recomputed:","pF D( f̃ |ẽ) = CF D(X → ⟨ f̃ , ẽ⟩) ∑ f̃′ CF D(X → ⟨ f̃ ′",", ẽ⟩) . (3)","Finally, using the translation model with the reestimated probabilities, we retune the log-linear parameter weights and obtain our final system. 3.1 Forced Decoding In this section, we describe the forced decoding for hierarchical phrase-based translation in detail.","Given a sentence pair of the training data, we constrain the translation of the source sentence to produce the corresponding target sentence. For this constrained decoding process, the language model score is constant as the translation is fixed. Hence, the incorporation of the a language model is not needed. This results in a simplification of the decoding process as we do not have to employ the cube pruning algorithm as described in the previous section. Consequently, forced decoding for hierarchical phrase-based translation is equivalent to synchronous parsing of the training data. Dyer (2010) has described an approach to reduce the average-case run-time of synchronous parsing by splitting one bilingual parse into two successive monolingual parses. We adopt this method and first parse the source sentence and then the target sentence with CYK+.","If the given sentence pair has been parsed successfully, we employ a top-down k-best parsing algorithm (Chiang and Huang, 2005) on the resulting hypergraph to find the k-best derivations between the given source and target sentence. In this step, all models of the translation process are 175 included (except for the language model). Further, leave-one-out is applied to counteract overfitting. Note, that the model weights of the baseline system are used to perform forced decoding.","Finally, we extract and count the rules which have been applied in the derivations. These counts are used to recompute the translation probabilities. 3.2 Recombination In standard hierarchical phrase-based decoding, partial derivations that are indistinguishable from each other are recombined. In (Huck et al., 2013) two schemes are presented. Either derivations that produce identical translations or derivations with identical language model context are recombined. As in forced decoding the translation is fixed and a language model is missing, both schemes are not suitable.","However, a recombination scheme is necessary to avoid derivations with the same application of rules. Further, recombining such derivations increases simultaneously the amounts of considered derivations during k-best parsing. Given two derivations with the same set of applied rules, the order of application of the rules may be different. Thus, we propose following scheme for recombining derivations in forced decoding: Derivations that produce identical sets of applied rules are recombined. Figure 1 shows an example for k = 3. Employing the proposed scheme, derivations d1 and d2 are recombined since both share the same set of applied rules ({r1, r3, r2}). d1 : {r1, r3, r2} d2 : {r3, r2, r1} d3 : {r4, r5, r1, r2} (a) d1 : {r1, r3, r2} d3 : {r4, r5, r1, r2} d4 : {r6, r5, r2, r3} (b) Figure 1: Example search space before (a) and after (b) applying recombination."]},{"title":"4 Experiments 4.1 Setup","paragraphs":["The experiments were carried out on the IWSLT 2013 German→English shared translation task.1 1 http://www.iwslt2013.org","German English English French Sentences 4.32M 5.23M Run.

As additional data sources for the LM we selected parts of the Shuffled News and LDC English Gigaword corpora based on crossentropy difference (Moore and Lewis, 2010). In all experiments, the hierarchical search was performed as described in Section 2.","To confirm the efficacy of our approach, additional experiments were run on the IWSLT 2013 English→French task. Statistics are given in Table 1.","The training pipeline was set up as described in the previous section. Tuning of the log-linear parameter weights was done with MERT on a provided development set. As optimization criterion we used BLEU (Papineni et al., 2001).","Forced decoding was performed on the TED talks portion of the training data (∼140K sentences).
