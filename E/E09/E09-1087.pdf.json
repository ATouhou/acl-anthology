For English, after a relatively big jump achieved by (Collins, 2002), we have seen two significant improvements: (Toutanova et al., 2003) and (Shen et al., 2007) pushed the results by a significant amount each time.1","1","In our final comparison, we have also included the results of (Giménez and Màrquez, 2004), because it has surpassed (Collins, 2002) as well and we have used this tagger in the data preparation phase. See more details below. Most recently, (Suzuki and Isozaki, 2008) published their Semi-supervised sequential labelling method, whose results on POS tagging seem to be optically better than (Shen et al., 2007), but no significance tests were given and the tool is not available for download, i.e. for repeating the results and significance testing. Thus, we compare our results only to the tools listed above.","Even though an improvement in POS tagging might be a questionable enterprise (given that its effects on other tasks, such as parsing or other NLP problems are less than clear—at least for English), it is still an interesting problem. Moreover, the “ideal” 2","situation of having a single algorithm (and its implementation) for many (if not all) languages has not been reached yet. We have chosen Collins’ perceptron algorithm because of its simplicity, short training times, and an apparent room for improvement with (substantially) grow-ing data sizes (see Figure 1). However, it is clear that there is usually little chance to get (substantially) more manually annotated data. Thus, we have been examining the effect of adding a large monolingual corpus to Collins’ perceptron, appropriately extended, for two typologically different languages: English and Czech. It is clear however that the features (feature templates) that the taggers use are still language-dependent.","One of the goals is also to have a fast implementation for tagging large amounts of data quickly. We have experimented with various classifier combination methods, such as those described in (Brill and Wu, 1998) or (van Halteren et al., 2001), and got improved results, as expected. However, we view this only as a side effect (yet, a positive one)—our goal was to stay on the turf of single taggers, which are both the common ground for competing on tagger accuracy today and also significantly faster at runtime.3","Nevertheless, we have found that it is advantageous to use them to (pre-)tag the large amounts of plain text data dur-2 We mean easy to use for further research on problems","requiring POS tagging, especially multilingual ones. 3 And much easier to (re)implement as libraries in proto-","type systems, which is often difficult if not impossible with","other people’s code. 763 Training data size (thousands of tokens) Accuracy on development data 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 96.0 96.5 97.0 97.5 98.0 Figure 1: Accuracy of the original averaged perceptron, supervised training on PTB/WSJ (English) ing the training phase.","Apart from feeding the perceptron by various mixtures of manually tagged (“supervised”) and auto-tagged (“unsupervised”) 4","data, we have also used various feature templates extensively; for example, we use lexicalization (with the added twist of lemmatization, useful especially for Czech, an inflectionally rich language), “manual” tag classification into large classes (again, useful especially for Czech to avoid the huge, still-to-be-overcome data sparseness for such a language5","), and sub-lexical features mainly targeted at OOV words. Inspired i.a. by (Toutanova et al., 2003) and (Hajič and Vidová-Hladká, 1998), we also use “lookahead” features (however, we still remain in the left-to-right HMM world – in this respect our solution is closer to the older work of (Hajič and Vidová-Hladká, 1998) than to (Toutanova et al., 2003), who uses bidirectional dependencies to include the right-hand side disambiguated tags,","4","For brevity, we will use the terms “supervised” and “unsupervised” data for “manually annotated” and “(automatically annotated) plain (raw) text” data, respectively, even though these adjectives are meant to describe the process of learning, not the data themselves.","5","As (Hajič, 2004) writes, Czech has 4400 plausible tags, of which we have observed almost 2000 in the 100M corpus we have used in our experiments. However, only 1100 of them have been found in the manually annotated PDT 2.0 corpus (the corpus on which we have based the supervised experiments). The situation with word forms (tokens) is even worse: Czech has about 20M different word forms, and the OOV rate based on the 1.5M PDT 2.0 data and measured against the 100M raw corpus is almost 10 %. which we cannot.)","To summarize, we can describe our system as follows: it is based on (Votrubec, 2006)’s implementation of (Collins, 2002), which has been fed at each iteration by a different dataset consisting of the supervised and unsupervised part: precisely, by a concatenation of the manually tagged training data (WSJ portion of the PTB 3 for English, morphologically disambiguated data from PDT 2.0 for Czech) and a chunk of automatically tagged unsupervised data. The “parameters” of the training process (feature templates, the size of the unsupervised chunks added to the trainer at each iteration, number of iterations, the combination of taggers that should be used in the auto-tagging of the unsupervised chunk, etc.) have been determined empirically in a number of experiments on a development data set. We should also note that as a result of these development-data-based optimizations, no feature pruning has been employed (see Section 4 for details); adding (even lexical) features from the auto-tagged data did not give significant accuracy improvements (and only made the training very slow).","The final taggers have surpassed the current state-of-the-art taggers by significant margins (we have achieved 4.12 % relative error reduction for English and 4.86 % for Czech over the best previously published results, single or combined), using a single tagger. However, the best English tagger combining some of the previous state-of-the-art ones is still “optically” better (yet not significantly—see Section 6)."]},{"title":"2 The perceptron algorithm","paragraphs":["We have used the Morče6","tagger (Votrubec, 2006) as a main component in our experiments. It is a reimplementation of the averaged perceptron described in (Collins, 2002), which uses such features that it behaves like an HMM tagger and thus the standard Viterbi decoding is possible. Collins’ GEN(x) set (a set of possible tags at any given position) is generated, in our case, using a morphological analyzer for the given language (essen-","6","The name “Mor če” stands for “MORfologie ČEštiny” (“Czech morphology”, see (Votrubec, 2006)), since it has been originally developed for Czech. We keep this name in this paper as the generic name of the averaged perceptron tagger for the English-language experiments as well. We have used the version available at http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/morce/. 764 tially, a dictionary that returns all possible tags7 for an input word form). The transition and output scores for the candidate tags are based on a large number of binary-valued features and their weights, which are determined during iterative training by the averaged perceptron algorithm.","The binary features describe the tag being predicted and its context. They can be derived from any information we already have about the text at the point of decision (respecting the HMM-based overall setting). Every feature can be true or false in a given context, so we can consider the true features at the current position to be the description of a tag and its context.","For every feature, the perceptron keeps its weight coefficient, which is (in its basic version) an integer number, (possibly) changed at every training sentence. After its final update, this integer value is stored with the feature to be later retrieved and used at runtime. Then, the task of the perceptron algorithm is to sum up all the coefficients of true features in a given context. The result is passed to the Viterbi algorithm as a transition and output weight for the current state.8","We can express it as w(C, T ) = n∑ i=1 αi.φi(C, T ) (1) where w(C, T ) is the transition weight for tag T in context C, n is the number of features, αi is the weight coefficient of the ith","feature and φ","i(C, T ) is the evaluation of the ith","feature for context C and tag T . In the averaged perceptron, the values of every coefficient are added up at each up-date, which happens (possibly) at each training sentence, and their arithmetic average is used instead.9","This trick makes the algorithm more resistant to weight oscillations during training (or, more precisely, at the end of it) and as a result, it substantially improves its performance.10","7","And lemmas, which are then used in some of the features. A (high recall, low precision) “guesser” is used for OOV words.","8","Which identifies unambiguously the corresponding tag.","9","Implementation note: care must be taken to avoid integer overflows, which (at 100 iterations through millions of sentences) can happen for 32bit integers easily.","10","Our experiments have shown that using averaging helps tremendously, confirming both the theoretical and practical results of (Collins, 2002). On Czech, using the best feature set, the difference on the development data set is 95.96 % vs. 95.02 %. Therefore, all the results presented in the following text use averaging.","The supervised training described in (Collins, 2002) uses manually annotated data for the estimation of the weight coefficients α. The training algorithm is very simple—only integer numbers (counts and their sums for the averaging) are updated for each feature at each sentence with imperfect match(es) found against the gold standard. Therefore, it can be relatively quickly retrained and thus many different feature sets and other training parameters, such as the number of iterations, feature thresholds etc. can be considered and tested. As a result of this tuning, our (fully supervised) version of the Morče tagger gives the best accuracy among all single taggers for Czech and also very good results for English, being beaten only by the tagger (Shen et al., 2007) (by 0.10 % absolute) and (not significantly) by (Toutanova et al., 2003)."]},{"title":"3 The data 3.1 The “supervised” data","paragraphs":["For English, we use the same data division of Penn Treebank (PTB) parsed section (Marcus et al., 1994) as all of (Collins, 2002), (Toutanova et al., 2003), (Giménez and Màrquez, 2004) and (Shen et al., 2007) do; for details, see Table 1. data set tokens sentences","train (0-18) 912,344 38,220 dev-test (19-21) 131,768 5,528 eval-test (22-24) 129,654 5,463 Table 1: English supervised data set — WSJ part of Penn Treebank 3","For Czech, we use the current standard Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT 2.0) data sets (Hajič et al., 2006); for details, see Table 2. data set tokens sentences train 1,539,241 91,049 dev-test 201,651 11,880 eval-test 219,765 13,136 Table 2: Czech supervised data set — Prague Dependency Treebank 2.0 3.2 The “unsupervised” data For English, we have processed the North American News Text corpus (Graff, 1995) (without the 765 WSJ section) with the Stanford segmenter and to-kenizer (Toutanova et al., 2003). For Czech, we have used the SYN2005 part of Czech National Corpus (CNC, 2005) (with the original segmentation and tokenization). 3.3 GEN(x): The morphological analyzers For English, we perform a very simple morphological analysis, which reduces the full PTB tagset to a small list of tags for each token on input. The resulting list is larger than such a list derived solely from the PTB/WSJ, but much smaller than a full list of tags found in the PTB/WSJ.11","The English morphological analyzer is thus (empirically) optimized for precision while keeping as high recall as possible (it still overgenerates). It consists of a small dictionary of exceptions and a small set of general rules, thus covering also a lot of OOV tokens.12","For Czech, the separate morphological analyzer (Hajič, 2004) usually precedes the tagger. We use the version from April 2006 (the same as (Spoustová et al., 2007), who reported the best previous result on Czech tagging)."]},{"title":"4 The perceptron feature sets","paragraphs":["The averaged perceptron’s accuracy is determined (to a large extent) by the set of features used. A feature set is based on feature templates, i.e. general patterns, which are filled in with concrete values from the training data. Czech and English are morphosyntactically very different languages, therefore each of them needs a different set of feature templates. We have empirically tested hundreds of feature templates on both languages, taken over from previous works for direct comparison, inspired by them, or based on a combination of previous experience, error analysis and linguistic intuition.","In the following sections, we present the best performing set of feature templates as determined on the development data set using only the supervised training setting; our feature templates have thus not been influenced nor extended by the unsupervised data.13 11 The full list of tags, as used by (Shen et al., 2007), also","makes the underlying Viterbi algorithm unbearably slow. 12 The English morphology tool is also downloadable as a","separate module on the paper’s accompanying website. 13 Another set of experiments has shown that there is not,","perhaps surprisingly, a significant gain in doing so. 4.1 English feature templates The best feature set for English consists of 30 feature templates. All templates predict the current tag as a whole.

Such a feature is true, in an identical context, for several different tags belonging to the same class (e.g., sharing a locative case). The individual grammatical categories used for such classing have been chosen on both linguistic grounds (POS, detailed finegrained POS) and also such categories have been used which contribute most to the elimination of the tagger errors (based on an extensive error analysis of previous results, the detailed description of which can be found in (Votrubec, 2006)).","Several features can look ahead (to the right of the current position) - apart from the obvious word form, which is unambiguous, we have used (in case of ambiguity) a random tag and lemma of the first position to the right from the current position which might be occupied with a verb (based on dictionary and the associated morphological guesser restrictions).","A total of 8,440,467 features has been extracted from the supervised training data set.

In other words, the training algorithm proper does not change at all: it is the data and their selection (including the selection of the way they are automatically tagged) that makes all the difference.","The following “parameters” of the (unsupervised part of the) data selection had to be determined experimentally:","• the tagging process for tagging the selected data","• the selection mechanism (sequential or random with/without replacement) • the size to use for each iteration","• and the use and order of concatenation with the manually tagged data.","We have experimented with various settings to arrive at the best performing configuration, described below. In each subsection, we compare the result of our ,,winning“ configuration with results of the experiments which have the selected attributes omitted or changed; everything is measured on the development data set. 5.1 Tagging the plain data In order to simulate the labeled training events, we have tagged the unsupervised data simply by a combination of the best available taggers. For practical reasons (to avoid prohibitive training times), we have tagged all the data in advance, i.e. no re-tagging is performed between iterations.","The setup for the combination is as follows (the idea is simplified from (Spoustová et al., 2007) where it has been used in a more complex setting): 1. run N different taggers independently;","2. join the results on each position in the data from the previous step — each token thus ends up with between 1 and N tags, a union of the tags output by the taggers at that position;","3. do final disambiguation (by a single tag-ger14",").

A bit surprisingly, the final setup is very similar for both languages (two taggers to tag the data in Step 1, and a third one to finish it up).","For English, we use three state-of-the-art taggers: the taggers of (Toutanova et al., 2003) and (Shen et al., 2007) in Step 1, and the SVM tagger (Giménez and Màrquez, 2004) in Step 3. We run the taggers with the parameters which were shown to be the best in the corresponding papers. The SVM tagger needed to be adapted to accept the (reduced) list of possible tags.17","For Czech, we use the Feature-based tagger (Hajič, 2004) and the Morče tagger (with the new feature set as described in section 4) in Step 1, and an HMM tagger (Krbec, 2005) in Step 3. This combination outperforms the results in (Spoustová et al., 2007) by a small margin. 5.2 Selection mechanism for the plain data We have found that it is better to feed the training with different chunks of the unsupervised data at each iteration.

These methods are: simple sequential chopping, randomized data selection with replacement and randomized selection without replacement. Table 5 demonstrates that there is practically no difference in the results. Thus, we use the sequential chopping mechanism, mainly for its simplicity.

The best results (on the development data set) have been achieved with the unsupervised chunks containing approx. 4 million tokens for English and 1 million tokens for Czech. Each training process consists of (at most) 100 iterations (Czech) or 50 iterations (English); therefore, for the 50 (100) iterations we needed only about 200,000,000 (100,000,000) tokens of raw texts. The best development data set results have been (with the current setup) achieved on the 44th (English) and 33th (Czech) iteration.","The development data set has been also used to determine the best way to “merge” the manually labeled data (the PTB/WSJ and the PDT 2.0 training data) and the unsupervised parts of the data. Given the properties of the perceptron algorithm, it is not too surprising that the best solution is to put (the full size of) the manually labeled data first, followed by the (four) million-token chunk of the automatically tagged data (different data in each chunk but of the same size for each iteration). It corresponds to the situation when the trainer is periodically “returned to the right track” by giving it the gold standard data time to time.","Figure 2 (English) and especially Figure 3 (Czech) demonstrate the perceptron behavior in cases where the supervised data precede the unsupervised data only in selected iterations.

It is practically impossible to perform the unsupervised training with the full list of tags (it would take several years instead of several days with the default setup), thus we compare only the results with morphological analyzer to the results with the list of tags derived from the training data, see Table 8.","It can be expected (some approximated experiments were performed) that the results with the full list of tags would be very similar to the results with the morphological analyzer, i.e. the morphological analyzer is used mainly for technical reasons.

For English, we found that excluding the state-of-the-art-tagger (in fact, a carefully selected combination of taggers yielding significantly higher quality than any of them has) drops the resulting accuracy the most (0.2 absolute). Significant yet smaller drop (less than 0.1 percent) appears when the manually tagged portion of the data is not used or used only once (or infrequently) in the input to the perceptron’s learner. The difference in using various feature templates (yet all largely similar to what state-of-the-art taggers currently use) is not significant. Similarly, the way the unsupervised data is selected plays no role, either; this differs from the bagging technique (Breiman, 1996) where it is significant. For Czech, the drop in accuracy appears in all dimensions, except the unsupervised data selection one. We have used novel features inspired by previous work but not used in","18","As empirically determined on the development data set. the standard perceptron setting yet (linguistically motivated tag classes in features, lookahead features). Interestingly, the resulting tagger is better than even a combination of the previous state-of-the-art taggers (for English, this comparison is in-conclusive).","We are working now on parallelization of the perceptron training, which seems to be possible (based i.a. on small-scale preliminary experiments with only a handful of parallel processes and specific data sharing arrangements among them). This would further speed up the training phase, not just as a nice bonus per se, but it would also allow for a semi-automated feature template selection, avoiding the (still manual) feature template preparation for individual languages. This would in turn facilitate one of our goals to (publicly) provide single-implementation, easy-to-maintain state-of-the-art tagging tools for as many languages as possible (we are currently preparing Dutch, Slovak and several other languages).19","Another area of possible future work is more principled tag classing for languages with large tagsets (in the order of 103","), and/or adding syntactically-motivated features; it has helped Czech tagging accuracy even when only the “in-trospectively” defined classes have been added. It is an open question if a similar approach helps English as well (certain grammatical categories can be generalized from the current WSJ tagset as well, such as number, degree of comparison, 3rd person present tense).","Finally, it would be nice to merge some of the approaches by (Toutanova et al., 2003) and (Shen et al., 2007) with the ideas of semi-supervised learning introduced here, since they seem orthogonal in at least some aspects (e.g., to replace the rudimentary lookahead features with full bidirectionality)."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["The research described here was supported by the projects MSM0021620838 and LC536 of Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic, GA405/09/0278 of the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic and 1ET101120503 of Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic. 19 Available soon also on the website. 770"]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Thorsten Brants. 2000.
