Following Silverstein (1976) several animacy hierarchies have been proposed in typological studies, focusing on the linguistic category of animacy, i.e., the distinctions which are relevant for linguistic phenomena. An example of an animacy hierarchy, taken from (Aissen, 2003), is provided in (1): (1) Human > Animate > Inanimate Clearly, non-human animates, like animals, are not less animate than humans in a biological sense, however, humans and animals show differing linguistic behaviour.","Empirical studies of animacy require human annotation efforts, and, in particular, a well-defined annotation task. However, annotation studies of animacy differ distinctly in their treatment of animacy as a type or token-level phenomenon, as well as in terms of granularity of categories. The use of the annotated data as a computational resource furthermore poses requirements on the annotation which do not necessarily agree with more theoretical considerations. Methods for the induction of animacy information for use in practical applications require the resolution of issues of level of representation, as well as granularity.","This article addresses these issues through empirical and experimental evaluation. We present an in-depth study of a manually annotated data set which indicates that animacy may be treated as a lexical semantic property at the type level. We then evaluate this proposal through supervised machine learning of animacy information and focus on an in-depth error analysis of the resulting classifier, addressing issues of granularity of the animacy dimension. Finally, the automatically an-630 notated data set is employed in order to train a syntactic parser and we investigate the effect of the animacy information and contrast the automatically acquired features with gold standard ones.","The rest of the article is structured as follows. In section 2, we briefly discuss annotation schemes for animacy, the annotation strategies and categories proposed there. We go on to describe annotation for the binary distinction of ‘human reference’ found in a Swedish dependency treebank in section 3 and we perform an evaluation of the consistency of the human annotation in terms of linguistic level. In section 4, we present experiments in lexical acquisition of animacy based on morphosyntactic features extracted from a considerably larger corpus. Section 5 presents experiments with the acquired animacy information applied in the data-driven dependency parsing of Swedish. Finally, section 6 concludes the article and provides some suggestions for future research."]},{"title":"2 Animacy annotation","paragraphs":["Annotation for animacy is not a common component of corpora or treebanks. However, following from the theoretical interest in the property of animacy, there have been some initiatives directed at animacy annotation of corpus data.","Corpus studies of animacy (Yamamoto, 1999; Dahl and Fraurud, 1996) have made use of annotated data, however they differ in the extent to which the annotation has been explicitly formulated as an annotation scheme. The annotation study presented in Zaenen et. al. (2004) makes use of a coding manual designed for a project study-ing genitive modification (Garretson et al., 2004) and presents an explicit annotation scheme for animacy, illustrated by figure 1. The main class distinction for animacy is three-way, distinguishing Human, Other animate and Inanimate, with sub-classes under two of the main classes. The ‘Other animate’ class further distinguishes Organizations and Animals. Within the group of inanimates, further distinctions are made between concrete and non-concrete inanimate, as well as time and place nominals.2","The annotation scheme described in Zaenen et. al. (2004) annotates the markables according to","2","The fact that the study focuses on genitival modification has clearly influenced the categories distinguished, as these are all distinctions which have been claimed to influence the choice of genitive construction. For instance, temporal nouns are frequent in genitive constructions, unlike the other inanimate nouns. the animacy of their referent in the particular context. Animacy is thus treated as a token level property, however, has also been proposed as a lexical semantic property of nouns (Yamamoto, 1999). The indirect encoding of animacy in lexical resources, such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) can also be seen as treating animacy as a type-level property. We may thus distinguish between a purely type level annotation strategy and a purely token level one. Type level properties hold for lexemes and are context-independent, i.e., independent of the particular linguistic context, whereas token-level properties are determined in context and hold for referring expressions, rather than lexemes."]},{"title":"3 Human reference in Swedish","paragraphs":["Talbanken05 is a Swedish treebank which was created in the 1970’s and which has recently been converted to dependency format (Nivre et al., 2006b) and made freely available.

In addition to information on part-of-speech, dependency head and relation, and various morphosyntactic properties such as definiteness, the annotation expresses a distinction for nominal elements between reference to human and non-human. The annotation manual (Teleman, 1974) states that a markable should be tagged as human (HH) if it may be replaced by the interrogative pro-noun vem ‘who’ and be referred to by the personal pronouns han ‘he’ or hon ‘she’.","There are clear similarities between the annotation for human reference found in Talbanken05 and the annotation scheme for animacy discussed 631 ANIM CONC NCONC TIME PLACE ORG","HUM InanimateOther animate Figure 1: Animacy classification scheme (Zaenen et al., 2004). above. The human/non-human contrast forms the central distinction in the animacy dimension and, in this respect, the annotation schemes do not conflict. If we compare the annotation found in Talbanken05 with the annotation proposed in Zaenen et. al. (2004), we find that the schemes differ primarily in the granularity of classes distinguished. The main source of variation in class distinctions consists in the annotation of collective nouns, in-cluding organizations, as well as animals. 3.1 Level of annotation We distinguished above between type and token level annotation strategies, where a type level annotation strategy entails that an element consistently be assigned to only one class. A token level strategy, in contrast, does not impose this restric-tion on the annotation and class assignment may vary depending on the specific context. Garretson et. al (2004) propose a token level annotation strategy and state that “when coding for animacy [. . . ] we are not considering the nominal per se (e.g., the word ‘church’), but rather the entity that is the referent of that nominal (e.g. some particular thing in the real world)”. This indicates that for all possible markables, a referent should be determinable.","The brief instruction with respect to annotation for human reference in the annotation manual for Talbanken05 (Teleman, 1974, 223) gives leeway for interpretation in the annotation and does not clearly state that it should be based on token level reference in context. It may thus be interesting to examine the extent to which this manual annotation is consistent across lexemes or whether we observe variation. We manually examine the intersection of the two classes of noun lemmas in the written sections of Talbanken, i.e., the set of nouns which have been assigned both classes by the annotators. It contains 82 noun lemmas, which corresponds to only 1.1% of the total number of noun lemmas in the treebank (7554 lemmas all together). After a manual inspection of the intersective elements along with their linguistic contexts, we may group the nouns which were assigned to both classes, into the following categories:that ‘HH’ is the tag for Abstract nouns Nouns with underspecified or vague type level properties with respect to animacy, such as quantifying nouns, e.g. hälft ‘half’, miljon ‘million’, as well as nouns which may be employed with varying animacy, e.g. element ‘element’, part ‘party’, as in (3) and (4):","(3) . . . också . . . also den the andra other partenHH party-DEF står stands utanför outside ‘. . . also the other party is left outside’","(4) I in ett a förhållande relationship är are aldrig never bägge both parter parties lika same","starka","strong","‘In a relationship, both parties are never equally","strong’ We also find that nouns which denote abstract concepts regarding humans show variable annotation, e.g. individ ‘individual’, adressat ‘addressee’, medlem ‘member’, kandidat ‘candidate’, representant ‘representative’, auktoritet ‘authority’ Reference shifting contexts These are nouns whose type level animacy is clear but which are employed in a specific context which shifts their reference. Examples include metonymic usage of nouns, as in (5) and nouns occurring in dereferencing constructions, such as predicative constructions (6), titles (7) and idioms (8):","(5) . . . daghemmensHH . . . kindergarten-DEF.GEN otillräckliga inadequate resurser resources","‘. . . the kindergarten’s inadequate resources’","(6) . . . för . . . for att to bli become en a bra good soldat soldier","‘. . . in order to become a good soldier’","(7) . . . menar . . . thinks biskop bishop Hellsten Hellsten","‘thinks bishop Hellsten’","(8) ta take studenten student-DEF","‘graduate from highschool (lit. take the student)’ 632 It is interesting to note that the main variation in annotation stems precisely from difficulties in de-termining reference, either due to bleak type level properties such as for the abstract nouns, or due to properties of the context, as in the reference shifting constructions. The small amount of variation in the human annotation for animacy clearly supports a type-level approach to animacy, however, underline the influence of the linguistic context on the conception of animacy, as noted in the literature (Zaenen et al., 2004; Rosenbach, 2008)."]},{"title":"4 Lexical acquisition of animacy","paragraphs":["Even though knowledge about the animacy of a noun clearly has some interesting implications, little work has been done within the field of lexical acquisition in order to automatically acquire animacy information. Orăsan and Evans (2007) make use of hyponym-relations taken from the WordNet resource in order to classify animate referents. However, such a method is clearly restricted to languages for which large scale lexical resources, such as the WordNet, are available. The task of animacy classification bears some resemblance to the task of named entity recognition (NER) which usually makes reference to a ‘person’ class. However, whereas most NER systems make extensive use of orthographic, morphological or contextual clues (titles, suffixes) and gazetteers, animacy for nouns is not signaled overtly in the same way.","Following a strategy in line with work on verb classification (Merlo and Stevenson, 2001; Stevenson and Joanis, 2003), we set out to classify common noun lemmas based on their morphosyntactic distribution in a considerably larger corpus. This is thus equivalent to treatment of animacy as a lexical semantic property and the classification strategy is based on generalization of morphosyntactic behaviour of common nouns over large quantities of data. Due to the small size of the Talbanken05 treebank and the small amount of variation, this strategy was pursued for the acquisition of animacy information.","In the animacy classification of common nouns we exploit well-documented correlations between morphosyntactic realization and semantic properties of nouns. For instance, animate nouns tend to be realized as agentive subjects, inanimate nouns do not (Dahl and Fraurud, 1996). Animate nouns make good ‘possessors’, whereas inanimate nouns are more likely ‘possessees’ (Rosenbach, 2008).

It is clear that the data is highly skewed towards the non-human class, which accounts for 91.5% of the type instances. For classification we organize the data into accumulated frequency bins, which include all nouns with frequencies above a certain threshold. We here approximate the class of ‘animate’ to ‘human’ and the class of ‘inanimate’ to ‘non-human’. Intersective elements, see section 3.1, are assigned to their majority class.3 4.1 Features for animacy classification We define a feature space, which makes use of distributional data regarding the general syntactic properties of a noun, as well as various morphological properties. It is clear that in order for a syntactic environment to be relevant for animacy classification it must be, at least potentially, nominal. We define the nominal potential of a dependency relation as the frequency with which it is realized by a nominal element (noun or pronoun) and determine empirically a threshold of .10. The syntactic and morphological features in the feature space are presented below:","Syntactic features A feature for each dependency relation with nominal potential: (transitive) subject (SUBJ), object (OBJ), prepositional complement (PA), root (ROOT)4",", apposition (APP), conjunct (CC), determiner (DET), predicative (PRD), complement of comparative subjunction (UK).

Also, the part-of-speech tags distinguish dates (DAT) and quantifying nouns (SET), e.g. del, rad ‘part, row’, so these are also included as features.

We observe a clear improvement on all data sets (p<.0001), compared to the respective baselines. As we recall, the data sets are successively larger, hence it seems fair to conclude that the size of the data set partially counteracts the lower frequency of the test nouns. It is not surprising, however, that a method based on distributional features suffers when the absolute frequencies approach 1. We obtain results for animacy classification, ranging from 97.3% accuracy to 93.9% depending on the sparsity of the data. With an absolute frequency threshold of 10, we obtain an accuracy of 95.4%, which constitutes a 50% reduction of error rate.","Table 3 presents the experimental results relative to class. We find that classification of the inanimate class is quite stable throughout the experiments, whereas the classification of the minority class of animate nouns suffers from sparse data. It is an important point, however, that it is largely recall for the animate class which goes down with increased sparseness, whereas precision remains quite stable. All of these properties are clearly advantageous in the application to realistic data sets, where a more conservative classifier is to be preferred. 4.4 Error analysis The human reference annotation of the Talbanken05 nouns distinguishes only the classes corresponding to ‘human’ and ‘inanimate’ along the 634","Animate Inanimate","Precision Recall Fscore Precision Recall Fscore >1000 89.7 83.9 86.7 98.1 98.8 98.5 >500 89.1 86.4 87.7 98.3 98.7 98.5 >100 87.7 76.6 81.8 97.6 98.9 98.2 >50 85.8 70.2 77.2 97.0 98.9 97.9 >10 81.9 64.0 71.8 96.4 98.6 97.5 >0 75.7 44.9 56.4 94.9 98.6 96.7 Table 3: Precision, recall and F-scores for the two classes in MBL-experiments with a general feature space.",">10 nouns (a) (b) ← classified as 222 125 (a) class animate 49 3390 (b) class inanimate Table 4: Confusion matrix for the MBL-classifier with a general feature space on the >10 data set on Talbanken05 nouns. animacy dimension. An interesting question is whether the errors show evidence of the gradience in categories discussed earlier and explicitly expressed in the annotation scheme by Zaenen et.al. (2004) in figure 1. If so, we would expect erroneously classified inanimate nouns to contain nouns of intermediate animacy, such as animals and organizations.","The error analysis examines the performance of the MBL-classifier employing all features on the > 10 data set in order to abstract away from the most serious effects of data sparseness.

The errors contain a group of nouns referring to animals and other living be-ings (bacteria, algae), as listed in (9), as well as one noun referring to an “intelligent machine”, included in the intermediate animacy category in Zaenen et al. (2004). Collective nouns with human reference and organizations are also found among the errors, listed in (11). We also find some nouns among the errors with human denotation, listed in (12).

These were all assigned to the animate majority class during extraction, but were misclassified as inanimate during classification. 4.5 SVM classifiers In order to evaluate whether the classification method generalizes to a different machine learning algorithm, we design an identical set of experiments to the ones presented above, but where classification is performed with Support Vector Machines (SVMs) instead of MBL.

Seeing that we have a treebank with gold standard syntactic information and gold standard as well as induced animacy information, it should be possible to study the direct effect of the added animacy information in the assignment of syntactic structure. 5.1 Experimental methodology We use the freely available MaltParser system, which is a language-independent system for data-driven dependency parsing (Nivre, 2006; Nivre et al., 2006c). A set of parsers are trained on Talbanken05, both with and without additional animacy information, the origin of which is either the manual annotation described in section 3 or the automatic animacy classifier described in section 4.2- 4.4 (MBL). The common nouns in the treebank are classified for animacy using leave-one-out training and testing. This ensures that the training and test instances are disjoint at all times. Moreover, the fact that the distributional data is taken from a separate data set ensures noncircularity since we are not basing the classification on gold standard parses.","All parsing experiments are performed using 10-fold cross-validation for training and testing on the entire written part of Talbanken05.

In the gold standard experiment, the results are not significantly better than the baseline and the main, overall, improvement from the gold standard animacy information reported in Øvrelid and Nivre (2007) and Øvrelid (2008) stems largely from the animacy annotation of pronouns.15","This indicates that the animacy information for common nouns, which has been automatically acquired from a considerably larger corpus, captures distributional distinctions which are important for the general effect of animacy and furthermore that the differences from the gold standard annotation prove beneficial for the results.","We see from Table 5, that the improvement in overall parse results is mainly in terms of dependency labeling, reflected in the LAS score. A closer error analysis shows that the performance of the two parsers employing gold and automatic animacy information is very similar with respect to dependency relations and we observe an improved analysis for subjects, (direct and indirect) objects and subject predicatives with only minor variations. This in itself is remarkable, since the covered set of animate instances is notably smaller in the automatically annotated data set. We furthermore find that the main difference between the gold standard and automatic Anim-experiments","15","Recall that the Talbanken05 treebank contains animacy information for all nominal elements – pronouns, proper and common nouns.

One relation for which performance deteriorates with the added information in the gold Anim-experiment is the nominal postmodifier relation (ET) which is employed for relative clauses and nominal PP-attachment. With the automatically assigned feature, in contrast, we observe an improvement in the performance for the ET relation, compared to the gold standard experiment, from a F-score in the latter of 76.14 to 76.40 in the former. Since this is a quite common relation, with a frequency of 5% in the treebank as a whole, the improvement has a clear effect on the results.","The parser’s analysis of postnominal modification is influenced by the differences in the added animacy annotation for the nominal head, as well as the internal dependent. If we examine the corrected errors in the automatic experiment, compared to the gold standard experiment, we find elements with differing annotation. Preferences with respect to the animacy of prepositional complements vary. In (14), the automatic annotation of the noun djur ‘animal’ as animate results in correct assignment of the ET relation to the preposition hos ‘among’, as well as correct nominal, as opposed to verbal, attachment. This preposi-tion is one of the few with a preference for animate complements in the treebank.

Following from this observation, we have shown how a type-level induction strategy based on morphosyntactic distributional features enables automatic animacy classification for noun lemmas which furthermore generalizes to different machine learning algorithms (MBL, SVM). We obtain results for animacy classification, ranging from 97.3% accuracy to 93.9% depending on the sparsity of the data. With an absolute frequency threshold of 10, we obtain an accuracy of 95.4%, which constitutes a 50% reduction of error rate. A detailed error analysis revealed some interesting results and we saw that more than half of the errors performed by the animacy classifier for the large class of inanimate nouns actually included elements which have been assigned an intermediate animacy status in theoretical work, such as animals and collective nouns.","The application of animacy annotation in the task of syntactic parsing provided a test bed for the applicability of the annotation, where we could contrast the manually assigned classes with the automatically acquired ones. The results showed that the automatically acquired information gives a slight, but significant improvement of overall parse results where the gold standard annotation does not, despite a considerably lower coverage. This is a suprising result which highlights important properties of the annotation. First of all, the automatic annotation is completely consistent at the type level. Second, the automatic animacy classifier captures important distributional properties of the nouns, exemplified by the case of nominal postmodifiers in PP-attachment. The automatic annotation thus captures a purely linguistic notion of animacy and abstracts over contextual influence in particular instances.","Animacy has been shown to be an important property in a range of languages, hence animacy classification of other languages constitutes an interesting line of work for the future, where empirical evaluations may point to similarities and differences in the linguistic expression of animacy. 637"]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Judith Aissen. 2003.
