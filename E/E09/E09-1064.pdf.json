Lexical-semantic resources, which provide the needed knowledge for lexical inference, are commonly utilized by applied inference systems (Giampiccolo et al., 2007) and applications such as Information Retrieval and Question Answering (Shah and Croft, 2004; Pasca and Harabagiu, 2001). Beyond WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), a wide range of resources has been developed and utilized, including extensions to WordNet (Moldovan and Rus, 2001; Snow et al., 2006) and resources based on automatic distributional similarity methods (Lin, 1998; Pantel and Lin, 2002). Recently, Wikipedia is emerg-ing as a source for extracting semantic relationships (Suchanek et al., 2007; Kazama and Torisawa, 2007).","As of today, only a partial comparative picture is available regarding the actual utility and limitations of available resources for lexical-semantic inference. Works that do provide quantitative information regarding resources utility have focused on few particular resources (Kouylekov and Magnini, 2006; Roth and Sammons, 2007) and evaluated their impact on a specific system. Most often, works which utilized lexical resources do not provide information about their isolated contribution; rather, they only report overall performance for systems in which lexical resources serve as components.","Our paper provides a step towards clarify-ing this picture. We propose a system- and application-independent evaluation methodology that isolates resources’ performance, and systematically apply it to seven prominent lexical-semantic resources. The evaluation and analysis methodology is specified within the Textual Entailment framework, which has become popular in recent years for modeling practical semantic inference in a generic manner (Dagan and Glickman, 2004). To that end, we assume certain definitions that extend the textual entailment paradigm to the lexical level.","The findings of our work provide useful insights and suggested directions for two research communities: developers of applied inference systems and researchers addressing lexical acquisition and resource construction. Beyond the quantitative mapping of resources’ performance, our analysis points at issues concerning their effective utiliza-tion and major characteristics. Even more importantly, the results highlight current gaps in exist-ing resources and point at directions towards fill-ing them. We show that the coverage of most resources is quite limited, where a substantial part of recall is attributable to semantic relations that are typically not available to inference systems. Notably, distributional acquisition methods 558 are shown to provide many useful relationships which are missing from other resources, but these are embedded amongst many irrelevant ones. Additionally, the results highlight the need to represent and inference over various aspects of contextual information, which affect the applicability of lexical inferences. We suggest that these gaps should be addressed by future research."]},{"title":"2 Sub-sentential Textual Entailment","paragraphs":["Textual entailment captures the relation between a text t and a textual statement (termed hypothesis) h, such that a person reading t would infer that h is most likely correct (Dagan et al., 2005).","The entailment relation has been defined insofar in terms of truth values, assuming that h is a complete sentence (proposition). However, there are major aspects of inference that apply to the sub-sentential level. First, in certain applications, the target hypotheses are often sub-sentential. For example, search queries in IR, which play the hypothesis role from an entailment perspective, typically consist of a single term, like drug legaliza-tion. Such sub-sentential hypotheses are not regarded naturally in terms of truth values and therefore do not fit well within the scope of the textual entailment definition. Second, many entailment models apply a compositional process, through which they try to infer each sub-part of the hypothesis from some parts of the text (Giampiccolo et al., 2007).","Although inferences over sub-sentential elements are being applied in practice, so far there are no standard definitions for entailment at sub-sentential levels. To that end, and as a prerequisite of our evaluation methodology and our analysis, we first establish two relevant definitions for sub-sentential entailment relations: (a) entailment of a sub-sentential hypothesis by a text, and (b) entailment of one lexical element by another. 2.1 Entailment of Sub-sentential Hypotheses We first seek a definition that would capture the entailment relationship between a text and a sub-sentential hypothesis. A similar goal was addressed in (Glickman et al., 2006), who defined the notion of lexical reference to model the fact that in order to entail a hypothesis, the text has to entail each non-compositional lexical element within it. We suggest that a slight adaptation of their definition is suitable to capture the notion of entailment for any sub-sentential hypotheses, including compositional ones: Definition 1 A sub-sentential hypothesis h is entailed by a text t if there is an explicit or implied reference in t to a possible meaning of h.","For example, the sentence “ crude steel output is likely to fall in 2000” entails the sub-sentential hypotheses production, steel production and steel output decrease.","Glickman et al., achieving good inter-annotator agreement, empirically found that almost all non-compositional terms in an entailed sentential hypothesis are indeed referenced in the entailing text. This finding suggests that the above definition is consistent with the original definition of textual entailment for sentential hypotheses and can thus model compositional entailment inferences.","We use this definition in our annotation methodology described in Section 3. 2.2 Entailment between Lexical Elements In the majority of cases, the reference to an “atomic” (non-compositional) lexical element e in h stems from a particular lexical element e′","in t, as in the example above where the word output implies the meaning of production.","To identify this relationship, an entailment system needs a knowledge resource that would specify that the meaning of e′","implies the meaning of e, at least in some contexts. We thus suggest the following definition to capture this relationship between e′","and e: Definition 2 A lexical element e’ entails another lexical element e, denoted e’⇒e, if there exist some natural (non-anecdotal) texts containing e’ which entail e, such that the reference to the meaning of e can be implied solely from the meaning of e’ in the text. (Entailment of e by a text follows Definition 1).","We refer to this relation in this paper as lexical entailment1",", and call e’ ⇒ e a lexical entailment rule. e′","is referred to as the rule’s left hand side (LHS) and e as its right hand side (RHS).","Currently there are no knowledge resources designed specifically for lexical entailment modeling. Hence, the types of relationships they capture do not fully coincide with entailment inference needs. Thus, the definition suggests a specification for the rules that should be provided by","1","Section 6 discusses other definitions of lexical entailment 559 a lexical entailment resource, following an operative rationale: a rule e’ ⇒ e should be included in an entailment knowledge resource if it would be needed, as part of a compositional process, to infer the meaning of e from some natural texts. Based on this definition, we perform an analysis of the relationships included in lexical-semantic resources, as described in Section 5.","A rule need not apply in all contexts, as long as it is appropriate for some texts. Two contextual aspects affect rule applicability. First is the “lexical context” specifying the meanings of the text’s words. A rules is applicable in a certain context only when the intended sense of its LHS term matches the sense of that term in the text. For example, the application of the rule lay ⇒ produce is valid only in contexts where the producer is poultry and the products are eggs. This is a well known issue observed, for instance, by Voorhees (1994).","A second contextual factor requiring validation is the “logical context”. The logical context determines the monotonicity of the LHS and is induced by logical operators such as negation and (explicit or implicit) quantifiers. For example, the rule mammal ⇒ whale may not be valid in most cases, but is applicable in universally quantified texts like “ mammals are warm-blooded”. This issue has been rarely addressed in applied inference systems (de Marneffe et al., 2006). The above mentioned rules both comply with Definition 2 and should therefore be included in a lexical entailment resource."]},{"title":"3 Evaluating Entailment Resources","paragraphs":["Our evaluation goal is to assess the utility of lexical-semantic resources as sources for entailment rules. An inference system applies a rule by inferring the rule’s RHS from texts that match its LHS. Thus, the utility of a resource depends on the performance of its rule applications rather than on the proportion of correct rules it contains. A rule, whether correct or incorrect, has insignificant effect on the resource’s utility if it rarely matches texts in real application settings. Additionally, correct rules might produce incorrect applications when applied in inappropriate contexts. Therefore, we use an instance-based evaluation methodology, which simulates rule applications by collecting texts that contain rules’ LHS and manually assessing the correctness of their applications.","Systems typically handle lexical context either implicitly or explicitly. Implicit context validation occurs when the different terms of a composite hypothesis disambiguate each other. For example, the rule waterside ⇒ bank is unlikely to be applied when trying to infer the hypothesis bank loans, since texts that match waterside are unlikely to contain also the meaning of loan. Explicit methods, such as word-sense disambiguation or sense matching, validate each rule application according to the broader context in the text. Few systems also address logical context validation by handling quantifiers and negation. As we aim for a system-independent comparison of resources, and explicit approaches are not standardized yet within inference systems, our evaluation uses only implicit context validation. 3.1 Evaluation Methodology Figure 1: Evaluation methodology flow chart","The input for our evaluation methodology is a lexical-semantic resource R, which contains lexical entailment rules. We evaluate R’s utility by testing how useful it is for inferring a sample of test hypotheses H from a corpus. Each hypothesis in H contains more than one lexical element in order to provide implicit context validation for rule applications, e.g. h: water pollution.","We next describe the steps of our evaluation methodology, as illustrated in Figure 1. We refer to the examples in the figure when needed:","1) Fetch rules: For each h ∈ H and each lexical element e ∈ h (e.g. water), we fetch all rules e’ ⇒ e in R that might be applied to entail e (e.g. lake ⇒ water).","2) Generate intermediate hypotheses h’: For each rule r: e’ ⇒ e, we generate an intermediate hypothesis h′","by replacing e in h with e′","(e.g. 560 h′ 1: lake pollution). From a text t entailing h′",", h can be further entailed by the single application of r. We thus simulate the process by which an entailment system would infer h from t using r.","3) Retrieve matching texts: For each h′","we retrieve from a corpus all texts that contain the lemmatized words of h′","(not necessarily as a single phrase). These texts may entail h′",". We discard texts that also match h since entailing h from them might not require the application of any rule from the evaluated resource. In our example, the retrieved texts contain lake and pollution but do not contain water.","4) Annotation: A sample of the retrieved texts is presented to human annotators. The annotators are asked to answer the following two questions for each text, simulating the typical inference process of an entailment system:","a) Does t entail h’? If t does not entail h′ then the text would not provide a useful example for the application of r. For instance, t1 (in Figure 1) does not entail h′","1 and thus we cannot deduce h from it by applying the rule r. Such texts are discarded from further evaluation.","b) Does t entail h? If t is annotated as entailing h′",", an entailment system would then infer h from h′","by applying r. If h is not entailed from t even though h′","is, the rule application is considered invalid. For instance, t2 does not entail h even though it entails h′","2. Indeed, the application of r2: *soil ⇒ water 2",", from which h′","2 was constructed, yields incorrect inference. If the answer is ’yes’, as in the case of t3, the application of r for t is considered valid.","The above process yields a sample of annotated rule applications for each test hypothesis, from which we can measure resources performance, as described in Section 5."]},{"title":"4 Experimental Setting 4.1 Dataset and Annotation","paragraphs":["Current available state-of-the-art lexical-semantic resources mainly deal with nouns. Therefore, we used nominal hypotheses for our experiment3",".","We chose TREC 1-8 (excluding 4) as our test corpus and randomly sampled 25 ad-hoc queries of two-word compounds as our hypotheses. We did not use longer hypotheses to ensure that 2 The asterisk marks an incorrect rule. 3 We suggest that the definitions and methodologies can be","applied for other parts of speech as well. enough texts containing the intermediate hypotheses are found in the corpus. For annotation simplicity, we retrieved single sentences as our texts.","For each rule applied for an hypothesis h, we sampled 10 sentences from the sentences retrieved for that rule. As a baseline, we also sampled 10 sentences for each original hypothesis h in which both words of h are found. In total, 1550 unique sentences were sampled and annotated by two annotators.","To assess the validity of our evaluation methodology, the annotators first judged a sample of 220 sentences. The Kappa scores for inter-annotator agreement were 0.74 and 0.64 for judging h′","and h, respectively. These figures correspond to substantial agreement (Landis and Koch, 1997) and are comparable with related semantic annotations (Szpektor et al., 2007; Bhagat et al., 2007). 4.2 Lexical-Semantic Resources We evaluated the following resources:","WordNet (WNd","): There is no clear agreement regarding which set of WordNet relations is useful for entailment inference. We therefore took a conservative approach using only synonymy and hyponymy rules, which typically comply with the lexical entailment relation and are commonly used by textual entailment systems, e.g. (Herrera et al., 2005; Bos and Markert, 2006). Given a term e, we created a rule e’ ⇒ e for each e′","amongst the synonyms or direct hyponyms for all senses of e in WordNet 3.0.","Snow (Snow30k","): Snow et al. (2006) presented a probabilistic model for taxonomy induction which considers as features paths in parse trees between related taxonomy nodes.

Overall, our findings highlight where efforts in developing future resources and inference systems should be invested. 5.1 Resources Performance Each resource was evaluated using two measures - Precision and Recall-share, macro averaged over all hypotheses. The results achieved for each resource are summarized in Table 1. 5 Kindly provided to us by Patrick Pantel. 6 Lin’s resources were downloaded from:","http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/l̃indek/demos.htm Resource Precision (%) Recall-share (%) Snow30k","56 8 WNd","55 24 XWN⋆","51 9 WikiFS 45 7 CBC 33 9 Lin-dep 28 45 Lin-prox 24 36 Table 1: Lexical resources performance 5.1.1 Precision The Precision of a resource R is the percentage of valid rule applications for the resource.

In contrast, Lin’s distributional resources are not designed to include lexical entailment relationships. They provide pairs of contextually similar words, of which many have non-entailing relationships, such as co-hyponyms7","(e.g. *doctor ⇒ journalist) or topically-related words, such as *radiotherapy ⇒ outpatient. Hence their relatively low precision.","One visible outcome is the large gap between the perceived high accuracy of resources constructed by accurate methods, most notably WNd",", and their performance in practice. This finding emphasizes the need for instance-based evaluations, which capture the “real” contribution of a resource. To better understand the reasons for this gap we further assessed the three factors that contribute to incorrect applications: incorrect rules, lexical context and logical context (see Section 2.2). This analysis is presented in Table 2.","From Table 2 we see that the gap for accurate resources is mainly caused by applications of correct rules in inappropriate contexts. More interestingly, the information in the table allows us to asses the lexical “context-sensitivity” of resources. When considering only the COR-LEX rules to recalculate resources precision, we find thatLin-dep achieves precision of 71% ( 15%","15%+6% ), while WNd yields only 56% ( 55%","55%+44% ).

This is explained by the fact that Lin-dep’s rules are calculated across multiple contexts and therefore capture the more frequent usages of words. WordNet, on the other hand, includes many anecdotal rules whose application is rare, and thus is very sensitive to context. Similarly, WikiFS turns out to be very context-sensitive. This resource contains many rules for polysemous proper nouns that are scarce in their proper noun sense, e.g. Captive ⇒ computer game. Snow30k",", when applied with the same calculation, reaches 73%, which explains how it achieved a comparable result to WNd",", even though it contains many incorrect rules in comparison to WNd",". 5.1.2 Recall Absolute recall cannot be measured since the total number of texts in the corpus that entail each hypothesis is unknown. Instead, we measure recall-share, the contribution of each resource to recall relative to matching only the words of the original hypothesis without any rules. We denote by yield(h) the number of texts that match h directly and are annotated as entailing h. This figure is estimated by the number of sampled texts annotated as entailing h multiplied by the sampling proportion. In the same fashion, for each resource R, we estimate the number of texts entailing h obtained through entailment rules of the resource R, denoted yieldR(h). Recall-share of R for h is the proportion of the yield obtained by the resource’s rules relative to the overall yield with and without the rules from R:","yieldR(h)","yield(h)+yieldR(h) . From Table 1 we see that along with their rela-","tively low precision, Lin’s resources’ recall greatly","surpasses that of any other resource, including","WordNet8",". The rest of the resources are even infe-8 A preliminary experiment we conducted showed that rerior to WNd","in that respect, indicating their limited utility for inference systems.","As expected, synonyms and hyponyms in WordNet contributed a noticeable portion to recall in all resources. Additional correct rules correspond to hyponyms and synonyms missing from WordNet, many of them proper names and some slang expressions. These rules were mainly provided by WikiFS and Snow30k",", significantly supplementing WordNet, whose HasInstance relation is quite partial. However, there are other interesting types of entailment relations contributing to recall. These are discussed in Sections 5.2 and 5.3. Examples for various rule types are found in Table 3. 5.1.3 Valid Applications of Incorrect Rules We observed that many entailing sentences were retrieved by inherently incorrect rules in the distributional resources. Analysis of these rules reveals they were matched in entailing texts when the LHS has noticeable statistical correlation with another term in the text that does entail the RHS. For example, for the hypothesis wildlife extinction, the rule *species ⇒ extinction yielded valid applications in contexts about threatened or endangered species. Has the resource included a rule between the entailing term in the text and the RHS, the entailing text would have been matched without needing the incorrect rule.","These correlations accounted for nearly a third of Lin resources’ recall. Nonetheless, in principle, we suggest that such rules, which do not conform with Definition 2, should not be included in a lexical entailment resource, since they also cause invalid rule applications, while the entailing texts they retrieve will hopefully be matched by addi-call does not dramatically improve when using the entire hyponymy subtree from WordNet. 563 Type Correct Rules HYPO Shevardnadze ⇒ official Snow30k ANT efficacy ⇒ ineffectiveness Lin-dep HOLO government ⇒ official Lin-prox HYPER arms ⇒ gun Lin-prox ̃childbirth ⇒ motherhood Lin-dep ̃mortgage ⇒ bank Lin-prox ̃Captive ⇒ computer WikiFS ̃negligence ⇒ failure CBC ̃beatification ⇒ pope XWN⋆ Type Incorrect Rules CO-HYP alcohol ⇒ cigarette CBC ̃radiotherapy ⇒ outpatient Lin-dep ̃teen-ager ⇒ gun Snow30k ̃basic ⇒ paper WikiFS ̃species ⇒ extinction Lin-prox Table 3: Examples of lexical resources rules by types.

These rules, which comply with Definition 2 but do not conform to any WordNet relation type, were mainly contributed by Lin’s distributional resources and to a smaller degree are also included in XWN⋆",". In Lin-dep, for example, they accounted for approximately a third of the recall.","Among the finer grained relations we identified in this set are topical entailment (e.g. IBM as the company entailing the topic computers), consequential relationships (pregnancy ⇒ motherhood) and an entailment of inherent arguments by a predicate, or of essential participants by a scenario description, e.g. beatification ⇒ pope. A comprehensive typology of these relationships requires further investigation, as well as the identification and development of additional resources from which they can be extracted.","As opposed to hyponymy and synonymy rules, these rules are typically non-substitutable, i.e. the RHS of the rule is unlikely to have the exact same role in the text as the LHS. Many inference systems perform rule-based transformations, substituting the LHS by the RHS. This finding suggests that different methods may be required to utilize such rules for inference. 5.3 Logical Context WordNet relations other than synonyms and hyponyms, including antonyms, holonyms and hypernyms (see Table 3), contributed a noticeable share of valid rule applications for some resources. Following common practice, these relations are missing by construction from the other resources.","As shown in Table 2 (COR-LOG columns), such relations accounted for a seventh of Lin-dep’s valid rule applications, as much as was the contribution of hyponyms and synonyms to this resource’s recall. Yet, using these rules resulted with more erroneous applications than correct ones. As discussed in Section 2.2, the rules induced by these relations do conform with our lexical entailment definition. However, a valid application of these rules requires certain logical conditions to occur, which is not the common case. We thus suggest that such rules are included in lexical entailment resources, as long as they are marked properly by their types, allowing inference systems to utilize them only when appropriate mechanisms for handling logical context are in place. 5.4 Rules Priors In Section 5.1.1 we observed that some resources are highly sensitive to context. Hence, when considering the validity of a rule’s application, two factors should be regarded: the actual context in which the rule is to be applied, as well as the rule’s prior likelihood to be valid in an arbitrary context. Somewhat indicative, yet mostly indirect, information about rules’ priors is contained in some resources. This includes sense ranks in WordNet, SemCor statistics (Miller et al., 1993), and similarity scores and rankings in Lin’s resources. Infer-ence systems often incorporated this information, typically as top-k or threshold-based filters (Pantel and Lin, 2003; Roth and Sammons, 2007). By empirically assessing the effect of several such filters in our setting, we found that this type of data is indeed informative in the sense that precision increases as the threshold rises. Yet, no specific filters were found to improve results in terms of F1 score (where recall is measured relatively to the yield of the unfiltered resource) due to a significant drop in relative recall. For example, Lin-564 prox loses more than 40% of its recall when only the top-50 rules for each hypothesis are exploited, and using only the first sense ofWNd","costs the resource over 60% of its recall. We thus suggest a better strategy might be to combine the prior information with context matching scores in order to obtain overall likelihood scores for rule applications, as in (Szpektor et al., 2008). Furthermore, resources should include explicit information regarding the prior likelihoods of of their rules. 5.5 Operative Conclusions Our findings highlight the currently limited recall of available resources for lexical inference. The higher recall of Lin’s resources indicates that many more entailment relationships can be acquired, particularly when considering distributional evidence. Yet, available distributional acquisition methods are not geared for lexical entailment. This suggests the need to develop acquisition methods for dedicated and more extensive knowledge resources that would subsume the correct rules found by current distributional methods. Furthermore, substantially better recall may be obtained by acquiring non-standard lexical entailment relationships, as discussed in Section 5.2, for which a comprehensive typology is still needed. At the same time, transformation-based inference systems would need to handle these kinds of rules, which are usually non-substitutable. Our results also quantify and stress earlier findings regarding the severe degradation in precision when rules are applied in inappropriate contexts. This highlights the need for resources to provide explicit information about the suitable lexical and logical contexts in which an entailment rule is applicable. In parallel, methods should be developed to utilize such contextual information within inference systems. Additional auxiliary information needed in lexical resources is the prior likelihood for a given rule to be correct in an arbitrary context."]},{"title":"6 Related Work","paragraphs":["Several prior works defined lexical entailment. WordNet’s lexical entailment is a relationship between verbs only, defined for propositions (Fellbaum, 1998). Geffet and Dagan (2004) defined substitutable lexical entailment as a relation between substitutable terms. We find this definition too restrictive as non-substitutable rules may also be useful for entailment inference. Examples are breastfeeding ⇒ baby and hospital ⇒ medical. Hence, Definition 2 is more broadly applicable for defining the desired contents of lexical entailment resources. We empirically observed that the rules satisfying their definition are a proper subset of the rules covered by our definition. Dagan and Glickman (2004) referred to entailment at the sub-sentential level by assigning truth values to subpropositional text fragments through their existential meaning. We find this criterion too permissive. For instance, the existence of country implies the existence of its flag. Yet, the meaning of flag is typically not implied by country.","Previous works assessing rule application via human annotation include (Pantel et al., 2007; Szpektor et al., 2007), which evaluate acquisition methods for lexical-syntactic rules.
