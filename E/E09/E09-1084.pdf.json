These images are useful in support of clinical decisions, in rich document summaries, and for instructional purposes. The task of delivering these images, and the publications in which they are contained, to biomedical clinicians and researchers in an accessible way is an information retrieval problem.","Current research in the biomedical domain (e.g., Antani et al., 2008; Florea et al., 2007), has in-vestigated hybrid approaches to image retrieval, combining elements of content-based image retrieval (CBIR) and annotation-based image retrieval (ABIR). ABIR, compared to the image-","1","Non-lexical features describe attributes of image-related text but not the text itself, e.g., unlike a bag-of-words model. only approach of CBIR, offers a practical advantage in that queries can be more naturally specified by a human user (Inoue, 2004). However, manually annotating biomedical images is a laborious and subjective task that often leads to noisy results.","Automatic image annotation is a more robust approach to ABIR than manual annotation. Unfortunately, automatically selecting the most appropriate indexing terms is an especially challeng-ing problem for biomedical images because of the domain-specific nature of these images and the many vocabularies used in the biomedical sciences. For example, the term “sweat gland adenocarcinoma” could be a useful indexing term for an image found in a dermatology publication, but it is less likely to have much relevance in describing an image from a cardiology publication. On the other hand, the term “mitral annular calcification” may be of great relevance for cardiology images, but of little relevance for dermatology ones.","Our problem may be summarized as follows: Given an image, its caption, its discussion in the article text (henceforth the image mention), and a list of potential indexing terms, select the terms that are most effective at describing the content of the image. For example, assume the image shown in Figure 1, obtained from the article “Metastatic Hidradenocarcinoma: Efficacy of Capecitabine” by Thomas et al. (2006) in Archives of Dermatol-ogy, has the following potential indexing terms, • Histopathology finding • Reviewed • Confirmation • Diagnosis aspect • Diagnosis • Eccrine • Sweat gland adenocarcinoma • Lesion which have been extracted from the image mention. While most of these do not uniquely identify 737 Caption: Figure 1. On recurrence, histologic features of porocarcinoma with an intraepidermal spread of neoplastic clusters (hematoxylin-eosin, original magnification x100). Mention: Histopathologic findings were reviewed and confirmed a diagnosis of eccrine hidradenocarcinoma for all lesions excised (Figure 1). Figure 1: Example Image. We index an image with concepts generated from its caption and discussion in the document text (mention). This image is from “Metastatic Hidradenocarcinoma: Efficacy of Capecitabine” by Thomas et al. (2006) and is reprinted with permission from the authors. the image, we would like to automatically select “sweat gland adenocarcinoma” and “eccrine” for indexing because they clearly describe the content and purpose of the image—supporting a diagnosis of hidradenocarinoma, an invasive cancer of sweat glands. Note that effective indexing terms need not be exact lexical matches of the text. Even though “diagnosis” is an exact match, its meaning is too broad in this context to be a useful term.","In a machine learning approach to image annotation, training data based on lexical features alone is not sufficient for finding salient indexing terms. Indeed, we must classify terms that are not encountered while training. Therefore, we hypothesize that non-lexical features, which have been successfully used for speech and genre classification tasks, among others (see Section 5 for related work), may be useful in classifying text associated with images. While this approach is broad enough to apply to any retrieval task, given the goals of our ongoing research, we restrict ourselves to studying its feasibility in the biomedical domain.","In order to achieve this, we make use of the previously developed MetaMap (Aronson, 2001) tool, which maps text to concepts contained in the Unified Medical Language SystemR","⃝","(UMLS) Metathesaurus R","⃝","(Lindberg et al., 1993). The UMLS is a compendium of several controlled vocabularies in the biomedical sciences that provides a semantic mapping relating concepts from the various vocabularies (Section 2). We then use a supervised machine learning approach, described in Section 3, to classify the UMLS concepts as useful indexing terms based on their non-lexical features, gleaned from the article text and MetaMap output.","Experimental results, presented in Section 4, indicate that ineffective indexing terms can be reduced using this classification technique. We conclude that ABIR approaches to biomedical image retrieval as well as hybrid CBIR/ABIR approaches, which rely on both image content and annotations, can benefit from an automatic annotation process utilizing non-lexical features to aid in the selection of useful indexing terms."]},{"title":"2 Image Retrieval: Recent Work","paragraphs":["Automatic image annotation is a broad topic, and the automatic annotation of biomedical images, specifically, has been a frequent component of the ImageCLEF2","cross-language image retrieval workshop. In this section, we describe previous work in biomedical image retrieval that forms the basis of our approach. Refer to Section 5 for work related to our method in general.","Demner-Fushman et al. (2007) developed a machine learning approach to identify images from biomedical publications that are relevant to clinical decision support. In this work, the authors utilized both image and textual features to classify images based on their usefulness in evidence-based medicine. In contrast, our work is focused on selecting useful biomedical image indexing terms; however, we utilize the methods developed in their work to extract images and their related captions and mentions.","Authors of biomedical publications often as-semble multiple images into a single multi-panel figure. Antani et al. (2008) developed a unique two-phase approach for detecting and segmenting these figures. The authors rely on cues from captions to inform an image analysis algorithm that determines panel edge information. We make use of this approach to uniquely associate caption and mention text with a single image. 2 http://imageclef.org/ 738","Our current work most directly stems from the results of a term extraction and image annotation evaluation performed by Demner-Fushman et al. (2008). In this study, the authors utilized MetaMap to extract potential indexing terms (UMLS concepts) from image captions and mentions. They then asked a group of five physicians and one medical imaging specialist (four of whom are trained in medical informatics) to manually classify each concept as being “useful for indexing” its associated images or ineffective for this purpose. The reviewers also had the opportunity to identify additional indexing terms that were not automatically extracted by MetaMap.","In total, the reviewers evaluated 4006 concepts (3,281 of which were unique), associated with 186 images from 109 different biomedical articles. Each reviewer was given 50 randomly chosen images from the 2006–2007 issues of Archives of Facial Plastic Surgery3","and Cardiovascular Ultrasound4",". Since MetaMap did not automatically extract all of the useful indexing terms, this selection process exhibited high recall averaging 0.64 but a low precision of 0.11. Indeed, assuming all the extracted terms were selected for indexing, this results in an average F1-score of only 0.182 for the classification problem. Our work is aimed at improving this baseline classification by reducing the number of ineffective terms selected for indexing."]},{"title":"3 Term Selection Method","paragraphs":["A pictorial representation of our term extraction and selection process is shown in Figure 2. We rely on the previously described methods to extract images and their corresponding captions and mentions, and the MetaMap tool to map this text to UMLS concepts. These concepts are potential indexing terms for the associated image.","We derive term features from various textual items, such as the preferred name of the UMLS concept, the MetaMap output for the concept, the text that generated the concept, the article containing the image, and the document collection containing the article. These are all described in more detail in Section 3.2. Once the feature vectors are built, we automatically classify the term as either being useful for indexing the image or not.","To select useful indexing terms, we trained a binary classifier, described in Section 3.3, in a 3 http://archfaci.ama-assn.org/ 4 http://www.cardiovascularultrasound.com/ Figure 2: Term Extraction and Selection. We gather features for the extracted terms and use them to train a classifier that selects the terms that are useful for indexing the associated images. supervised learning scenario with data obtained from the previous study by Demner-Fushman et al. (2008). We obtained our evaluation data from the 2006 Archives of Dermatology5","journal. Note that our training and evaluation data represent distinct subdomains of the biomedical sciences.","In order to reduce noise in the classification of our evaluation data, we asked two of the reviewers who participated in the initial study to manually classify our extracted terms as they did for our training data. In doing so, they each evaluated an identical set of 1539 potential indexing terms relating to 50 randomly chosen images from 31 different articles. We measured the performance of our classifier in terms of how well it performed against this manual evaluation. These results, as well as a discussion pertaining to the inter-annotator agreement of the two reviewers, are presented in Section 4.","Since our general approach is not specific to the biomedical domain, it could equally be applied in 5 http://archderm.ama-assn.org/ 739 any domain with an existing ontology. For example, the UMLS and MetaMap can be replaced by the Art and Architecture Thesaurus6","and an equivalent mapping tool to annotate images related to art and art history (Klavans et al., 2008). 3.1 Terminology To describe our features, we adopt the following terminology.","• A collection contains all the articles from a given publication for a specified number of years. For example, the 2006–2007 issues of Cardiovascular Ultrasound represent a single collection.","• A document is a specific biomedical article from a particular collection and contains images and their captions and mentions.","• A phrase is the portion of text that MetaMap maps to UMLS concepts. For example, from the caption in Figure 1, the noun phrase “histologic features” maps to four UMLS concepts: “Histologic,” “Characteristics,” “Protein Domain” and “Array Feature.”","• A mapping is an assignment of a phrase to a particular set of UMLS concepts. Each phrase can have more than one mapping. 3.2 Features Using this terminology, we define the following features used to classify potential indexing terms. We refer to these as non-lexical features because they generally characterize UMLS concepts, go-ing beyond the surface representation of words and lexemes appearing in the article text.","F.1 CUI (nominal): The Concept Unique Identifier (CUI) assigned to the concept in the UMLS Metathesaurus. We choose the concept identifier as a feature because some frequently mapped concepts are consistently ineffective for indexing the images in our training and evaluation data. For example, the CUI for “Original,” another term mapped from the caption shown in Figure 1, is “C0205313.” Our results indicate that “C0205313,” which occurs 19 times in our evaluation data, never identifies a useful indexing term. 6 http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting research/","vocabularies/aat/","F.2 Semantic Type (nominal): The concept’s semantic categorization. There are currently 132 different semantic types7","in the UMLS Metathesaurus. For example, The semantic type of “Original” is “Idea or Concept.”","F.3 Presence in Caption (nominal): true if the phrase that generated the concept is located in the image caption; false if the phrase is located in the image mention.","F.4 MeSH Ratio (real): The ratio of words ci in the concept c that are also contained in the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH terms)8 M assigned to the document to the total number of words in the concept.","R(m) = |{ci : ci ∈ M}|","|c| (1) MeSH is a controlled vocabulary created by the US National Library of Medicine (NLM) to index biomedical articles.

Computation of all other features is straightforward. 3.3 Classifier","We explored these feature vectors using various","classification approaches available in the Rapid-","Miner10","tool. Unlike many similar text and image 9 http://ir.dcs.gla.ac.uk/terrier/ 10 http://rapid-i.com/ classification problems, we were unable to achieve results with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) learner (libSVMLearner) using the Radial Base Function (RBF). Common cost and width parameters were used, yet the SVM classified all terms as ineffective. Identical results were observed using a Naı̈ve Bayes (NB) learner.","For these reasons, we chose to use the Averaged One-Dependence Estimator (AODE) learner (Webb et al., 2005) available in RapidMiner. AODE is capable of achieving highly accurate classification results with the quick training time usually associated with NB. Because this learner does not handle continuous attributes, we preprocessed our features with equal frequency discretization. The AODE learner was trained in a ten-fold cross validation of our training data."]},{"title":"4 Results","paragraphs":["Results relating to specific aspects of our work (annotation, features and classification) are presented below. 4.1 Inter-Annotator Agreement Two independent reviewers manually classified the extracted terms from our evaluation data as useful for indexing their associated images or not. The inter-annotator agreement between reviewers A and B is shown in the first row of Table 1. Although both reviewers are physicians trained in medical informatics, their initial agreement is only moderate, with κ = 0.519. This illustrates the subjective nature of manual ABIR and, in general, the difficultly in reliably classifying potential indexing terms for biomedical images.

The probability of agreement Pr(a), expected probability of chance agreement Pr(e), and the associated Cohen’s kappa coefficient κ are given for each reviewer combination.","After their initial classification, the two reviewers were instructed to collaboratively reevaluate the subset of extracted terms upon which they disagreed (roughly 15% of the terms) and create a 741 Feature Gain χ2 F.1 CUI 0.003 13.331 F.2 Semantic Type 0.015 68.232 F.3 Presence in Caption 0.008 35.303 F.4 MeSH Ratio 0.043 285.701 F.5 Abstract Ratio 0.023 114.373 F.6 Title Ratio 0.021 132.651 F.7 Noun Ratio 0.053 287.494","Verb Ratio 0.009 26.723","Adjective Ratio 0.021 96.572","Adverb Ratio 0.002 5.271 F.8 Concept Ambiguity 0.008 33.824 F.9 Tf-idf 0.004 21.489 F.10 Document Location 0.002 12.245 F.11 Phrase Length 0.021 102.759 Table 2: Feature Comparison. The information gain and chi-square statistic is shown for each feature. A higher score indicates greater influence on term effectiveness. gold standard evaluation. The second and third rows of Table 1 suggest the resulting evaluation strongly favors reviewer A’s initial classification compared to that of reviewer B.","Since the reviewers of the training data each classified terms from different sets of randomly selected images, it is impossible to calculate their inter-annotator agreement. 4.2 Effectiveness of Features The effectiveness of individual features in describing the potential indexing terms is shown in Table 2. We used two measures, both of which indicate a similar trend, to calculate feature effectiveness: Information gain (Kullback-Leibler divergence) and the chi-square statistic.","Under both measures, the MeSH ratio (F.4) is one of the most effective features. This makes intuitive sense because MeSH terms are assigned to articles by specially trained NLM professionals. Given the large size of the MeSH vocabulary, it is not unreasonable to assume that an article’s MeSH terms could be descriptive, at a coarse granularity, of the images it contains. Also, the subjectivity of the reviewers’ initial data calls into question the usefulness of our training data. It may be that MeSH terms, consistently assigned to all documents in a particular collection, are a more reliable determiner of the usefulness of potential indexing terms. Furthermore, the study by Demner-Fushman et al. (2008) found that, on average, roughly 25% of the additional (useful) terms the reviewers added to the set of extracted terms were also found in the MeSH terms assigned to the document containing the particular image.","The abstract and title ratios (F.6 and F.5) also had a significant effect on the classification outcome. Similar to the argument for MeSH terms, as these constructs are a coarse summary of the contents of an article, it is not unreasonable to assume they summarize the images contained therein.","Finally, the noun ratio (F.7) was a particularly effective feature, and the length of the UMLS concept (F.11) was moderately effective. Interestingly, tf-idf and document location (F.9 and F.10), both features computed using standard information retrieval techniques, are among the least effective features. 4.3 Classification While the AODE learner performed reasonably well for this task, the difficulty encountered when training the SVM learner may be explained as follows. The initial inter-annotator agreement of the evaluation data suggests that it is likely that our training data contained contradictory or mislabeled observations, preventing the construc-tion of a maximal-margin hyperplane required by the SVM. An SVM implementation utilizing soft margins (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995) would likely achieve better results on our data, although at the expense of greater training time. The success of the AODE learner in this case is probably due to its resilience to mislabeled observations.

The precision and recall of the classification scheme is shown for the manual classification by reviewers A and B in the first and second rows. The third row contains the results obtained from combining the results of the two reviewers, and the fourth row shows the classification results compared to the gold standard obtained after discovering the initial inter-annotator agreement.","We hypothesized that the training data labels may have been highly sensitive to the subjectivity of the reviewers. Therefore, we retrained the learner with only those observations made by reviewers A and B (of the five total reviewers) and again compared the classification results with the gold standard. Not surprisingly, the F1-score of this classification (shown in the fifth row) is somewhat improved compared to that obtained when utilizing the full training set.","The last row in Table 3 shows the results of classifying the training data. That is, it shows the results of classifying one tenth of the data after a ten-fold cross validation and can be considered an upper bound for the performance of this classifier on our evaluation data. Notice that the associated F1-score for this experiment is only marginally better than that of the unseen data. This implies that it is possible to use training data from particular subdomains of the biomedical sciences (cardiology and plastic surgery) to classify potential indexing terms in other subdomains (dermatology).","Overall, the classifier performed best when verified with reviewer A, with an F1-score of 0.326. Although this is relatively low for a classification task, these results improve upon the baseline classification scheme (all extracted terms are useful for indexing) with an F1-score of 0.182 (Demner-Fushman et al., 2008). Thus, non-lexical features can be leveraged, albeit to a small degree with our current features and classifier, in automatically selecting useful image indexing terms. In future work, we intend to explore additional features and alternative tools for mapping text to the UMLS."]},{"title":"5 Related Work","paragraphs":["Non-lexical features have been successful in many contexts, particularly in the areas of genre classification and text and speech summarization.","Genre classification, unlike text classification, discriminates between document style instead of topic.
