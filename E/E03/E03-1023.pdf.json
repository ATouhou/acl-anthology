This is because it is necessary for an MT system to (semi- )automatically increase its translation knowledge in order for it to be used in the real world situation. One limitation of the corpus-based translation knowledge acquisition approach is that the techniques of translation knowledge acquisition heavily rely on availability of parallel/comparative corpora. However, the sizes as well as the domain of existing parallel/comparative corpora are limited, while it is very expensive to manually collect parallel/comparative corpora. Therefore, it is quite important to overcome this resource scarcity bottleneck in corpus-based translation knowledge acquisition research.","In order to solve this problem, this paper focuses on bilingual news articles on WWW news sites as a source for translation knowledge acquisition. In the case of WWW news sites in Japan, Figure 1: Translation Knowledge Acquisition from WWW News Sites: Overview Japanese as well as English news articles are updated everyday. Although most of those bilingual news articles are not parallel even if they are from the same site, certain portion of those bilingual news articles share their contents or at least report quite relevant topics. Based on this observation, we take an approach of acquiring translation knowledge of domain specific named entities, event expressions, and collocational expressions from the collection of bilingual news articles on WWW news sites (Utsuro and others, 2002).","Figure 1 illustrates the overview of our framework of translation knowledge acquisition from WWW news sites. First, pairs of Japanese and English news articles which report identical contents or at least closely related contents are retrieved. (Hereafter, we call pairs of bilingual news articles which report identical contents as \"identical\" pair, and those which report closely related contents (e.g., a pair of a crime report and the arrest"]},{"title":"355","paragraphs":["of its suspect) as \"relevant\" pair.) Then, by applying previously studied techniques of translation knowledge acquisition from parallel/comparative corpora, various kinds of translation knowledge are acquired.","Within this framework of translation knowledge acquisition from WWW news sites, this paper studies issues on the effect of cross-language retrieval of relevant texts in bilingual lexicon acquisition from comparable corpora. First, we show that, due to its computational complexity, it is difficult to straightforwardly apply previously studied techniques of bilingual term correspondence estimation from comparable corpora, especially in the case of large scale evaluation such as those presented in this paper. Then, we show that, with the help of cross-language retrieval of relevant texts, this computational difficulty can be easily avoided by reducing the candidate bilingual term pairs against which bilingual term correspondences are estimated. It is also experimentally shown that candidate reduction with the help of cross-language retrieval of relevant texts is quite effective in improving the performance of precise estimation of bilingual term correspondences."]},{"title":"2 Acquisition of Bilingual Term Correspondences from Comparable Corpora","paragraphs":["Previously studied techniques of estimating bilingual term correspondences from comparable corpora are mostly based on the idea that semantically similar words appear in similar contexts (Fung, 1995; Rapp, 1995; Kaji and Aizono, 1996; Tanaka and Iwasaki, 1996; Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1999; Tanaka, 2002). In those techniques, frequency information of contextual words cooccurring in the monolingual text is stored and their similarity is measured across languages.","The following gives a rough formalization of the previous approaches to acquiring bilingual term correspondences from comparable corpora. Suppose that CCE and CCj denote an English corpus and a Japanese corpus, respectively, and that they can be considered as comparable corpora. Then, in the previous approaches, for each English term tE in CCE and each Japanese term tj in CCj, occurrences of surrounding words are recorded in the form of some vector cv (tE CCE ) and cv (t j. CCA, respectively l . In most previous works, surrounding words that are con-In previous works, as weights of these contextual vectors, word frequencies or modified weights such as tf • idf are used. Finally, for every pair of an English term tE and a Japanese term tJ , bilingual term correspondence corrEj(tE,Q) is estimated in terms of a certain similarity measure sim(cv (tE, CCE ), cv (tj, CCJ)) between contextual vectors cv(tE, CCE) and cv(tj, CCJ): corrEJ(tE,O) simEJ(cv(tE,CCE),cv(tj,CCJ)) Here, in the modeling of contextual similarities across languages, earlier works such as Fung (1995), Rapp (1995), and Tanaka and Iwasaki (1996) studied to measure the similarities of contextual co-occurrence patterns across languages without the help of any existing bilingual lexicons. On the other hand, later works such as Kaji and Aizono (1996), Fung and Yee (1998), Rapp (1999), and Tanaka (2002) studied to exploit existing bilingual lexicons as initial seed for modeling of contextual similarities across languages. As the similarity measure sim(cv(t E , CCE ). cv(tJ . CCJ)) between contextual vectors cv(tE, CCE) and cv(tj, CCj), measures such as cosine measure, dice coefficient, and Jaccard coefficient are used."]},{"title":"3 Acquisition of Bilingual Term Correspondences from Cross-Lingually Relevant Texts 3.1 Cross-Language Retrieval of Relevant News Articles","paragraphs":["This section gives the overview of our framework of cross-language retrieval of relevant news articles from WWW news sites (Utsuro and others, 2002). First, from WWW news sites, both Japanese and English news articles within certain range of dates are retrieved. Let dj and dE denote one of the retrieved Japanese and English articles, respectively. Then, each English article dE is translated into a Japanese document d T by some commercial MT software 2 . Each Japanese article sidered as contexts of a term are those that co-occur in the same sentence, or in a window of a few words.","2In this query translation process, we also evaluated simply consulting a bilingual lexicon instead of employing an MT software. As reported in Collier and others (1998), the precision of simple word by word query translation with a bilingual lexicon is much lower than that with an MT software. Since we prefer precision rather than recall in our experiments, in this paper, we show results with query translation by an MT software. 356 dj as well as the Japanese translation dij-/T of each English article are next segmented into word sequences, and word frequency vectors v (d j) and v (dlYT) are generated. Then, cosine similarities between v (d j ) and v (dr') are calculated 3 and pairs of articles di and dE which satisfy certain criterion are considered as candidates for \"identical\" or \"relevant\" article pairs.","As will be described in section 4.1, on WVVW news sites in Japan, the number of articles updated per day is far greater (5 ,-30 times) in Japanese than in English. Thus, it is much easier to find cross-lingually relevant articles for each English query article than for each Japanese query article.

In the figure, \"pseudo-parallel with CUR\" indicates the plot for estimating bilingual term correspondence based on the pseudo-parallel corpus technique described in section 3.2.1. \"Contextual similarity with CUR\" indicates the plots for estimation based on contextual similarity described in section 3.2.2, where in \"reduced\", the candidates of bilingual term pairs are selected from a pseudo-parallel sentence pair rate of correct bilingual term correspondences 360","... —",".- -","— - — -","e -",".....","......6_ reduced\\tfull -.","contextual similarity with CLIR pseudo-parallel with CLIR 1-200\\t201-500\\t501-1000\\t1001-2000\\t2001-3000\\t","3001-","Order of 7P(tE) sorted by corr (TP(t E )) Figure 3: Rates of Containing Correct Bilingual Term Pairs (Site A, Ld = 0.4) as in the formula (2), while, in \"full\", the candidates are every pair of an English term found in RCE and a Japanese term found in RC,I.","For both \"pseudo-parallel with CUR\" and \"contextual similarity with CUR: reduced\", the number of bilingual term pairs found in the existing bilingual lexicon corresponds to the one in the column with \"reduced\" in Table 3 (i.e., 543), while, for \"contextual similarity with CUR: full\", that number corresponds to the one in the column with \"full\" in Table 3 (i.e., 1467). The differences of the rates in Figure 3 correspond to the difference of these numbers (i.e., 1467 and 543). However, it is very important to note that, for both \"pseudo-parallel with CUR\" and \"contextual similarity with CUR: reduced\", the rate of containing correct bilingual term pairs tends to decrease as the order of TP(tE ) sorted by corrEJ(TP(tE)) becomes lower. This tendency indicates that the estimated values of bilingual term correspondences have positive correlations with the correctness of bilingual term pairs, which supports the usefulness of the estimated bilingual term correspondences. For \"contextual similarity with CUR: full\", on the other hand, the rate of containing correct bilingual term pairs seems to be constant and thus the estimated values of bilingual term correspondences do not seem useful. This result again supports our claim on the usefulness of cross-language retrieval of relevant texts in acquisition of bilingual term correspondences. 4.3.3 Ranks of Correct Bilingual Term Pairs Finally, we evaluate the rank of correct bilingual term correspondences within each set TP(tE ), sorted by the estimated bilingual term correspondence corr Ej (tE ,tj ).

Here, we compare this distribution among \"pseudo-parallel with CUR\", \"contextual similarity with CUR: reduced\", and \"contextual similarity with CUR: full\".","For all the similarity lower bounds Ld, \"pseudo-parallel with CUR\" performs best, where about 85-,90% of correct bilingual term pairs are included within the 5-best candidates in each TP(tE ), and about 90 ,-400% are included within the 10-best. Here, it is important to note that bilingual term correspondence estimation by \"pseudo-parallel with CUR\" has another advantage over that by \"contextual similarity with CUR: reduced/full\" in terms of computational complexity. Also note that the performance of \"pseudo-parallel with CUR\" is affected little by the similarity lower bounds Ld. On the other hand, for \"contextual similarity with CUR: reduced/full\", the performance becomes worse as the similarity lower bound Ld becomes smaller and the cross-lingually relevant English/Japanese corpus RCE and RCJ becomes noisier. More specifically, for \"full\", as the similarity lower bound Ld becomes smaller, more and more correct bilingual term pairs become outside of the 100-best candidates7 . For \"reduced\", the rate of correct bilingual term pairs included within the 5-best candidates decreases from 70 to 40%, and that within the 10-best decreases from 73 to 45%, as the similarity lower bound Ld becomes smaller.

Previous works on bilingual term correspondence estimation from comparable corpora controlled experimental evaluation in various ways in order to reduce this computational complexity. For example, Rapp (1999) filtered out bilingual term pairs with low monolingual frequencies (those below 100 times), while Fung and Yee (1998) restricted candidate bilingual term pairs to be pairs of the most frequent 118 unknown words. Tanaka (2002) restricted candidate bilingual compound term pairs by consulting a seed bilingual lexicon and requir-ing their constituent words to be translation of each other across languages. In this paper, on the other hand, we showed in section 4.3.1 that, due to its computational complexity, it is difficult to straightforwardly apply previously studied techniques of bilingual term correspondence estimation from comparable corpora, especially in the case of large scale evaluation such as those presented in this paper. Then, we showed that this computational difficulty can be easily avoided with the help of cross-language retrieval of relevant texts without harming the performance of precisely estimating bilingual term correspondences."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion","paragraphs":["Within the framework of translation knowledge acquisition from WWW news sites, we studied issues on the effect of cross-language retrieval of relevant texts in bilingual lexicon acquisition from comparable corpora. We showed that it is quite effective to reduce the candidate bilingual term pairs against which bilingual term correspondences are estimated, in terms of both computational complexity and the performance of precise estimation of bilingual term correspondences."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["N.
