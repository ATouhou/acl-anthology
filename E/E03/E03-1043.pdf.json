The entire content of the textbook is covered.","The textbook is used in teaching Slovenian especially in German, French or Italian speaking communities. 2 It contains Slovenian-only text, explanations and exercises. As there is neither an index nor a vocabulary list, the online dictionary is a valuable completion of this educational material. However, it can be — and actually is — used independently of the textbook.","The current version of the online dictionary contains the following elements, based on Odkrivajmo slovenkino:","• all lemmas appearing in the texts, explanations, instructions and exercises;","• irregular inflected forms as well as the first person singular form of verbs;","• common conversational phrases and multi-word expressions as well as some contextual examples of words and grammatical forms.","Grammar information for both languages and information on stressed syllables for the Slovenian entries are contained in additional fields. For both languages, three different kinds of search are possible:","2Personal communication from Meta Lokar, Centre for Slovenian as a Second/Foreign Language, University of Ljubljana. 119 1. exact match3 ;","2. match a text string as a part of the dictionary entry; words","\\t 60,843,505 distinct word forms","\\t 25,598 distinct lemmas or lemma sets","\\t 10,250 Table 1: Lemmatized word list for evaluation.","3. match a text string at the beginning of the dictionary entry.","In the current version, the internal structure of the dictionary is a table containing one-to-one correspondences of words, word forms, and phrases. If an item has more than one equivalent in the other language, as many entries as necessary are created. 3 Evaluation The evaluations of the Slovenian part of the dictionary concern its coverage of a) the corpus of the Slovenian newspaper DELO, as included in the ZRC SAZU corpus by the end of November 2002 (cf. Subsection 3.1); b) user queries to the dictionary which have been logged since the publication of the first trial version in April 2002 (cf. Subsection 3.2). Based on these analyses, some qualitative remarks about the most frequent missing items will be made (cf. Subsection 3.3).","The evaluation is based on the Slovenian part of the complete \"vocabulary\" (words, inflected forms, expressions) of the dictionary. The 4,841 entries actually contain 4,354 distinct Slovenian entries; this number is smaller than the overall number because some words are polysemous, or some expressions can have different translations. The minimum number of Slovenian lemmas in the dictionary can be approximated by counting those entries which either contain no space in both languages, or which are reflexive verbs (ending on \"_se\" in Slovenian or starting with \"sich_\" in German): There are 2,428 such entries. 3.1 Newspaper corpus coverage To evaluate the coverage of texts by the Slovenian side of the dictionary, we chose the wordform list with frequencies of DELO, the main Slovenian daily, from January 1998 to August 2002.","3 Exact match is case insensitive. Some characters or character combinations are treated in a special way in order to achieve matching of characters which might be difficult to enter, as German and Slovenian use different character sets. lemma(s)","\\t distinct word","\\t corpus possible form","\\t frequency lemmas","absoluten:P\\t1\\t","absolutni","\\t 797 absolutno:A;absoluten:P 2","\\t absolutno","\\t 1,709 Table 2: Lemmatizer Output. About 75% of the text of the Monday—Saturday edition is sent in ASCII format every day via email to a small list of handicapped (\"DELO for the blind\") and to research users (Nova beseda). DELO is a good source for modern Slovenian, the text is spell-checked and proof-read, the error-rate is low (Jakopin, 2002). The results of our evaluation will give an approximation of how well the lexical knowledge represented in the dictionary — which can be interpreted as that of a learner after finishing the study of the textbook — overlaps with the lexical content of newspaper text.","The word list of the DELO newspaper corpus at ZRC SAZU in its November 2002 version contains 930,977 distinct word forms with an overall occurence of 73,412,302. Using the Corpus Laboratory lemmatizer4 (Jakopin, 2002), the 30,000 most frequent word forms (with an overall occurrence of 64,465,582 and a coverage of 87.8% of the whole corpus) were lemmatized. 25,598 out of these 30,000 word forms were recognized by the lemmatizer. The recognized word forms, which cover 82.8% of the entire DELO corpus (cf. Table 1), will serve as the basis of our evaluation.","Word forms of each single lemma that corresponds to an entry in the dictionary will be counted as covered. For ambiguous word forms, the procedure is more complicated: In this case the lemma-tizer output will consist of a set of possible lemmas (cf. Table 2). As only a part of the corpus is POS-tagged (Jakopin and Bizjak, 1997), these sets cannot be disambiguated. We decided to evaluate them by marking with an asterisk all those lemmas that are not covered by the dictionary; if at 4http://bos.zrc-sazu.si/dol_lem.html 120","lemma(s)\\tword\\tcorpus form\\tfrequency aids:S aids:S aids:S ali: avto:S avto:S :*avt:S avto:S :*avt:S avto:S ;*avt:S aids aidsa aidsom aui avto avta avtom avtu 527 466 391","198,399 7,450 2,576 1,948 1,519","Lemmatized Covered by Percentage","corpus dictionary\\tcovered Words 60,843,505 41,564,382 68.3% Word forms 25,598 6,640 25.9% Lemmas 10,250 2,083 20.3% Table 3: Covered lemmas and lemma sets.","lemma(s)\\t word","\\t corpus form","\\t frequency *absoluten:P","\\t absolutni","\\t 797 *absolutno:A;*absoluten:P absolutno","\\t 1,709 *absurdno:A:*absurden:P absurdno","\\t 388 *administracija:S","\\t administracija","\\t 833 Table 4: Not covered lemmas and lemma sets. least one of the alternative lemmas is unmarked, the underlying word form will be counted as covered. Tables 3 and 4 show parts of the sorted result of the marking procedure.","Inflected forms of lemmas that appear in Table 3 are counted as covered by the dictionary. For example, all occurrences of avta, avtom and avtu will be counted as covered because the lemma avto ('car') is in the dictionary, even if the alternative lemma avt ('oe, in sports contexts) is missing. We believe that this method is a good approximation of how much a dictionary user can understand of the lexical content of the newspaper text. In the case of non-related lemmas, one of them is usually much more frequent (as with avto and avt), whereas in the case of related lemmas, the meaning of the missing one can be inferred from the other (as with bogat 'rich' and bogatiti 'to enrich': only bogat corresponds to an entry). Table 4 shows some lemmas and lemma sets which are not covered by the dictionary.","By this method, we find that 68.3% of the words in the lemmatized list from the corpus are covered (for detailed results, cf. Table 5). We notice, however, that not all lemmas in the dictionary (which were approximated to 2,428 lemmas) are actually among the most frequent ones of the corpus; for example, the textbook lemmas kozolec Table 5: Corpus evaluation results.","All queries Top 100 Number 14,030 1,754 Distinct 7,188 105 Number covered 3,764 1,298 Distinct covered 1,068 73 Percentage covered (overall) 26.8% 74.0% Percentage covered (distinct) 14.6% 69.5% Table 6: Query evaluation results. 'hayrack' and potica (a special cake), which are introduced in order to present the Slovenian culture, but also meduza 'jellyfish' and vedeZevalka 'fortune-teller', around which some textbook stories are centered, are not among those derived from the frequent word forms in the corpus. 3.2 Query coverage By 15 November 2002, the trial version of the dictionary logged more than 34,000 requests. For evaluating the coverage of user queries, we compare the dictionary entries to the log file containing the 14,030 requests asking for a translation from Slovenian into German. The results for all queries as well as for the 100 most popular queries are shown in Table 6.","As can be seen from the table, the coverage of all queries is quite low (26.8% overall coverage and 14.6% coverage of distinct queries). This is due to the fact that the dictionary contains general basic words and expressions; user queries, however, range from basic to specialised vocabulary and include all sorts of expressions, spelling mistakes and even queries in languages other than Slovenian. If we look at the top 100 queries, however, the results are much better: 74.0% of all queries and 69.5% of distinct queries are covered. 3.3 Qualitative remarks A closer look at the most frequent corpus words and user queries not covered by the dictionary shows the most serious gaps in the vocabulary.

The results show that in order to enhance corpus coverage, the insertion of seven frequent closed class items (prepositions, particles and conjunctions, which cover 343,826 occurrences, cf. Table 7), is as important as the insertion of the top seven missing nouns, which cover 351,323 occurrences. In contrast to these findings, user queries mainly concern open class items: Only two of the top 30 missing lemmas from the query evaluation are neither verbs nor nouns. For details on the distinction between open and closed word classes, cf. Greenbaum (1996).","The politico-economical context of the newspaper is reflected by nouns like predsednik 'chairman', zakon 'law', minister 'minister' and podjetje 'company', which are among the most frequent missing ones. Out of these, only zakon is also among the 30 most popular and unmatched user queries. An analysis of the unmatched user queries shows popular missing lemmas in the general domain, like pozdrav 'greeting; regards', postaja 'station', krava 'cow' and odpad 'waste; rubbish'. Economical or legal terms of daily life are popular as well: pogodba 'contract', potrditi 'to confirm', rae'un 'bill' and davek 'tax' can be mentioned as missing from the dictionary."]},{"title":"4 Conclusions and future work","paragraphs":["Using an approximated method of untagged corpus coverage evaluation, we found that a dictionary of general Slovenian based on a beginners' textbook covers nearly 70% of the 82.8% most frequent lemmatized words in a big newspaper corpus. The textbook also contains lemmas which are less frequent in the corpus. A comparison of the corpus evaluation results with an analysis of the most popular user queries shows differences in the distribution of word classes among the most frequent unmatched items. Corpus coverage can be quickly enhanced by the insertion of some closed class items, while dictionary users are more interested in open class items.","The dictionary will be enlarged based on these quantitative and qualitative corpus and query analyses. Using a tagset covering the grammar information necessary for the Slovenian language (cf. e.g. http://bos.zrc-sazu.si/cgi/ckb_oo.html, (Jakopin and Bizjak, 1997)), the grammar information about Slovenian lemmas and word forms will be completed."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["The first author thanks the Corpus Laboratory at the Fran Ramovg Institute of Slovenian language, ZRC SAZU, for research facilities and hospitality.
