Many tagging problems have been successfully modelled in the ME framework, including POS tagging, with state of the art performance (van Halteren et al., 2001), \"supertagging\" (Clark, 2002) and chunking (Koeling, 2000).","Generalised Iterative Scaling (GIs) is a very simple algorithm for estimating the parameters of a ME model. The original formulation of GIS (Darroch and Ratcliff, 1972) required the sum of the feature values for each event to be constant. Since this is not the case for many applications, the standard method is to add a \"correction\", or \"slack\", feature to each event Improved Iterative Scaling (us) (Berger et al., 1996; Della Pietra et al., 1997) eliminated the correction feature to improve the convergence rate of the algorithm. However, the extra book keeping required for us means that GIS is often faster in practice (Malouf, 2002). This paper shows, by a simple adaptation of Berger's proof for the convergence of HS (Berger, 1997), that GIS does not require a correction feature. We also investigate how the use of a correction feature affects the performance of ME taggers.","GIS and HS obtain a maximum likelihood estimate (mLE) of the parameters, and, like other MLE methods, are susceptible to overfitting. A simple technique used to avoid overfitting is a frequency cutoff, in which only frequently occurring features are included in the model (Ratnaparkhi, 1998). However, more sophisticated smoothing techniques exist, such as the use of a Gaussian prior on the parameters of the model (Chen and Rosenfeld, 1999). This technique has been applied to language modelling (Chen and Rosenfeld, 1999), text classification (Nigam et al., 1999) and parsing (Johnson et al., 1999), but to our knowledge it has not been compared with the use of a feature cutoff. We explore the combination of Gaussian smoothing and a simple cutoff for two tagging tasks.","The two taggers used for the experiments are a POS tagger, trained on the WSJ Penn Treebank, and a \"supertagger\", which assigns tags from the 91 much larger set of lexical types from Combinatory Categorial Grammar (ccG) (Clark, 2002). Elimination of the correction feature and use of appropriate smoothing methods result in state of the art performance for both tagging tasks."]},{"title":"2 Maximum Entropy Models","paragraphs":["A conditional ME model, also known as a log-linear model, has the following form:","P(YIX) =\\texp\\tilifi(xJ))\\t(1) Z(x) i=1 where the functions fi are the features of the model, the A, are the parameters, or weights, and Z(x) is a normalisation constant. This form can be derived by choosing the model with maximum entropy (i.e. the most uniform model) from a set of models that satisfy a certain set of constraints. The constraints are that the expected value of each feature fi according to the model p is equal to some value Ki (Rosenfeld, 1996):"]},{"title":"\\tE","paragraphs":["p(x, y)fi(x, y) = K1\\t(2) x,)","Calculating the expected value according to p requires summing over all contexts x, which is not possible in practice.

Moreover, we show in the Appendix, by a (6) (7) 92 simple adaptation of Berger's proof for the convergence of HS (Berger, 1997), that GIS converges to the maximum likelihood model without a correction feature. 1","The proof works by introducing a correction feature with fixed weight of 0 into the Hs convergence proof. This feature does not contribute to the model and can be ignored during weight update. Introducing this null feature still satisfies Jensen's inequality, which is used to provide a lower bound on the change in likelihood between iterations, and the existing GIS weight update (7) can still be derived analytically.","An advantage of GIS is that it is a very simple algorithm, made even simpler by the removal of the correction feature. This simplicity means that, although GIS requires more iterations than 11s to reach convergence, in practice it is significantly faster (Malouf, 2002)."]},{"title":"4 Smoothing Maximum Entropy Models","paragraphs":["Several methods have been proposed for smoothing ME models (see Chen and Rosenfeld (1999)). For taggers, a standard technique is to eliminate low frequency features, based on the assumption that they are unreliable or uninformative (Ratnaparkhi, 1998). Studies of infrequent features in other domains suggest this assumption may be in-correct (Daelemans et al., 1999). We test this for ME taggers by replacing the cutoff with the use of a Gaussian prior, a technique which works well for language models (Chen and Rosenfeld, 1999).","When using a Gaussian prior, the objective function is no longer the likelihood, L(A), but has the form:","L13' (A) = L\\t1 p(A) + E log \\t(10)","•\\t.‘121ro\\t2o-3'l Maximising this function is a form of maximum a posteriori estimation, rather than maximum likelihood estimation. The effect of the prior is to penalise models that have very large positive or negative weights. This can be thought of as relaxing the constraints in (5), so that the model fits the data","1We note that Goodman (2002) suggests that the correction feature may not be necessary for convergence.

CCG supertagging is more difficult than PUS tagging because the set of \"tags\" assigned by the supertagger is much larger (398 in this implementation, compared with 45 POS tags). The supertagger assigns CCG lexical categories (Steedman, 2000) which encode subcategorisation information. Table 1 gives some examples.","The features used by each tagger are binary valued, and pair a tag with various elements of the context; for example: = { 1 if word(x)= the & y = DT fi(x,y) 0 otherwise","(12) word(x) = the is an example of what Ratnaparkhi calls a contextual predicate.

Although GIS is not as fast as some alternatives, such as conjugate gradient and limited memory variable metric methods (Malouf, 2002), our C&C POS tagger takes less than 10 minutes to train, and the space requirements are modest, irrespective of the size of the tagset.","We have also shown that using a Gaussian prior on the parameters of the ME model improves performance over a simple frequency cutoff. The Gaussian prior effectively relaxes the constraints on the ME model, which allows the model to use low frequency features without overfitting. Achieving optimal performance with Gaussian smoothing and without cutoffs demonstrates that low frequency features can contribute to good performance."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["We would like to thank Joshua Goodman, Miles Osborne, Andrew Smith, Hanna Wallach, Tara Murphy and the anonymous reviewers for their comments on drafts of this paper.
