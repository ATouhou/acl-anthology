The TOEIC score is used as a measure of one's speech translation capability. However, this method requires tremendous evaluation costs. Accordingly, automatization of this method is an important subject for study. In the proposed method, currently available automatic evaluation methods are applied to automate the translation paired comparison method.

(2000) proposed the translation paired comparison method, which is applicable to precise evaluation of speech translation systems with a limited task/domain capability. A major disadvantage of the translation paired comparison method is its subjective approach to evaluation. Such an approach requires large costs and a long evaluation time. Therefore, automatization of this method remains an important issue to solve.","Several automatic evaluation methods have been proposed to achieve efficient development of MT technology, (Su et al., 1992; Papineni et al., 2002; NIST, 2002). Both subjective and automatic evaluation methods are useful for making comparisons among different schemes or systems. However, these techniques are unable to objectively measure the performance of practical target application systems.","In this paper, we propose an automatization scheme for the translation paired comparison method that employs available automatic evaluation methods.","Section 2 explains the translation paired comparison method, and Section 3 introduces the proposed evaluation scheme. Section 4 describes several automatic evaluation methods applied to the proposed method. Section 5 presents the evaluation results obtained by the proposed methods. Section 6 presents our conclusions."]},{"title":"2 Translation Paired Comparison Method","paragraphs":["The translation paired comparison method can precisely measure the capability of a speech translation system. A brief description of the method is given in this section.","Figure 1 shows a diagram of the translation paired comparison method in the case of Japanese to English translation. The Japanese nativespeaking examinees are asked to listen to spoken Japanese text and then write its English translation on paper. The Japanese text is presented twice within one minute, with a pause between the presentations. To measure the English capability of the Japanese native speakers, the TOEIC score (TOEIC, 2002) is used. The examinees are asked to present an official TOEIC score certificate confirming that they have officially taken the test within the past six months.","In the translation paired comparison method, the translations by the examinees and the outputs of the system are printed in rows together with the original Japanese text to form evaluation sheets for comparison by an evaluator, who is a bilingual speaker of English and Japanese. Each transcribed utterance on the evaluation sheets is represented by the Japanese test text and the two translation results (i.e., translations by an examinee and by the system).","The evaluator is asked to follow the procedure depicted in Figure 2. The meanings of ranks in the figure are as follows: (A) Perfect: no problem in both information and grammar; (B) Fair: easy-to-understand with some unimportant information missing or flawed grammar; (C) Acceptable: broken but understandable with effort; (D) Nonsense: important information has been translated incorrectly.","In the evaluation process, the human evaluator ignores misspellings because the capability to be measured is not English writing but speech translation.","From the scores based on these rankings, either the examinee or the system is considered the \"winner\" for each utterance. If the ranking and the naturalness are the same for an utterance, the competition is considered \"even\".","To prepare the regression analysis, the number of \"even\" utterances are divided in half and equally assigned as system-won utterances and human-won utterances. Accordingly, we define the human winning rate (/17H) by the following equation:","WH — (Nhuman — 0.5 x Nevem) I Ntotal (1) 372 Choose A, B, C, or D rank Consider naturalness No No Calculate WH No Yes Set an examinee to be compared to a system n= 0.

Details of the regression analysis are given in Section 5. 3 Proposed Method The first point to explain is how to automatize the translation paired comparison method. The basic idea of the proposed method is to substitute the human evaluation process of the translation paired comparison method with an automatic evaluation Figure 3: Procedure of Utterance Unit Evaluation method'. There are two kinds of units to apply an automatic evaluation method to the automatization of the translation paired comparison method. One is an utterance unit, and the other is a test set unit. The unit of utterance corresponds to the unit of segment in BLEU and NIST. Similarly, the unit of the test set corresponds to the unit of document or system in BLEU and NIST. 3.1 Utterance Unit Evaluation The utterance unit evaluation takes roughly the same procedure as the translation paired comparison method. Figure 3 shows the points of difference between the translation paired comparison method and the utterance unit evaluation of the proposed method. The complete flow can be obtained by substituting Figure 3 for the broken line area of Figure 2. In the regression analysis of the utterance unit evaluation, the same procedure as the original translation paired comparison method is carried out. 3.2 Test Set Unit Evaluation In a sense, the test set unit evaluation follows a different procedure from the translation paired comparison method and the utterance unit evaluation. The flow of the test set unit evaluation is shown in Figure 4. In the regression analysis of the test set unit evaluation, the evaluation result by an automatic evaluation method is used instead of IVH.","' An automatic evaluation method for the proposed method does not have to be a certain kind.

TDMT is a language translation subsystem of the Japanese-to-English speech translation system ATR-MATRIX. For evaluation of TDMT, the input included accurate transcriptions.","The total number of examinees is 29, and the range of their TOEIC score is between the 300s and 800s. Excepting the 600s, every hundred-point range has 5 examinees.","The test set consists of 330 utterances in 23 conversations from the ATR bilingual travel conversation database (Takezawa, 1999). Consequently, this test set has different features from written language. Most of the utterances in our task contain fewer words than the unit of segment used so far in research with BLEU and NIST. One utterance contains 11.9 words on average. The standard deviation of the number of words is 6.5. The shortest utterance consists of 1 word, and the longest consists of 32 words. This test set was not used to train the TDMT system.","For the translations of examinees, all misspellings were corrected by humans because, as mentioned in Section 2, the human evaluator ignores misspellings in the original translation paired comparison method.","5.2 Evaluation Results by Translation Paired Comparison Method Figure 5 shows the results of a comparison between TDMT and the examinees.

In Figure 5, this point is 705. Consequently, the translation capability of the language translation system equals that of an examinee with a score of around 700 points on the TOEIC. We call this point the system's TOEIC score.","5.3 Evaluation Results of Utterance Unit Evaluation In their original forms, the maximum n-gram length for BLEU (N in Equation 3) is set at 4 and that for NIST (N in Equation 4) is set at 5. These settings were established for evaluation of written language. However, utterances in our test set contain fewer words than in typical written language. Consequently, for the utterance unit evaluation, we conducted several experiments while varying N from 1 to 4 for BLEU and from 1 to 5 for NIST.","Table 1 shows the detailed results of the paired comparison using automatic evaluations.

The difference between Figures 6 and 7 is the number of references to be used for automatic evaluation. In Figure 6, there is 1 reference per utterance, while in Figure 7 there are 16 references per utterance. In these figures, values in parentheses under the abscissa indicate the maximum n-gram length.","Looking at these figures, the correct ratio of BLEU changes value depending on the maximum n-gram length. The maximum n-gram length of 1 or 2 yields a high correct ratio, and that of 3 or 4 yields a low correct ratio. On the other hand, the correct ratio of NIST is not influenced by the maximum n-gram length. It seems reasonable to suppose that these phenomena are due to computation of the mean of n-gram matching. As shown in Equations 3 and 4, BLEU applies a geometric mean and NIST applies an information-weighted arithmetic mean. Computation of the geometric mean yields 0 when one of the factors is 0, i.e., the BLEU score takes 0 for all of the utterances whose word count is less than the maximum n-gram length.","The correct ratio shown in Figures 6 and 7 is low, i.e., around 0.5. Thus, even state-of-the-art technology is insufficient to determine better translation in the utterance unit evaluation. For a sufficient result of the utterance unit evaluation, we need a more precise automatic evaluation method or another scheme, for example, majority decision using multiple automatic evaluation methods.","5.4 Evaluation Results of Test Set Unit Evaluation CO In the original BLEU or NIST formulation of the test set unit (or document or system level) evaluation, n-gram matches are computed at the utterance level, but the mean of n-gram matches is computed at the test-set level. However, considering the characteristics of the translation paired comparison method, the average of the utterance-level scores might be more suitable. Therefore, we carried out experiments using both the original formulation and the average of utterance-level scores. For the average of utterance-level scores, considering the experimental results shown in Figure 7, we used the maximum n-gram length of 2 for BLEU and 5 for NIST.","Figure 8 shows the correlation between automatic measures and WH.
